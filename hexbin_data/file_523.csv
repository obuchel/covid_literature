The disease varies from mild to serious and fatal cases. There are many hypotheses explaining why this virus infection would be fatal. One of these is the impaired immune response of the infected patient. The use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors may cause decreased immune response and greater susceptibility to infections. We presented a case of a patient using adalimumab that have developed H1N1 without complications. This is the first case of H1N1 in a patient using adalimumab reported in Brazil. We discuss the possibility that anti-TNF may not predisposes to a serious form of the disease or fatal complications.,"Serrato, Varlei A.; Azevedo, Valderílio Feijó; Sabatoski, Viviane; Gonçalves, Beatriz P.; Machado, Denise M.",Clin Rheumatol,523,1

The Urgent Need for Global Collaboration in Public Health,20.276146,7.924363,2011-10-20,"Recently, it was shown that aminopeptidase N (E.C. 3.4.11.2, CD13) is up-regulated during mitogenic stimulation of peripheral T-cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the half-life of APN mRNA was considerably prolonged in these cells leading to a 2.7-fold increase of APN transcript level. The apparent half-life time of the APN transcript was investigated by the RNA synthesis inhibitor-chase method using actinomycin D. The steady-state APN mRNA levels was determined by a competitive RT-PCR. The half-lives estimated in resting T-cells, natural killer cells and permanently growing tumour cells varied between 3.5 and 6 h. Finally, nuclear run-on assays revealed that the APN gene expression of stimulated T-cells is controlled by increased promoter activity as well. These studies suggest a control of APN gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in addition to promoter-mediated regulation.","Wex, Th; Bühling, F; Arndt, M; Frank, K; Ansorge, S; Lendeckel, U",FEBS Lett,523,30

The primordial adhesion molecules of this family are the cell—cell adhesion molecules (C-CAMs), which have been found to be multifunctional, signal-regulatory proteins. C-CAMs inhibit tumor growth, interact with calmodulin, protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases, and are subject to specific dimerization reactions. These new insights indicate that C-CAMs are important regulators of cellular functions.","Öbrink, Björn",Curr Opin Cell Biol,523,30
10506,10506,10506,Obesity-related stigma—hiding in plain sight,20.482677,8.025395,2020-04-22,"This paper introduces a novel method of spectrum sensing in communication systems that utilizes nonuniform sampling in conjunction with a suitable spectral analysis tool. It is referred to here as spectral analysis for randomized sampling (SARS). Owing to the deployment of nonuniform sampling, the proposed technique can accomplish the sensing task by using sampling rates well below the ones demanded by uniform-sampling-based digital signal processing (DSP). The effect of the cyclostationary nature of the incoming digital communication signal on the adequacy of the adopted periodogram-type estimator for the spectrum sensing operation is addressed. The statistical characteristics of the estimator are presented. General reliability conditions on the length of the required signal observation window, i.e., sensing time, for a chosen sampling rate or vice versa are provided amid a sought system performance. The impact of the presence of noise and processing transmissions with various power levels on the derived dependability recommendations is given. The analytical results are illustrated by numerical examples. This paper establishes a new framework for efficient spectrum sensing where considerable savings on the sampling rate and number of processed samples can be attained.","Ahmad, Bashar I.; Tarczynski, Andrzej",IEEE Trans Signal Process,523,1

Within weeks the virus had spread globally and the first pandemic of the 21st Century had been declared. It is unlikely to be the last and it is crucial that real lessons are learned from the experience. Asia is considered a hot spot for the emergence of new pathogens including past influenza pandemics. On this occasion while preparing for an avian, highly virulent influenza virus (H5N1 like) originating in Asia in fact the pandemic originated from swine, and was less virulent. This discrepancy between what was planned for and what emerged created its own challenges. The H1N1 pandemic has tested national health‐care infrastructures and exposed shortcomings in our preparedness as a region. Key health challenges include communication throughout the region, surge capacity, access to reliable information and access to quality care, health‐care worker skills, quality, density and distribution, access to essential medicines and lack of organizational infrastructure for emergency response. Despite years of preparation the public health and clinical research community were not ready to respond and opportunities for an immediate research response were missed. Despite warm words and pledges efforts to engage the international community to ensure equitable sharing of limited resources such as antivirals and vaccines fell short and stockpiles in the main remained in the rich world. This manuscript with authors from across the region describes some of the major challenges faced by Asia in response to the pandemic and draws lessons for the future.","FISHER, DALE; HUI, DAVID S.; GAO, ZHANCHENG; LEE, CHRISTOPHER; OH, MYOUNG‐DON; CAO, BIN; HIEN, TRAN TINH; PATLOVICH, KRISTA; FARRAR, JEREMY",Respirology,523,22

Previous studies illustrating the effects of oral colostrum (OC) have been confounded by the coincidence of enteral feedings. OBJECTIVE: To quantify OC absorption, as measured by urinary sIgA and lactoferrin, in preterm infants prior to enteral feedings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Colostrum was obtained from mothers delivering infants ≤32 weeks and ≤1500 g. sIgA and lactoferrin were measured in infant urine, and microflora in saliva and tracheal aspirates were characterized. RESULTS: Urinary sIgA and lactoferrin were significantly greater in infants receiving OC by syringe compared to swab (p < 0.002). Urinary sIgA correlated with the total number of doses in 72 h (R(2) = 43%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of OC by syringe and higher cumulative dose are associated with increased absorption of sIgA and lactoferrin, and early dosing may contribute to a more diverse tracheal microbiome.","Maffei, Diana; Brewer, Mariana; Codipilly, Champa; Weinberger, Barry; Schanler, Richard J.",J Perinatol,523,1

Previously, an international multicenter study reported that this procedure was not inferior to conventional open surgery. However, thoracoscopic surgery is a highly difficult operation for surgeons and anesthesiologists; as a result, the safety and efficacy of the surgery is still under debate. Considering these circumstances, the purpose of this study was to analyze the results of single-center thoracoscopic surgery and to compare the outcomes relative to the patient’s weight at the time of surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with EA/TEF who underwent thoracoscopic surgery in a single center between October 2008 and February 2017. RESULTS: In total, 41 cases of thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were performed. Upon subgrouping by over and under 2000 g of body weight at the time of operation, 34 were found to be over 2000 g and seven were under 2000 g. Intraoperative factors and events were not significantly different between the two groups. Additionally, most of the postoperative outcomes, including the rate of postoperative leakage and strictures, showed no difference. On the other hand, the under 2000 g group had more gastroesophageal reflux requiring fundoplication than did the heavier group (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this center’s thoracoscopic repair of EA/TEF were not inferior to other centers’ outcomes. Additionally, the intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were similar despite differences in weight at operation. Therefore, thoracoscopic repair might be a feasible surgical option for infants weighing less than 2000 g when performed by a surgeon and anesthesiologist team who are experienced in pediatric thoracoscopic surgery.","Son, Joonhyuk; Jang, Yerang; Kim, Wontae; Lee, Sanghoon; Jeong, Ji Seon; Lee, Suk-Koo; Seo, Jeong-Meen",Surg Endosc,523,12

Enterobacterales producing AmpC are reported worldwide and have great clinical importance due to therapeutic restriction and epidemiological importance once the easy dissemination by plasmidic genes to other bacteria is a real threat. These genes are naturally found in some enterobacteria as Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter freundii, but other species have demonstrated similar resistance phenotype of AmpC production. Genes carried in plasmids have been described in these species conferring resistance to cefoxitin and causing therapeutic failure in some bacterial infections. This work detected and described five clinical strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae that presented plasmid ampC (pAmpC) isolated from the north of Portugal collected in 2009. AmpC production was confirmed by inhibition of the enzyme by cloxacillin and boronic acid in agar diffusion tests. Also, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was performed for the detection of gene universal to AmpC, bla(ampC), and others to AmpC group: bla(ACC), bla(CIT), bla(CMY), bla(DHA), and bla(EBC). The conjugation in liquid medium for 24 h was realized to determine if gene is localized in chromosome or plasmid. The isolates and their conjugants showed phenotypic characteristics and bla(CMY) and bla(CIT) were detected by PCR corroborating the AmpC characteristics observed in these bacteria. Confirmation of transfer of plasmid containing genes encoding AmpC is of high epidemiological relevance to the hospital studied and demonstrated the importance of AmpC surveillance and studies in hospital and community environments in order to choose the appropriate therapy for bacterial infections.","Santiago, Gabrielli Stefaninni; Gonçalves, Daniela; da Silva Coelho, Irene; de Mattos de Oliveira Coelho, Shana; Neto Ferreira, Helena",Braz J Microbiol,523,1

Evidence supports conservative fluid management in ARDS, but whether current practice reflects the implementation of that evidence has not been described. This study reports the variability in contemporary fluid management for ICU patients with ARDS. We compared routine care to trial protocols and analyzed whether more conservative management with diuretic medications in contemporary, usual care is associated with outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in nine ICUs at two academic hospitals during 2016 and 2017. We included 234 adult patients with ARDS in an ICU at least 3 days after meeting moderate-severe ARDS criteria (PaO(2):FIO(2) ≤ 150). The primary exposure was any diuretic use in 48 to 72 h after meeting ARDS criteria. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Unadjusted statistical analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used. RESULTS: In 48–72 h after meeting ARDS criteria, 116 patients (50%) received a diuretic. In-hospital mortality was lower in the group that received diuretics than in the group that did not (14% vs 25%; p = 0.025). At ARDS onset, both groups had similar Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and ICU fluid balances. During the first 48 h after ARDS, the diuretic group received less crystalloid fluid than the no diuretic group (median [inter-quartile range]: 1.2 L [0.2–2.8] vs 2.4 L [1.2-5.0]; p < 0.001), but both groups received more fluid from medications and nutrition than from crystalloid. At 48 h, the prevalence of volume overload (ICU fluid balance >10% of body weight) in each group was 16% and 25%(p = 0.09), respectively. During 48–72 h after ARDS, the overall prevalence of shock was 44% and similar across both groups. Central venous pressure was recorded in only 18% of patients. Adjusting for confounders, early diuretic use was independently associated with lower hospital mortality (AOR 0.46, 95%CI [0.22, 0.96]). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of ARDS patients, volume overload was common, and early diuretic use was independently associated with lower hospital mortality. These findings support the importance of fluid management in ARDS and suggest opportunities for further study and implementation of conservative fluid strategies into usual care.","Seitz, Kevin P.; Caldwell, Ellen S.; Hough, Catherine L.",J Intensive Care,523,1

In organisms operating under strict nutrient limitations, such as pathogenic microsporidia, conservation of energy via ribosomal hibernation and recycling is critical. The mechanisms by which hibernation is achieved in microsporidia, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the ribosome from Paranosema locustae spores, bound by the conserved eukaryotic hibernation and recycling factor Lso2. The microsporidian Lso2 homolog adopts a V-shaped conformation to bridge the mRNA decoding site and the large subunit tRNA binding sites, providing a reversible ribosome inactivation mechanism. Although microsporidian ribosomes are highly compacted, the P. locustae ribosome retains several rRNA segments absent in other microsporidia, and represents an intermediate state of rRNA reduction. In one case, the near complete reduction of an expansion segment has resulted in a single bound nucleotide, which may act as an architectural co-factor to stabilize a protein–protein interface. The presented structure highlights the reductive evolution in these emerging pathogens and sheds light on a conserved mechanism for eukaryotic ribosome hibernation.","Ehrenbolger, Kai; Jespersen, Nathan; Sharma, Himanshu; Sokolova, Yuliya Y.; Tokarev, Yuri S.; Vossbrinck, Charles R.; Barandun, Jonas",PLoS Biol,523,5

Therefore, an alert must only be sent if triggered by a correct event. Nevertheless, IoT networks are exposed to intrusions, which affects event detection accuracy. In this paper, an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) is proposed in a smart hospital IoT system for detecting events of interest about patients’ health and environment and, at the same time, for network intrusions. Providing a single system for network infrastructure supervision and e-health monitoring has been shown to optimize resources and enforce the system reliability. Consequently, decisions regarding patients’ care and their environments’ adaptation are more accurate. The low latency is ensured, thanks to a deployment on the edge to allow for a processing close to data sources. The proposed ADS is implemented and evaluated while using Contiki Cooja simulator and the e-health event detection is based on a realistic data-set analysis. The results show a high detection accuracy for both e-health related events and IoT network intrusions.","Said, Abdel Mlak; Yahyaoui, Aymen; Abdellatif, Takoua",Sensors (Basel),523,1

Our goal was to evaluate the influence of TAR with mesh retromuscular reinforcement on the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and respiratory function in a series of patients with complex incisional hernias (IH). METHODS: Since November 2014 through February 2019, patients with TAR were identified in the Clinical Department of Surgery database and were retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures include: demographics, pre- and perioperative details, preoperative and postoperative IAP and plateau pressure (PP). RESULTS: One-hundred-and-one consecutive TAR procedures (19.7% from all incisional hernia repairs) were analyzed. Mean age was 63 years with a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of 31.85 kg/m(2) (25–51). Diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) were the main major comorbidities. Mean hernia defect area was 247 cm(2) (104–528 cm(2)). CONCLUSION: TAR is a safe and sound procedure with acceptable modifications of the IAP morbidity and recurrence rate when correctly performed on the right patient.","Oprea, V.; Mardale, S.; Buia, F.; Gheorghescu, D.; Nica, R.; Zdroba, S.; Grad, O.",Hernia,523,1

This leads to duplicate health records, breakdowns in communication, and limited opportunities to provide comprehensive, collaborative care. The objectives of this study were to explore communication challenges and solutions/recommendations from multiple perspectives including (i) parents, (ii) HCPs – hospital and community providers, and (iii) teachers of CMC with a goal of informing patient care. METHODS: This qualitative study utilized an interpretive description methodology. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents and care team members of CMC. The interview guides targeted questions surrounding communication, coordination, access to information and roles in the health system. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two individual interviews were conducted involving parents (n = 16) and care team members (n = 16). Interviews revealed 2 main themes and several associated subthemes (in parentheses): (1) Communication challenges in the care of CMC (organizational policy and technology systems barriers, inadequate access to health information, and lack of partnership in care) (2) Communication solutions (shared systems that can be accessed in real-time, universal access to health information, and partnered contribution to care). CONCLUSION: Parents, HCPs, and teachers face multiple barriers to communication and information accessibility in their efforts to care for CMC. Parents and care providers in this study suggested potential strategies to improve communication including facilitating communication in real-time, universal access to health information and meaningful partnerships.

It consists of long polymeric chains of oligosaccharide repeating units, and each of the ten capsular serotypes described so far presents a unique chemical structure with distinct antigenic properties; therefore, broad protection against this pathogen could be achieved by a combination of ten glycoconjugates. Capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and assembly follow a polymerase-dependent pathway that is widespread in encapsulated bacteria and is encoded by a polycistronic operon. Here we exploited the sequence similarity between the capsule operons of types V and IX to generate hybrid polysaccharides incorporating epitopes of both serotypes in a single molecule, by co-expressing their specific CpsM, O, I glycosyltransferases in a single isolate. Physicochemical and immunochemical methods confirmed that an engineered strain produced a high molecular weight chimeric polysaccharide, combining antigenic specificities of both type V and IX. By optimizing the copy number of key glycosyltransferase genes, we were able to modulate the ratio between type-specific epitopes. Finally, vaccination with chimeric glycoconjugates significantly decreased the incidence of disease in pups born from immunized mice challenged with either serotype. This study provides proof of concept for a new generation of glycoconjugate vaccines that combine the antigenic specificity of different polysaccharide variants in a single molecule, eliciting a protective immune response against multiple serotype variants.","Campisi, Edmondo; Rosini, Roberto; Romano, Maria Rosaria; Balducci, Evita; Pinto, Vittoria; Brogioni, Barbara; De Ricco, Riccardo; Fabbrini, Monica; Spagnuolo, Angela; Chiarot, Emiliano; Berti, Francesco; Margarit, Immaculada",Glycoconj J,523,1

Light is one of the best characterized factors promoting seed germination in several species. The germination is also finely regulated by changes in hormones levels, mainly those of gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Here, we performed physiological, pharmacological, and molecular analyses to uncover the role of ATHB2, an HD-ZIP II transcription factor, in germination of Arabidopsis seeds. Our study demonstrated that ATHB2 is a negative regulator and sustains the expression of transcription factors to block germination promoted by light. Besides, we found that ATHB2 increases ABA sensitivity. Moreover, ABA and auxin content in athb2-2 mutant is higher than wild-type in dry seeds, but the differences disappeared during the imbibition in darkness and the first hours of exposition to light, respectively. Some ABA and light transcription factors are up-regulated by ATHB2, such as ABI5, ABI3, XERICO, SOMNUS and PIL5/PIF1. In opposition, PIN7, an auxin transport, is down-regulated. The role of ATHB2 as a repressor of germination induced by light affecting the gemination timing, could have differential effects on the establishment of seedlings altering the competitiveness between crops and weeds in the field.","Soledad, Tognacca Rocío; Monica, Carabelli; Giorgio, Morelli; Ida, Ruberti; Francisco, Botto Javier",Sci Rep,523,1

METHODS: Microarray GSE36791 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database followed by the identification of significantly different expressed RNAs (DERs, including lncRNA and mRNA) between patients with SAH and healthy individuals. Then, the functional analyses of DEmRNAs were conducted and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was also performed to extract the modules associated with SAH. Following, the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed and the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to screen key RNA biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of SAH from RIA. We also verified the results in a bigger dataset GSE7337. RESULTS: Totally, 561 DERs, including 25 DElncRNAs and 536 DEmRNAs, were identified. Functional analysis revealed that the DEmRNAs were mainly associated with immune response-associated GO-BP terms and KEGG pathways. Moreover, there were 6 modules significantly positive-correlated with SAH. The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network contained 2 lncRNAs (LINC00265 and LINC00937) and 169 mRNAs. The GSEA analysis showed that these two lncRNAs were associated with three pathways (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, neurotrophin signaling pathway, and apoptosis). Additionally, IRAK3 and NFKBIA involved in the neurotrophin signaling pathway and apoptosis while IL1R2, IL18RAP and IL18R1 was associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. The expression levels of these genes have the same trend in GSE36791 and GSE7337. CONCLUSION: LINC00265 and LINC00937 may be implicated with the pathogenesis of SAH from RIA.

To avoid bit errors in data transmission, low density parity check (LDPC) codes are widely recognized as efficient ways for navigation communication. Conventionally, the LDPC decoding is applied for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and degrades severely while facing the impulsive noise. However, navigation communication often suffers from impulsive interference due to the occurrence of high amplitude “spikes”. At this time, the conventional Gaussian noise assumption is inadequate. The impulsive component of interference has been found to be significant which influences the reliability of transmitted information. Therefore the LDPC decoding algorithms for AWGN channel are not suitable for impulsive noise environments. Consider that LDPC codes over GF(q) perform better than binary LDPC in resisting burst errors for current navigation system, it is necessary to conduct research on LDPC codes over GF(q). In this paper, an optimized initialization by calculating posterior probabilities of received symbols is proposed for non-binary LDPC decoding on additive white Class A noise (AWAN) channel. To verify the performance of the proposed initialization, extensive experiments are performed in terms of convergence, validity, and robustness. Preliminary results demonstrate that the decoding algorithm with the optimized initialization for non-binary LDPC codes performs better than the competing methods and that of binary LDPC codes on AWAN channel.","Liu, Haoqiang; Zhao, Hongbo; Chen, Xiaowen; Feng, Wenquan",PLoS One,523,27

Both dArc isoforms are related to the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon capsid, consisting of N- and C-terminal lobes. Structures of dArc1, as well as capsids formed by both dArc isoforms, have been recently determined. We carried out structural characterization of the four individual dArc lobe domains. As opposed to the corresponding mammalian Arc lobe domains, which are monomeric, the dArc lobes were all oligomeric in solution, indicating a strong propensity for homophilic interactions. A truncated N-lobe from dArc2 formed a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal structure, resulting in a novel dimer interaction that could be relevant for capsid assembly or other dArc functions. This domain-swapped structure resembles the dimeric protein C of flavivirus capsids, as well as the structure of histones dimers, domain-swapped transcription factors, and membrane-interacting BAK domains. The strong oligomerization properties of the isolated dArc lobe domains explain the ability of dArc to form capsids in the absence of any large N-terminal domain, in contrast to the mammalian protein.","Hallin, Erik I.; Markússon, Sigurbjörn; Böttger, Lev; Torda, Andrew E.; Bramham, Clive R.; Kursula, Petri",PLoS One,523,5

METHODS: Subjects were enrolled in the present cross-sectional study based on a random drop-off technique at the Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics at Jordan University Hospital. Initially, any female 18 years of age and older was asked to enroll in the study. Relevant data were gathered using a questionnaire composed of 30 questions, and body mass index (BMI) was determined from each participant’s weight and height. The following variables were collected: socio-demographic, chronic diseases, and health status. Each variable’s frequencies were reported, and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each variable was calculated. For association analysis, Chi-square analysis was performed with an odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to a combination of independent variables and a dependent condition with covariate factors. RESULTS: The age-standardized prevalence of overweight/obese Jordanian women was 70.6% (95% CI 66.0–74.8%). On the other hand, the age-standardized prevalence of only obese women was 36.4 (95% Cl 31.9–41.2%). Furthermore, the association between age and overweight/obesity was significant (p<0.0001). The percentage of overweight and obesity started to be significant in the 30–39 year age group. Moreover, the OR for obesity ranged from 2.7 to 7.0 (p<0.05–0.01) for those women with only elementary education. Besides, high parity was significantly associated with obesity and elementary education. For chronic conditions, the percentages of hypertension, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis were significantly correlated with increased BMI in Jordanian women. With age adjustment, however, only hypertension was associated with obese level 3 with OR of 7.2 and 95% CI of 2.1–25.1 (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of overweight/obesity among women in Jordan, which was related to high parity and low education level. This high prevalence of obesity increased the incidence of chronic diseases, such as hypertension. Therefore, community-based multiple strategies are required to combat obesity in Jordanian women.","Bustami, Mona; Matalka, Khalid Z; Mallah, Eyad; Abu-Qatouseh, Luay; Abu Dayyih, Wael; Hussein, Nour; Abu Safieh, Nayef; Elyyan, Yousef; Hussein, Nagham; Arafat, Tawfiq",J Multidiscip Healthc,523,1

There are some 274 species worldwide, distributed in Africa and the Asia-Pacific. To date, only five complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of Dacus fruit flies have been published and are available in the GenBank. METHODS AND RESULTS: In view of the lack of study on their mitogenome, we sequenced (by next generation sequencing) and annotated the complete mitogenome of D. vijaysegarani from Malaysia to determine its features and phylogenetic relationship. The whole mitogenome of D. vijaysegarani has identical gene order with the published mitogenomes of the genus Dacus, with 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNAs, a non-coding A + T rich control region, and intergenic spacer and overlap sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on 15 mitochondrial genes (13 PCGs and two rRNA genes), reveals Dacus, Zeugodacus and Bactrocera forming a distinct clade. The genus Dacus forms a monophyletic group in the subclade containing also the Zeugodacus group; this Dacus-Zeugodacus subclade is distinct from the Bactrocera subclade. D. (Mellesis) vijaysegarani forms a lineage with D. (Mellesis) trimacula in the subcluster containing also the lineage of D. (Mellesis) conopsoides and D. (Callantra) longicornis. D. (Dacus) bivittatus and D. (Didacus) ciliatus form a distinct subcluster. Based on cox1 sequences, the Malaysia and Vietnam taxa of D. vijaysegarani may not be conspecific. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mitochondrial genome of D. vijaysegarani provided essential molecular data that could be useful for further studies for species diagnosis, evolution and phylogeny research of other tephritid fruit flies in the future.

Genomic comparison to Duroc reveals that variations including SNPs, INDELs and one ∼2 Mb inversion identified in Ossabaw pig may be related to its “thrifty” phenotype. Finally, an important positively selected gene (PSG) was found to be LEPR (leptin receptor) containing two positively selected sites which may lead to pseudogenization of this gene with possible significant effects on obesity and inflammation development.

Probes in microarray are one kind of the most important materials. Usually, scientists use a unique probe for marking a special target sequence. Thus, for identifying n different viruses, we need n different probes. Recently, some researchers study non-unique probes to identify viruses by using less number of probes. In this case, a virus can be identified by a combination of some probes. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of probes that can identify all the given targets. We consider the k-fault tolerance selection of probes. That is, if any k probes fail, then we still can identify each target. We propose a practical algorithm for this k-fault tolerance probe selection problem.

These techniques offer significant advantages over traditional open surgical approaches to the skull base, including improved tumor resection, and better post-operative neurological outcomes. Following their introduction, however, the initial rate of post-operative CSF leak was unacceptably high. Post-operative CSF leak following skull base surgery is a major source of morbidity, and can lead to the development of life-threatening intracranial infection. The use of vascularized naso-septal flaps transformed the management of these patients, significantly reducing the rate of post-operative CSF leak and increasing the number of patients that could benefit from this less invasive treatment modality. Adequate repair of iatrogenic defects in the skull base is of crucial importance for patients with skull base tumors, as the development of a post-operative CSF leak, and the associated complications can significantly delay the administration of the adjunctive oncological therapies these patients require. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest evidence regarding skull base reconstruction following endoscopic skull base surgery, and describe the skull base repair technique in use at our institution.","Hannan, Cathal John; Kelleher, Eoin; Javadpour, Mohsen",Front Oncol,523,1

Studies have shown that nostalgic memories trigger positive emotions, which can provide better experiences for elderly people in learning and using new technology. However, the use of nostalgia in TUI for elderly people has been little and therefore the understanding on how nostalgia can contribute in TUI promoting technology acceptance among elderly people is limited. In order to address this knowledge gap, in this study we have created a nostalgic TUI application for elderly people through three iterations of design, development and evaluation. The results show that by adopting the element of nostalgia into the TUI application, elderly people could learn to use new technology in a more intuitive way. They could relate the new technology to their old positive memories. However, they had expectations that the TUI application would work exactly like the old fashioned way. Through the research process, we gathered and reflected on the lessons learned, which can serve as guidelines for using the concept of nostalgia in designing TUI application for elderly people’s technology acceptance.","Bong, Way Kiat; Maußer, Florian; van Eck, Margot; De Araujo, Diogo; Tibosch, Jorg; Glaum, Tobias; Chen, Weiqin",Computers Helping People with Special Needs,523,19

These FSPs typically consist of several sophisticated fiscal policies that may not necessarily complement each other. While the impact of these policies at the aggregate country level in developed countries has been widely discussed, the spatial impact of these policies within developing countries is less understood. Utilizing an inter-regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this paper aims to assess and understand the short- and long-term economic impacts of these stimulus policies using Indonesia as a case study. This paper, hence, provides a quantitative ex-post assessment of FSPs typically implemented during the 2009 GFC by developing economies. Overall, results, indicate that fiscal stimulus had a positive impact on aggregate demand and on poverty prevention, principally via stimulating private consumption. Corporate income tax cuts have the largest economic impact in the long-run, and cash transfers are the most useful policy tool for alleviating poverty. An FSP, however, could have an uneven spatial distributional effect on output across regions, particularly in the short-term.","Resosudarmo, Budy P.; Abdurohman; Yusuf, Arief A.; Hartono, Djoni",Asia-Pac J Reg Sci,523,13

This has forced decision-makers in the energy sector to reconsider how should the sector operate. With stumbling crude oil prices, it is evident that there is a need for a radical change in the way energy resources are utilized. This is where renewable energy supply chains such as biomass supply chains can play an important role. Biomass supply chains have been identified as a potential answer to the current issues faced by the energy sector that is still heavily reliant on fossil fuel. As such, this paper aims to examine the current challenges faced by biomass supply chains. Alongside this, potential opportunities that may arise for biomass supply chains in a post-COVID-19 world are also discussed with a specific focus on how the resiliency of biomass supply chains in six areas (i.e., supply availability, digitalization and automation, collaboration within the supply chain, community-focused energy production, social challenges and opportunities, and policy) can be improved in the post-pandemic scenario.

We hypothesize that hospitals with reputations for high quality service represent an opportunity for physicians, and other service providers, to benefit from reputation spillovers. Further, the reputation benefit is capitalized into the practices’ willingness to pay for proximate office locations, thereby driving up the rental rates for nearby space. We find that distance from, and overall quality ranking of the hospital, both independent and in concert, are significantly linked to the base rents. The degradation in rent with distance is significantly greater when the hospital is ranked high in overall service quality, supporting the notion that a rent premium is linked to the high-quality hospital rather than simply an artifact of the neighborhood.","Goodman, Allen C.; Smith, Brent C",J Real Estate Finan Econ,523,17

We carry out analysis on a secondary dataset (2017 Natality) obtained from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This was analyzed using descriptive, bivariate, and regression analysis. This cross-sectional study obtained sociodemographic information-maternal race, independent and confounder variables (explanatory variables), and the occurrence of Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease (outcome variable) within the reporting States and U.S. territories. There was a report of 3,864,754 live birth out of 325,719,178 USA races and origin populations for the 2017 review year. A total number of 2130 CCHD birth was reported to have occurred out of the 3,8161,947 live births. The Chi-square test showed a statistically significant association between maternal race and the occurrence of CCHD. As well as, the following confounders mother's age, mother's nativity, combined gestation, pre-pregnancy diabetes, pre-pregnancy hypertension, month prenatal care began, smoking status, and Nutrition (WIC) all having a p-value of 0.01 each, respectively. Unadjusted odds ratios at 95 % CI of the association between maternal race and CCHD were 56 % higher among American Indian and Alaska Native women (95% CI 1.13-2.15) than the white racial group. In addition, the Odds were 13% (95% CI 0.78-0.98) and 46% (95% CI 0.43-0.66) less likely amongst Black and Asian or Pacific Islander, respectively. The odds were 402% markedly high for pre-pregnancy diabetes, 159% for pre-pregnancy hypertension, 38 % for smoking status, and 44%, 159%, and 42% respectively for prenatal care from 1st to 2nd months, 4th to 6th months, and 7th to the final month, when compared to no prenatal care. The odds of having a CCHD was 16% less likely for mothers on Nutrition (mothers on WIC) (95% CI 0.77-0.92), 19% (95% CI 0.73-0.90) for mothers age (under 35 years) category, and likewise for mothers born outside of the USA at 39% (95% CI 1.22-1.56). On Adjustment for confounders, the OR for this relationship was on the higher side for many of the variables. The odds of occurrence of CCHD were 59 % higher amongBlack (95% CI 1.27-2.0), 35% among AIAN (95 % CI 1.05-1.74), and 92 % among American Indian and Alaska Native (95 % CI 1.26-2.93) racial categories whencompared to Asian or Pacific Islander categories. The odds of having a CCHD was also elevated on adjustment for mothers born outside of the USA at 39% (95% CI 1.22-1.56), and at from the 7th to final month 94% (95% CI 1.38-2.73). However, the odds were insignificant in other categories and variables. These estimates suggest theoccurrence of a CCHD is associated with the analyzed independent predictor and confounder variables. An association exists between maternal race and the occurrence of cyanotic congenital heart disease in the USA. Further research in this area, may therefore help to diminish the occurrence, morbidity, and or mortality of CCHD in America and globally as well.","Ebeh, Dandison Nat; Jahanfar, Shayesteh",SN Compr Clin Med,523,1

Monocytes play an important role in the initiation and resolution of inflammation, and their diverse functions can be attributed to specific cellular subsets: pro-inflammatory or classical monocytes (Ly6cHi) and pro-reparative or non-classical monocytes (Ly6cLo). We hypothesized that inherent differences in Ly6cHi classical monocytes and Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes determine susceptibility to perinatal hepatic inflammation in late gestation fetuses and neonates. We found an anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile expressed by Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes, and a physiologic abundance of these cells in the late gestation fetal liver. Unlike neonatal pups, late gestation fetuses proved to be resistant to rhesus rotavirus (RRV) mediated liver inflammation. Furthermore, neonatal pups were rendered resistant to RRV-mediated liver injury when Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes were expanded. Pharmacologic inhibition of Ly6cLo non-classical monocytes in this setting restored susceptibility to RRV-mediated disease. These data demonstrate that Ly6cLo monocytes promote resolution of perinatal liver inflammation in the late gestation fetus, where there is a physiologic expansion of non-classical monocytes, and in the neonatal liver upon experimental expansion of these cells. Therapeutic strategies directed towards enhancing Ly6cLo non-classical monocyte function may mitigate the detrimental effects of perinatal liver inflammation.","Alkhani, Anas; Levy, Claire S; Tsui, Margaret; Rosenberg, Katherine A; Polovina, Katya; Mattis, Aras N; Mack, Matthias; Van Dyken, Steven; Wang, Bruce M; Maher, Jacquelyn J; Nijagal, Amar",Scientific reports,523,1

METHOD In this prospective study, consecutive women with faecal incontinence following OASIS accepted for SNM were screened for concomitant urinary incontinence. The primary outcome was the change in urinary incontinence score on the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence, Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF), between baseline and 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the change in St Mark's score, sexual function and quality of life, change in grade of urinary incontinence and disappearance of urgency. RESULTS From March 2012 to September 2014, 39 women with combined faecal incontinence and urinary incontinence received SNM. Thirty-seven women were available for analysis after 12 months. The mean reduction in the ICIQ-UI-SF score between the baseline and 12 months was 5.8 (95% CI 3.7-8.0, P < 0.001). ICIQ-UI-SF was reduced in 29 (78%) women, urinary incontinence resolved in 13/37 (35%, 95% CI 20%-50%) patients, and urgency disappeared in 14/33 (42%, 95% CI 26%-59%). The mean reduction in the St Mark's score was 10.6 (95% CI 8.6-12.7, P < 0.001). Disease-specific quality of life, Euroqual 5-dimension visual analogue scale (EQ-5D VAS) and several areas of sexual function changed significantly for the better.

The American Society for Transplantation (AST) Clinical Practice Guidelines advise that serologic screening for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) be conducted for all KT candidates, since live-attenuated vaccines are contraindicated post-transplantation [4]. Our team at Mayo Clinic Florida (MCF) conducted a quality improvement (QI) initiative to establish a best MMR screening and immunizations clinical practice in KT candidates using a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model. By retrospective chart review of all KT candidates evaluated at our institution from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, baseline data determining the rate of MMR serologic screening was established. PDSA cycles were implemented to adopt protocol-driven testing for MMR serologies, immunization documentation, and vaccination in cases of seronegativity to any of the three MMR viruses in all pre-KT candidates. Two PDSA cycles were completed in 4 months. The study population totaled 447 patients (baseline n=283, PDSA 1 n=61, PDSA 2 n=103). Baseline data showed that 83% (n=235) of pre-KT candidates received infectious disease consultation (IDC). Complete MMR (all three viruses) serological screening in KT candidates improved from baseline 3.9% to 87.4% post-PDSA cycle 2 (P < .001).

This is usually performed through three to four small incisions. Although postoperative pain is minimal, there still exists some discomfort from multiple incisions. In theory, fewer incisions or incisionless surgery may decrease postoperative morbidity more than that already exists. Reports of microport instrumentation as well as normal orifice translumenal endosurgery (NOTES) cholecystectomy transvaginally, transcolonically, or transgastrically have recently surfaced. However, these require a different skill set and new technology, which is still in its developmental infancy. Single incision surgery has recently entered the minimally invasive arena. METHODS Ten consecutive patients requiring laparoscopic cholecystectomy were performed with a single incision multiport technique as described below. RESULTS All ten patients had a successful completion of a single incision multiport laparoendoscopic cholecystectomy without need for conversion to two, three, or four incisions. There were no complications and the recovery was comparable to a conventional LC. CONCLUSION We describe here a single incision multiport laparoendoscopic cholecystectomy (SIMPLE cholecystectomy) technique that is safe for the patient, reproducible, easy to learn, and uses commonly available instruments already in most operating rooms. Conversion, if required, is placement of the remaining two to three ports for a more conventional LC.","Petrotos, Athanassios C; Molinelli, Bruce M",Surgical endoscopy,523,30

Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and exercise have been shown to affect aspects of immune function in some populations. We hypothesized that influenza vaccine responses may be enhanced with meditation or exercise training as compared with controls. RESULTS No differences in vaccine responses were found comparing control to MBSR or exercise. Individuals achieving seroprotective levels of influenza antibody ≥160 units had higher optimism, less anxiety, and lower perceived stress than the nonresponders. Age correlated with influenza antibody responses, but not with IFNγ or IL-10 production. CONCLUSION The MBSR and exercise training evaluated in this study failed to enhance immune responses to influenza vaccine. However, optimism, perceived stress, and anxiety were correlated in the expected directions with antibody responses to influenza vaccine. METHODS Healthy individuals≥50 y were randomly assigned to exercise (n=47) or MBSR (n=51) training or a waitlist control condition (n=51). Each participant received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine after 6 weeks, and had blood draws prior to and 3 and 12 weeks after immunization. Serum influenza antibody, nasal immunoglobulin A, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell interferon-γ (IFNγ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations were measured. Measures of optimism, perceived stress, and anxiety were obtained over the course of the study. Seroprotection was defined as an influenza antibody concentration≥160 units.

Prednisolone, prednisolone acetate, dexamethasone, triamcinolone acetonide, fluocinolone acetonide, and loteprednol etabonate are amongst the most widely used ophthalmic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids differ in their activity and potency in the eye due to their inherent pharmacological and pharmaceutical differences. Different routes and regimens are available for ocular administration of corticosteroids. Conventional topical application to the eye is the route of choice when targeting diseases affecting the ocular surface and anterior segment, while periocular, intravitreal, and suprachoroidal injections can be potentially effective for posterior segment diseases. Corticosteroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation and cataract formation remain the most significant local risks following topical as well as systemic corticosteroid administration. Invasive drug administration via intracameral, subconjunctival, and intravitreal injection can enhance ocular bioavailability and minimize dose and dosing frequency of administration, yet may exacerbate ocular side effects of corticosteroids.

In accord with randomization, the vaginal cuff in TLH was closed with either extracorporeal or intracorporeal knots (1-Monocryl(®); Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) and a bidirectional knotless barbed suture (0-Quill™; Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). All patients were evaluated at 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year follow-up. RESULTS Time required to suture was significantly lower in the group treated with bidirectional suture than in groups with traditional sutures (P<.001). No significant difference was observed in the operative time between the study groups. The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in the bidirectional barbed suture group than in the other groups. At 1-year follow-up all patients presented no wound dehiscence, no bleeding, dyspareunia, and other potential major complications such as ureteric, bladder, or bowel injury.

We suggest using a risk-stratified testing strategy, based on targeted testing directly integrated with the Public Health Service's case and contact tracing management. According to the proposed targeted testing strategy stratified by risk of infection, all persons with acute symptoms of a respiratory infection as well as other population groups with an elevated probability of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be specifically tested to identify ""hidden"" infection networks. The strategy should include a uniform communication strategy for dealing with positive and negative test results, a targeted expansion of access to low-threshold testing opportunities, ensuring timely and free access to the results of confirmatory tests, and integration into an overarching documentation system for evaluation.

Prior to lithotripsy techniques, transcystic laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) was limited to smaller CBD stones. The addition of lithotripsy to LCBDE increases cost, operative time and staffing requirements. Predicting which patients might require lithotripsy would be useful in operative planning. The primary aim was to investigate clinical variables for predicting lithotripsy assistance during transcystic bile duct exploration by laparoendoscopy (PRE-LABEL). Secondary aims were to develop and validate a predictive scoring tool. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients who underwent transcystic LCBDE at a single centre in the UK was performed to investigate clinical variables for PRE-LABEL and develop a scoring tool (ABCdE score: age, bilirubin, CBD diameter, ERCP). Binary logistic regression was used to investigate which independent variables (predictors) were associated with lithotripsy assistance during transcystic LCBDE. The ABCdE score was applied to both UK and Spain patient cohorts to determine its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. RESULTS From 8 pre-operative clinical variables analysed, age ≤ 40 years, bilirubin > two-times upper limit of normal, CBD diameter ≥ 10 mm and ERCP failure of stone extraction were independent predictors of requiring lithotripsy during transcystic LCBDE and formed the ABCdE score. The hazard ratios were 2.87, 3.79, 2.78 and 10.06, respectively. An ABCdE score ≥ 2 resulted in 71% sensitivity, 81% specificity and 79% accuracy in predicting lithotripsy during LCBDE (UK cohort). Validation using a contemporary cohort from Spain yielded similar sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS This study represents the only study to date reporting independent predictors of requiring lithotripsy assistance during transcystic LCBDE. ABCdE score ≥ 2 can highlight patients that may require lithotripsy in order to avoid failure of transcystic LCBDE and therefore avoid choledochotomy or post-operative ERCP.","Navaratne, Lalin; Martínez Cecilia, David; Martínez Isla, Alberto",Surgical endoscopy,523,20

In Northern Italy in particular, we rapidly experienced a critical care crisis due to a shortage of intensive care beds, as we expected according to data reported in China. Based on our experience of managing this surge, we produced this review to support other healthcare services in preparedness and training of hospitals during the current coronavirus outbreak. We had a dedicated task force that identified a response plan, which included: (1) establishment of dedicated, cohorted intensive care unit(s) (ICU) for COVID-19-positive patients; (2) design of appropriate procedures for pre-triage, diagnosis and isolation of suspected and confirmed cases; and (3) training of all staff to work in the dedicated ICU in personal protective equipment use and patient management. Hospital multidisciplinary and departmental collaboration was needed to work on all principles of surge capacity, including: space definition; supplies provision; staff recruitment; and ad-hoc training. Dedicated protocols were applied where full isolation of spaces, staff and patients was implemented. Opening the unit and the whole hospital emergency process required a multidisciplinary, multilevel involvement of healthcare providers and hospital managers all working towards a common goal: patient care and hospital safety. Hospitals should be prepared to face severe disruptions to their routine and it is very likely that protocols and procedures might require re-discussion and update on a daily basis.","Carenzo, L; Costantini, E; Greco, M; Barra, F L; Rendiniello, V; Mainetti, M; Bui, R; Zanella, A; Grasselli, G; Lagioia, M; Protti, A; Cecconi, M",Anaesthesia,523,27

Endovascular treatment of these aneurysms has rarely been reported. Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single Pipeline Embolization Device for the treatment of tandem aneurysms of the internal carotid artery. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device between 2009 and 2016 at 3 institutions in the United States was performed. Cases included aneurysms of the ICA treated with a single Pipeline Embolization Device, and they were divided into tandem versus solitary. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS The solitary group (median age, 58 years) underwent 184 Pipeline Embolization Device procedures for 184 aneurysms. The tandem group (median age, 50.5 years) underwent 34 procedures for 78 aneurysms. Aneurysms were primarily located along the paraophthalmic segment of the ICA in both the single and tandem groups (72.3% versus 78.2%, respectively, P = .53). The median maximal diameters in the solitary and tandem groups were 6.2 and 6.7 mm, respectively. Complete occlusion on the last angiographic follow-up was achieved in 75.1% of aneurysms in the single compared with 88.6%% in the tandem group (P = .06). Symptomatic thromboembolic complications were encountered in 2.7% and 8.8% of procedures in the single and tandem groups, respectively (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS Tandem aneurysms of the ICA can be treated with a single Pipeline Embolization Device with high rates of complete occlusion. While there appeared to be a trend toward higher thromboembolic complication rates, this did not reach statistical significance.","Adeeb, N; Moore, J M; Griessenauer, C J; Foreman, P M; Shallwani, H; Dmytriw, A A; Shakir, H; Siddiqui, A H; Levy, E I; Davies, J M; Harrigan, M R; Thomas, A J; Ogilvy, C S",AJNR.

Every second year since 2004, the examinations are expanded in six study regions using a cross-sectional survey design (GME). However, the extent to which the results of the GME surveys are generalizable to the SEU population is unknown. Therefore, this study carried out a poststratification of two different GME surveys. The aim was to observe the impact of poststratification on an exemplary analysis of influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma, wheezing) and thus to better understand this important question. METHODS First, poststratification was applied to correct for deviances of the GME sample in comparison to the SEU population. Logistic regression was used to determine the auxiliary variables for the poststratification. Following this, a composite variable as a linear combination was created to calculate weighting factors. Next, logistic regression analyses were applied to analyze possible influencing factors for three allergy and asthma related outcomes (hay fever, asthma and wheezing) in two GME surveys (2005/2006 and 2012/2013). Subsequently, the differences arising from poststratification were examined in more detail. RESULTS This study supports the hypothesis that the GME sample deviates from the SEU population. Mother tongue other than German of at least one parent, complete vaccination status and conspicuous visuomotor test results were positively associated with participation in both GME surveys. The prevalence for hay fever, asthma and frequent wheeze did not change statistically significant from 2005/2006 to 2012/2013. In the twelve analyses before and after poststratification, male sex was statistically significant associated with the three allergy and asthma related outcomes (e.g. asthma 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 2.06, 95%-CI: 1.56-2.71). A high body mass index was positively associated with asthma (e.g. 2005/2006 after poststratification, aOR: 1.12, 95%-CI: 1.05-1.20). Poststratification caused a significant change in the sample composition. CONCLUSIONS It might be suggested that a poststratification should be performed for each GME survey. Poststratification tended to make results more comparable with previous research. In accordance with previous research, this study confirmed that male sex and high BMI are associated with asthma.","Kass, Bernhard; Kutzora, Susanne; Weinberger, Alisa; Nennstiel, Uta; Heißenhuber, Annette; Herr, Caroline; Heinze, Stefanie",International journal of hygiene and environmental health,523,5

Here, we show that hypothalamic E-Syt3 plays a critical role in diet-induced obesity (DIO). E-Syt3 is characteristically expressed in the hypothalamic nuclei. Whole-body or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-specific ablation of E-Syt3 ameliorated DIO and related comorbidities, including glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Conversely, overexpression of E-Syt3 in the arcuate nucleus moderately promoted food intake and impaired energy expenditure, leading to increased weight gain. Mechanistically, E-Syt3 ablation led to increased processing of POMC to α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), increased activities of protein kinase C and activator protein-1, and enhanced expression of prohormone convertases. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for hypothalamic E-Syt3 in DIO and related metabolic disorders.","Zhang, Yi; Guan, Yunliang; Pan, Susu; Yan, Lihong; Wang, Ping; Chen, Zhuo; Shen, Qing; Zhao, Faming; Zhang, Xin; Li, Juan; Li, Juxue; Cai, Dongsheng; Zhang, Guo",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,523,1

In this study, we have achieved intracellular production of PbS QDs using Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The characterization of these PbS QDS was performed by different techniques, such as Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and particle size analysis (DLS). The obtained results confirmed the synthesis of PbS QDs. The PbS QDs showed absorption peaks at 1088 nm (ultraviolet-visible spectrometry) and a luminescence peak at 1572 nm. In addition, the intracellular biosynthesized PbS QDs showed a particle size in the range 3.47-11.45 nm, which is consistent with DLS and sphere-shaped nanocrystals with good crystallinity and a cubic cristalline structure including pure Pb and S elements. Biosynthesized PbS QDs showed antibacterial activity against Proteus mirabilis ATCC 25933 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 from Gram (-) bacteria and Bacillus cereus NRLL B-3008 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 from Gram (+) bacteria. Besides, these current results obtained from the cleavage studies revealed that PbS QDs do not show DNA cleavage activity. Consequently, the microorganism-based intracellular method allows an economic and environmentally friendly way to obtain PbS QDs with superior optical properties and they have a potential to be used in healthcare applications.","Öcal, Necip; Ceylan, Ahmet; Duman, Fatih",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,523,13

Criticisms of the single-incision laparoscopic surgery technique include a larger incision and increased incidence of wound-related complications. We present our initial experience with a novel technique aimed at performing strategic laparoscopy for improved cosmesis (SLIC) for cholecystectomy. METHODS Twenty-five patients with biliary symptoms were selected for SLIC cholecystectomy. Access to the abdomen was obtained with a 5-mm optical trocar in the left upper quadrant and a 5-mm trocar in the umbilicus. Retraction was performed by a transabdominal suture in the dome of the gallbladder and a needlescopic grasper. Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, operative time, length of stay, pathology results, and short-term complications at follow-up were prospectively recorded. RESULTS The 25 female patients had a mean age of 34.3 years and mean body mass index of 24 kg/m(2). American Society of Anesthesiologists scores ranged from 1 to 3. The mean operative time was 51.3 minutes. Pathology revealed chronic cholecystitis in all patients. All procedures were performed on an outpatient basis. The only complication was one ultrasonography-documented deep vein thrombosis. All 25 planned SLIC cholecystectomies were successfully completed. CONCLUSIONS SLIC cholecystectomy is feasible and safe. This technique decreases the cumulative incision length, as well as the number of incisions, leading to very desirable cosmetic results in patients with a favorable body habitus and surgical history.","Dan, Adrian G; Mirhaidari, Shayda; Pozsgay, Mark; Standerwick, Andrew; Bohon, Ashley; Zografakis, John G",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,523,19

While abundant in soil, Fe bioavailability in oxic soil is very low. In environmental conditions, bacteria need to acquire sufficient Fe to sustain growth while limiting the energy cost of siderophore synthesis. Biofilm formation might mitigate this Fe stress, since it was shown to accumulate Fe in certain Gram-negative bacteria and that this Fe could be mobilized for uptake. However, it is still unclear if and to what extent the amount of Fe accumulated in the biofilm can sustain growth, and if the mobilization of this local Fe pool is modulated by the availability of environmental Fe (i.e., Fe outside the biofilm matrix). Here we use a non-domesticated strain of the ubiquitous biofilm-forming soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, and stable Fe isotopes to precisely evaluate the origin of Fe during growth in the presence of tannic acid and hydroxides, used as proxies for different environmental conditions. We report that this B. subtilis strain can accumulate a large quantity of Fe in the biofilm, largely exceeding Fe associated with cells. We also report that only a fraction of biofilm-bound Fe is available for uptake in the absence of other sources of Fe in the vicinity of the biofilm. We observed that availability of environmental Fe modulates the usage of this pool of biofilm-bound Fe. Finally, our data suggest that consumption of biofilm-bound Fe relates to the efficacy of B. subtilis to transport Fe from the environment to the biofilm, possibly through siderophores.Importance Recent evidences suggest that Fe bound to the biofilm could assume at least two important functions; a local source of Fe for uptake and a support to extracellular metabolism such as extracellular electron transfer. Our results show that B. subtilis can use biofilm-bound Fe for uptake only if it does not compromise Fe homeostasis of the biofilm, i.e., maintaining a minimum Fe concentration in the biofilm for extracellular purposes. We propose a theoretical framework based on our results and recent literature to explain how B. subtilis manages biofilm-bound Fe and Fe uptake in response to environmental Fe availability. These results provide important insights into the management of biofilm-bound and environmental Fe by B. subtilis in response to Fe stress.","Rizzi, Adrien; Leroux, Julie; Charron-Lamoureux, Vincent; Roy, Sébastien; Beauregard, Pascale B; Bellenger, Jean-Philippe",Applied and environmental microbiology,523,1

Local autogenous bone is largely unavailable, distant bone grafts are fraught with significant morbidity and limited yield, and alloplastic materials are incompatible with the growing calvarium and facial skeleton. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2, a member of a class of proteins first noticed in the 1960s to promote bone deposition in soft tissues, offers a potential solution to the bone shortage historically faced by the pediatric craniofacial surgeon. A review of English language literature was conducted from the 1960s to the present.Attention was focused on BMP-2's osteoinductive mechanism, basic science and translational laboratory findings, and multidisciplinary clinical experiences. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 has been embraced by spine surgeons, is gaining in popularity for long-bone repair, and is making its way into the plastic surgery literature. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 may provide a basis for an off-the-shelf tissue-engineered bone construct that is compatible with the growing craniofacial skeleton while free from the morbidities of distant graft harvest. Questions remain, however, regarding the safety and efficacy of this compound in the context of pediatric craniofacial surgery. In an effort to facilitate the clinician's risk-benefit analysis of this emerging technology, we present a primer on the basic science of BMP-2, a discussion of possible morbidities associated with its use, a review of laboratory and clinical trials with this substance to date, and an analysis of strategies to maximize its efficacy in craniofacial surgery.","Smith, Darren M; Cooper, Gregory M; Mooney, Mark P; Marra, Kacey G; Losee, Joseph E",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,523,29

GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. RESULTS There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it.","Barney, Anitha M; Danda, Sumita; Abraham, Aby; Fouzia, N A; Gowdra, Aruna; Abraham, Suneetha Susan Cleave; Sony, Mohan; Das, Sweta; Korula, Sophy; Mathai, Sarah; Simon, Anna; Kumar, Sathish",Public health genomics,523,1

In particular, resource-limited areas need simple and easily disseminated testing solutions to manage the outbreak. In this work, a microfluidic-integrated lateral flow recombinase polymerase amplification (MI-IF-RPA) assay was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, which integrates the reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and a universal lateral flow (LF) dipstick detection system into a single microfluidic chip. The single-chamber RT-RPA reaction components are mixed with running buffer, and then delivered to the LF detection strips for biotin- and FAM-labelled amplified analyte sequences, which can provide easily interpreted positive or negative results. Testing requires only a simple nucleic acid extraction and loading, then incubation to obtain results, approximately 30 minutes in total. SARS-CoV-2 armored RNA particles were used to validate the MI-IF-RPA system, which showed a limit of detection of 1 copy per μL, or 30 copies per sample. Chip performance was further evaluated using clinically diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and revealed a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 100%, highly comparable to current reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based diagnostic assays.

As these symptoms matched with coronavirus infection, the COVID-19 test was done, which was found negative. He was then moved to the intensive care unit where he developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and was put on mechanical ventilation. Further workup did not reveal any source of infection, as all his cultures were negative, but his CT chest showed a tree-in-bud appearance.

Sterilized embryos are transferred to sterile diet in 50 ml centrifuge tubes, and developing larvae and adults remain free of any exogenous microbes until the vials are opened. Alternatively, flies with a defined microbiota can be reared by inoculating sterile diet and embryos with microbial species of interest. We describe the introduction of 4 bacterial species to establish a representative gnotobiotic microbiota in Drosophila.

As the use of medication without established effectiveness may result in adverse health consequences, the development of evidence-based guidelines is of critical importance for the clinical management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This research presents methods used to develop rapid advice guidelines on treating COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We have followed the basic approach for developing WHO rapid guidelines, including preparing, developing, disseminating and updating each process. Compared with general guidelines, this rapid advice guideline is unique in formulating the body of evidence, as the available evidence for the treatment of COVID-19 with TCM is from either indirect or observational studies, clinical first-hand data together with expert experience in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, our search of evidence not only focuses on clinical studies of treating COVID-19 with TCM but also of similar diseases, such as pneumonia and influenza. Grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methodology was adopted to rate the quality of evidence and distinguish the strength of recommendations. The overall certainty of the evidence is graded as either high, moderate, low or very low, and to give either ""strong"" or ""weak"" recommendations of each TCM therapy. The output of this paper will produce the guideline on TCM for COVID-19 and will also provide some ideas for evidence collection and synthesis in the future development of rapid guidelines for COVID-19 in TCM as well as other areas.","Liang, Ning; Li, Huizhen; Wang, Jingya; Jiao, Liwen; Ma, Yanfang; Wang, Xiaohui; Liu, Bin; Luo, Xufei; Zhao, Siya; Lv, Meng; Cao, Jin; Hu, Wenpin; Zhang, Hairong; Xiong, Yibai; Tian, Yaxin; Chen, Yaolong; Wang, Yanping; Shi, Nannan",The American journal of Chinese medicine,523,31

Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. Eleven reported positive associations, three reported mixed results, and three reported no association. Two studies used objective measures of lutein status (blood concentration) and physical activity (accelerometry) and reported positive associations, with correlations of ≥0.36 and differences of ≥57% in physical activity between upper and lower tertiles. Studies using self-report measures reported weaker correlations (r = 0.06 to 0.25), but still more physical activity (18% to ≥600% higher) in those with the highest compared with the lowest lutein status.

However, molecular data strongly and consistently suggest that hylobatids should be present by approximately 20 Ma; thus, there are large temporal, geographical, and morphological gaps between early fossil apes in Africa and the earliest fossil hylobatids in China. Here, we describe a new approximately 12.5-13.8 Ma fossil ape from the Lower Siwaliks of Ramnagar, India, that fills in these long-standing gaps with implications for hylobatid origins. This ape represents the first new hominoid species discovered at Ramnagar in nearly a century, the first new Siwalik ape taxon in more than 30 years, and likely extends the hylobatid fossil record by approximately 5 Myr, providing a minimum age for hylobatid dispersal coeval to that of great apes.

This study aimed firstly to compare CDUS detection of significant sac abnormalities with CTA. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare financial estimates of the, predominantly CDUS based, local and Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) protocols, the risk stratified European Society of Vascular Surgery (ESVS) protocol, and the CTA based National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) protocol. METHODS Agreement between CDUS and CTA was assessed for detection of significant sac abnormalities. Surveillance protocols were extrapolated from published guidelines and applied to infrarenal EVAR patients active on local surveillance at a large, single centre. Surveillance intensity was dependent on presence of endoleak and subsequent risk of treatment failure in accordance with surveillance recommendations. Estimates for each surveillance protocol were inclusive of a range of published incidences of endoleak, contrast associated acute kidney injury (AKI), and excess hospital bed days, and estimated for a hypothetical five year surveillance period. RESULTS The kappa coefficient between CDUS and CTA for detecting sac abnormalities was 0.68. Maximum five year surveillance cost estimates for the 289 active EVAR patients were £272 359 for SVS, £230 708 for ESVS, £643 802 for NICE, and £266 777 for local protocols, or £1 270, £1 076, £3 003, and £1 244 per patient. Differences in endoleak incidence accounted for a 1.1 to 1.4 fold increase in costs. AKI incidence accounted for a 3.3 to 6.2 fold increase in costs. CONCLUSION A combined CTA and CDUS EVAR surveillance protocol, with CTA reserved for early seal assessment and confirmatory purposes, provides an economical approach without compromising detection of sac abnormalities. AKI, as opposed to direct imaging costs, accounted for the largest differences in surveillance cost estimates.","Smith, Luke; Thomas, Nicholas; Arnold, Andrew; Bell, Rachel; Zayed, Hany; Tyrrell, Mark; Padayachee, Soundrie",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,523,24

METHODS Four FNA needles and one percutaneous needle were used to perform liver biopsies on two human cadaveric livers: Cook Echotip Procore™, Olympus EZ Shot 2™, Boston Scientific Expect Slimline™, Covidien SharkCore™, and an 18-gauge percutaneous needle (TruCore™, Argon Medical Devices). Each needle obtained biopsies by three, six, and nine complete back-and-forth motions of the needle (""throw"") with a fanning technique. The combined lengths of specimen fragments and the total number of complete portal tracts (CPT) were measured by a blinded pathologist. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS A total of 52 liver biopsies were performed. The Covidien SharkCore needle had significantly greater number of CPT compared to other FNA needles. The number of ""throws"" did not impact the number of CPT significantly. There was no statistically significant difference in mean total specimen length between each FNA needle type.

Two M-specific shRNA-expressing plasmid constructs, named pS(M641) and pS(M827), were evaluated for antiviral activity against the NDV strain NA-1 by cytopathic effects (CPE), virus titration and real-time RT-PCR. After 36h of infection, both pS(M641) and pS(M827) reduced virus titers by 79.4- and 31.6-fold, respectively, and they down-regulated mRNA expression levels of the matrix protein gene M by 94.6% and 84.8%, respectively, in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells, while only pS(M641) significantly decreased CPE, compared to the control group.

From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and respond with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain(NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARS-CoV2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host. The review also addresses the stages of developments of various vaccines against these viral diseases and the challenges encountered by the researchers during vaccine development.","Dixon, Dalia Cicily Kattiparambil; Ratan, Chameli; Nair, Bhagyalakshmi; Mangalath, Sabitha; Abraham, Rachy; Nath, Lekshmi R",Current protein & peptide science,523,7

Although IBV is controlled using live attenuated and inactivated vaccines it continues to be a major problem due to the existence of many serotypes, determined by the surface spike protein resulting in poor cross-protection, and loss of immunogenicity associated with vaccine production. Live attenuated IBV vaccines are produced by the repeated passage in embryonated eggs resulting in spontaneous mutations. As a consequence attenuated viruses have only a few mutations responsible for the loss of virulence, which will differ between vaccines affecting virulence and/or immunogenicity and can revert to virulence. A new generation of vaccines is called for and one means of controlling IBV involves the development of new and safer vaccines by precisely modifying the IBV genome using reverse genetics for the production of rationally attenuated IBVs in order to obtain an optimum balance between loss of virulence and capacity to induce immunity.","Britton, Paul; Armesto, Maria; Cavanagh, David; Keep, Sarah",Bioengineered bugs,523,16

Material and Methods For ruptured aneurysms we preformed endovascular embolization. Further treatment was dependent on patient's condition and control studies. In case of unruptured aneurysms, we assessed collateral circulation between superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis in angio-CT. If there was a pathway free from aneurysms, endovascular approach was chosen. Otherwise, surgical or combined treatment was favored. Results Endovascular treatment was performed in 14 patients with no complications. Follow-up studies revealed incomplete occlusion of the aneurysms in two cases. Surgical or combined treatment was performed in 7 patients with three serious perioperative complications. They were managed conservatively in two cases and surgically in one. Follow-up studies showed aneurismal dilatation and stenosis of a renohepatic by-pass in one case. Conclusion We present our management algorithm of PAAAs.

Alcohol consumption was positively correlated with PAL at baseline but had no effect on PAL at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed the importance of sports participation in maintaining PAL during challenging situations, such as the COVID‑19 lockdown. The substance-specific influence of SUM on PAL before and during the lockdown points to evident social and cultural aspects of SUM behaviors in adolescents. Further studies evidencing the cumulative effects of PAL decline during the lockdown are warranted.","Gilic, Barbara; Zenic, Natasa; Separovic, Vlatko; Jurcev Savicevic, Anamarija; Sekulic, Damir",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,523,29

OBJECTIVE To assess the association between influenza vaccination status and hospitalization for community-acquired laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study was a prospective observational multicenter study of hospitalizations for community-acquired pneumonia conducted from January 2010 through June 2012 at 4 US sites. In this case-control study, we used EPIC data from patients 6 months or older with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection and verified vaccination status during the influenza seasons and excluded patients with recent hospitalization, from chronic care residential facilities, and with severe immunosuppression. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios, comparing the odds of vaccination between influenza-positive (case) and influenza-negative (control) patients with pneumonia, controlling for demographics, comorbidities, season, study site, and timing of disease onset. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1 - adjusted odds ratio) × 100%. EXPOSURE Influenza vaccination, verified through record review. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Influenza pneumonia, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. RESULTS Overall, 2767 patients hospitalized for pneumonia were eligible for the study; 162 (5.9%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Twenty-eight of 162 cases (17%) with influenza-associated pneumonia and 766 of 2605 controls (29%) with influenza-negative pneumonia had been vaccinated. The adjusted odds ratio of prior influenza vaccination between cases and controls was 0.43 (95% CI, 0.28-0.68; estimated vaccine effectiveness, 56.7%; 95% CI, 31.9%-72.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children and adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, those with laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pneumonia, compared with those with pneumonia not associated with influenza, had lower odds of having received influenza vaccination.","Grijalva, Carlos G; Zhu, Yuwei; Williams, Derek J; Self, Wesley H; Ampofo, Krow; Pavia, Andrew T; Stockmann, Chris R; McCullers, Jonathan; Arnold, Sandra R; Wunderink, Richard G; Anderson, Evan J; Lindstrom, Stephen; Fry, Alicia M; Foppa, Ivo M; Finelli, Lyn; Bramley, Anna M; Jain, Seema; Griffin, Marie R; Edwards, Kathryn M",JAMA,523,19

It is more accurate than radiography for this purpose and is considered to be the reference modality for imaging the feline kidney, providing excellent visualisation of renal size, shape and internal architecture. Compared with more advanced imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography is more accessible, less expensive, does not require general anaesthesia and allows real-time procedures to be performed. CLINICAL CHALLENGES On ultrasound examination, focal or multifocal disorders may be readily identified, but diffuse changes are more challenging. B-mode ultrasonography is of limited use for differentiating between benign and malignant focal lesions. However, based on the presence and pattern of vascularity as an indicator of malignancy, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography allows distinction between benign and malignant focal renal lesions. AUDIENCE This review provides a framework for the ultrasonographic approach to feline renal and perirenal disorders for the general practitioner.

Its consequences are multifaceted and refer to individual and public physical, mental, and economic states. Therefore, viral outbreaks raise many fears and concerns, both among policymakers and individuals. In light of these fears, we explore the central aspects of viral victimization, compared to another significant threat of this century: terrorism. Analysis: There are many similarities between terrorism and the current pandemic which manifest within the physical, economic, social, and psychological aspects of victimization. To address the multidimensional nature of the pandemic's impact we coined the term viruism. Though terrorism and viruism are not the deadliest of threats, they evoke high levels of fear and cause enormous financial, social, and psychological effects. Conclusion: We recommend exploring the psychosocial mechanisms that account for public reaction to viruism. Identifying such mechanisms will contribute to developing more effective practices in managing the fear of viruism and in decreasing its emotional toll.

Diseases are a potential threat for its conservation but to date have been poorly studied. We performed clinical evaluations and investigated the presence of infectious diseases through serology and coprologic tests on maned wolves from Galheiro Natural Private Reserve, Perdizes City, Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil. Fifteen wolves were captured between 2003 and 2008. We found high prevalences of antibody to canine distemper virus (CDV; 13/14), canine parvovirus (CPV; 4/14), canine adenovirus type 2 (13/14), canine coronavirus (5/11), canine parainfluenza virus (5/5), and Toxoplasma gondii (6/8), along with Ancylostomidae eggs in all feces samples. Antibodies against Leishmania sp. were found in one of 10 maned wolves, and all samples were negative for Neospora caninum. Evidence of high exposure to these viral agents was also observed in unvaccinated domestic dogs from neighboring farms. High prevalence of viral agents and parasites such as CDV, CPV, and Ancylostomidae indicates that this population faces considerable risk of outbreaks and chronic debilitating parasites. This is the first report of exposure to canine parainfluenza virus in Neotropical free-ranging wild canids. Our findings highlight that canine pathogens pose a serious hazard to the viability of maned wolves and other wild carnivore populations in the area and emphasize the need for monitoring and protecting wildlife health in remaining fragments of the Cerrado biome.","de Almeida Curi, Nelson Henrique; Coelho, Carlyle Mendes; de Campos Cordeiro Malta, Marcelo; Magni, Elisa Maria Vaz; Sábato, Marco Aurelio Lima; Araújo, Amanda Soriano; Lobato, Zelia Inês Portela; Santos, Juliana Lúcia Costa; Santos, Hudson Andrade; Ragozo, Alessandra Alves Mara; de Souza, Silvio Luís Pereira",Journal of wildlife diseases,523,25

However, there is a lack of consensus in favor of or against NRS use due to the risks of worsening hypoxemia, intubation delay, and aerosols environmental contamination associated with the use of these tools. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the use of NRS in adult patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia (i.e. H1N1, SARS, MERS) and AHRF. We also searched for studies evaluating the risk of aerosolization/contamination with these tools. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION We searched MEDLINE, PubMed EMBASE and two major preprint servers (biorXiv and medRxiv) from inception to April 14, 2020, for studies on the use of respiratory support in AHRF and viral pneumonia. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The search identified 4086 records and we found only one randomized controlled trial out of 58 studies included, with great variabilities in support utilization and failure rates. Fifteen studies explored the issue of aerosolization/contamination showing a high risk of airborne transmission via droplets generation during the use of these modalities. CONCLUSIONS Use of NRS and treatment failure in the context of COVID-19 and viral infection associated-AHRF, varied widely. Dispersion of exhaled air is different depending on the type of respiratory therapies and interfaces.

DESIGN Continuing, prospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3). SETTING University teaching, research hospital, and a tertiary care center. PATIENTS We performed the SPA-LAVH in 24 patients from May 6, 2008, through October 8, 2008. INTERVENTIONS All cases of SPA-LAVH were performed by a single surgeon (T. J. K.). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We analyzed the data to determine the outcome of SPA-LAVH and compared the initial 10 cases (group A) and the latter 14 cases (group B) to consider the learning curve. Median and range are used to describe non-normal data. A total of 24 consecutive patients have undergone SPA-LAVH, for benign gynecologic conditions, including 16 uterine myomas and 8 cases of adenomyosis, regardless of body mass index or previous abdominal or pelvic surgery. All cases but 3 were performed exclusively through a single port. The median operative time, weight of the uterus, and estimated blood loss were 119 minutes (range 90 to 255 minutes), 347 g (range 225 to 732 g), and 400 mL (range 100 to 1000 mL), respectively. The decline in hemoglobin from before surgery to postoperative day 1 was from 0.7 to 4.3 g/dL, with a median of 2.05 g/dL. The median hospital stay (postoperative day) was 3 days (range 3 to 7). When we compared the operative outcomes between the 2 groups, there was a tendency toward a decreased operative time in group B, although the difference was not significant. However, there was a significant decrease in the estimated blood loss and hospital stay in group B (p = .00, = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION The SPA-LAVH was safe and effective, and the procedure could be learned over a short period of time.

As a result, stent- and balloon-assisted coiling are instead performed to treat morphologically complex aneurysms, which include giant, wide-necked, and fusiform aneurysms. While these techniques have had success in treating these complex aneurysms, recanalization rates associated with these techniques are still problematic. In the constant effort to improve the outcome of complex aneurysm treatment, flow-diverting stents (FDSs) have emerged in recent years as the preferred treatment. Instead of directly obstructing the flow of blood into the aneurysmal sac, as is the case for stent- and balloon-assisted coiling, FDSs are placed in the parent blood vessel to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm itself. Subsequent to the diverting away of blood from the aneurysm, a thrombotic cascade ensues that ultimately results in the closure of the aneurysm while the parent vessel's perforators are preserved. Current known risks for this procedure include vessel rupture or perforation, in-stent thrombosis, perforator occlusion, procedural or delayed hemorrhages, and perianeurysmal edema. In this review, we will evaluate the mechanisms of actions, clinical applications, complications, and ongoing studies for FDSs.","Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Amuluru, Krishna; Francisco, Gomez; Dodson, Vincent; El-Ghanem, Mohammad; Prestigiacomo, Charles J; Gandhi, Chirag D",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,523,26

METHODS AND MATERIALS From 2011 to 2016, 123 patients with treatment-naïve single subcapsular HCC (≤ 2.5 cm) who underwent RFA were retrospectively included. Patients were divided into two groups according to AA infusion. After RFA, medical records were used to analyze pain scores during a 24-h period and to determine the opioid used that compared using Mann-Whitney U test. We also conducted subgroup analysis of the patients with HCCs located adjacent to parietal peritoneum. After follow-up period, we analyzed local tumor progression (LTP) and recurrence-free survival using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS AA was infused in 76 patients (61.8%, 76/123). Pain score using numeric rating scale (NRS) was significantly lower in AA infusion group than in control group (2.54 ± 2.8 vs. 3.66 ± 3.2, p = 0.048). Dose of opioids used was not significantly different between two groups (1.62 ± 3.4 mg vs. 1.66 ± 3 mg, p = 0.698). However, in subgroup analysis (N = 45), NRS score and dose of opioids used were significantly lower in AA infusion group (p = 0.03, p = 0.032, respectively). LTP rate was not significantly different between two groups (p = 0.673). CONCLUSION AA infusion was an effective and safe way to reduce pain when performing RFA for subcapsular HCC. In particular, in patients with subcapsular HCC adjacent to parietal peritoneum, dose of opioid to use pain control was significantly lower with AA infusion.","Park, Sae-Jin; Lee, Dong Ho; Han, Joon Koo",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,523,24

ISG15 has antiviral activity against a number of viruses; therefore, we examined the effect of ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) in a model of acute viral hepatitis induced by the murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) coronavirus. Mice deficient in the ISG15 deconjugating enzyme, ubiquitin-specific peptidase-18 (USP18), accumulate high levels of ISG15-conjugated proteins and are hypersensitive to type I IFN. Infecting USP18(-/-) mice with MHV-3 resulted in extended survival (8 ± 1.2 versus 4 days) and in improved liver histology, a decreased inflammatory response, and viral titers 1 to 2 logs lower than in USP18(+/+) mice. The suppression of viral replication was not due to increased IFN since infected USP18(-/-) mice had neither increased hepatic IFN-α, -β, or -γ mRNA nor circulating protein. Instead, delayed MHV-3 replication coincided with high levels of cellular ISGylation. Decreasing ISGylation by knockdown of the ISG15 E1 enzyme, Ube1L, in primary USP18(+/+) and USP18(-/-) hepatocytes led to increased MHV-3 replication. Both in vitro and in vivo, increasing MHV-3 titers were coincident with increased PLP2 mRNA and decreased ISGylation over the course of infection. The pharmacologic inhibition of the PLP2 enzyme in vitro led to decreased MHV-3 replication. Overall, these results demonstrate the antiviral effect of ISGylation in an in vivo model of coronavirus-induced mouse hepatitis and illustrate that PLP2 manipulates the host innate immune response through the ISG15/USP18 pathway. IMPORTANCE There have been a number of serious worldwide pandemics due to widespread infections by coronavirus. This virus (in its many forms) is difficult to treat, in part because it is very good at finding ""holes"" in the way that the host (the infected individual) tries to control and eliminate the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that an important host viral defense-the ISG15 pathway-is only partially effective in controlling severe coronavirus infection. Activation of the pathway is very good at suppressing viral production, but over time the virus overwhelms the host response and the effects of the ISG15 pathway. These data provide insight into host-virus interactions during coronavirus infection and suggest that the ISG15 pathway is a reasonable target for controlling severe coronavirus infection although the best treatment will likely involve multiple pathways and targets.","Ma, Xue-Zhong; Bartczak, Agata; Zhang, Jianhua; He, Wei; Shalev, Itay; Smil, David; Chen, Limin; Phillips, Jim; Feld, Jordan J; Selzner, Nazia; Levy, Gary; McGilvray, Ian",Journal of virology,523,28

However, a relatively high-energy (26 000-30 000 cm-1) M-to-M' charge transfer can be identified. One-electron oxidation is largely localized on the {M(C[triple bond, length as m-dash]CR)(PP)Cp'} fragment and gives rise to a new charge transfer band with bridging-ligand-to-{M(PP)Cp'}+ (M'(CO)xCp' = Fe(CO)2Cp) or M'-to-M(+) (M(CO)xCp' = W(CO)3Cp*) character. The localized electronic ground state of these complexes is better revealed through analysis of the IR spectra, taking advantage of the well-resolved ν(C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C) and ν(CO) bands and IR spectroelectrochemical methods, than through the more classical analysis based on the concepts of Marcus-Hush theory and analysis of the putative IVCT electronic transition.

The primary outcome was a GDMT optimization score, the net of positive (+1 for new initiations or up-titrations) & negative therapeutic changes (-1 for discontinuations or down-titrations) at hospital discharge. Serious in-hospital safety events were assessed. Among 278 consecutive encounters with HFrEF, 118 met eligibility criteria; 29 (25%) received usual care and 89 (75%) received the GDMT Team intervention. Among usual care encounters, there were no changes in GDMT prescription during hospitalization. In the intervention group, β-blocker (72% to 88%; P=0.01), ARNI (6% to 17%; P=0.03), MRA (16% to 29%; P=0.05), and triple therapy (9% to 26%; P<0.01) prescriptions increased during hospitalization. After adjustment, the GDMT Team was associated with an increase in GDMT optimization score (+0.58; 95% CI: +0.09 to +1.07; P=0.02). There were no serious in-hospital adverse events. CONCLUSIONS Non-cardiovascular hospitalizations are a potentially safe and effective setting for GDMT optimization. A virtual GDMT Team was associated with improved HF therapeutic optimization. This implementation strategy warrants testing in a prospective randomized controlled trial. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the proportion of people who participate in the recommended amount of physical activity is low, with common barriers including competing interests and inclement weather. In people with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions, participation in physical activity is reduced further by disease-specific barriers; time-burden of treatment and unpleasant symptoms during physical activity. Addressing these barriers during adolescence and early adulthood may promote greater physical activity participation into older age. The aim of this review was, in people aged 15 to 45 years with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions, to classify interventions aimed at optimising participation in physical activity as 'promising' or 'not promising', and categorise the behaviour change techniques (BCTs) within these interventions. Nine databases and registries were searched (October 2017) for studies that reported objective measures of physical activity before and after an intervention period. Interventions were classified as 'promising' if a between-group difference in physical activity was demonstrated. Michie et al.'s (2013) v1 Taxonomy was used to unpack the BCTs within interventions. Across the six included studies (n = 396 participants), 19 (20%) of 93 BCTs were described. The interventions of three studies were classified as 'promising'. The most commonly used BCTs comprised goal setting, action planning and social support. Five BCTs were solely used in 'promising' interventions. Our review demonstrated that only 20% of BCTs have been utilised and isolated those BCTs that were used only in 'promising' physical activity interventions in adolescents and adults with chronic cardiorespiratory conditions.

Our objective was to estimate the association between serum concentrations of antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E) and markers of oxidative stress (F2-isoprostane) with symptoms and severity of PMS. METHODS The BioCycle study was a prospective cohort study following 259 healthy premenopausal women aged 18-44 years for up to 2 menstrual cycles. Frequency/severity of 20 PMS symptoms were assessed via questionnaires 4 times/cycle, and antioxidant vitamins and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured up to 8 times/cycle to correspond with specific cycle phases. Generalized linear models were used to estimate associations between mean antioxidant concentrations and oxidative stress biomarkers with PMS symptoms and severity; linear mixed models were used to evaluate associations with symptom severity scores within groups (e.g. depression, cravings, pain). RESULTS Higher concentrations of serum antioxidant vitamins were largely not associated with prevalence or severity of PMS symptoms. Though a few associations were observed, only associations between mean γ-tocopherol and decreased odds of swelling of the hands/feet survived adjustment for multiple comparisons (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16, 0.65, per ug/dL). However, F2-isoprostanes were associated with prevalence and severity of several symptoms specifically related to depression and cravings (depression score β = 0.07, 95% CI 0.02, 0.12, per 10 ug/dL; cravings score β = 0.16, 95% CI 0.10, 0.22, per 10 ug/dL), as well as with classification of PMS severity (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14, per 10 pg/dL), with these associations surviving adjustment for false discovery rate. CONCLUSIONS F2-isoprostanes, but not antioxidant vitamins, were associated with select PMS symptoms, as well as symptom and severity categories. Specific symptom relationships merit further research.","Frankel, Robyn A; Michels, Kara A; Kim, Keewan; Kuhr, Daniel L; Omosigho, Ukpebo R; Wactawski-Wende, Jean; Levine, Lindsay; Perkins, Neil J; Mumford, Sunni L",BMC women's health,523,31

Using the well-known laboratory/psychometric high-risk approach, the present study investigated the associations between nonpsychotic perceptual aberrations measured at age 18, in individuals with no prior history of psychosis, and clinical psychotic symptom outcomes 17 years later in midlife (middle 30s). Clinical assessments for hallucinations and delusions were completed for 191 adults (95% of the original sample) in the follow-up study. Elevated perceptual aberrations at age 18 predicted increased levels of hallucinations, delusions, and total psychotic symptoms in midlife as well as psychotic illness. The associations between baseline perceptual aberrations and later psychotic symptoms were not accounted for by general nonspecific psychopathology factors such as anxiety or depression present at age 18. Early detection of subtle, nonpsychotic forms of perceptual disturbance may aid in identifying individuals at increased risk for nonaffective psychosis outcomes in adulthood. Perceptual aberrations may constitute a useful endophenotype for genetic, neurobiological, and cognitive neuroscience investigations of schizophrenia liability.

In the current research, we use social psychological theory to better understand what motivates vegans to engage in collective action on behalf of this social group - that is, what motivates individuals to promote, or encourage others to adopt, a vegan lifestyle. We develop and test a Social Identity Model of Vegan Activism, which highlights the roles of individuals' social identities, sense of efficacy, emotions and moral convictions in fostering collective action. In two pre-registered studies, the first with self-identified vegans from Australia and the UK (N = 351), and the second with self-identified vegans recruited via Prolific (N = 340), we found that individuals more frequently engaged in vegan activism (i.e., actions to promote vegan lifestyles) when they had stronger moral convictions (i.e., deontological or consequentialist), greater collective efficacy (i.e., beliefs that vegans can make a positive difference), anger (i.e., when thinking about the reasons why they are vegan), and identification (both with vegans, and with animals). Deontological and consequentialist moral convictions had significant indirect effects on vegan activism via different mediators. We conclude by discussing the implications and importance of studying dietary behavior from a social identity perspective, including its ability to help explain how and why individuals become motivated to not only adopt a certain (e.g., vegan) lifestyle themselves, but to also 'act collectively' on behalf of that shared group membership (e.g., promote vegan-friendly behaviors).

The posttranslational modification of proteins has primarily been studied in cells and tissues in an intra-proteomic context (where both substrates and enzymes are part of the same species). However, the inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications of most of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by the host enzymes and vice versa are largely unexplored in virus pathogenesis and in the host immune response. It is now known that the structural spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 undergoes proteolytic priming by the host serine proteases for entry into the host cells, and N- and O-glycosylation by the host cell enzymes during virion packaging, which enable the virus to spread. New evidence suggests that both SARS-CoV-2 and the host proteins undergo inter-proteomic posttranslational modifications, which play roles in virus pathogenesis and infection-induced immune response by hijacking the host cell signaling. The purpose of this minireview is to bring attention of the scientific community to recent cutting-edge discoveries in this understudied area. It is likely that a better insight into the molecular mechanisms involved may open new research directions, and thereby contribute to novel therapeutic modality development against the SARS-CoV-2. Here we briefly discuss the rationale and touch upon some unanswered questions in this context, especially those that require attention from the scientific community.","Mishra, Suresh; Bassi, Geetika; Nyomba, Bl Grégoire",Experimental biology and medicine,523,1

We aimed to compare functional status after 3 months in patients treated with intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) and those treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone in Joinville, Brazil. From the Joinville Stroke Registry, we extracted and compared all consecutive IVT patients treated with r-tPA within 4.5 h in the period 2009-2011 versus all consecutive IAT treated within 6 h with the Solitaire FR device plus IVT in the period 2012-2014. We registered 82 patients in the IVT group and 31 patients in the IAT group. At hospital admission, patients in the IAT group were significantly younger (p < 0.001), had a higher educational level (p = 0.001), had a slightly higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.057) and had more severe strokes measured by the NIH stroke scale (p = 0.011).

We aimed to analyze gender-specific anticoagulant prescription patterns early following the introduction of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in a large, global registry on atrial fibrillation. METHODS The Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (GLORIA-AF) is an international registry program involving patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (<3 months from arrhythmia onset). We used data from 15,092 consecutive patients (median age, 71.0 years; 45.5% were women) enrolled between 2011 and 2014. Globally, 79.7% of women and 80.2% of men were anticoagulated; the absolute between-gender difference in prevalence of anticoagulant use was -0.5% (95% confidence interval, -1.8% to 0.8%). Vitamin K antagonists were prescribed to 32.8% and 31.9% (NOACs 46.8% and 48.3%) of women and men, respectively. RESULTS No confounder for the association between gender and anticoagulant prescription was identified. Between-gender differences in anticoagulant use (lower use in women compared with men by decreasing order of magnitude of the difference) were found for CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex category [female]) score = 1; CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke) score = 0; previous bleeding; age <65 years; no history of hypertension; myocardial infarction; coronary artery disease; North America region; and specialist office setting. CONCLUSION Globally, the prevalence of anticoagulant use is similar in women and men.

We assessed the impact of COVID-19 related societal restrictions and lockdown on trauma admissions to single Level 1 Trauma Center in Westmead, Australia. We hypothesized that the number of trauma admissions would decrease and number of admissions due to self-harm and assault (specifically domestic violence) would increase. METHODS Data was collected from the prospectively maintained Westmead Hospital Trauma Registry. The primary outcome compared the average number of trauma admissions during March and April during years 2016 to 2020. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze means. Pairwise differences among group means were evaluated with Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. Secondary outcomes compared were in-hospital interventions and patient outcomes. RESULTS There was a 23-34% decrease (p value 0.018) in the mean monthly average trauma admissions during March/April 2020 compared with previous years 2016-2019. Additionally, there was a 40-52% decrease (p value 0.025) and 13-29% decrease (p value 0.020) in admissions due to road traffic collisions and falls respectively. CONCLUSIONS There was a significant decrease in the overall number of trauma related admissions during the COVID-19 related period of societal restrictions and lockdown. This was due to a decrease in minor traumas, falls and road traffic collisions. There was no difference in the number of admissions secondary to major traumas, self-harm or assault.

Qualitative faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) have been used for suspected CRC in Sweden since the mid-2000s, but evidence regarding their effectiveness is scarce. Anaemia and thrombocytosis are both associated with CRC. AIM To evaluate the usefulness of qualitative FITs requested for symptomatic patients in primary care, alone and combined with findings of anaemia and thrombocytosis, in the diagnosis of CRC. DESIGN AND SETTING A population-based cohort study using electronic health records and data from the Swedish Cancer Register, covering five Swedish regions. METHOD Patients aged ≥18 years in the five regions who had provided FITs requested by primary care practitioners from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015 were identified. FIT and blood-count data were registered and all CRC diagnoses made within 2 years were retrieved. Diagnostic measurements were calculated. RESULTS In total, 15 789 patients provided FITs (four different brands); of these patients, 304 were later diagnosed with CRC. Haemoglobin levels were available for 13 863 patients, and platelet counts for 10 973 patients. Calculated for the different FIT brands only, the sensitivities for CRC were 81.6%-100%; specificities 65.7%-79.5%; positive predictive values 4.7%-8.1%; and negative predictive values 99.5%-100%. Calculated for the finding of either a positive FIT or anaemia, the sensitivities increased to 88.9-100%. Adding thrombocytosis did not further increase the diagnostic performance. CONCLUSION Qualitative FITs requested in primary care seem to be useful as rule-in tests for referral when CRC is suspected. A negative FIT and no anaemia indicate a low risk of CRC.","Högberg, Cecilia; Gunnarsson, Ulf; Jansson, Stefan; Thulesius, Hans; Cronberg, Olof; Lilja, Mikael",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,523,1

METHODS The authors evaluated the surgical outcomes of SPA laparoscopic cystectomy in 293 patients and SPA laparoscopic myomectomy in 246 patients. The surgical outcomes comprised operation time, the amount of blood loss during the operation, the change in hemoglobin (before and after the operation), the change in hematocrit (before and after the operation), switching to the multi-port access method, complications, transfusions, and the duration of the postoperative hospital stay. RESULTS The Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman correlation coefficient between the operation time and the amount of blood loss were 0.312 and 0.321 for SPA laparoscopic cystectomy, respectively, and 0.706 and 0.674 for SPA laparoscopic myomectomy, respectively. The drops in hemoglobin and hematocrit were 1.33±0.78 g/dL and 4.14%±2.45%, respectively, in SPA laparoscopic cystectomy, while the corresponding figures were 1.34±1.13 g/dL and 4.17%±3.24% in SPA laparoscopic myomectomy, respectively.

One assumption is that when unemployment is high people are more likely to work while being sick (discipline hypothesis). Against this background, we investigate the association between regional unemployment and sickness presenteeism. Second, we study interactions with factors of occupational disadvantage. METHODS We combined survey data of 20 974 employees collected 2015 in 232 regions from 35 European countries with data on regional unemployment rates obtained from Eurostat. Presenteeism was assessed by the fraction of days worked while ill among all days with illness (presenteeism propensity). To investigate if unemployment was related to presenteeism, we estimated multi-level models (individuals nested in regions) that were adjusted for socio-demographic and occupational covariates to account for compositional differences of the regions. RESULTS The mean presenteeism propensity was 34.8 (SD 40.4), indicating that workers chose presenteeism in 1 out of 3 days with sickness. We found that a change in unemployment by +10 percentage points was associated with a change in presenteeism by +5 percentage points (95% CI 1.2 to 8.6). This relationship was more pronounced among workers with low salary, low skill-level, and industrial and healthcare workers. CONCLUSION Our results support the assumption that high unemployment elevates presenteeism, and that people in disadvantaged occupations are particularly affected. Policies managing presenteeism should consider the labour market context, particularly during the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reuter, Marvin; Dragano, Nico; Wahrendorf, Morten",Journal of epidemiology and community health,523,20

Quantitative DCE parameter analysis was performed for the placenta and fetal kidneys of three groups of pregnant C57BL/6 mice: 1) mice that were exposed to Fi(O(2)) = 12% between E15.5 and E18.5, 2) mice in normoxia with food restriction similar to the intake of hypoxic mice between E15.5 and E18.5, and 3) mice in normoxia that were fed ad libitum. After imaging, we assessed fetoplacental weight, placental histology, and gene expression. We found that dams exposed to hypoxia exhibited fetal growth restriction (weight reduction by 28% and 14%, respectively, P < 0.05) with an increased placental-to-fetal ratio. By using MRI-based assessment of placental contrast agent kinetics, referenced to maternal paraspinous muscle, we found decreased placental clearance of contrast media in hypoxic mice, compared with either control group (61%, P < 0.05). This was accompanied by diminished contrast accumulation in the hypoxic fetal kidneys (23%, P < 0.05), reflecting reduced transplacental gadolinium transport. These changes were associated with increased expression of placental Phlda2 and Gcm1 transcripts. Exposure to hypoxia near the end of mouse pregnancy reduces placental perfusion and clearance of contrast. MRI-based DCE imaging provides a novel tool for dynamic, in vivo assessment of placental function.","Tomlinson, Tracy M; Garbow, Joel R; Anderson, Jeff R; Engelbach, John A; Nelson, D Michael; Sadovsky, Yoel","American journal of physiology.

Benefits of the minimally invasive approach over traditional open surgery have been well demonstrated in terms of minimal perioperative morbidity and reduced postoperative pain and hospital stay duration, with consequent quick postoperative recovery (Medeiros et al. (2009)). Single-port surgery resurfaced in gynaecology surgery in recent years and renewed interest among other surgeons and within the industry to develop this field (Podolsky et al. (2009)). Patient satisfaction is emerging as an increasingly important measure of quality which represents a complex entity that is dependent on patient demographics, comorbidities, disease, and, to a large extent, patient expectations (Tomlinson and Ko (2006)). It can be broadly thought to refer to all relevant experiences and processes associated with health care delivery (Jackson et al. (2001)). In this study we aim to compare single-port surgery (SPS) with conventional laparoscopy in terms of patient satisfaction using the EORTC IN-PATSAT32 questionnaire. We also evaluate the main surgical outcomes of both minimally invasive approaches.","Buda, Alessandro; Cuzzocrea, Marco; Montanelli, Luca; Passoni, Paolo; Bargossi, Lorena; Baldo, Romina; Locatelli, Luca; Milani, Rodolfo",Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy,523,7

It is unclear what is being done in actual practice. The purpose of this study was to report practice patterns for treatment of inguinal hernias among Quebec surgeons, and to identify factors that may be associated with the choice of operative approach. METHODS We studied a population-based cohort of patients who underwent an inguinal hernia repair between 2007 and 2011 in Quebec, Canada. A generalized linear model was used to identify predictors associated with the selection of a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS 49,657 inguinal hernias were repaired by 478 surgeons. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) was used in 8 % of all cases. LIHR was used to repair 28 % of bilateral hernias, 10 % of recurrent hernias, 6 % of unilateral hernias, and 4 % of incarcerated hernias. 268 (56 %) surgeons did not perform any laparoscopic repairs, and 11 (2 %) surgeons performed more than 100 repairs. These 11 surgeons performed 61 % of all laparoscopic cases. Patient factors significantly associated with having LIHR included younger age, fewer comorbidities, bilateral hernias, and recurrent hernias. CONCLUSION An open approach is favored for all clinical scenarios, even for situations where published guidelines recommend a laparoscopic approach. Surgeons remain divided on the best technique for inguinal hernia repair: while more than half never perform LIHR, the small proportion who perform many use the technique for a large proportion of their cases. There appears to be a gap between the best practices put forth in guidelines and what surgeons are doing in actual practice. Identification of barriers to the broader uptake of LIHR may help inform the design of educational programs to train those who have the desire to offer this technique for certain cases, and have the volume to overcome the learning curve.","Trevisonno, M; Kaneva, P; Watanabe, Y; Fried, G M; Feldman, L S; Andalib, A; Vassiliou, M C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,523,4

The purpose of this review is to update the use of MIS in pediatric oncological surgery over the past five years. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review of papers published between 2009 and 2014 focusing on indications and results of the technique. RESULTS New indications in Wilms tumor, pheochromocytoma, and lung nodules have emerged, thanks to the growing use of MIS in benign urological and thoracic surgery with satisfactory results. Case control studies comparing MIS to open approach have been published for the first time in more classical indications such as neurogenic tumors, while robot-assisted procedure has shown concern in results about its early experience in solid tumors. CONCLUSION MIS is a promising method for removal of thoracic and abdominal malignancies as long as oncological principles are strictly followed.

We describe the development of a reusable public health data analytics system for reuse of clinical data to evaluate the health burden, disparities, and impact of COVID-19 on populations served by health centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Multi-State Data Strategy engaged project partners to assess public health readiness and COVID-19 data challenges. An infrastructure for data capture and sharing procedures between health centers and public health agencies was developed to support existing capabilities and data capacities to respond to the pandemic. RESULTS Between August 2020 - March 2021, project partners evaluated their data capture and sharing capabilities and reported challenges and preliminary data. Major interoperability challenges included poorly aligned federal, state, and local reporting requirements, lack of unique patient identifiers, lack of access to pharmacy, claims and laboratory data, missing data, and proprietary data standards and extraction methods. DISCUSSION Efforts to access and align project partners' existing health systems data infrastructure in the context of the pandemic highlighted complex interoperability challenges. These challenges remain significant barriers to real-time data analytics and efforts to improve health outcomes and mitigate inequities through data-driven responses. CONCLUSION The reusable public health data analytics system created in the Multi-State Data Strategy can be adapted and scaled for other health center networks to facilitate data aggregation and dashboards for public health, organizational planning and quality improvement and can inform local, state, and national COVID-19 response efforts.","Romero, Lisa; Carneiro, Pedro B; Riley, Catharine; Clark, Hollie; Uy, Raymonde; Park, Michael; Mawokomatanda, Tebitha; Bombard, Jennifer M; Hinckley, Alison; Skapik, Julia",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,523,27

In this study, we sought to explore the psychological distress and COVID-19-related anxiety of pregnant women during the crisis. METHODS Israeli Jewish and Arab pregnant women (n = 336) aged 20-47 completed a set of questionnaires during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. RESULTS The levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties were quite high (much or very much), with the highest regarding public places and transportation (87.5%, 70%, respectively), followed by concerns over the possible infection of other family members and the health of the foetus (71.7%, 70%, respectively), going for pregnancy check-ups (68.7%,), being infected themselves, and the delivery (59.2%, 55.4%, respectively). Although COVID-19-related anxieties were shared by pregnant women characterised by diverse sociodemographic variables, with very small nuances, Arab women were more anxious about each of the issues than Jewish women. DISCUSSION Our findings highlight the importance of assessing anxiety and distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the need to be attentive to the double stress of pregnant women in times of crisis and to the potential vulnerability of subgroups, such as cultural minorities.","Taubman-Ben-Ari, Orit; Chasson, Miriam; Abu Sharkia, Salam; Weiss, Efrat",Journal of reproductive and infant psychology,523,1

Nevertheless, there are no systematic reviews examining the global prevalence of personality disorders.AimsTo calculate the worldwide prevalence of personality disorders and examine whether rates vary between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHOD We systematically searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed from January 1980 to May 2018 to identify articles reporting personality disorder prevalence rates in community populations (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017065094). RESULTS A total of 46 studies (from 21 different countries spanning 6 continents) satisfied inclusion criteria. The worldwide pooled prevalence of any personality disorder was 7.8% (95% CI 6.1-9.5). Rates were greater in high-income countries (9.6%, 95% CI 7.9-11.3%) compared with LMICs (4.3%, 95% CI 2.6-6.1%). In univariate meta-regressions, significant heterogeneity was partly attributable to study design (two-stage v. one-stage assessment), county income (high-income countries v. LMICs) and interview administration (clinician v. trained graduate). In multiple meta-regression analysis, study design remained a significant predictor of heterogeneity. Global rates of cluster A, B and C personality disorders were 3.8% (95% CI 3.2, 4.4%), 2.8% (1.6, 3.7%) and 5.0% (4.2, 5.9%). CONCLUSIONS Personality disorders are prevalent globally. Nevertheless, pooled prevalence rates should be interpreted with caution due to high levels of heterogeneity.

Telehealth can increase the diversity of people who take part in research. This matters because most autism spectrum disorder studies have included people who have resources, are White, and live in North America and Europe. When study participants are similar, it is hard to understand which interventions can help different types of people who live in different parts of the world. While telehealth may allow more people to take part in research, it needs to ""fit"" the local context and consider the ""digital divide"" because many people around the world have no access to computers and the Internet. This short report describes changes to two research studies that include caregiver coaching based on the Early Start Denver Model in the United States and South Africa. We describe how the local context, including technology and Internet access, guided the telehealth approach. By doing so, we highlight ways to make telehealth available to more people around the world. The pandemic can help us understand how telehealth can ""fit"" diverse places and support high-quality research. It is important that study changes are tracked and we assess how well the changes work. COVID-19 telehealth changes to caregiver coaching can result in new ways to reach more people around the world.","Franz, Lauren; Howard, Jill; Viljoen, Marisa; Sikich, Linmarie; Chandrasekhar, Tara; Kollins, Scott H; Lee, Lawrence; Ndlovu, Minkateko; Sabatos-DeVito, Maura; Seris, Noleen; Shabalala, Nokuthula; Spanos, Marina; de Vries, Petrus J; Dawson, Geraldine",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,523,31

We adopted the technique of totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and transvaginal extraction in women who required right colon resection. METHODS Over a 2-year period, 14 women were scheduled for totally laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis and transvaginal colon removal. The indications for surgery included malignant (n=9) and benign (n=5) right-side colon pathology. RESULTS The procedure was accomplished laparoscopically in all patients. In 1 patient, the transvaginal removal was not possible because of a large tumor mass. The American Society of Anesthesiology was III in 13 and II in 1 patient. The mean body mass index was 31.65. Seventy-eight percent of patients had undergone abdominal surgery previously. The mean size of the lesion was 3.75 cm (range, 1.8 to 8.0 cm) and the mean number of lymph nodes was 18.7 (range, 8 to 37). All margins in the resected specimens were macroscopically and microscopically free of any tumor. One patient needed reoperation for intra-abdominal bleeding, whereas 3 patients developed postoperative ileus. DISCUSSION Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and transvaginal extraction is a safe and effective procedure that can be added to the armamentarium of surgeons performing laparoscopic colon surgery. This technique may provide both an attractive way to reduce abdominal wall morbidity and a bridge to pure natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery for colon surgery.","Awad, Ziad T; Qureshi, Irfan; Seibel, Brent; Sharma, Sunil; Dobbertien, Mark A","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",523,7

The coronavirus-2019 pandemic has brought a new variant of MDRPUs: facial skin irritation or damage associated with extended use of protective personal equipment (PPE), e.g. facemasks and respirators. In this context, we report here a comprehensive experimental evaluation including facial contact forces, skin temperatures and sub-epidermal moisture (SEM) measurements pre/post-PPE usage, to determine how these physiological parameters change under the effects of surgical facemasks and KN95 respirators and whether such potential changes can explain the commonly reported skin irritation or damage. We found that a surgical mask is potentially less irritating to facial skin than the KN95 respirator, as it applies lower forces and facilitates faster return of facial temperatures to their basal levels. Further, we demonstrated that use of dressing cuts for padding under a KN95 respirator considerably reduced localized forces and did not worsen the thermal and SEM readings at the skin-device contact sites. This study provides a basis for improvement of PPE designs, as it describes physiological measurement methodologies for quantitative comparisons of the effects of different PPE types on facial skin status.","Peko, Lea; Ovadia-Blechman, Zehava; Hoffer, Oshrit; Gefen, Amit",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,523,30

C57BL/6 mice were injected with Adenoviruses (Ad)-shTHRIL or negative control (NC) before caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation. MPVECs were transfected with Ad-shTHRIL or NC, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. MiR-424 and Rho-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2) were predicted and verified as direct targets of THRIL and miR-424, respectively, by using dual-luciferase reporter assay. ROCK2 overexpression vector and shTHRIL were co-transfected into mouse pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells for 24 h before LPS treatment. Our results showed that THRIL was highly expressed in the lung of sepsis mice. CLP triggered severe lung injury and apoptosis in mice, which was abolished by THRIL knockdown. Moreover, CLP treatment visibly increased protein concentration, the number of total cell of neutrophils, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Besides, elevated protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 were observed in both lung and BALF. However, inhibition of THRIL reduced the number of inflammatory cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in sepsis mouse model. The effect of THRIL on inflammatory response and apoptosis in the lung was confirmed in sepsis cell model. Moreover, mechanistic studies have shown that THRIL up-regulated ROCK2 level through sponging miR-424. Furthermore, ROCK2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of THRIL knockdown on LPS-induced inflammatory response and apoptosis. Overall, in vivo and in vitro results suggested that THRIL accelerates sepsis-induced lung injury by sponging miR-424 and further restoring ROCK2.","Chen, Huibin; Hu, Xuemei; Li, Ruiting; Liu, Boyi; Zheng, Xiang; Fang, Zhicheng; Chen, Li; Chen, Wei; Min, Li; Hu, Shengli",Molecular immunology,523,23

To perform these procedures, the practitioner needs an extensive knowledge of the anatomy of the nervous system, vasculature, and pathological conditions that affect their physiology. A working knowledge of radiation biology and safety is essential. Similarly, a sufficient volume of clinical and interventional experience, first as a trainee and then as a practitioner, is required so that these treatments can be delivered safely and effectively. METHODS This document has been prepared under the aegis of the Society of Neurological Surgeons and its Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training in conjunction with the Joint Section of Cerebrovascular Surgery for the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons, the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology. RESULTS The material herein outlines the requirements for institutional accreditation of training programs in neuroendovascular surgery, as well as those needed to obtain individual subspecialty certification, as agreed on by Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training, the Society of Neurological Surgeons, and the aforementioned Societies. This document also clarifies the pathway to certification through an advanced practice track mechanism for those current practitioners of this subspecialty who trained before Committee for Advanced Subspecialty Training standards were formulated.

In the absence of an available affordable diagnostic test, detailed clinical history and physical examination are still fundamental to make a diagnosis. METHODS We present five representative cases with KD-like presentation; Systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis, Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, BCGosis and the recently described Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV2. RESULTS Rash, fever and laboratory markers of inflammation can be present in several childhood diseases that may mimic KD. CONCLUSION The term Kawasaki syndrome instead of Kawasaki disease may be more appropriate. Physicians should consider alternate diagnosis that may mimic KD, particularly consider MIS-C during the present pandemic since an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach is needed.","Saez-de-Ocariz, Marimar; Gámez-González, Luisa Berenise; Rivas-Larrauri, Francisco; Castaño-Jaramillo, Lina María; Toledo-Salinas, Carla; Garrido-García, Luis Martín; Ulloa-Gutierrez, Rolando; Santamaría-Piedra, Maydeli; de la Luz Orozco-Covarrubias, María; Scheffler-Mendoza, Selma; Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,523,10

A group of orthopaedic trainees at Royal Gwent Hospital, UK, were redeployed to intensive therapy unit for four weeks during COVID-19 pandemic. This study reviews our experience; focusing on causes of stress and anxiety, and how they were managed. The lessons learnt could be used as a framework for pre-emptive me-asures during future challenges. MATERIAL AND METHODS Orthopaedic registrars were divided into two groups. Seven trainees (Redeployed group) moved to ITU for four weeks to support the critical care team. The other group (Retained group) of eight registrars continued to cover orthopaedic rota. A survey was done for anxiety levels comparing the two groups at three time points during these four weeks. RESULTS Anxiety and stress in the ITU-redeployed group was comparatively less than the continuing group as time progressed during the redeployment. CONCLUSIONS 1. The disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of massive stress and an-xiety for health care workers. 2. Our experience shows that stress is controllable with the correct strategies. 3. The main points are early identification of vulnerable groups, proper induction, active involvement, adequate explanation, appreciation, good communication, and available psychological support whenever needed. 4. These are essential to maintain a resilient workforce against upcoming waves of COVID-19.","Boktor, Joseph; Gwyn, Rhodri; Gonzi, Gianluca; Kumar, Abhijeet; Roy, Kunal; Rooney, Kathryn; Pullen, Huw","Ortopedia, traumatologia, rehabilitacja",523,16

As such, the role of the government and medical institution in preventing public fear and anxiety became prominent. As hypothesized, trust in the institutions is especially relevant to public fear and anxiety during the epidemic crisis. For testing hypotheses involving the role of institutional trust, a telephone survey during the crisis in April 2003 and another telephone survey after the crisis in June 2003 drew data from 9,402 Hong Kong adults for analysis. Results indicate the significant negative effects of trust in the government and trust in the medical institution on anxiety. Supporting the aforementioned hypothesis the effect of institutional trust in the government was significantly more negative on anxiety during the crisis than its aftermath. Hence, the government and medical institution are particularly responsible for anxiety reduction during the crisis.","Cheung, Chau-Kiu; Tse, John Wing-Ling",Social work in public health,523,1

Type I interferon is crucial for control of viral replication and spread in the natural host, but the specific contributions of MDA5 signaling to this pathway as well as to pathogenesis and subsequent immune responses are largely unknown. In this study, we use MHV infection of the liver as a model to demonstrate that MDA5 signaling is critically important for controlling MHV-induced pathology and regulation of the immune response. Mice deficient in MDA5 expression (MDA5(-/-) mice) experienced more severe disease following MHV infection, with reduced survival, increased spread of virus to additional sites of infection, and more extensive liver damage than did wild-type mice. Although type I interferon transcription decreased in MDA5(-/-) mice, the interferon-stimulated gene response remained intact. Cytokine production by innate and adaptive immune cells was largely intact in MDA5(-/-) mice, but perforin induction by natural killer cells and levels of interferon gamma, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in serum were elevated. These data suggest that MDA5 signaling reduces the severity of MHV-induced disease, at least in part by reducing the intensity of the proinflammatory cytokine response. IMPORTANCE Multicellular organisms employ a wide range of sensors to detect viruses and other pathogens. One such sensor, MDA5, detects viral RNA and triggers induction of type I interferons, chemical messengers that induce inflammation and help regulate the immune responses. In this study, we sought to determine the role of MDA5 during infection with mouse hepatitis virus, a murine coronavirus used to model viral hepatitis as well as other human diseases. We found that mice lacking the MDA5 sensor were more susceptible to infection than were mice with MDA5 and experienced decreased survival. Viral replication in the liver was similar in mice with and without MDA5, but liver damage was increased in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that the immune response is causing the damage. Production of several proinflammatory cytokines was elevated in MDA5(-/-) mice, suggesting that MDA5 may be responsible for keeping pathological inflammatory responses in check.","Zalinger, Zachary B; Elliott, Ruth; Rose, Kristine M; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,523,13

However, recent cases of clinical decision-making involving capacitous vulnerable adults have shown that, when it comes to medical law, medical ethics and clinical practice, vulnerability is typically conceived as opposed to autonomy. The first aim of this paper is to detail the problems that arise when the courts and healthcare practitioners respond to the vulnerability of capacitous adults on the basis of such an opposition. It will be shown that not only does the common law approach to vulnerability fail to adequately capture the autonomy of capacitous vulnerable adults, the conception of vulnerability and autonomy in oppositional terms leads to objectionably paternalistic healthcare responses that undermine the autonomy of vulnerable patients as well as clinical and legal interventions that violate their autonomy. In response, the second aim of this paper is to show that the concepts of autonomy and vulnerability are necessarily entwined and, on that basis, the focus should be on promoting the autonomy of capacitous vulnerable adults where possible In order to make this case, the paper explains the limitations of standard approaches to the autonomy of vulnerable adults and, in their place, offers a conception of legitimate, self-authorised autonomy that is fundamentally dependent on intersubjective practices of recognition.","Lewis, Jonathan",Journal of medical ethics,523,16

Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure can rapidly lead to impressive growth of FLR. We describe the technique of an entirely laparoscopic radiofrequency-assisted liver partition with portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (RALPP) in a cirrhotic patient with HCC. PATIENT CONCERNS A 33 year-old female cirrhotic patient with HCC in the right liver was indicated for RALPP as the predicted future liver remnant (FLR) was 21%. DIAGNOSES HCC with liver cirrhosis. INTERVENTIONS The first surgery consisted of ligation of the right portal vein and radiofrequency ablation of the liver without parenchymal transection. Three weeks postoperatively, FLR reached 42%, and the patient underwent right hepatectomy. OUTCOMES Operative times for the both surgeries were 60 and 240 minutes respectively, with negligeable blood loss. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and the FLR reached 53% 1 week after the second procedure. No recurrence occurred at 10 months. LESSONS Laparoscopic RALPP is feasible in some cirrhotic patients with liver cancer that in line with the indications and this method may be a superior choice for selected cirrhotic patients with HCC, as it decreases potential morbidity associated with open surgery.","Rong, Zhixia; Lu, Qian; Yan, Jun",Medicine,523,26

A protocol was developed for performing this procedure in an Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) with extended recovery. METHODS From January 2000 to December 2011, data about all laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs were gathered prospectively. The patients' clinical features, hernia type, intraoperative and postoperative complications and reasons for hospital admission are studied. RESULTS A total of 259 patients have been operated for incisional hernia (185) or recurrent hernioplasty (74) in our ASC. Laparoscopic repair was successful in 254 patients (98.07 %). Conversion to open surgery was necessary in five patients (1.93 %). A total of 50 patients (19.69 %) in whom surgery was completed laparoscopically were discharged the same day of surgery, 179 (70.47 %) at 24 h and 25 (9.84 %) required a stay of over 24 h. Postoperative pain was severe in 10 % of patients, moderate in 40 %, and mild in 50 %. Complications, mostly minor and self-limiting, were observed in 25 patients (9.84 %) during hospital stay. Five major complications that occured were: bile peritonitis, an acute peritonitis, due to an inadvertent intestinal perforation, and one intestinal obstruction by partial detachment of the mesh, an intra-abdominal hematoma and a colo-cutaneous fistula. There were no deaths in the series. The mean follow-up of patients was 29.35 months (range 12-129 months). The recurrence rate was 7.03 % (n = 18). Four trocar-site hernias were detected. CONCLUSIONS It is essential to create a protocol with selection criteria that take into account the patient, his entourage, the anesthetic-surgical procedure, and a team dedicated to surgical laparoscopic surgery in an ASC with extended recovery to achieve good results in terms of morbidity and patient safety.","Lorente-Herce, J M; Marín-Morales, J; Jiménez-Vega, F J; Ruíz-Juliá, M L; Claro-Alves, B M; Fernández-Zulueta, A; Gallardo-García, P A; Marrero-Cantera, S; De Quinta-Frutos, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,523,1

The recent observation by He et al. (Nat. Nanotechnol., 2019, 14, 1042-1047) and Zhang et al. (Nat. Nanotechnol., 2020, 15, 94-98) confirm the presence of the root-growth mode for the growth of lithium dendrites (whiskers, spheres and hillocks). In this work, we introduced a non-Newtonian flow model to describe the flow of lithium in lithium metal and incorporate the contributions of viscous dissipation, surface energy, kinetic energy and strain energy in the analysis of the stress relaxation and the growth of a Li-sphere and a Li-whisker. Nonlinear second-order differential equations are derived for the growth of the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker. Closed-form solutions for the temporal evolution of the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker are obtained under the conditions such that the contributions of the surface energy, kinetic energy and strain energy stored in the cantilever beam to the stress relaxation in the lithium metal are negligible. Using the Lippmann relation in specific surface energy, we demonstrated that increasing the electric potential reduces the resistance to the flow of lithium into the Li-sphere and the Li-whisker. The results reveal the need to suppress the cycling-induced strain energy (misfit strain and biaxial modulus) in order to mitigate the growth of Li dendrites (whiskers, spheres and hillocks).","Yang, Fuqian",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,523,27

METHODS This study retrospectively investigated 201 consecutive patients with Milan criteria HCCs who underwent RFA (RFA group, n = 150) or MWA (MWA group, n = 51) between January 2012 and December 2016. Overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), local tumor control, and treatment-related complications were compared between the two groups. Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS Median follow-up duration was 36.7 months (range: 6.2-64.0 months). Cumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 97.9%, 92.3%, and 80.6% in the MWA group and 96.4%, 87.4%, and 78.2% in the RFA group, respectively, (P = 0.450). Cumulative RFS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93.2%, 74.4%, and 63.7% in the MWA group and 80.3%, 57.3%, and 49.6% in the RFA group, respectively, (P = 0.097). Multivariate analyses showed that variable categories ""patient age above 65 years"" (P = 0.004) and ""more than one tumor"" (P = 0.004) were associated with overall mortality, and ""patient age above 65 years"" (P = 0.048) and ""tumor size greater than 3 cm"" (P = 0.009) were associated with inferior RFS. The incidences of major complications were not significantly different between the two groups (3.3% vs 3.9%, P = 0.843).

This study investigated possible relationships between anti-hypertensive medications use and COVID-19 infection risk in the ambulatory hypertensive population. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study involving 34 936 hypertensive adults >50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) who were retrospectively followed through pandemic period (from 01/03/2020 to 30/04/2020). Two data sets including demographic/clinical characteristics (comorbidities and cardiovascular medications use) and laboratory PCR codes for COVID-19 were linked to construct an anonymized research database.

In conclusion, our data support that receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors does not predispose for suffering COVID-19 infection in ambulatory hypertensive people. Conversely, receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers could be related with a reduced risk.","Vila-Corcoles, Angel; Satue-Gracia, Eva; Ochoa-Gondar, Olga; Torrente-Fraga, Cristina; Gomez-Bertomeu, Frederic; Vila-Rovira, Angel; Hospital-Guardiola, Imma; de Diego-Cabanes, Cinta; Bejarano-Romero, Ferran; Rovira-Veciana, Dolors; Basora-Gallisa, Josep",Journal of clinical hypertension,523,24

Recently a self-gripping mesh has been introduced into clinical practice. This mesh does not need staple fixation and thus might reduce the incidence of chronic pain. This prospective study aimed to compare two groups of patients with bilateral (BIH) or monolateral (MIH) primary or recurrent inguinal hernia treated with TAPP using either a self-gripping polyester and polylactic acid mesh (SGM) or a polypropylene and poliglecaprone mesh fixed with four titanium staples [standard technique (ST)]. METHODS In this study, 96 patients (mean age, 58 years) with BIH (73 patients with primary and recurrent hernia) or MIH (22 patients with recurrent hernia) underwent a TAPP repair. For 49 patients, the repairs used SGM, and for 46 patients, ST was used. The patients were clinically evaluated 1 week and then 30 days postoperatively. After at least 6 months, a phone interview was conducted. The short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire was administered to all the patients at the 6-month follow-up visit. RESULTS The mean length of the procedure was 83 min in the SGM group and 77.5 min in the ST group. The mean follow-up period was 13.8 months (range 1.3-42.0 months) for the SGM group and 18.2 months (range 1.9-27.1 months) for the ST group. The recurrence rate at the last follow-up visit was 0 % in the SGM group and 2.2 % (1 patient) in the ST group. The incidence of mild chronic pain at the 6-month follow-up visit was 4.1 % in the SGM group and 9.1 % in the ST group, and the incidence of moderate or severe pain was respectively 2.1 and 6.8 %. CONCLUSIONS The study population was not large enough to obtain statistically significant results. However, the use of SGM for TAPP repairs appeared to give good results in terms of chronic pain, and the incidence of recurrences was not higher than with ST. In our unit, SGM during TAPP repair of inguinal hernias has become the standard.","Fumagalli Romario, Uberto; Puccetti, Francesco; Elmore, Ugo; Massaron, Simonetta; Rosati, Riccardo",Surgical endoscopy,523,27

Here we propose a simple statistical model that could be used to predict the epidemiological extent of community spread of COVID-19from the explicit data based on optimal ARIMA model estimators. METHODS Raw data was retrieved on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted based on cumulative daily figures of confirmed cases aggregated globally for ten major countries to predict their incidence trend. Statistical analysis was completed by using R 3.5.3 software. RESULTS The optimal ARIMA model having the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) value for US (0,2,0); Spain (1,2,0); France (0,2,1); Germany (3,2,2); Iran (1,2,1); China (0,2,1); Russia (3,2,1); India (2,2,2); Australia (1,2,0) and South Africa (0,2,2) imparted the nowcasting of trends for the upcoming weeks. These parameters are (p, d, q) where p refers to number of autoregressive terms, d refers to number of times the series has to be differenced before it becomes stationary, and q refers to number of moving average terms. Results obtained from ARIMA model showed significant decrease cases in Australia; stable case for China and rising cases has been observed in other countries. CONCLUSION This study tried their best at predicting the possible proliferate of COVID-19, although spreading significantly depends upon the various control and measurement policy taken by each country.","Sandhir, Venuka; Kumar, Vinod; Kumar, Vikash","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",523,1

METHODS We analysed patients with a histologically proven RCC (≤ 7 cm) treated by MWA from April 2012-April 2018. Primary and secondary efficacy, local tumour recurrence (LTR), morbidity and mortality were reported. Efficacy was defined as no residual tumour enhancement on follow-up imaging 1 month after the first ablation (primary efficacy) and after re-ablation(s) for residual disease (secondary efficacy). Adverse events (AE) were registered by the Clavien-Dindo classification and the common terminology criteria for AE. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate a relation among pre-treatment factors incomplete ablation and complications. RESULTS In 100 patients, a total of 108 RCCs (85 T1a and 23 T1b) were treated by MWA. Median size was 3.2 cm (IQR 2.4-4.0). Primary efficacy was 89% (95%CI 0.81-0.94) for T1a lesions and 52% (95%CI 0.31-0.73) for T1b lesions (p < 0.001). Fifteen lesions (7 T1a) were re-ablated for residual disease by MWA in one (n = 13) and two (n = 2, both T1b) sessions resulting in secondary efficacy rates of 99% (T1a) and 95% (T1b, p = 0.352). LTR occurred in four tumours (2 T1a, 2 T1b) after 10-60 months. Six (4%) AEs grade > 3-5 were observed (2 T1a, 4 T1b, p = 0.045). Multivariable analysis showed that mR.E.N.A.L. nephrometry was independently associated with incomplete ablation (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION Microwave ablation is safe and effective for T1a and T1b RCC lesions with a significantly lower primary efficacy for T1b lesions.","Aarts, B M; Prevoo, W; Meier, M A J; Bex, A; Beets-Tan, R G H; Klompenhouwer, E G; Gómez, F M",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,523,1

Nowadays, it is a great threat that claims uncountable lives worldwide. There is no specific chemotherapeutics developed yet to combat COVID-19. Therefore, scientists have been devoted in the quest of the medicine that can cure COVID- 19. OBJECTIVE Existing antivirals such as ASC09/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir with or without umifenovir in combination with antimalarial chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been repurposed to fight the current coronavirus epidemic. But exact biochemical mechanisms of these drugs towards COVID-19 have not been discovered to date. METHOD In-silico molecular docking can predict the mode of binding to sort out the existing chemotherapeutics having a potential affinity towards inhibition of the COVID-19 target. An attempt has been made in the present work to carry out docking analyses of 34 drugs including antivirals and antimalarials to explain explicitly the mode of interactions of these ligands towards the COVID-19protease target. RESULTS 13 compounds having good binding affinity have been predicted towards protease binding inhibition of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Our in silico docking results have been confirmed by current reports from clinical settings through the citation of suitable experimental in vitro data available in the published literature.","Nandi, Sisir; Kumar, Mohit; Saxena, Mridula; Saxena, Anil Kumar",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,523,1

At least 30% to 50% of the complications of donor hepatectomy appear to be related to abdominal wall trauma, including hernia, bowel obstruction, and chronic abdominal discomfort. We analyzed our experience with laparoscopically procured donor hepatectomy. We compared 22 full laparoscopic donor hepatectomies to 20 open/hybrid hepatectomies over an 11-year period. Donor and recipient demographics, complications, and graft and recipient outcomes were analyzed. All 22 laparoscopically procured liver allografts were transplanted successfully. The laparoscopically procured grafts took longer to procure (7 hours 58 minutes versus 6 hours 38 minutes; P < 0.001). The laparoscopically procured cases had lower blood loss (177.3 versus 3753 cc; P < 0.001), a shorter length of stay, and significantly reduced days off work (P = .01).

However, the therapeutic application has been simplistically limited to using antioxidants with little correction of diseases, and many biomarkers of OS, although confirming and quantifying the magnitude of this pathology, are not suggestive of the underlying causes behind generation of a large amount of free radicals. Unfortunately, research has not noted the multi-implication parallel phenomenon of Ihtiraq (Combustion) in Unani Medicine, which possesses much richer etiopathological sub-typing and much more variegated selective and specific treatments (and prophylactics) corresponding to each sub-type of Ihtiraq; the identification of each sub-type's molecular counterparts can be used to develop not only sub-types of OS pathologies and corresponding selective treatments/prophylactics but also non-biomolecular factors. Eminent Unani physicians described a deteriorative phenomenon, which they termed as 'Ihtiraq' which stands for extreme metabolism or 'combustion' and is recognized as a fundamental pathology, contributing as a major factor to the development of chronic diseases. Further, Unani Medicine also possesses a pathophysiological phenomenon called 'Hararat Ghariba' (Unnatural Heat) whose diverse associations with Ihtiraq may be correlatable as upstream, parallel, or downstream associations of OS and consequent pathologies. AIM OF THE STUDY The aim of the study is to: MATERIAL AND METHODS: This review is presented with a noteworthy insight into Unani concepts and a thorough study of classical Unani literature by Ibn Sina (10th century), Zakaria Razi (9th century), Ibn Rushd (12th century), Ibn al-Nafees (13th century), Majusi (10th century), and Jurjani (11th century), and comparative detailed study of modern concepts of OS from literature databases, as well as Google, recent researches, and review articles. RESULT The study showed very close correspondences between the phenomenon, etiopathology, and treatment and prevention of Ihtiraq in Unani Medicine and OS in contemporary biomolecular medicine. It also revealed sub-types of Ihtiraq and corresponding selective Unani treatments and prophylactics including drugs and non-drug factors. CONCLUSION After a comprehensive study and analysis of the most recent researches and classical theories, it can be stated that OS can be seen as a molecular level expression of Ihtiraq. Further, various components of Ihtiraq may be used to hypothesize molecular sub-types of OS and propose corresponding specific interventions.","Kausar, Firdaus; Yusuf Amin, Kunwar Mohammad; Bashir, Showkeen; Parvez, Athar; Ahmad, Pervaiz",Journal of ethnopharmacology,523,1

METHODS A cross-sectional study conducted between May 18 and June 26, 2020, during which HCWs at a large inner-city teaching hospital in NYC received voluntary antibody testing. The main outcome was presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicating previous infection. Seroprevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seropositivity by type and location of work were calculated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Of 2,749 HCWs tested, 831 tested positive, yielding a crude seroprevalence of 30.2% (95% CI, 29%-32%). Seroprevalence ranged from 11.1% for pharmacy staff to 44.0% for nonclinical HCWs comprised of patient transporters and housekeeping and security staff, with 37.5% for nurses and 20.9% for administrative staff. Compared to administrative staff, aORs (95% CIs) for seropositivity were 2.54 (1.64-3.94) for nurses; 2.51 (1.42-4.43) for nonclinical HCWs; between 1.70 and 1.83 for allied HCWs such as patient care technicians, social workers, registration clerks and therapists; and 0.80 (0.50-1.29) for physicians. Compared to office locations, aORs for the emergency department and inpatient units were 2.27 (1.53-3.37) and 1.48 (1.14-1.92), respectively. CONCLUSION One-third of hospital-based HCWs were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 by the end of the first wave in NYC. Seroprevalence differed by job function and work location, with the highest estimated risk for nurses and the emergency department, respectively. These findings support current nationwide policy prioritizing HCWs for receipt of newly authorized COVID-19 vaccines.","Purswani, Murli U; Bucciarelli, Jessica; Tiburcio, Jose; Yagudayev, Shamuel M; Connell, Georgia H; Omidiran, Arafat A; Hannaway, Launcelot; Zeana, Cosmina; Healy, Maureen; Yu, Gary; Reich, Doug",Journal of hospital medicine,523,8

The present series demonstrates our 'real-world experience' in the use of all iterations of WEB devices (available in Europe) in ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. METHODS We analyzed our all-inclusive cerebrovascular database for patients treated with the WEB device between October 2010 and May 2015. Anatomic and clinical results are reported for all patients. RESULTS One hundred and eight patients with 114 intracranial aneurysms were included in the series. Forty-seven aneurysms (41.2%) were ruptured. Eighty-six patients received angiographic and clinical follow-up after a mean of 13.4 months. One hundred and ten of 114 WEB devices (96.5%) were deployed successfully. Thromboembolic complications occurred in 11 of 110 interventions (10.0%), with a new permanent deficit in one patient. Re-rupture after WEB treatment was detected in two aneurysms (4.3%), which had both initially presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Angiographic follow-up revealed adequate occlusion in 68 of 90 aneurysms (75.6%). Fifteen aneurysms required retreatment.

Despite the danger of infection during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, many patients still need surgical treatment. Most elective surgeries were delayed because of the public health emergency. However, when patients have life-threatening emergencies or illnesses, surgeries are often needed as soon as possible. Moreover, due to hospital overcrowding during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare professionals initially struggled to address the issue due to a lack of experience. This is especially true for day surgery centers with higher patient mobility. Methods. We remodeled pathways to separate patients and medical personnel to minimize the COVID-19 infection rate. Further, strategies for medical staff education and potential patient education, ward disinfection and maintenance, setup with 3 more screening stations, patient and companion management, medical staff management, and perioperative management were implemented before starting elective day surgery. Results. From February 11 to March 11 in 2020, 202 day surgeries were performed. These were all elective surgeries and included ultrasound-guided Mammotome biopsy, endoscopic polypectomy, hernia repair, pediatric surgeries, cholecystectomy, choledochoscopy, radical mastectomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage, liver biopsy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, laparoscopic resection of colon cancer, colostomy apotheosis, and varicose vein surgery. On days 7, 14, and 30 after discharge, no postoperative complications were reported or infection of COVID-19 cases was reported. Conclusions. Using scientific and well-designed protocols, day surgery can ensure quality surgical care with while ensuring medical safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. These protocols may also be applied to other surgical departments in China.","Jiang, Lisha; Ma, Hongsheng",Surgical innovation,523,20

Such a method can be used for patients who require a high inspired oxygen fraction to maintain arterial oxygenation and for patients ventilated using a circle breathing system commonly found in operating rooms, which is not capable of step changes in oxygen. We developed a CO(2) rebreathing method for FRC measurement that is based on the change in partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide and volume of CO(2) eliminated at the end of a partial rebreathing period. This study was designed to assess the accuracy and precision of the proposed FRC measurement system compared to body plethysmography and nitrogen washout FRC. METHODS Accuracy and precision of measurements were assessed by comparing the CO(2) rebreathing FRC values to the gold standard, body plethysmography FRC, in twenty spontaneously breathing volunteers. The CO(2) rebreathing FRC measurements were then compared to nitrogen washout FRC in twenty intensive care patients whose lungs were mechanically ventilated. For each subject, an average value of CO(2) rebreathing FRC was compared to the average gold standard method. Measurements were accepted for statistical analysis if they had been recorded from periods of stable tidal ventilation, defined as a coefficient of variation of tidal volume of <0.13. RESULTS Compared to body plethysmography, the accuracy (average error) for the CO(2) rebreathing method during stable ventilation (n = 8) was 0.03 L and precision (1 standard deviation of the error) was 0.29 L (0.8 ± 7.6% of body plethysmography). During stable mechanical ventilation (n = 9), the accuracy was -0.02 L and precision was 0.26 L (-1.1 ± 12.6% of nitrogen washout). CONCLUSIONS The CO(2) rebreathing method for FRC measurement provides acceptable accuracy and precision during stable ventilation compared to the gold standards of body plethysmography and nitrogen washout. The results based on periods of stable ventilation best approximate the performance of the system in the likely areas of application during controlled mechanical ventilation. Further study of the CO(2) rebreathing method is needed to evaluate accuracy in a larger group of controlled mechanical ventilation patients, including patients with respiratory insufficiency and significant lung injury.","Brewer, Lara; Orr, Joseph; Fulcher, Earl; Markewitz, Boaz",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,523,1

CI at T3-6 in group Iso and Iso+Epi were significantly higher than that of T1 (P<0.05), and were significantly higher than that of propofol group (P<0.05). MAP at T3-6 in group Pro+Epi and Iso+Epi were significantly lower than that at T1 (P <0.05). Heart rate at T4-6 in group Iso were significantly higher than T1, and higher than group Pro and group Iso+Epi (P <0.05). Conclusion One lung ventilation may predispose to increase of intrapulmonary shunt and decrease in arterial partial pressure of oxygen; isoflurane inhalation anesthesia is more likely to cause intrapulmonary shunt, but no changes in arterial partial pressure of oxygen.","Zheng, Xia; Lv, Zhiquan; Yin, Kaiyu; Peng, Mingqing",Pakistan journal of medical sciences,523,27

We used data from a randomized controlled trial of 87 participants with PTSD aged 14-21 years. The discriminative ability was evaluated by comparing participants scores on the descriptive system of the EQ-5D-5L with general population scores. Furthermore, the discriminative ability between subgroups of participants with different disease severity levels was estimated. Correlations between the EQ-5D index and clinical parameters were used to measure construct validity. Test-retest reliability was measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between baseline, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up scores of participants with stable symptoms. Finally, the responsiveness of the EQ-5D was calculated by mean differences, effect sizes and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for participants with improved symptoms. Participants reported significantly more problems on the dimensions ""mobility"", ""usual activities"", ""pain/discomfort"" and ""anxiety/depression"" than the general population. The EQ-5D-5L was able to discriminate between different disease severity levels. The EQ-5D index and clinical scales were significantly correlated with absolute values of correlation coefficients varying between 0.21 and 0.59. Furthermore, ICCs between 0.65 and 0.91 indicated good test-retest reliability for the EQ-5D index. The ICCs for the EQ-VAS between baseline and 3-month follow-up, and posttreatment and 3-month follow-up were statistically significant with 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, whereas the ICC between baseline and posttreatment was 0.08 and not statistically significant. Effect sizes to measure the responsiveness ranged between -0.008 and 0.40 for the EQ-5D index and - 0.32 and 0.40 for the EQ-VAS. Furthermore, the area under the curve in ROC analyses was between 0.40 and 0.64 for the EQ-5D index and 0.60 and 0.70 for the EQ-VAS. Discriminative ability, test-retest reliability and construct validity of the EQ-5D-5L were good, whereas the responsiveness was rather weak. Nevertheless, the EQ-5D-5L can be used to measure HrQoL in adolescents and young adults with PTSD.

METHODS Between 2017 and 2019, 203 patients who had liver malignancies and underwent percutaneous RFA with Celon bipolar electrodes enrolled into this study. There were 90 patients had liver cirrhosis and 113 patients had normal liver background. They were 63 females and 140 males with average age of 59.0 ± 10.9 years old. Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI was used to evaluate the ablation zone in one month after RFA. The hepatic flow measurements on CDFI and CEUS were performed before RFA. Correlations between ablation zone versus hepatic flow were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS The average ablation zone in cirrhotic liver was significantly larger than those in normal liver background with 3 cm tip of RF electrodes (length 3.5 ± 0.5 vs 3.1 ± 0.4 cm, p = 0.001; width 2.6 ± 0.3 vs 2.2 ± 0.3 cm, p < 0.001; thickness 2.5 ± 0.3 vs 2.0 ± 0.2 cm, p < 0.001). The similar result was found with three 4 cm tip of RF electrodes (width 3.6 ± 0.5 vs 3.1 ± 0.5 cm, p = 0.019; thickness 3.3 ± 0.5 vs 2.7 ± 0.5 cm, p = 0.002). The multiple linear regression analysis showed arrive time of hepatic vein and portal vein was statistically associated with ablation zone with 3 cm electrodes (p < 0.001, p = 0.001), but explained part of the variance (Adjusted R2=0.294, adjusted R2=0.212). CONCLUSION The ablation zones of RFA with multi-bipolar electrodes in liver cirrhosis were significantly larger than those in normal liver background, being up to 6 mm in thickness. The hepatic flow parameters partly contributed to the ablation zone.","Wang, Hong; Lee, Jung-Chieh; Cao, Kun; Tang, He-Wen; Wang, Song; Zhang, Zhong-Yi; Wu, Wei; Yan, Kun; Yang, Wei","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",523,1

Diabetes Technology: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2021.,20.346794,8.053252,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Recombinant human growth hormone has been used for more than 30 years and its indications have increased worldwide. There is concern that this treatment might increase mortality, but published data are scarce. We present data from the entire dataset of all eight countries of the Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone treatments in Europe (SAGhE) consortium, with the aim of studying long-term overall and cause-specific mortality in young adult patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood and relating this to the underlying diagnosis. METHODS This cohort study was done in eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK). Patients were classified a priori based on pre-treatment perceived mortality risk from their underlying disease and followed up for cause-specific mortality. Person-years at risk of mortality and expected rates from general population data were used to calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). FINDINGS The cohort comprised 24 232 patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood, with more than 400 000 patient-years of follow-up. In low-risk patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, all-cause mortality was not significantly increased (SMR 1·1, 95% CI 0·9-1·3). In children born small for gestational age, all-cause mortality was significantly increased when analysed for all countries (SMR 1·5, CI 1·1-1·9), but this result was driven by the French subcohort. In patients at moderate or high risk, mortality was increased (SMR 3·8, 3·3-4·4; and 17·1, 15·6-18·7, respectively). Mortality was not associated with mean daily or cumulative doses of recombinant human growth hormone for any of the risk groups. Cause-specific mortality from diseases of the circulatory and haematological systems was increased in all risk groups. INTERPRETATION In this cohort, the largest, to our knowledge, with long-term follow-up of patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood, all-cause mortality was associated with underlying diagnosis. In patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, recombinant human growth hormone treatment was not associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, mortality from certain causes was increased, emphasising the need for further long-term surveillance.

This study examines the perceived trust of different COVID-19 information sources (health professionals, academic institutions, government agencies, news media, social media, family, and friends) and sharing of COVID-19 information in China. Specifically, it investigates how beliefs about sharing and emotions mediate the effects of perceived source trust on source-specific information sharing intentions. Results suggest that health professionals, academic institutions, and government agencies are trusted sources of information and that people share information from these sources because they think doing so will increase disease awareness and promote disease prevention. People may also choose to share COVID-19 information from news media, social media, and family as they cope with anxiety, anger, and fear. Taken together, a better understanding of the distinct psychological mechanisms underlying health information sharing from different sources can help contribute to more effective sharing of information about COVID-19 prevention and to manage negative emotion contagion during the pandemic.","Lu, Linqi; Liu, Jiawei; Yuan, Y Connie; Burns, Kelli S; Lu, Enze; Li, Dongxiao",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,523,31

This study demonstrates a mechanistic role for dieckol in the suppression of lipid accumulation using three models. METHODS AND RESULTS Mice were split into four experimental groups (n = 10 per group): normal diet, high-fat diet (HFD), and dieckol-supplemented diets. Dieckol-supplemented mice groups showed a significant decrease of body weight gain (38%) as well as fats of organs including epididymal (45%) compared with a HFD-fed group. LDL cholesterol level was reduced by 55% in dieckol-supplemented group. Adipogenic factors and lipid synthetic enzymes were analyzed via real-time PCR or immunoblotting. Dieckol regulated mRNA expressions of early adipogenic genes in 3T3-L1 cells. These results were reflected in downregulation of late adipogenic factors, resulting in a decrease in triacylglycerol content. These data were also verified in zebrafish and mouse models. Dieckol activated AMP-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) signaling to inhibit lipid synthesis in 3T3-L1 and mouse model. Dieckol was also shown to inhibit mitotic clonal expansion via cell-cycle arrest. CONCLUSION Our data demonstrate that dieckol inhibits lipid accumulation via activation of AMPKα signaling and cell-cycle arrest.","Choi, Hyeon-Son; Jeon, Hui-Jeon; Lee, Ok-Hwan; Lee, Boo-Yong",Molecular nutrition & food research,523,1

Recently, a connection between the limbic part of the STN and side effects of DBS-STN has been increasingly recognized. Animal studies have shown that DBS-STN influences behavior and provokes neurochemical changes in regions of the limbic system. Some of these regions, which are activated during DBS-STN, are involved in neuroimmunomodulation. The therapeutic effects of DBS-STN in PD treatment are clear, but the influence of DBS-STN on peripheral immunity has not been reported so far. In this study, we examined the effects of unilateral DBS-STN applied in male Wistar rats with 6-hydroxydopamine PD model (DBS-6OHDA) and rats without nigral dopamine depletion (DBS) on corticosterone (CORT) plasma concentration, blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC), leukocyte numbers, lymphocyte population and apoptosis numbers, plasma interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) concentration. The same peripheral immune parameters we measured also in non-stimulated rats with PD model (6OHDA). We observed peripheral immunity changes related to PD model. The NKCC and percentage of T cytotoxic lymphocytes were enhanced, while the level of lymphocyte apoptosis was down regulated in 6OHDA and DBS-6OHDA groups. After DBS-STN (DBS-6OHDA and DBS groups), the plasma CORT and TNF-α were elevated, the number of NK cells and percentage of apoptosis were increased, while the number of B lymphocytes was decreased. We also found, changes in plasma IFN-γ and IL-6 levels in all the groups. These results suggest potential peripheral immunomodulative effects of DBS-STN in the rat model of PD. However, further studies are necessary to explain these findings and their clinical implication.

Recent research has demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) of some Bcl-2 protein family members can modulate apoptosis; however, the transmembrane interactome of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the Mcl-1 TMD forms homooligomers in the mitochondrial membrane, competes with full-length Mcl-1 protein with regards to its antiapoptotic function, and induces cell death in a Bok-dependent manner. While the Bok TMD oligomers locate preferentially to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), heterooligomerization between the TMDs of Mcl-1 and Bok predominantly takes place at the mitochondrial membrane. Strikingly, the coexpression of Mcl-1 and Bok TMDs produces an increase in ER mitochondrial-associated membranes, suggesting an active role of Mcl-1 in the induced mitochondrial targeting of Bok. Finally, the introduction of Mcl-1 TMD somatic mutations detected in cancer patients alters the TMD interaction pattern to provide the Mcl-1 protein with enhanced antiapoptotic activity, thereby highlighting the clinical relevance of Mcl-1 TMD interactions.","Lucendo, Estefanía; Sancho, Mónica; Lolicato, Fabio; Javanainen, Matti; Kulig, Waldemar; Leiva, Diego; Duart, Gerard; Andreu-Fernández, Vicente; Mingarro, Ismael; Orzáez, Mar",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,523,2

Aneurysm treatment with flow diverters is particularly amenable to such analysis. We analyze contrast time-density curves - recorded within aneurysms before (pre) and immediately after (post) flow diverter implantation to estimate six-month treatment outcomes. METHODS Fifty-six patients with 65 aneurysms were treated with flow diverters at two institutions. A region of interest was drawn around the aneurysm perimeter in image sequences taken both pre and post angiography, and the temporal variation in grayscale intensity within the aneurysm (time-density curve) was recorded. Eleven parameters were quantified from each time-density curve. Aneurysm occlusion status was recorded six months post treatment. The change in parameters from pre to post treatment was statistically evaluated between aneurysm occluded and non-occluded groups. RESULTS Of the 11 parameters, eight were significantly different before and immediately after flow diversion. Considering the entire data set, none of the parameters was statistically different between the occluded and non-occluded groups. However, subgroup analyses showed that four variables were significantly different between the aneurysm occluded and non-occluded groups. The sensitivity of these variables to predict aneurysm occlusion at six months ranged from 60% to 89%, while the specificity ranged from 55% to 70%. CONCLUSIONS Device-induced intra-aneurysmal flow alterations quantified by simple aneurysmal time-density curves can potentially be used to predict long-term outcomes of flow diversion. Large multi-center studies will be required to confirm these findings. Patient-to-patient variability in coagulation may need to be incorporated for clinically relevant predictive values.","Sadasivan, Chander; Dholakia, Ronak; Peeling, Lissa; Gölitz, Philipp; Doerfler, Arnd; Lieber, Baruch B; Fiorella, David J; Woo, Henry H","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",523,23

The quality of the immune infiltrate in luminal-like BCs has been poorly studied, thereby limiting further investigation of immunotherapeutic strategies. By using high-dimensional single-cell technologies, we identify heterogeneous behavior within the tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cells infiltrating luminal-like tumors. A subset of CD127- CD39hi Trm cells, preferentially present in the tumor compared to the adjacent normal breast tissue or peripheral blood, retains enhanced degranulation capacity compared to the CD127+ CD39lo Trm counterpart ex vivo, and is specifically associated with positive prognosis.

Because IFN-I is protective, it is commonly used to treat virus infections for which no specific approved drug or vaccine is available. The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is such an infection, yet little is known about the role of IFN-I in this setting. Here, we show that IFN-I signaling is protective during MERS-CoV infection. Blocking IFN-I signaling resulted in delayed virus clearance, enhanced neutrophil infiltration, and impaired MERS-CoV-specific T cell responses. Notably, IFN-I administration within 1 day after infection (before virus titers peak) protected mice from lethal infection, despite a decrease in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) and inflammatory cytokine gene expression. In contrast, delayed IFN-β treatment failed to effectively inhibit virus replication, increased infiltration and activation of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in the lungs, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression, resulting in fatal pneumonia in an otherwise sublethal infection. Together, these results suggest that the relative timing of the IFN-I response and maximal virus replication is key in determining outcomes, at least in infected mice. By extension, IFN-αβ or combination therapy may need to be used cautiously to treat viral infections in clinical settings.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Fehr, Anthony R; Zheng, Jian; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; Abrahante, Juan E; Mack, Matthias; Sompallae, Ramakrishna; McCray, Paul B; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",The Journal of clinical investigation,523,16

Some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be associated with AS progression. However, the roles of OIP5-AS1 in AS development are still little known. In this study, the levels of OIP5-AS1 and miR-26a-5p in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were determined by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Flow-cytometric analysis, respectively. The protein levels of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), cleaved caspase 3, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1β), AKT, p-AKT, p65, p-p65, IκBα and p-IκBα were detected by Western blot analysis. The targeting relationship between OIP5-AS1 and miR-26a-5p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and RNA pull down assay. As a result, the expression of OIP5-AS1 was upregulated and miR-26a-5p was downregulated in ox-LDL treated HUVECs. MiR-26a-5p was identified as a direct target of OIP5-AS1. OIP5-AS1 knockdown reversed the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and the promotional effects on apoptosis and inflammation induced by ox-LDL treatment in HUVECs. Interestingly, the effects caused by OIP5-AS1 knockdown were further attenuated by miR-26a-5p inhibition. Furthermore, OIP5-AS1 knockdown blocked AKT/NF-κB pathway by regulating miR-26a-5p expression. In conclusion, OIP5-AS1 knockdown promoted cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis and inflammatory response in ox-LDL treated HUVECs by targeting miR-26a-5p through blocking AKT/NF-κB pathway, indicating a promising strategy for AS treatment.","Ren, Mingming; Wang, Tao; Han, Zhen; Fu, Pengcheng; Liu, Zigang; Ouyang, Chun",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology,523,24

Patients were randomized 2:1 to edoxaban vs. VKA. The primary endpoint (per-protocol population) was time to first occurrence of all-cause death, stroke, or International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis-defined major bleeding during the period from the end of the ablation procedure to end of treatment (90 days). Overall, 632 patients were enrolled, 614 randomized, and 553 received study drug and underwent ablation; 177 subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to assess silent cerebral infarcts. The primary endpoint (only major bleeds occurred) was observed in 0.3% (1 patient) on edoxaban and 2.0% (2 patients) on VKA [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.16 (0.02-1.73)].

Several research studies have also focused on maternal infections during the second trimester of pregnancy and their long-term effects on fetal brain development, ultimately leading to schizophrenia. No specific virus has been implicated although a handful have received increasing attention. The current pandemic spreading the SARS CoV-2 corona virus world-wide is now showing anecdotal evidence of psychoses newly developing post viral exposure, implicating neuronal inflammation in crucial areas of the brain that could initiate psychotic symptoms.

Therefore, development of new antiviral treatment strategies is urgently needed. As reported, lithium chloride (LiCl) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of viruses, including infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). In this report, we explored whether LiCl had the potential to inhibit PRRSV infection. METHODS MARC-145 cells were treated with LiCl at various stages of PRRSV life cycle. Virus titration assay was performed to determine the virus infectivity. The expression of viral mRNA and protein was measured by real-time PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay, respectively. The transcript levels of cytokines were evaluated by real-time PCR. RESULTS LiCl significantly suppressed the synthesis of viral RNA and protein; however, it did not block PRRSV binding and entry. Further studies confirmed that LiCl inhibited PRRSV replication at an early stage and TNF-α, an antiviral cytokine, was significantly increased after LiCl treatment. Thus, we suggested that LiCl inhibited PRRSV infection by up-regulating the level of antiviral cytokine TNF-α at an early infection stage. CONCLUSIONS Our findings imply that the LiCl has the potential to be used as anti-PRRSV therapy.","Cui, Jin; Xie, Jiexiong; Gao, Ming; Zhou, Han; Chen, Yao; Cui, Tiantian; Bai, Xiaolei; Wang, Heng; Zhang, Guihong",Antiviral therapy,523,12

The size and number of ports determine the extent of the trauma. Single-port laparoscopic surgery is assumed to minimize and perhaps eliminate the potential adverse effects of conventional laparoscopy. The aim of this study was to examine short-term outcomes of single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospectively collected data from 25 consecutive patients who underwent single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer between January 2010 and March 2012. Perioperative data, oncological resections, and short-term outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Male:female ratio was 10:15. Of the 25 patients, 44% had previously undergone abdominal surgery. Median body mass index was 24 kg/m(2) (range: 19-32 kg/m(2)). In all, four patients (16%) had neoadjuvant therapy. Median operating time was 260 min (range: 136-397 min). An additional port was needed in two patients, and one case was converted to hand-assisted approach. Median postoperative stay was 7 days (range: 4-39 days), and three patients (12%) were readmitted. Median lymph node harvest was 13 (range: 3-33). The surgical margins were clear in all patients. Complications were seen in six patients. CONCLUSION Single-port laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer can be performed in selected patients with rectal cancer without compromising oncological safety and with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates.","Bulut, O; Aslak, K K; Rosenstock, S",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,523,24

METHODS Nineteen patients with a solitary nodule were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were maximum nodule diameter <15 mm, distance from nearest pleural surface of 20-40 mm, nonsolid or partly solid nodule, and/or posterior location. Under computed tomography (CT) guidance, the nodule was identified and a needle was inserted to reach lesional or perilesional tissue. A solution of (99m)Tc macro-aggregates albumin diluted with iodized contrast medium was injected. After injection, CT and gamma scintigraphy were performed to confirm precise staining. Localization complications were minimal. RESULTS At thoracoscopy, the gamma detector probe allowed localization of nodules in all patients, with the radioactive signal being converted by the system into audio and visual numeric signals. Resection was performed, and suture margins were checked with the probe to search for residual hyperabsorption. All specimens underwent frozen section. Mean time to detect nodules with the gamma probe was 6 min (range 3-9 min). Frozen section revealed primary pulmonary tumors in eight cases, secondary lesions in four cases, and a benign nodule in the remaining seven cases. CONCLUSION Radio-guided localization is a simple, safe procedure for localizing nonpalpable solitary pulmonary nodules.","Bertolaccini, Luca; Terzi, Alberto; Spada, Elvira; Acchiardi, Franco; Ghirardo, Donatella",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,523,1

Thus, the objective of this study is to examine how quality risk management can be used to prioritize the number of experiments needed to identify the CQA, while still maintaining an acceptable product risk profile. To conduct the study, immediate-release ciprofloxacin tablets manufactured via roller compaction were used as a prototype system. Granules were manufactured using an Alexanderwerk WP120 roller compactor and tablets were compressed on a Stokes B2 tablet press. In the early stages of development, prior knowledge was systematically incorporated into the risk assessment using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). The factors identified using FMEA were then followed by a quantitative assessed using a Plackett-Burman screening design. Results show that by using prior experience, literature data, and preformulation data the number of experiments could be reduced to an acceptable level, and the use of FMEA and screening designs such as the Plackett Burman can rationally guide the process of reducing the number experiments to a manageable level.","Fahmy, Raafat; Kona, Ravikanth; Dandu, Ramesh; Xie, Walter; Claycamp, Gregg; Hoag, Stephen W",AAPS PharmSciTech,523,16

Here, we used 24-channel NIRS to examine the characteristics of prefrontal hemodynamic responses during a verbal fluency task in 20 adults with ASD and in age-, sex-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls. In addition, we used Spearman's correlation analysis to identify the relationship between the time-course of prefrontal hemodynamic activation and the current suicide risk in patients with ASD. We found no significant differences between the verbal fluency task-induced prefrontal hemodynamic responses in the ASD vs. control group. However, we found a significant positive correlation between the current suicide risk score and the time-course of prefrontal hemodynamic activation in the ASD group. Thus, the 24-channel NIRS system appears to be useful in assessing suicide risk in individuals with ASD.","Ota, Toyosaku; Iida, Junzo; Okazaki, Kosuke; Ishida, Rio; Takahashi, Masato; Okamura, Kazuya; Yamamuro, Kazuhiko; Kishimoto, Naoko; Kimoto, Sohei; Yasuda, Yuka; Hashimoto, Ryota; Makinodan, Manabu; Kishimoto, Toshifumi",Psychiatry research,523,1

JUUL Labs (JUUL) insists they do not market their product to teenagers. We created several scenarios to estimate the percentages of JUUL's net revenue from adults and youth in the US in 2018. METHODS We used the number of youth (aged 12-17 years) and adults (aged ≥18 years) who reported using JUUL in the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study wave 4 (Dec 2016-Jan 2018) to estimate the youth proportion of JUUL users. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used data from the nationally representative Truth Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) study to estimate the youth proportion of JUUL users. Based on this percentage, we then applied several scenarios to estimate JUUL's net revenue from youth in the US in 2018. RESULTS From the PATH Study, 31% of JUUL users were youth (aged 12-17 years). In the TLC study, 30% of current JUUL users were aged 15-17 years. Given that JUUL's net revenue was $1.3 billion in 2018, we calculated that JUUL made between $130 million and $650 million of its net revenue from youth, depending on consumption scenarios. CONCLUSIONS A substantial proportion of JUUL's profits in 2018 were a result of use by youth. It could be required that all e-cigarette companies actively ensure that use by youth is below a pre-determined small fraction of their sales, requiring that a high penalty be paid by those that fail to do so.","Kaplan, Bekir; Cherukupalli, Rajeev; Welding, Kevin; Kennedy, Ryan D; Cohen, Joanna E",Tobacco induced diseases,523,1

Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform to genetically reconstruct diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-24 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments.

Teachers can assist children to acquire the skills, confidence, and creativity required to perform diverse movements and physical activities. However, to detect and directly intervene on the aspects of children's PL that are suboptimal, teachers require valid and reliable measures. This systematic review critically evaluates the psychometric properties of teacher proxy-report instruments for assessing one or more of the 30 elements within the four domains (physical, psychological, cognitive, social) of the Australian Physical Literacy Framework (APLF), in children aged 5-12 years. Secondary aims were to: examine alignment of each measure (and relevant items) with the APLF and provide recommendations for teachers in assessing PL. METHODS Seven electronic databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Complete, Education Source, Global Health, MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched originally in October 2019, with an updated search in April 2021. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed English language publications that sampled a population of children with mean age between 5 and 12 years and focused on developing and evaluating at least one psychometric property of a teacher proxy-report instrument for assessing one or more of the 30 APLF elements. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidance was followed for the conduct and reporting of this review. The methodological quality of included studies and quality of psychometric properties of identified tools were evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidance. Alignment of each measure (and relevant items) with the APLF domains and 30 elements was appraised. RESULTS Database searches generated 61,412 citations; reduced to 41 studies that evaluated the psychometric properties of 24 teacher proxy-report tools. Six tools were classified as single domain measures (i.e. assessing a single domain of the APLF), eleven as dual-domain measures, and seven as tri-domain measures. No single tool captured all four domains and 30 elements of the APLF. Tools contained items that aligned with all physical, psychological, and social elements; however, four cognitive elements were not addressed by any measure. No tool was assessed for all nine psychometric properties outlined by COSMIN. Included studies reported a median of 3 out of nine psychometric properties. Most reported psychometric properties were construct validity (n = 32; 78% of studies), structural validity (n = 26; 63% of studies), and internal consistency (n = 25; 61% of studies). There was underreporting of content validity, cross-cultural validity, measurement error, and responsiveness. Psychometric data across tools were mostly indeterminate for construct validity, structural validity, and internal consistency. CONCLUSIONS There is limited evidence to fully support the use of a specific teacher proxy-report tool in practice. Further psychometric testing and detailed reporting of methodological aspects in future validity and reliability studies is needed. Tools have been designed to assess some elements of the framework. However, no comprehensive teacher proxy-report tool exists to assess all 30 elements of the APLF, demonstrating the need for a new tool. It is our recommendation that such tools be developed and psychometrically tested.

National reports have emphasized professional development as a critical component of this training period. In response, many institutions are establishing transferable skills training workshops for postdocs; however, the lack of structured programs and an absence of methods to assess outcomes beyond participant satisfaction surveys are critical gaps in postdoctoral training. To address these shortcomings, we took the approach of structured programming and developed a method for controlled assessment of outcomes. Our program You3 (You, Your Team, Your Project), co-designed by postdoctoral fellows, focused on a structured array of management and leadership skills agnostic of ultimate career path(s). We then measured outcomes in a controlled manner, by systematically comparing perceived knowledge and growth of participants with non-participants as the control group. You3 participants discern greater growth, independent of number of years in training, in competencies overall compared to the control group. This growth was shown by multiple criteria including self-reporting and associative analysis. Correspondingly, You3 participants reported greater knowledge in 75% of the modules when compared to controls. These data indicate that structured learning, where postdocs commit to a curriculum via a cohort-structure, leads to positive outcomes and provides a framework for programs to assess outcomes in a rigorous manner.","Steen, Kaylee; Vornhagen, Jay; Weinberg, Zara Y.; Boulanger-Bertolus, Julie; Rao, Arvind; Gardner, Margery Evans; Subramanian, Shoba",bioRxiv,523,1

However, there is limited information about the impact of COVID-19 on glycemic control in the months following infection. In this retrospective observational study, we examined the correlation between COVID-19 infection and glycemic control in adult patients with elevated A1c in a single health system (n=3,295). Patients were selected from a cohort of those age 18 years or older who were tested for COVID-19 between 3/1/2020 and 11/1/2020. COVID positive patients were identified through positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or a COVID flag in the EMR. COVID negative patients were randomly selected in a 3:1 ratio from all patients who had a negative COVID test in the same week as each positive patient. Patients from this cohort were included if they had a baseline A1c ≥ 5.7% measured in the preceding six months and at least two weeks prior to their COVID positive (n=670) or COVID negative (n=2,625) test date, as well as an endpoint A1c ≥ 5.7% at least three months after this date. The study population was 54% female, 60% White, 20% Hispanic, and 13% Black with a mean BMI 32 ± 7.3 kg/m2, age 64.1 ± 13.6 yrs, and baseline A1c of 7.7± 1.6 %;81% of patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. In a linear regression model, COVID-19 infection was significantly associated with increased endpoint A1c (coefficient = 0.14, 95% CI [0.03 - 0.25], p = 0.01). Baseline A1c, male sex, and Hispanic ethnicity were also significantly associated with increased A1c, while age and median income based on zip code were associated with decreased A1c. In conclusion, prior COVID-19 infection appears to be associated with worse glycemic control at least 3 months post-infection compared to patients who did not contract COVID-19. Additional research is needed to determine if this association is present in other patient populations as well as the physiologic and socio-demographic causes for this finding.","Thurber, Emilia G.; McDonnell, Marie E.; Cromwell, Grace Johnson Matthew Simonson Donald C.; Palermo, Nadine E.",Diabetes,523,1

A total of 303 students from both disciplines (133 Psychology and 170 Veterinary Science undergraduate students) participated in this study by completing an online questionnaire after following the teaching shift from blended learning to full remote online approach at a UK University during the 2019–2020 academic year. Differences between students’ responses were identified due to their discipline’s curricular structure, students’ study behaviours (i.e., being exposed to unrelated learning activities), and students’ cognitive effort to think critically in the search, evaluation and managing of digital information. Students with high level of self-regulation and digital capabilities were able to keep focused and engaged during the lockdown. Although universities and teachers were “forced” to shift their teaching approach due to the unfortunate disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, most students have coped with the changed teaching delivery mode relatively easy with minimum guidance. However, teachers should further consider how digital technologies could enhance students’ learning flexibility promoting critical thinking.","Limniou, Maria Varga-Atkins Tunde Hands Caroline Elshamaa Marie",Education Sciences,523,27

Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of particular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms, labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A susceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the U-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral responses \emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in the improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most concerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two models are given by two methods. The analytic results \emph{quantitatively} describe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection, the awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic thresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the suppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS model.","Zhang, Hai-Feng; Xie, Jia-Rong; Chen, Han-Shuang; Liu, Can; Small, Michael",,523,1

El principal objetivo consiste en identificar aquellas cuestiones espaciales ligadas a la experiencia del habitar en la infancia que determinan espacios comunitarios de esparcimiento y aprendizaje. La propuesta, realizada a partir de una experiencia personal, surge de la observación de las nuevas formas de ocupación del espacio doméstico habitual de dos niñas de 3 y 5 años tras la situación de confinamiento decretada en marzo de 2020 debido a la pandemia del Covid-19. En esta situación, la vivienda se reinventa a través de pequeñas intervenciones efímeras configuradas mediante la combinación de patrones espaciales sencillos que las niñas y niños manejan con soltura, proyectando lugares de protección y experimentación que responden a sus necesidades de forma instantánea. Estas prácticas de resistencia permiten cuestionar las funciones del espacio doméstico, y por extensión, del espacio urbano, poniendo en evidencia la necesidad urgente de proyectar nuestras viviendas y espacios urbanos en términos de cuidado y sostenibilidad, desde una perspectiva feminista y comunitaria que integre la mirada y experiencia de la infancia en el proceso de diseño.Alternate abstract: This study presents a reflection on the relationship between space, play and childhood and the ability to reinvent contexts through a proposal of spatial practices. The main objective is to identify those spatial issues linked to the experience of living in childhood that determine community spaces for recreation and learning. The proposal, based on an own experience, arises from the observation of the new forms of occupation of the habitual domestic space of two girls of 3 and 5 years old after the situation of confinement decreed in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In this unprecedented situation, housing is reinvented through small ephemeral interventions configured through a combination of simple spatial patterns that the children handle with ease, projecting places of protection and experimentation that respond to their needs instantly. These practices of resistance allow us to question the functions of domestic space, and by extension, of urban space, highlighting the urgent need to project our homes and urban spaces in terms of care and sustainability, from a feminist and community perspective that integrates the view and experience of childhood into the design process.","Freire-Pérez, Estella","Arte, Individuo y Sociedad",523,25

Changes in Sleep among Parents with Children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D),20.454876,8.12956,2021,"Background: High incidence of life-threatening thrombotic complications is observed in severely ill COVID-19 patients. D-dimer may help evaluate disease severity and predict outcomes at hospital admission. However, its non-specificity and long analysis times strongly constrain its clinical value. Viscoelastic tests (VET) are widely available rapid point-of-care devices that have been shown to detect a hypercoagulable state (increased clot stiffness and fibrinolysis shutdown) as major contributors of the thrombotic complication in COVID-19. Nevertheless, based on the data obtained so far, definitive conclusions have not been drawn. Objectives: We aim to evaluate the association between VET parameters, standard coagulation tests and inflammation markers assessed in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission with disease severity and outcomes. Patients/Methods: A total of 69 COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization were included in the study. The pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state was analyzed by a panel of inflammation markers (IL-6, CRP, LDH, ferritin), routine coagulation tests (PT, aPTT, platelet count, fibrinogen, D-dimer) and a SEER sonorheometry VET profile (Quantra System). Results: Inflammatory markers IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin were elevated in a high percentage of patients (73.6%, 89.2%, 57.1% and 52.4%), as were coagulation-related parameters such as fibrinogen (81.4%) and D-dimer levels (66.2%). Quantra analysis revealed increased clot stiffness (CS) in 34.8%, particularly due to increased fibrinogen contribution (FCS) in 63.7%. Increased clot stability to lysis (CSL) was observed in 32.4%. Age > 65 years, elevated values of fibrinogen, D-dimer, LDH, increased clot stiffness and resistance to clot lysis were significantly associated with worsening disease. The Quantra FCS parameter showed a particularly high prognostic value in distinguishing patients with severe symptomatology. Conclusion: The global study of hemostasis by the whole blood point-of-care Quantra VET system may be a powerful tool for identifying poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission. In particular, FCS measured by Quantra could be established as a plausible prognostic marker to aid the clinical management of COVID-19 patients.","Lopez-Jaime, F.

It is a leading cause of antimicrobial therapy prescriptions and surgery in children. Despite this, treatments have changed little in over 50 years. Research has been limited by the lack of physiological models of middle ear epithelium. Methods: We develop a novel human middle ear epithelial culture using an air-liquid interface (ALI) system;akin to the healthy ventilated middle ear in vivo. We validate this using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and membrane conductance studies. We also utilize this model to perform a pilot challenge of middle ear epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2. Results: We demonstrate that human middle ear epithelial cells cultured at an ALI undergo mucociliary differentiation to produce diverse epithelial subtypes including basal (p63+), goblet (MUC5AC+, MUC5B+), and ciliated (FOXJ1+) cells. Mature ciliagenesis is visualized and tight junction formation is shown with electron microscopy, and confirmed by membrane conductance. Together, these demonstrate this model reflects the complex epithelial cell types which exist in vivo. Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, human middle ear epithelium shows positive viral uptake, as measured by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: We describe a novel physiological system to study the human middle ear. This can be utilized for translational research into middle ear diseases. We also demonstrate, for the first time under controlled conditions, that human middle ear epithelium is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has important clinical implications for safe otological surgery.

These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of anti-fibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents.","D'Alessandro, A.; Thomas, T.; Dzieciatkowska, M.; Hill, R.

Increasing the use of Big Data for mental health research, especially routinely-collected data, could improve this situation. However, steps to facilitate this must be enacted in collaboration with those who would provide the data - people with mental health conditions. Methods We used the Delphi method to create a best practice checklist for mental health data science. Twenty participants with both expertise in data science and personal experience of mental illness worked together over three phases. In the Phase 1, participants rated a list of 63 statements and added any statements or topics that were missing. Statements receiving a mean score of 5 or more (out of 7) were retained. These were then combined with the results of a rapid thematic analysis of participants' comments to produce a 14-item draft checklist, with each item split into two components: best practice now and best practice in the future. In Phase 2, participants indicated whether or not each item should remain in the checklist, and items that scored more than 50% endorsement were retained. In Phase 3 participants rated their satisfaction with the final checklist. Results The final checklist was made up of 14 'best practice' items, with each item covering best practice now and best practice in the future. At the end of the three phases, 85% of participants were (very) satisfied with the two best practice checklists, with no participants expressing dissatisfaction. Conclusions Increased stakeholder involvement is essential at every stage of mental health data science. The checklist produced through this work represents the views of people with experience of mental illness, and it is hoped that it will be used to facilitate trustworthy and innovative research which is inclusive of a wider range of individuals.","Kirkham, E.

The main reported concerns are centered around privacy and ethical issues. At the same time, people are voluntarily using Social Media apps at a significantly higher rate during the pandemic without similar privacy concerns compared with COVID-19 apps. To better understand these seemingly anomalous behaviours, we analysed the privacy policies, terms & conditions and data use agreements of the most commonly used COVID-19, Social Media & Productivity apps. We also developed a tool to extract and analyse nearly 2 million user reviews for these apps. Our results show that Social Media & Productivity apps actually have substantially higher privacy and ethical issues compared with the majority of COVID-19 apps. Surprisingly, lots of people indicated in their user reviews that they feel more secure as their privacy are better handled in COVID-19 apps than in Social Media apps. On the other hand, most of the COVID-19 apps are less accessible and stable compared to most Social Media apps, which negatively impacted their store ratings and led users to uninstall COVID-19 apps more frequently. Our findings suggest that in order to effectively fight this pandemic, health officials and technologists will need to better raise awareness among people about COVID-19 app behaviour and trustworthiness. This will allow people to better understand COVID-19 apps and encourage them to download and use these apps.

Such an evolutionary phenomenon should depend on the age of the star-planet system. In this work, we study the temporal evolution of the radius valley using two independent determinations of host star ages among the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) sample. We find evidence for a wide and nearly empty void of planets in the period-radius diagram at the youngest system ages ($\lesssim$2-3 Gyr) represented in the CKS sample. We show that the orbital period dependence of the radius valley among the younger CKS planets is consistent with that found among those planets with asteroseismically determined host star radii. Relative to previous studies of preferentially older planets, the radius valley determined among the younger planetary sample is shifted to smaller radii. This result is compatible with an atmospheric loss timescale on the order of gigayears for progenitors of the largest observed super-Earths. In support of this interpretation, we show that the planet sizes which appear to be unrepresented at ages $\lesssim$2-3 Gyr are likely to correspond to planets with rocky compositions. Our results suggest the size distribution of close-in exoplanets, and the precise location of the radius valley, evolves over gigayears.","David, Trevor J.; Contardo, Gabriella; Sandoval, Angeli; Angus, Ruth; Lu, Yuxi; Bedell, Megan; Curtis, Jason L.; Foreman-Mackey, Daniel; Fulton, Benjamin J.; Grunblatt, Samuel K.; Petigura, Erik A.",,523,17

To date, a majority of studies assessing sensory-dependent plasticity have focused on effects from either early onset or long-term sensory loss and little is known how the recent sensory loss affects the human brain. With the aim of determining how recent sensory loss affects cerebral morphology and functional connectivity, we assessed differences between individuals with acquired olfactory loss (duration 7-36 months, n=20) and matched healthy controls (n=23) in their grey matter volume, using multivariate pattern analyses, and functional connectivity, using dynamic connectivity analyses, within and from the olfactory cortex. Our results demonstrate that acquired olfactory loss alters grey matter volume in, among others, posterior piriform cortex, a core olfactory processing area, as well as the inferior frontal gyrus and angular gyrus. In addition, compared to controls, individuals with acquired anosmia displayed significantly stronger dynamic functional connectivity from the posterior piriform cortex to, among others, the angular gyrus, a known multisensory integration area. No significantly stronger connectivity in healthy control participants were demonstrated. When assessing differences in dynamic functional connectivity from the angular gyrus, individuals with acquired anosmia had stronger connectivity from the angular gyrus to areas primary responsible for basic visual and taste processing. These results demonstrate that recently acquired sensory loss alters both cerebral morphology within core olfactory areas and increase dynamic functional connectivity from olfactory cortex to cerebral areas processing multisensory integration.","Iravani, Behzad; Peter, Moa G.; Arshamian, Artin; Olsson, Mats J.; Hummel, Thomas; Kitzler, Hagen H.; Lundström, Johan N.",bioRxiv,523,22

There is limited evidence on the mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has important implications for early treatment. Objective: Evaluate the risk of pre-existing comorbidities on COVID-19 mortality, and provide clinical suggestions accordingly. Method: This study used a nested case-control design. A total of 94 publicly reported deaths in locations outside of Hubei Province, China, between December 18th, 2019 and March 8th, 2020 were included as cases. Each case was matched with up to three controls, based on gender and age (94 cases and 181 controls). The inverse-probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard model was performed. Results: History of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% higher risk of death (p<0.001). The estimated mortality risk in patients with CHD was three times of those without CHD (p<0.001). The estimated 30-day survival probability for a profile patient with pre-existing CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities) was 0.53 (95% CI [0.34-0.82]), while it was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. Older age was also associated with increased death risk: every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 20% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).

The airway industry, which is a demand-oriented sector, has an important role in the rapid spread of the virus. Serious restrictions have been imposed on the industry for this. Due to these restrictions;The airway industry is one of the sectors most affected by the Covid-19 process. In this context;by using the interim financial reports of the enterprises for the years 2019-2020, who are in air transportation operations in Turkey and located in BIST 100 index, financial performances and industry-specific indicators have been compared. In addition, by examining the financial statement footnotes with the ""content analysis method"", the level of informing enterprises provide about Covid-19 was determined. According to the results of the study, it is seen that Covid-19 led to a negative impact on Turkish air transport. It has been determined that this effect is mostly felt in the second and third quarters, and financial reports include explanations for Covid-19, but differ between enterprises.","Canli, Serap Nur Özata Özdemir Murat",Third Sector Social Economic Review,523,1

Therefore, sexuality education is considered the only effective way to avoid it. This project aims to understand sexual risk behaviour factors and their consequences in young adults and to explore strategies they would use to face them. To answer these questions, we conducted a qualitative study in which we interviewed 11 young adults using an asynchronous mail technique due to the Covid19 pandemic. We also carried out a thematic analysis and developed our key results: 1) Sexual attitudes and behaviours;2) Sexual risk factors, 3) Sexual risk consequences;and 4) Educational approach and strategies. Similarities in the themes were verified with previous literature, exposing the importance of learning to identify factors and consequences to respond appropriately. Participants believe that comprehensive and egalitarian sexuality education applied at individual and community level is a solid method that can improve sexual health and well-being. To conclude, this study reveals the importance of listening to young adults' perspectives towards these conduct variables and educational approaches in order to establish global health strategies that could be based on these results.","Alonso-Martinez, L.; Fernandez-Hawrylak, M.; Heras-Sevilla, D.; Ortega-Sanchez, D.",Qualitative Research in Education,523,5

METHODS We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged <2 years with bronchiolitis. For 3 consecutive years from November 1 until March 31, beginning in 2007, researchers collected clinical data and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from study participants. We oversampled children from the ICU. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 18 pathogens. RESULTS There were 161 children who required CPAP and/or intubation. The median age of the overall cohort was 4 months; 59% were male; 61% white, 24% black, and 36% Hispanic. In the multivariable model predicting CPAP/intubation, the significant factors were: age <2 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-11.5), maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.9), birth weight <5 pounds (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.0-2.6), breathing difficulty began <1 day before admission (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1), presence of apnea (OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.5-8.5), inadequate oral intake (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.3-4.3), severe retractions (OR 11.1; 95% CI 2.4-33.0), and room air oxygen saturation <85% (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.0-4.8). The optimism-corrected c-statistic for the final model was 0.80. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we identified several demographic, historical, and clinical factors that predicted the use of CPAP and/or intubation, including children born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. We also identified a novel subgroup of children who required mechanical respiratory support <1 day after respiratory symptoms began.","Mansbach, Jonathan M; Piedra, Pedro A; Stevenson, Michelle D; Sullivan, Ashley F; Forgey, Tate F; Clark, Sunday; Espinola, Janice A; Camargo, Carlos A",Pediatrics,523,6

Of the six proteins in purified virions, only one showed RNA-binding activity. This 92,000-molecular-weight (92K) protein was present in both single- and double-shelled particles. Its RNA-binding activity was blocked by preincubation with monospecific antibody to VP2. Thus, the 92K RNA-binding protein in rotavirus virions is VP2, the second most abundant protein in single-shelled particles. In infected cell extracts, numerous cellular RNA-binding proteins and two virus-specific RNA-binding proteins were detected, VP2 and a 31K nonstructural (NS31) protein. VP2 bound single-stranded RNA in preference to double-stranded RNA, whereas NS31 bound both single- and double-stranded RNA equally well. Binding did not appear to be nucleotide sequence specific, because RNA from uninfected cells and an unrelated RNA virus bound to VP2 and to NS31 as did rotavirus RNA. This technique showed that both cellular and rotavirus RNA-binding proteins also bound DNA. VP2 interacted with rotavirus RNA over a broad pH range, with an optimum at pH 6.4 to 6.8, and at NaCl concentrations between 0 and 100 mM. The RNA-binding activity of NS31 exhibited similar pH and NaCl dependency. Sequence-specific nucleic acid binding could be detected by this method. When labeled synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides corresponding to the 3' and 5' plus-sense terminal sequences of rotavirus gene segments were used as probes, the 3' synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide bound to one 48K protein in control and infected cells. This suggests that there may be a specific functional interaction between the 48K cellular protein and this 3'-terminal noncoding region of the rotavirus genome or mRNA. These data show that the RNA overlay-protein blot assay is a useful test to identify some cellular and viral proteins with RNA-binding activity. For bovine rotavirus, the evidence suggests that, of all the virus-specific proteins, VP2 and NS31 are most likely to interact with RNA during transcription and replication or virus assembly or both.","Boyle, J F; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,523,4

These additional patients may lead to the risk of viral transmission to other patients and medical teams. To contain the spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the Israeli Ministry of Health initiated a plan spearheaded by Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency medical services (EMS) organization. OBJECTIVES To describe outbreak containment actions initiated by MDA, including a COVID-19 tele-triage center and home testing by paramedics. METHODS Retrospective analysis was conducted of de-identified data from the call management and command and control systems during the first period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (23 February 2020-15 March 2020). RESULTS During the study period, the total number of calls to the dispatch centers was 477,321 with a daily average of 21,696, compared to 6000-6500 during routine times. The total number of COVID-19 related calls was 334,230 (daily average 15,194). There were 28,454 calls (8.51% of all COVID-19 related calls, average 1293/day) transferred to the COVID-19 call center. Of the COVID-19 call center inquiries, 8390 resulted in the dispatch of a dedicated vehicle, including a paramedic wearing personal protective equipment, to collect samples for testing (daily average 381). CONCLUSIONS Maximizing EMS during a pandemic using phone triage, in addition to dispatching paramedics to perform home testing, may significantly distance infected patients from the public and health care system. These steps can further minimize the spread of disease.","Jaffe, Eli; Sonkin, Roman; Alpert, Evan Avraham; Magid, Avi; Knobler, Haim Y",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,523,24

The objective of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of supervised progressive resistance training compared with common treatment for patients with hip osteoarthritis, focusing on patient-reported function, pain, health-related quality of life, performance-based function at end of treatment and patient-reported function at 6-12 months. METHODS This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search was performed on 30 January 2019 in eight electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Pedro, AMED, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Cinahl). The methodology of the included studies and the overall quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS A total of 189 participants with hip osteoarthritis > 50 years of age were included in the three studies. A significant difference in favour of the supervised progressive resistance groups was found in patient-reported function (weighted mean difference (MD) = 9.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.45-13.80)), hip-related pain (weighted MD = 7.83 (95% CI: 2.64-13.02)) and health-related quality of life (weighted MD = 6.80 (95% CI: 1.96-11.63)) at end of treatment. The overall quality of evidence was downgraded to low due to a lack of blinding in the included studies and due to imprecision. CONCLUSIONS Supervised progressive resistance training might be of clinical relevance for patients with hip osteoarthritis and was effective in improving patient-reported function, hip-related pain and health-related quality of life. The level of evidence is low and future studies may therefore affect the findings reported herein.","Hansen, Sebrina; Mikkelsen, Lone Ramer; Overgaard, Søren; Mechlenburg, Inger",Danish medical journal,523,19

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 23rd March 2020, Northern Ireland was placed into 'lockdown' with the majority of the population advised to ""stay at home"". The objective of this paper is to identify what effect the lockdown restrictions had on the workload of the Major Trauma Service at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Method Patients were identified at the orthopaedic trauma meetings and from direct referral to the Major Trauma Service (MTS). Patients admitted and seen by the MTS from 23/03/20, the day lockdown was announced, to 29/05/20, when restrictions were partially lifted, were included in the analysis. Admissions data from this time period was then compared to admissions data from the same period in 2019 (23/03/19 - 29/05/19). Results When comparing pre-lockdown and lockdown groups there was an overall decrease of 26% in admissions to the MTS (n=57 vs n=42). Road Traffic Accidents were reduced by 53% (n=31 vs n=15) and falls from >2m were reduced by 29% (n=21 vs n=15). Conclusion Overall the number of admissions to the major trauma service was reduced during the lockdown period. A significant proportion of the reduction may be a result of social restrictions that reduced volume of traffic on Northern Irelands roads. Further study of future lockdowns and including admissions data of other MTCs in the UK would allow us to draw more robust conclusions.","Jefferies, Owen; Kealey, David; Yoong, Susan; Houston, Ruth; Tennyson, Caoimhe",The Ulster medical journal,523,1

Other 46 cases were accompanied by diarrhea. Most of patients, manifestation of lungs was negative. Chest X-ray, shadow of lungs were light in beginning, and change to severity slowly or suddenly during 5 - 10 days. Of these cases, 36 cases develop to ARDS and 11 cases died with severity ARDS. Using general antibiotic was of no effect for the illness. Continual positive airway pressure (CPAP) and glucocorticoid was required that can control deprivation of the disease when toxicosis symptom of patients was severity and shadow of lungs diffuse more and more. CONCLUSION Infectivity of the illness is evidence and spread by airway. Using general antibiotic was of no effect for the illness. Continual positive airway pressure (CPAP) and glucocorticoid are effective for control of the disease.","Zhao, Zi-wen; Zhang, Fu-chun; Xu, Min; Huang, Kan; Zhong, Wei-nong; Cai, Wei-ping; Yin, Chi-biao; Huang, Shao-dan; Deng, Zhe-tong; Wei, Min",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,523,28

Intimate linkage of human and animal health is not a new phenomenon. However, the global scope of contemporary zoonoses has no historical precedent. Indeed, most human infectious diseases classed as emerging are zoonotic, and many of these have spilled over from natural wildlife reservoirs into humans either directly or via domestic or peridomestic animals. Conservation medicine has recently emerged as a meaningful discipline to address the intersection of animal, human, and ecosystem health. Interest in the development of novel vaccines for wildlife encounters important challenges that may prevent progress beyond the conceptual phase. Although notable examples of successful wildlife immunisation programmes exist, depending upon key considerations, vaccination may or may not prove to be effective in the field. When implemented, wildlife vaccination requires a combination of novel zoonosis pathogen management strategies and public education to balance conservation, economic, and public health issues.","Plumb, G; Babiuk, L; Mazet, J; Olsen, S; Rupprecht, C; Pastoret, P P; Slate, D",Revue scientifique et technique,523,1

Selection of the strains showed that their immunogenicity depends upon the density and salience of the crown-like projections, the antigenic relationship of the projections determining cross serologic reactions between different species. At present experiments are being carried out on animals with vaccines prepared with antigenically related heterologous cornavirus species, not pathogenic for the host, and with subunitary vaccines prepared from the projections of the homologous species.

Our aim is to determine whether ALB is a risk factor for an unfavorable clinical outcome and involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective, single-center study of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Patients with pharmacological hepatotoxicity or liver diseases were excluded. ALB was defined as the elevation of total bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and/or GGT above the upper limit of normal. An assessment was first made of the correlation between ALB and the need for hospitalization. This was followed by an assessment of the correlation of hospitalized patients with demographic variables, comorbidities and treatment for COVID-19 and with clinical involvement and outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using age-adjusted multiple logistic regression with a p-value of <0.05 RESULTS: Of 1,277 confirmed cases, 346 required hospitalization, and 302 were included. The prevalence of ALB was higher in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients (60.9% vs. 10.3%, p Ë0.001). Among the hospitalized patients, there was no correlation between ALB and demographic variables, comorbidities or treatment for COVID-19, except for low molecular weight heparin. We found a significant correlation between ALB and moderate/severe COVID-19 involvement and between unfavorable clinical outcomes and elevated total bilirubin. The period of greatest clinical worsening and deterioration of liver biochemistry parameters occurred during the first seven days. There was a significant correlation between ALB and a longer hospital stay and admission to the Intensive Care Unit, but this did not imply higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ALB is correlated with greater clinical involvement and worse clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Alventosa Mateu, Carlos; Urquijo Ponce, Juan José; Puchades Gimeno, Francesc; Benlloch Pérez, Salvador; Sanz Herrero, Francisco; Latorre Sánchez, Mercedes; García Deltoro, Miguel; Gimeno Cardona, Concepción; Ocete Mochón, María Dolores; Diago Madrid, Moisés",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,523,16
206766,206766,206766,The Proportion of Adult Americans at Risk of Severe COVID-19 Illness,20.347095,7.9600897,2020,"Objectives During the last quarter of 2020—despite improved distribution of personal protective equipment(PPE) and knowledge of COVID-19 management—nursing homes experienced the greatest increases in cases and deaths since the pandemic’s beginning. We sought to update COVID-19 estimates of cases, hospitalization, and mortality, and to evaluate the association of potentially modifiable facility-level infection control factors on odds and magnitude of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in nursing homes during the third surge of the pandemic. Design Cross-sectional analysis Setting and Participants Facility-level data from 13,156 United States nursing home facilities Methods Two series of multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models to examine the association of infection control factors (personal protective equipment and staffing) on incidence and magnitude, respectively, of confirmed COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in nursing home residents reported in the last quarter of 2020. Results Nursing homes experienced steep increases in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths during the final quarter of 2020. Four-fifths (80.51%;n=10,592) of facilities reported at least one COVID-19 case, 49.44%(n=6,504) reported at least one hospitalization, and 49.76% (n=6,546) reported at least one death during this third surge. N95 mask shortages were associated with increased odds of at least one COVID-19 case (OR: 1.21[95% Confidence Interval(CI), 1.05-1.40]) and hospitalization (OR: 1.26 [95%CI, 1.13-1.40]), as well as larger numbers of hospitalizations (OR: 1.11 [95%CI, 1.02-1.20]). Nursing aide shortages were associated with lower odds of at least one COVID-19 death (OR: 1.22 [95%CI, 1.12-1.34]) and higher hospitalizations (OR:1.09 [95%CI, 1.01-1.17]). The number of nursing hours per resident per day was largely insignificant across all outcomes. Of note, smaller (<50 beds) and mid-sized (50-150 beds) facilities had lower odds yet higher magnitude of all COVID outcomes. Bed occupancy rates > 75% increased odds of experiencing a COVID-19 case (OR:1.48 [95%CI, 1.35-1.62]) or death (OR: 1.25 [95%CI, 1.17-1.34]). Conclusions and Implications Adequate staffing and PPE—along with reduced occupancy and smaller facilities—mitigate incidence and magnitude of COVID-19 cases and sequellae. Addressing shortcomings in these factors is critical to the prevention of infections and adverse health consequences of a next surge among vulnerable nursing home residents. Many modifiable factors that increased facility COVID-19 case, hospitalization, or death risks- such as PPE and facility size-as well as the magnitude of these outcomes, remain unchanged from those reported earlier in the pandemic.","Simoni-Wastila, Linda Wallem Alexandra Fleming Sean Le Tham Kepczynska Paulina Yang Jeanne Qato Danya M.",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,523,32

The objective of this paper is to examine how “tacit knowledge” – implicit knowledge used to guide everyday practice – is employed in professional relationships and communication processes between public health and acute care settings. A qualitative study design was used to explore the experiences of key informants from public health and acute care settings in Ontario, Canada, to examine how specific dimensions of tacit knowledge are employed in communications about EPHIs. Twenty-six in-depth interviews were conducted from 2014 to 2015. The results describe the way in which participants employ discretion and knowledge of local context, and rely on relationships built on trust and credibility, to facilitate decision-making and communication during EPHIs. Given the uncertainty characterizing most EPHIs, communicators rely a great deal on their informal knowledge and networks which allow them to remain flexible and respond quickly to changing situations. The results reveal that communication about public health guidance during emergencies is a complex and active process that draws from past experiences of the individuals involved, and is shaped by the requirements of local circumstances. The broader implications of these findings for building resilient and responsive health systems are considered. In particular, for rethinking the authority of standardized forms of evidence in public health decision-making, and the importance of knowledge which is grounded in the uniqueness of specific local contexts.","Sanford, S.; Schwartz, B.; Khan, Y.",Int.

In this case report, we describe our first case of COVID-19 pneumonia that was complicated by cerebral venous thrombosis and bleeding in a patient with polycythemia vera. Madam A, a 72-year-old lady with polycythemia vera, ischemic stroke, hemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as per hospital protocol. She continued taking hydroxyurea and aspirin for her treatment of polycythemia vera. Subsequently, she developed rectal bleeding when her platelet count was 1247 × 103/µl, even though she was not on an anticoagulant. Her aspirin was withheld. One week later, she was readmitted to the hospital for cerebral venous thrombosis and her D-dimer was 2.02 µg/ml. She was commenced on a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin. Following that, her D-dimer level showed a decreasing trend and normalized upon her discharge. Patients with polycythemia vera are prone to develop thrombotic and bleeding complications. Management of this group of patients has become more complex with COVID-19 infection. It is crucial for us to decide when to start an anticoagulant especially when there is a history of recent bleeding. We need to balance the risks of further bleeding versus potentially fatal thrombotic events. Studies have shown that D-dimer can be used as a clinical marker to predict thrombotic events in COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 infection and polycythemia vera will benefit from both pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and close monitoring for bleeding.","Chow, Lai Chee; Chew, Lee Ping; Leong, Tze Shin; Mohamad Tazuddin, Estrellita Elena; Chua, Hock Hin",SN Compr Clin Med,523,1

Many of these workers experience higher job pressure and increased risk of infection due to their work. It is crucial to investigate which factors that can contribute to insomnia in these important sectors. METHODS: Data was collected using an online survey administered in June 2020. The questionnaire measured demographic variables, sleep, stress, psychosocial factors and health concerns (i.e worrying about health consequences related to the pandemic). The sample in the present study consisted of 1327 (76% females) employees in organizations with societal critical functions. RESULTS: The employees reported higher levels of insomnia symptoms compared to normative data collected before the pandemic. Health concerns specifically related to COVID-19 had the strongest association to insomnia, followed by work stress. Job demands (i.e workload, time pressure and overtime) had merely a weak association to insomnia. CONCLUSION: Worrying about consequences the pandemic can have on your own health and the health of your family or colleagues have a stronger negative impact on sleep than work pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impaired sleep can have detrimental effects on performance and health, and a stronger focus on preventing insomnia as a mean of sustaining critical societal functions both during and after the pandemic is warranted. Organizations should consider interventions aimed at reducing health concerns among their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sørengaard, Torhild Anita; Saksvik-Lehouillier, Ingvild",Sleep medicine,523,22

Patients may develop severe pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and a significant proportion of them dies. It has been suggested that brainstem might play a role in severe respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. We described three COVID-19 patients in ICU at Federico II Hospital in Naples that, although had recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation. Our clinical evaluation was consistent with an involvement of the brainstem and especially of respiratory centre thus possibly explaining the weaning failure in patients that were awake and had recovered from lung involvement. Our data, though limited, indicate that brainstem involvement may play a role in respiratory failure and perhaps in the high death rate of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the weaning failure from mechanical ventilation due to central respiratory drive depression might underlie the unusual long stay in ICU reported for COVID-19 patients.","Manganelli, Fiore; Vargas, Maria; Iovino, Aniello; Iacovazzo, Carmine; Santoro, Lucio; Servillo, Giuseppe",Neurol. sci,523,7

It has historically been deployed to streamline healthcare delivery and reach those who would previously have faced obstacles to accessing services. It has also enabled improved health education and management. Telemedicine can be employed in everything from primary care consultations to the monitoring of chronic diseases. Despite recommendation by the World Health Organization, countries have been slow to embrace such technology in the health sector. Nonetheless, it is expected to become more prevalent with increased digitization. Further, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rush to implement forms of telemedicine where possible to prevent patients breaking social distancing rules. In this paper, I present and defend what I term the 'telemedical imperative'. The telemedical imperative represents a duty for healthcare systems to implement remote access to services where possible, thereby furthering the mission of equity in access to healthcare. It is intended as an addition to in-person services rather than a replacement. After highlighting the benefits of telemedicine, I provide four criteria that must be met for the telemedical imperative to arise. The first three-safety, effectiveness, and acceptability-are consistent and essential. The fourth adapts to the service in question and requires that there be no other obstacles specific to that service that cannot reasonably be overcome. Finally, I address several potential objections to the telemedical imperative based on more general concerns around the implementation of telemedicine.","Parsons, Jordan A",Bioethics,523,1

Transparent barriers are an engineering control that are utilized to intercept air traveling between customers to workers. Information on the effectiveness of these barriers against aerosols is limited. In this study, a cough simulator was used to represent a cough from a customer. Two optical particle counters were used (one on each side of the barrier, labeled reference and worker) to determine the number of particles that migrated around a transparent barrier. Nine barrier sizes and a no barrier configuration were tested with six replicates each. Tests of these 10 configurations were conducted for both sitting and standing scenarios to represent configurations common to nail salons and grocery stores, respectively. Barrier efficiency was calculated using a ratio of the particle count results (reference/worker). Barriers had better efficiency when they were 9 to 39 cm (3.5 to 15.5"") above cough height and at least 91 cm (36"") wide, 92% and 93% respectively. Barriers that were 91 cm (36"") above table height for both scenarios blocked 71% or more of the particles between 0.35-0.725 {micro}m and 68% for particles between 1 to 3 {micro}m. A barrier that blocked an initial cough was effective at reducing particle counts. While the width of barriers was not as significant as height in determining barrier efficiency it was important that a barrier be placed where interactions between customers and workers are most frequent.","Bartels, Jacob; Estill, Cheryl Fairfield; Chen, I-Chen; Neu, Dylan",,523,29

The authors outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute to deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. The authors suggest these have contributed to divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities with COVID-19 disease outcomes.

One of these targets is the main protease, Mpro or 3CLpro, which is highly conserved among coronaviruses. 3CLpro is an essential player in the viral replication cycle, processing the large viral polyproteins and rendering the individual proteins functional. We report a biophysical characterization of the structural stability and the catalytic activity of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV-2, from which a suitable experimental in vitro molecular screening procedure has been designed. By screening of a small chemical library consisting of about 150 compounds, the natural product quercetin was identified as reasonably potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Ki ~ 7 µM). Quercetin could be shown to interact with 3CLpro using biophysical techniques and bind to the active site in molecular simulations. Quercetin, with well-known pharmacokinetic and ADMET properties, can be considered as a good candidate for further optimization and development, or repositioned for COVID-19 therapeutic treatment.","Abian, Olga; Ortega-Alarcon, David; Jimenez-Alesanco, Ana; Ceballos-Laita, Laura; Vega, Sonia; Reyburn, Hugh T; Rizzuti, Bruno; Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian",Int J Biol Macromol,523,1

The secondary aim was to compare this with population mobility data obtained from Google. Methods: A cross-sectional study of consecutive adult (> 13 years) patients with musculoskeletal trauma referred as either in-patients or out-patients over a 40-day period beginning on 5 March 2020, the date of the first reported UK COVID-19 death, was performed. This time period encompassed social distancing measures. This group was compared to a group of patients referred over the same calendar period in 2019 and to publicly available mobility data from Google. Results: Orthopaedic trauma referrals reduced by 42% (1,056 compared to 1,820) during the study period, and by 58% (405 compared to 967) following national lockdown. Outpatient referrals reduced by 44%, and inpatient referrals by 36%, and the number of surgeries performed by 36%. The regional incidence of traumatic injury fell from 5.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.79 to 5.35) to 2.94 (95% CI 2.52 to 3.32) per 100,000 population per day. Significant reductions were seen in injuries related to sports and alcohol consumption. No admissions occurred relating to major trauma (Injury Severity Score > 16) or violence against the person. Changes in population mobility and trauma volume from baseline correlated significantly (Pearson's correlation 0.749, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85, p < 0.001). However, admissions related to fragility fractures remained unchanged compared to the 2019 baseline. Conclusion: The profound changes in social behaviour and mobility during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have directly correlated with a significant decrease in orthopaedic trauma referrals, but fragility fractures remained unaffected and provision for these patients should be maintained.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:182-189.","Scott, Chloe E H; Holland, George; Powell-Bowns, Matilda F R; Brennan, Caitlin M; Gillespie, Matthew; Mackenzie, Samuel P; Clement, Nick D; Amin, Anish K; White, Tim O; Duckworth, Andrew D",Bone Jt Open,523,16

We sought to provide direct proof of the global population's altered use of Wikipedia medical knowledge resulting from the new COVID-19 pandemic and related global restrictions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify temporal search trends and quantify changes in access to Wikipedia Medicine Project articles that were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical articles across nine language versions of Wikipedia and country-specific statistics for registered COVID-19 deaths. The observed patterns were compared to a forecast model of Wikipedia use, which was trained on data from 2015 to 2019. The model comprehensively analyzed specific articles and similarities between access count data from before (ie, several years prior) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wikipedia articles that were linked to those directly associated with the pandemic were evaluated in terms of degrees of separation and analyzed to identify similarities in access counts. We assessed the correlation between article access counts and the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and deaths to identify factors that drove interest in these articles and shifts in public interest during the subsequent phases of the pandemic. RESULTS: We observed a significant (P<.001) increase in the number of entries on Wikipedia medical articles during the pandemic period. The increased interest in COVID-19-related articles temporally correlated with the number of global COVID-19 deaths and consistently correlated with the number of region-specific COVID-19 deaths. Articles with low degrees of separation were significantly similar (P<.001) in terms of access patterns that were indicative of information-seeking patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of Wikipedia medical article popularity could be a viable method for epidemiologic surveillance, as it provides important information about the reasons behind public attention and factors that sustain public interest in the long term. Moreover, Wikipedia users can potentially be directed to credible and valuable information sources that are linked with the most prominent articles.","Chrzanowski, Jedrzej; Solek, Julia; Fendler, Wojciech; Jemielniak, Dariusz",J Med Internet Res,523,29

Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. Selection criteria: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Data collection and analysis: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the 'Risk of bias' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. Main results: We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19. Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-life' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.","Burns, Jacob; Movsisyan, Ani; Stratil, Jan M; Coenen, Michaela; Emmert-Fees, Karl MF; Geffert, Karin; Hoffmann, Sabine; Horstick, Olaf; Laxy, Michael; Pfadenhauer, Lisa M; von Philipsborn, Peter; Sell, Kerstin; Voss, Stephan; Rehfuess, Eva",Cochrane Database Syst.

These systems are accurate and effective, but also costly, time-consuming, high-technological, infrastructure-dependent, and currently suffer from commercial reagent supply shortages. The reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) can be used as an alternative testing method. Here, we present a novel versatile (real-time and colorimetric) RT-LAMP for the simple (one-step), affordable (~1.7 /sample), and rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 targeting both ORF1ab and N genes of the novel virus genome. We demonstrate the assay on RT-qPCR-positive clinical samples, obtaining most positive results under 25 min. In addition, a novel 30-min one-step drying protocol has been developed to stabilize the RT-LAMP reaction mixtures, allowing them to be stored at room temperature functionally for up to two months, as predicted by the Q10.

A comprehensive review for clinical trials assessing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines is urgently needed to make an accurate judgment for mass vaccination. MAIN TEXT: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the safety of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus, Web of Science, and MedRxiv. Included articles were limited to RCTs on COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 73,633 subjects from 14 articles were included to compare the risks of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) after vaccinating different COVID-19 vaccines. Pooled risk ratios (RR) of total AEFI for inactivated vaccine, viral-vectored vaccine, and mRNA vaccine were 1.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.61, P < 0.001], 1.65 (95% CI 1.31-2.07, P < 0.001), and 2.01 (95% CI 1.78-2.26, P < 0.001), respectively.

We conducted this analysis to better understand tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 patients. MAIN TEXT: We searched major databases for manuscripts reporting the effects of tocilizumab on COVID-19 patients. A total of 25 publications were analyzed with Revman 5.3 and R for the meta-analysis. Significant better clinical outcomes were found in the tocilizumab treatment group when compared to the standard care group [odds ratio (OR) = 0.70, 95% confidential interval (C): 0.54-0.90, P = 0.007].

We evaluate the performance of the first commercial surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript Biotech) against SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We compare it to five other ELISAs, two of which are designed to detect neutralizing antibodies. Results: In 491 pre-vaccination serum samples, sVNT missed 23.6% of PRNT-positive samples when using the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 30% binding inhibition. Introducing a equivocal area between 15 and 35% maximized sensitivity and specificity against PRNT to 72.8-93.1 % and 73.5-97.6%, respectively. The overall diagnostic performance of the other ELISAs for neutralizing antibodies was below that of sVNT. Vaccinated individuals exhibited higher antibody titers by PRNT (median 119.8, IQR 56.7-160) and binding inhibition by sVNT (median 95.7, IQR 88.1-96.8) than convalescent patients (median 49.1, IQR 20-62; median 52.9, IQR 31.2-76.2). Conclusion: GenScript sVNT is suitable to screen for SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies; however, to obtain accurate results, confirmatory testing by PRNT in a equivocal area is required. This equivocal area may require adaptation for use in vaccinated individuals, due to higher antibody titers.","Hofmann, Natalie E; Grossegesse, Marica; Neumann, Markus; Schaade, Lars; Nitsche, Andreas",,523,16

In the clinic, most patients with COVID-19 show none or mild symptoms, while approximately 20% of them develop severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or septic shock due to infection-induced cytokine release syndrome (the so-called ""cytokine storm""). Neutralizing antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines may potentially curb immunopathology caused by COVID-19; however, the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets make attenuating the cytokine storm challenging. Nonspecific in vivo biodistribution and dose-limiting side effects further limit the broad application of those free antibodies. Recent advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology have offered many promising opportunities for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, potential mechanisms of COVID-19 cytokine storm are first discussed, and relevant therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials are then reviewed. Furthermore, recent research involving emerging biomaterials for improving antibody-based and broad-spectrum cytokine neutralization is summarized.

This pandemic represents a serious public health risk. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is essential to control disease progression. Radiological examination plays a crucial role in the early identification and management of infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. The keywords diagnostic imaging, radiology, respiratory infection, pneumonia, coronavirus infection and COVID-19 were used to identify radiology articles focusing on the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to determine the diagnostic value of various imaging modalities, including x-ray, computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and nuclear medicine for identification and management of infected patients. RESULTS: We identified 50 articles in the literature search. Studies that investigated the diagnostic roles and imaging features of patients with COVID-19, using either chest CT, lung ultrasound, chest x-ray, or positron emission topography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan, were discussed. Of these imaging modalities, chest x-ray and CT scan are the most commonly used for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients, with chest CT scan being more accurate and sensitive in identifying COVID-19 at early stages. Only a few studies have investigated the roles of ultrasound and PET/CT scan in diagnosing COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Chest CT scan remains the most sensitive imaging modality in initial diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19. Other diagnostic imaging modalities could add value in evaluating disease progression and monitoring critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Aljondi, Rowa; Alghamdi, Salem",J Med Internet Res,523,12

The objective of this study was to estimate the economic impact of NMS on HCRU in Quebec, Canada. Methods: HCRU data over a 6-month period associated with patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis who were stable on a biologic treatment who underwent a NMS or not were obtained from a systematic literature review (Tarallo, 2019 and Glintborg, 2018). Costs included were those associated with physician visits, hospitalization, emergency department visits, nurse visits, imaging, laboratory tests, productivity loss and transportation. These costs were obtained from Quebec sources, including governmental publications. Results: Rheumatic patients who underwent a NMS incurred greater HCRU-related costs compared to those who stayed on the originator biologic ($3,085 per patient for switchers vs. $1,768 for non-switchers), for a difference of $1,317 per patient. The main drivers of the difference in costs between switchers vs. non-switchers were associated with hospitalization and productivity loss, with an increase of $563 and $360, respectively. Conclusions: The economic impact of NMS may be associated with an increase in HRCU-related costs to which hospitalisation is the biggest contributor. This should be considered by payers when evaluating biosimilar policy options. Moreover, given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, new policies that may increase HRCU could result in increased stress on the healthcare system.","Mathurin, K.; Castonguay, A.; Parison, D.; Rahal, Y.; Lachaine, J.; Beauchemin, C.",Value in Health,523,30

Predictably, as the virus becomes less prevalent, there will be a tremendous motivation to move forward with scheduling operations from both patient care and institutional perspectives. However, one can anticipate a pandemic-related increase in surgical morbidity and mortality above prepandemic levels, particularly in older or medically frail patients even if they did not have a novel coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19) infection.

Diabetes Care 2020;43:1433-1434,20.337162,7.643285,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. METHODS: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). FINDINGS: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

The physical fitness assessment data and the competition records collected by the Korean national team pentathletes for the years 2005 to 2019 were tracked. The correlation between the competition records and fitness factors was confirmed by correlation analysis. In addition, the physical factors affecting performance were identified through multiple regression analysis, and the average difference between national and international competitions was verified by t-test. The first result was that fencing, swimming, and horseback riding rankings were more relevant to the overall pentathlon performance score than the combined rankings in national competitions. In the international competitions, performance in the combined running and shooting event was more relevant than fencing, swimming, and horseback riding. Second, the basic fitness factors of grip strength and sergeant jump and the specific fitness factors of leg strength-left and right average flexor were correlated with overall pentathlon performance national competitions. However, in international competitions, sergeant jump, 20 m shuttle run, reaction time, lung capacity, and back strength were correlated (presented in high to low order). In terms of the specific fitness factors, relative (%BW) and absolute (Nm) leg strength-left and right average flexor, lower body anaerobic fatigue rate, half squat, relative (W/kg) and absolute (Watts) maximal lower body anaerobic power were correlated accordingly with overall pentathlon performance. Third, we analyzed the differences between average performance in national and international competitions. Only the combined running and shooting event out of the five modern pentathlon events showed a difference. Grip strength and relative leg strength-average extensor AP (%BW) appeared to be different among the physical fitness factors. Fourth, we examined the level of contribution of each of the fitness factors on overall performance. The model's goodness of fit was confirmed, and grip strength was found to have a significant contribution on overall performance. Furthermore, the level of contribution was higher in the following order: relative leg strength-left and right average flexor (%BW), bench press, half squat, relative leg strength-average extensor AP(%BW), GXT-time to exhaustion, relative lower body anaerobic average power (W/kg), and maximal lactic acid concentration. With the 2020 Tokyo Olympics just around the corner, combined running and shooting performance appeared to be a decisive factor in the final ranking in modern pentathlon according to the analysis of the basic and specific fitness factors of pentathletes. The basic fitness factors are critical in order of sergeant jump, grip strength, reaction time, lung capacity, side-step, back strength, 20m shuttle run, sit-and-reach, sit-ups, and single leg standing. With respect to the specific fitness factors, relative leg strength-left and right average flexor (%BW), bench press, half squat, relative leg strength-average extensor AP (%BW), GXT-time to exhaustion, relative lower body anaerobic average power (W/kg), and maximal lactic acid concentration showed their relevance accordingly.","Ko, Byoung-Goo; Cho, Eun-Hyung; Chae, Jin-Seok; Lee, Ji-Hoon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),523,24

Social media distrust affects the dissemination of disaster information as it entails shifts in media perception and participation but also changes in the way individuals and organisations make sense of information in critical situations. So far, a little considered notion in this domain is the concept of sense-giving. Originating from organisational theory, it is used to explain the mechanisms behind intentional information provision that fosters collective meaning creation. In our study, we seek to understand the potential impact of sense-giving from Twitter crisis communication generated during the Hurricane Harvey disaster event. Social network and content analyses performed with a dataset of 9,414,463 tweets yielded insights into how sense-giving occurs during a large-scale disaster event. Theoretically, we specified (1) perpetual sense-giving, which relies primarily on topical authority and frequency; as well as (2) intermittent sense-giving, which occurs from high value of message content and leverage of popularity, that is, retweets.

What has now become apparent is that a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 is abnormal thrombosis. This thrombosis occurs on a macro- and microvascular level and is unique to this disease. The virus has been demonstrated in the endothelium of the pulmonary alveoli and as such is thought to contribute to the devastating respiratory complications encountered. D-dimer concentrations are frequently raised in COVID to levels not frequently seen previously. The optimal anticoagulation treatment in COVID remains to be determined, and the myriad of pathophysiologic effects caused by this virus in the human host have also yet to be fully elucidated.","Louw, S; Jacobson, B F; Mayne, E S; Wiggill, T M",Adv Exp Med Biol,523,24

Reliable and accurate short and long-term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths, both at the national and provincial level, are a key aspect of the strategy to handle the COVID-19 epidemic in the country. METHODS: In this paper we apply the previously validated approach of phenomenological models, fitting several non-linear growth curves (Richards, 3 and 4 parameter logistic, Weibull and Gompertz), to produce short term forecasts of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the national level as well as the provincial level. Using publicly available daily reported cumulative case and death data up until 22 June 2020, we report 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30-day ahead forecasts of cumulative cases and deaths. All predictions are compared to the actual observed values in the forecasting period. RESULTS: We observed that all models for cases provided accurate and similar short-term forecasts for a period of 5 days ahead at the national level, and that the three and four parameter logistic growth models provided more accurate forecasts than that obtained from the Richards model 10 days ahead. However, beyond 10 days all models underestimated the cumulative cases. Our forecasts across the models predict an additional 23,551-26,702 cases in 5 days and an additional 47,449-57,358 cases in 10 days. While the three parameter logistic growth model provided the most accurate forecasts of cumulative deaths within the 10 day period, the Gompertz model was able to better capture the changes in cumulative deaths beyond this period. Our forecasts across the models predict an additional 145-437 COVID-19 deaths in 5 days and an additional 243-947 deaths in 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: By comparing both the predictions of deaths and cases to the observed data in the forecasting period, we found that this modeling approach provides reliable and accurate forecasts for a maximum period of 10 days ahead.","Reddy, Tarylee; Shkedy, Ziv; Janse van Rensburg, Charl; Mwambi, Henry; Debba, Pravesh; Zuma, Khangelani; Manda, Samuel",BMC Med Res Methodol,523,16

With the accumulation of clinical diagnostic data, the imaging big data features of COVID-19 are gradually clear, and CT imaging diagnosis results become more important. To obtain clear lesion information from the CT images of patients' lungs is helpful for doctors to adopt effective medical methods, and at the same time, is helpful to screen the patients with real infection. Deep learning image segmentation is widely used in the field of medical image segmentation. However, there are some challenges in using deep learning to segment the lung lesions of COVID-19 patients. Since image segmentation requires the labeling of lesion information on a pixel by pixel basis, most professional radiologists need to screen and diagnose patients on the front line, and they do not have enough energy to label a large amount of image data. In this paper, an improved Dense GAN to expand data set is developed, and a multi-layer attention mechanism method, combined with U-Net's COVID-19 pulmonary CT image segmentation, is proposed. The experimental results showed that the segmentation method proposed in this paper improved the segmentation accuracy of COVID-19 pulmonary medical CT image by comparing with other image segmentation methods.","Zhang, Ju; Yu, Lundun; Chen, Decheng; Pan, Weidong; Shi, Chao; Niu, Yan; Yao, Xinwei; Xu, Xiaobin; Cheng, Yun",Biomed Signal Process Control,523,1

Using this novel method, the proposed model can both take in a large number of heterogeneous features, such as census data, intra-county mobility, inter-county mobility, social distancing data, past growth of infection, among others, and learn complex interactions between these features. Using data collected from various sources, we estimate the range of increase in infected cases seven days into the future for all U.S. counties. In addition, we use the model to identify the most influential features for prediction of the growth of infection. We also analyze pairs of features and estimate the amount of observed second-order interaction between them. Experiments show that the proposed model obtains satisfactory predictive performance and fairly interpretable feature analysis results; hence, the proposed model could complement the standard epidemiological models for national-level surveillance of pandemics, such as COVID-19. The results and findings obtained from the deep learning model could potentially inform policymakers and researchers in devising effective mitigation and response strategies.

This study assessed changes in HFI during the pandemic and examined the interlinkages between HFI with child feeding practices and coping strategies. DESIGN: A longitudinal survey in December 2019 (in-person) and August 2020 (by phone). SETTING: Community-based individuals from 26 blocks in 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh, India. PARTICIPANTS: Mothers with children <2 years (n=569). MAIN OUTCOMES AND ANALYSES: We measured HFI by using the HFI Access Scale and examined the changes in HFI during the pandemic using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests. We then assessed child feeding practices and coping strategies by HFI status using multivariable regression models. RESULTS: HFI increased sharply from 21% in December 2019 to 80% in August 2020, with 62% households changing the status from food secure to insecure over this period. Children in newly or consistently food-insecure households were less likely to consume a diverse diet (adjusted OR, AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.95 and AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.12, respectively) compared with those in food-secure households. Households with consistent food insecurity were more likely to engage in coping strategies such as reducing other essential non-food expenditures (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 4.24), borrowing money to buy food (AOR 4.3, 95% CI 2.31 to 7.95) or selling jewellery (AOR 5.0, 95% CI 1.74 to 14.27) to obtain foods. Similar findings were observed for newly food-insecure households. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures posed a significant risk to HFI which in turn had implications for child feeding practices and coping strategies. Our findings highlight the need for further investment in targeted social protection strategies and safety nets as part of multisectoral solutions to improve HFI during and after COVID-19.","Nguyen, Phuong Hong; Kachwaha, Shivani; Pant, Anjali; Tran, Lan M; Ghosh, Sebanti; Sharma, Praveen Kumar; Shastri, Vishal Dev; Escobar-Alegria, Jessica; Avula, Rasmi; Menon, Purnima",BMJ Open,523,16

However, existing methods use short videos as the visual modality and short summary as the ground-truth, therefore, perform poorly on lengthy videos and long ground-truth summary. Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to generalize this task on videos of varying lengths. In this paper, we introduce AVIATE, the first large-scale dataset for abstractive text summarization with videos of diverse duration, compiled from presentations in well-known academic conferences like NDSS, ICML, NeurIPS, etc. We use the abstract of corresponding research papers as the reference summaries, which ensure adequate quality and uniformity of the ground-truth. We then propose FLORAL, a factorized multi-modal Transformer based decoder-only language model, which inherently captures the intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics within various input modalities for the text summarization task. FLORAL utilizes an increasing number of self-attentions to capture multimodality and performs significantly better than traditional encoder-decoder based networks. Extensive experiments illustrate that FLORAL achieves significant improvement over the baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the existing How2 dataset for short videos and newly introduced AVIATE dataset for videos with diverse duration, beating the best baseline on the two datasets by $1.39$ and $2.74$ ROUGE-L points respectively.","Atri, Yash Kumar; Pramanick, Shraman; Goyal, Vikram; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",,523,20

Iran as one of the most affected countries needs unprecedented effort for monitoring and evaluation of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalance of COVID-19 in Semnan province North-East of Iran. METHODS: Six hundred people were randomly selected using the ""SIB data-base"". From 1 to 30 June, 2020, 153 participants of Semnan population were enrolled. Blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were obtained. Prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies were ascertained using ELISA and Real-Time PCR was conducted to evaluate viral load. Estimates of prevalence were standardized by age and sex, based on the 2015 national census of Semnan province. RESULTS: Seroprevalence showed no difference between females and males and no significant association between age and seropositivity. Among total participants, the age and sex adjusted prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.0-26.7 per 100 persons). Approximately 10% of participants had detectable antibodies but showed a negative-PCR result. However, approximately 80% of participants did not show an evidence of infection. CONCLUSION: The majority of the population in Semnan province has no detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, Semnan is considered a SARS-CoV-2 susceptible area. These results emphasize the need for maintaining public health measures to tackle the new epidemic wave.","Jandaghi, Elahe; Hemati, Maral; Mohammadlou, Maryam; Jandaghi, Jafar; Mirmohammadkhani, Majid; Danaei, Navid; Kokhaei, Parviz",Iran J Immunol,523,10

Independent oversight provided by DMCs is particularly important in trials conducted in public health emergencies, such as in HIV/AIDS or coronavirus epidemics. Special considerations are needed to enable DMCs to effectively address novel circumstances they face in such settings. In the COVID-19 pandemic, these include the remarkable speed in which data regarding benefits and risks of interventions are accumulated. DMCs must hold frequent virtual meetings, using state-of-the-art communication software that protects against risk for security breaches. Data capture and DMC reports should be focused on the most informative measures about benefits and risks. Because numerous clinical trials are being concurrently conducted in the COVID-19 setting, often addressing closely related scientific questions, structures for DMC oversight should be efficient and adequately informative. When these concurrently conducted trials are evaluating related regimens in related clinical settings, often individually underpowered for safety and having separate DMCs, processes should be implemented enabling these DMCs to share with each other emerging confidential evidence to better assess risks and benefits. Ideally a single DMC would monitor a portfolio of clinical trials or a trial with multiple arms, such as a platform trial.","DeMets, David L; Fleming, Thomas R",J Clin Epidemiol,523,20

A total of 1,421 healthcare professionals who were in contact with at least one positive COVID-19 patient participated in a cross-sectional online survey from April to June 2020. Mental health was measured with the General Health Questionnaire-12, and loneliness was assessed with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale. More than 80% of participants showed a certain prone to experience mental health problems, and 90% felt that they had not enough workplace protective measures to manage COVID-19 patients. Presence of loneliness was positively related to higher mental health problems after controlling for other covariates. Other factors related to higher mental health problems were a higher COVID-19 risk perception, being in quarantine, checking COVID-19-related news several times a day and having a lower training on managing infectious diseases. Neither living alone, nor supervisor social support, were related to healthcare professionals' mental health. Results suggest that the impact of COVID-19 in terms of mental health in the healthcare professionals could be more related to subjective appraisals of social isolation rather than to be physically alone. There were also a variety of cognitive, behavioural and training-related factors that were associated with the healthcare professionals' mental health, and that should be potentially managed in the mental healthcare interventions.","Cabello, María; Izquierdo, Ana; Leal, Itziar",Heal. soc. care community,523,20

However, existing studies on depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a wide range of prevalence estimates, making mental health planning for this population difficult. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of surveys that assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Major Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP) and English (PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo) databases and preprint platforms were searched to identify cross-sectional studies containing data on the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Chinese university students during the pandemic. Two authors independently retrieved the literature, evaluated the eligibility of potential studies, assessed the risk of bias (RoB) of included studies, and extracted data. RoB was assessed with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data. RESULTS: In total, 1177 records were retrieved, and 84 studies involving 1 292 811 Chinese university students during the pandemic were included. None of the included studies were rated as completely low RoB. Statistically significant heterogeneity in the prevalence estimates of included studies was detected (I2 = 99.9%, p < 0.001). The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms was 26.0% (95%CI: 23.3-28.9%), which was significantly higher in female than in male students (30.8% v. 28.6%, p < 0.001), in postgraduates than in undergraduates (29.3% v. 22.9%, p < 0.001), in students living inside than in those living outside the COVID-19 epicentre (27.5% v. 22.3%, P < 0.001), in students from universities at the epicentre than in those from universities outside the epicentre (26.2% v. 23.1%, p < 0.001), in students who had close contact with COVID-19 than in those who did not (46.0% v. 25.0%, p < 0.001), and in students who had acquaintances or relatives infected with COVID-19 (39.7% v. 24.0%, p < 0.001) than in those who did not. Five sources of heterogeneity were identified from the subgroup analysis: survey period, % of males among the survey sample, scale of depressive symptoms, cutoff score of the scale and level of RoB. CONCLUSIONS: Over one-fourth of Chinese university students experienced depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health services for this population should include periodic evaluation of depressive symptoms, expanded social support and psychiatric assessment and treatment when necessary. It is also necessary to design depression prevention programmes that target higher-risk cohorts of university students.","Luo, Wei; Zhong, Bao-Liang; Chiu, Helen Fung-Kum",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,523,9

Communicating well will help achieve goals. The communication that will be discussed here is the importance of good communication in the office environment, as well as how it affects employees. Sometimes people don't pay much attention to communication, but actually without good communication, work in the office will be hampered. The flow of communication in the office has vertical and horizontal flows. Vertical flow is the flow of communication carried out from superiors to subordinates or vice versa, while horizontal flow is the flow of communication carried out with colleagues or equivalent. What includes communication in the vertical flow is orders, tasks, suggestions, opinions, and complaints, while what includes horizontal communication is sharing feelings, and solidarity of cooperation.This study aims to determine and see the effect of good communication on improving employee performance, especially in the office. This research uses library research method.

The causes of such coagulation abnormalities are unknown. The receptor tissue factor, also known as CD142, is often associated with cell-released extracellular vesicles (EV). In this study, we aimed to characterize surface antigens profile of circulating EV in COVID-19 patients and their potential implication as procoagulant agents. METHODS: We analyzed serum-derived EV from 67 participants who underwent nasopharyngeal swabs molecular test for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (34 positives and 33 negatives) and from 16 healthy controls (HC), as referral. A sub-analysis was performed on subjects who developed pneumonia (n = 28). Serum-derived EV were characterized for their surface antigen profile and tested for their procoagulant activity. A validation experiment was performed pre-treating EV with anti-CD142 antibody or with recombinant FVIIa. Serum TNF-&#945; levels were measured by ELISA. FINDINGS: Profiling of EV antigens revealed a surface marker signature that defines circulating EV in COVID-19. A combination of seven surface molecules (CD49e, CD209, CD86, CD133/1, CD69, CD142, and CD20) clustered COVID (+) versus COVID (-) patients and HC. CD142 showed the highest discriminating performance at both multivariate models and ROC curve analysis. Noteworthy, we found that CD142 exposed onto surface of EV was biologically active. CD142 activity was higher in COVID (+) patients and correlated with TNF-&#945; serum levels. INTERPRETATION: In SARS-CoV-2 infection the systemic inflammatory response results in cell-release of substantial amounts of procoagulant EV that may act as clotting initiation agents, contributing to disease severity.

277293,277293,277293,Annals On Call - Clinical Reasoning and COVID-19 Part 2,20.513643,8.133962,2020,"BACKGROUND: Shortly after the emergence of COVID-19, researchers rapidly mobilized to study numerous aspects of the disease such as its evolution, clinical manifestations, effects, treatments, and vaccinations. This led to a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19-related publications. Identifying trends and areas of interest using traditional review methods (eg, scoping and systematic reviews) for such a large domain area is challenging. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct an extensive bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 literature. METHODS: We used the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) that consists of a large number of research articles related to all coronaviruses. We used a machine learning-based method to analyze the most relevant COVID-19-related articles and extracted the most prominent topics. Specifically, we used a clustering algorithm to group published articles based on the similarity of their abstracts to identify research hotspots and current research directions. We have made our software accessible to the community via GitHub. RESULTS: Of the 196,630 publications retrieved from the database, we included 28,904 in our analysis. The mean number of weekly publications was 990 (SD 789.3). The country that published the highest number of COVID-19-related articles was China (2950/17,270, 17.08%). The highest number of articles were published in bioRxiv. Lei Liu affiliated with the Southern University of Science and Technology in China published the highest number of articles (n=46). Based on titles and abstracts alone, we were able to identify 1515 surveys, 733 systematic reviews, 512 cohort studies, 480 meta-analyses, and 362 randomized control trials. We identified 19 different topics covered among the publications reviewed. The most dominant topic was public health response, followed by clinical care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical characteristics and risk factors, and epidemic models for its spread. CONCLUSIONS: We provide an overview of the COVID-19 literature and have identified current hotspots and research directions. Our findings can be useful for the research community to help prioritize research needs and recognize leading COVID-19 researchers, institutes, countries, and publishers. Our study shows that an AI-based bibliometric analysis has the potential to rapidly explore a large corpus of academic publications during a public health crisis. We believe that this work can be used to analyze other eHealth-related literature to help clinicians, administrators, and policy makers to obtain a holistic view of the literature and be able to categorize different topics of the existing research for further analyses. It can be further scaled (for instance, in time) to clinical summary documentation. Publishers should avoid noise in the data by developing a way to trace the evolution of individual publications and unique authors.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Schneider, Jens; Mifsud, Borbala; Alam, Tanvir; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair",J Med Internet Res,523,24

In addition to anxiety related to infection risks, trainees have the additional burden of learning and career planning while providing care in an uncertain and rapidly changing environment. We conducted a survey to evaluate the practical and psychosocial impact on radiation oncology fellows during the first month of the pandemic. Methods and Materials: A 4-part survey was designed and distributed to the fellows in our program. The survey was designed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on scope of activity and well-being (""Impact on You"") and to identify key lessons learned and social factors (""About You"") using Likert scales and open-ended response options. The survey included items from the Oldenburg Burnout questionnaire. Results: A total of 17 participants (71%) responded to the survey. Although there was a significant reduction in the mean time spent on in-person clinics (13.5 h/wk [pre-COVID] vs 9.3 h/wk [3 weeks into the COVID emergency response]; P = .002), this was replaced by virtual consults and other COVID-related activities. The proportion of respondents demonstrating features of burnout in the domains of ""disengagement"" and ""exhaustion"" was 71% and 64%, respectively. However, there was also evidence of resilience, with 47% respondents ""feeling energized."" Top ""concerns"" and ""negative changes"" identified related to learning, infection risk and safety, patient care, coping, and concerns about their home country. Top ""positive changes"" highlighted include work culture, appreciation for leadership caring for the team, the insistence on evidence to guide change, and the implementation of virtual health care.

Less attention has focused on ventilation. Effective distancing practices for open spaces may be ineffective for poorly ventilated spaces, both of which are commonly filled with turbulent air. While turbulence initially reduces the risk of infection near a virion-source, it eventually increases the exposure risk for all occupants in a space without ventilation. Here we estimate the time-scale for virions injected into a room of turbulent air to infect an occupant, distinguishing cases of low vs. high initial virion mass loads and virion-destroying vs. virion-reflecting walls. An open window typifies ventilation and we show that its minimum area needed to ensure safety depends only on the ratio of total viral load to threshold load for infection. Our minimalist estimates complement more detailed approaches and present opportunities for generalization.","Blackman, Eric G.; Ghoshal, Gourab",,523,1

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with inflammatory changes to the olfactory bulb, and treatments with anti-inflammatory properties are hypothesized to attenuate viral injury and promote recovery of olfaction after infection. Our study investigated the efficacy of a supplement with Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and Luteolin to support recovery of olfaction in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized-controlled pilot study in outpatients with history of confirmed COVID-19 with post-infection olfactory impairment that persisted &#8805; 90 days after SARS-CoV-2 negative testing. Patients were randomized to two times a day olfactory rehabilitation alone or weekly olfactory rehabilitation plus daily oral supplement with PEA and Luteolin. Subjects with preexisting olfactory disorders were excluded. Sniffin' Sticks assessments were performed at baseline and 30 days after treatment. Data on gender, age, and time since infection were collected. Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test was used to compare variances of Sniff scores between groups over time, and Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess for correlations between Sniff Score and gender or duration of infection. RESULTS: Among 12 patients enrolled (n=7, supplement; n=5, controls), patients receiving supplement had greater improvement in olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification score versus controls (p=0.01). Time since infection was negatively correlated with Sniff Score, and there was no correlation between gender. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment combining olfactory rehabilitation with oral supplementation with PEA and Luteolin was associated with improved recovery of olfactory function, most marked in those patients with longstanding olfactory dysfunction. Further studies are necessary to replicate these findings and to determine whether early intervention including olfactory rehabilitation and PEA+Luteolin oral supplement might prevent SARS-CoV-2 associated olfactory impairment.","D039,; Ascanio, L; Vitelli, F; Cingolani, C; Maranzano, M; Brenner, M J; Di Stadio, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,523,7

MethodsCounty-level income, rurality, insurance, health status, 2020 presidential vote percentage, and fatality rate data were collected and analyzed in a path analysis model with Covid-19 per capita fatalities as the key variable of interest. ResultsThe analysis found strong support for the proposed model structure (R2 = 37.6%). The strongest overall effects on the Covid-19 per capita fatality rate came from income levels and voting behaviors. ConclusionThe model explained a substantial amount of variability in mortalities attributed to Covid-19. Socioeconomic and political factors provided the strongest contribution to the per-capita Covid-19 death rate, controlling for the other variables studied. The Covid-19 pandemic was highly politicized by various leaders and media outlets. The current analysis showed that political trends were one of the key overall factors related to Covid-19 mortality. The strongest overall factor was median income. Income is used to enhance ones current health or acquire adequate treatment which may safeguard people from the most severe effects of Covid-19.

However, these same chemicals can exert toxic effects in non-target organisms. To determine chemical modes of action, the toxicity ratio (TR) and critical body residues (CBRs) of 57 pesticides were calculated for Daphnia magna. Results showed that the CBR values of inert compounds were close to a constant while the CBR values of pesticides varied over a wider range. Although herbicides are categorized as specifically-acting compounds to plants, herbicides did not exhibit excess toxicity to Daphnia magna and were categorized as inert compounds with an average logTR = 0.41, which was less than a threshold of one. Conversely, fungicides and insecticides exhibited strong potential for toxic effects to Daphnia magna with an average logTR >2. Many of these chemicals act via disruption of the nervous, respiratory, or reproductive system, with high ligand-receptor binding activity which leads to higher toxicity for Daphnia magna. Molecular docking using acetylcholinesterase revealed that fungicides and insecticides bind more easily with the biological macromolecule when compared with inert compounds. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed that the toxicity of fungicides was mainly dependent upon the heat of formation and polar surface area, while the toxicity of insecticides was more related to hydrogen-bond properties. This comprehensive analysis reveals that there are specific differences in toxic mechanisms between fungicides and insecticides. These results are useful for determining relative risk associated with pesticide exposure to aquatic crustaceans, such as Daphnia magna.","Wang, Jia; Yang, Yi; Huang, Ying; Zhang, Xiao; Huang, Yu; Qin, Wei C; Wen, Yang; Zhao, Yuan H",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,523,16

COVID-19 is gradually posing a serious threat to global public health. In this review the characteristics and mechanism of kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized and contrasted. In particular, urine-oral transmission, prevention and management of the kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 are emphasized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed® for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords ""SARS,"" ""MERS,"" ""COVID-19"" or ""kidney injury."" ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for ongoing studies. We also used relevant data from websites, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: Similar to 2 other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 caused severe respiratory syndrome with rapid progression and kidney injury. The infection process of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by specifically binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Cases of COVID-19 combined with kidney impairment are associated with a higher risk of mortality than those without comorbidities. The pathological changes of the kidney are mainly due to local SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirectly by pro-inflammatory cytokine response. In addition, studies have confirmed the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in urine, raising the possibility of urine-oral transmission. Ultimately this is significant for preventing potential urine-oral transmission and improving the cure rate of acute kidney injury with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging evidence supports that in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections the prevalence of kidney injury is high and usually leads to a poor prognosis. Optimal prevention and management of kidney injury will benefit patients with COVID-19.","Lv, Wenchang; Wu, Min; Ren, Yuping; Zeng, Ning; Deng, Pei; Zeng, Hong; Zhang, Qi; Wu, Yiping",J Urol,523,16

Failure to distinguish the 2 diseases may increase the risk of transmission. A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits. We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza. All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared. We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Finally, we validated the diagnostic model using the validation set. RESULTS We preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer. The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS This initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza. Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza. This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and influenza. Owing to the study's retrospective nature, further prospective study is needed to validate the accuracy of the model.","Li, Jingwen; Li, Simin; Qiu, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenyan; Li, Linfeng; Qin, Bo",Med Sci Monit,523,30

This has had an impact upon paediatricians and in particular respiratory paediatricians. The effects in Europe, with its mature healthcare system, have been far faster and greater than most authorities anticipated. Within six weeks of COVID-19 being declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation [WHO] in China, Europe had become the new epicentre of disease. A pandemic was finally declared by the WHO on March 11th 2020. Continued international travel combined with the slow response of some political leaders and a variable focus on economic rather than health consequences resulted in varying containment strategies in response to the threat of the initial wave of the pandemic. It is likely that this variation has contributed to widely differing outcomes across Europe. Common to all countries was the stark lack of preparations and initial poor co-ordination of responses between levels of government to this unforeseen but not unheralded global health crisis. In this article we highlight the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Austria, Germany, and the United Kingdom.","Carroll, W D; Strenger, V; Eber, E; Porcaro, F; Cutrera, R; Fitzgerald, D A; Balfour-Lynn, I M",Paediatr Respir Rev,523,21

Agricultural Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) are commonly used to reduce excessive nutrient runoff and improve water quality. The successful uptake of BMPs not only depends on their effectiveness but also on their costs of implementation. This study conducts a set of cost-effectiveness analyses to help stakeholders identify their preferred combinations of BMPs in the Qu'Appelle River Basin, a typical watershed in the Canadian Prairies. The considered BMPs are related to cattle and cropping farms and are initially selected by agricultural producers in this region. The analyses use a water quality model to estimate the impact of implementing BMPs on nutrient export, and the cost estimation model to approximate the cost of implementing BMPs at tributary and watershed scales. Our results show that BMPs' effectiveness, total costs of implementation and costs per kilogram of nutrient abatement vary between tributaries. However, wetland conservation is among the optimal practices to improve water quality across the watershed. It is also found that the rates of BMP adoption by stakeholders can influence the effectiveness of practices in a large watershed scale, which highlights the importance of stakeholder engagement in water quality management. This type of analyses can help stakeholders choose single or a combination of BMPs according to their available budget and acceptable levels of reduction in nutrients.","Zammali, Mohamed Khalil; Hassanzadeh, Elmira; Shupena-Soulodre, Etienne; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich",J Environ Manage,523,16

The aim of the analysis was to develop a prognostic model for the prediction of the severe course of acute respiratory infection. DESIGN: A population-based study. SETTING: Czech Republic. PARTICIPANTS: The first 7455 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who were identified by reverse transcription-PCR testing from 1 March 2020 to 17 May 2020. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Severe course of COVID-19. RESULT: Of a total 6.2% of patients developed a severe course of COVID-19. Age, male sex, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent history of cancer, chronic heart failure, acid-related disorders treated with proton-pump inhibitors and diabetes mellitus were found to be independent negative prognostic factors (Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) was 0.893). The results were visualised by risk heat maps, and we called this diagram a 'covidogram'. Acid-related disorders treated with proton-pump inhibitors might represent a negative prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: We developed a very simple prediction model called 'covidogram', which is based on elementary independent variables (age, male sex and the presence of several chronic diseases) and represents a tool that makes it possible to identify-with a high reliability-patients who are at risk of a severe course of COVID-19.

This review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19. Observations: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may provide additional preventive strategies. Conclusions and Relevance: As of July 1, 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public health and clinical interventions.","Wiersinga, W Joost; Rhodes, Andrew; Cheng, Allen C; Peacock, Sharon J; Prescott, Hallie C",JAMA,523,22

Objective: To compare the accuracy, efficacy and safety of novel robotic prototype with human operator in laser operation performance for skin photo-rejuvenation. Methods: Seventeen subjects were enrolled in a prospective, comparative split-face trial. Q-switch 1064nm laser conducted by the robotic prototype was provided on the right side of the face and that by the professional practitioner on the left. Each subject underwent a single time, one-pass, non-overlapped treatment on an equal size area of the forehead and cheek. Objective assessments included: treatment duration, laser irradiation shots, laser coverage percentage, VISIA parameters, skin temperature and the VAS pain scale. Results: Average time taken by robotic manipulator was longer than human operator; the average number of irradiation shots of both sides had no significant differences. Laser coverage rate of robotic manipulator (60.2 +-15.1%) was greater than that of human operator (43.6 +-12.9%). The VISIA parameters showed no significant differences between robotic manipulator and human operator. No short or long-term side effects were observed with maximum VAS score of 1 point. Limitations: Only one section of laser treatment was performed. Conclusion: Laser operation by novel robotic prototype is more reliable, stable and accurate than human operation.","Chan, Si Un; Ip, Cheong Cheong; Lian, Chengxiang; Muddassir, Muhammad; Dominguez, Domingo Gomez; Ming, Wai Kit; Du, Jianhao; Zheng, Yue; Navarro-Alarcon, David; Deng, Lie Hua",,523,24

PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

Clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients vary among infected individuals. Therefore, it is vital to identify patients at high risk of disease progression. Methods: In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, COVID-19 patients from Huoshenshan Hospital and Taikang Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) were included. Clinical features showing significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups were screened out by univariate analysis. Then, these features were used to generate classifier models to predict whether a COVID-19 case would be severe or nonsevere based on machine learning. Two test sets of data from the two hospitals were gathered to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. Results: A total of 455 patients were included, and 21 features showing significant differences between the severe and nonsevere groups were selected for the training and validation set. The optimal subset, with eleven features in the k-nearest neighbor model, obtained the highest area under the curve (AUC) value among the four models in the validation set. D-dimer, CRP, and age were the three most important features in the optimal-feature subsets. The highest AUC value was obtained using a support vector-machine model for a test set from Huoshenshan Hospital. Software for predicting disease progression based on machine learning was developed. Conclusion: The predictive models were successfully established based on machine learning, and achieved satisfactory predictive performance of disease progression with optimal-feature subsets.","Xu, F.; Chen, X.; Yin, X.; Qiu, Q.; Xiao, J.; Qiao, L.; He, M.; Tang, L.; Li, X.; Zhang, Q.; Lv, Y.; Xiao, S.; Zhao, R.; Guo, Y.; Chen, M.; Chen, D.; Wen, L.; Wang, B.; Nian, Y.; Liu, K.",International journal of general medicine,523,1

Evidence of the benefits of vitamin C (VC) for the treatment of sepsis is accumulating. However, data revealing the targets and molecular mechanisms of VC action against sepsis are limited. In this report, a bioinformatics analysis of network pharmacology was conducted to demonstrate screening targets, biological functions, and the signaling pathways of VC action against sepsis. As shown in network assays, 63 primary causal targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified from the data, and four optimal core targets for the VC action against sepsis were identified. These core targets were epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK1), proto-oncogene c (JUN), and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). In addition, all biological processes (including a top 20) and signaling pathways (including a top 20) potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis were identified. The hub genes potentially involved in the VC action against sepsis and interlaced networks from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Mapper assays were highlighted. Considering all the bioinformatic findings, we conclude that VC antisepsis effects are mechanistically and pharmacologically implicated with suppression of immune dysfunction-related and inflammation-associated functional processes and other signaling pathways. These primary predictive biotargets may potentially be used to treat sepsis in future clinical practice.","Li, Rong; Guo, Chao; Li, Yu; Qin, Zuqian; Huang, Wenjun",Brief. bioinform,523,30

Although the focus of public health systems must lie on patients' care and treatment, SARS-COV­2 infection has also affected surgical trainees in their academic and professional development, causing significant disruption in all forms of their training. Methods: The aims of this study were firstly to assess the impact of SARS-CoV­2 on core surgical training, regarding operative, educational and academic skills, as well as the general effect on psychological status and well-being of surgical trainees at a tertiary center in Greece. All core surgical trainees (17) in the general surgery department at the University Hospital of Patras were invited to participate in a voluntary anonymous survey via printed questionnaires. Results: Junior trainees and senior surgical trainees performed or assisted in almost 50% fewer cases in the COVID era when compared with the period reported before the virus. As far as courses, conferences and exams attended by trainees are concerned, a significant reduction in numbers (six vs 35) before and after the start of COVID-19 pandemic was apparent. In all, 10 (62.5%) trainees felt that their confidence in the operating theatre had been negatively impacted by the pandemic, while four (25%) trainees felt significant stress levels as a result of the national lockdown. Conclusions: It is imperative for surgical educators to design and implement new alternative ways to assist surgical trainees in their education and also avoid their undertraining during the pandemic.","Vailas, Michail; Sotiropoulou, Maria; Mulita, Francesk; Drakos, Nikolaos; Ambalov, Elina; Maroulis, Ioannis",Eur Surg,523,1

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a close reading of the news media and official reports from government departments, Parliament select committees and the National Audit Office, among others, this paper frames the UK government's uses of accounting and accountability in its response to COVID-19. This is by using the categories of “apparatuses of security”, Foucault's schematic of government for economising on the uses of state power. Findings: The paper shows that an important role for accounting is in the process of enabling the government to gauge the extent of the crisis and produce calculations to underpin its response, what Foucault called “normalisation”. This role was unlike statistics and economics. The government relied most on monthly statistical reporting and budgeting flexibilities. By contrast, the multi-year Spending Review and financial reporting were not timely enough. That said, financial reporting fed into financial sustainability projections and enabled audit that could provide potential accountability regarding regularity, probity, value for money and fairness. The authors’ findings suggest that, conceptually, accountability should be added to the object–subject element of Foucault's apparatuses of security because of its significance for governments' ability to pursue crisis objectives that require popular assent. Practical implications: In view of the ongoing uncertainty, with the crisis extending over longer budget and financial reporting periods, a Spending Review is becoming ever more necessary for better planning, without limiting, however, the budget flexibilities that have proven so useful for rapid government responses. Moreover, the government should continue its accounting reforms post COVID-19 so that improved accountability and audit can contribute to enhanced future financial resilience. Originality/value: This is the first paper to apply Foucault's notion of apparatuses of security to an analysis of government accounting and accountability practices. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ahrens, T.; Ferry, L.","Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal",523,10

Accurately simulating the rules of water invasion and drainage gas recovery countermeasures in fractured WDGRs, thereby revealing the mechanism of water invasion and an appropriate development strategy, is important for formulating water management measures and enhancing the recovery of gas reservoirs. In this work, physical simulation methods were proposed to gain a better understanding of water invasion and to optimize the water control of fractured WDGRs. Five groups of experiments were designed and conducted to probe the impacts of the distance between the fractures and the gas well, the drainage position, the drainage timing and the aquifer size on the water invasion and production performance of a gas reservoir. The gas and water production and the internal pressure drop were monitored in real time during the experiments. Based on the above experimental works, a theoretical analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the gas reservoir recovery via the gas well production performance, water invasion, dynamic pressure drop and residual gas and water distribution analysis. The results show that when the fracture scale was appropriate, a gas well drilled close to a fracture (Experiment 1-3) or a high-permeability formation could also produce gas and achieve drainage efficiently. The recovery factor of Experiment 1-3 reached 62.5%, which was 24.6% and 21.1% higher than those of Experiments 1-1 and 1-2, respectively, which had wells drilled in low-permeability areas. Draining water near an aquifer can effectively inhibit water invasion during the early stage of gas recovery. The setup in Experiment 2-1 effectively inhibited water invasion and avoided the formation of water-sealed volumes of gas to recover 30% more gas than recovered with that of Experiment 1-1 without drainage wells. A shorter distance between the drainage well and the aquifer increased the drainage capacity and decreased the gas production capacity, respectively (Well 2 at Point A vs Point B). A larger aquifer had a lower gas recovery, which reduced the economic benefit. For example, due to an infinitely large aquifer, the reserves in Experiment 4-1 were developed by a single well, the gas recovery was only 33.4%. These research results are expected to be beneficial for the preparation of development plans and the optimization of water control measures for WDGRs.","Xu, Xuan; Li, Xizhe; Hu, Yong; Mei, Qingyan; Shi, Yu; Jiao, Chunyan",Sci Rep,523,21

This multicentre, retrospective study was performed in 12 hospitals in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces from 20 January to 8 February 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up until 26 March 2020. The viral shedding duration, full clinical course and treatment efficacy were analysed in different subgroups of patients. A total of 149 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years, and 61.1% (91) were males. Of them, 133 (89.3%) had fever, 131 of 144 (91%) had pneumonia, 27 (18.1%) required intensive care unit (ICU) management, 3 (2%) were pregnant, and 3 (2%) died. Two premature newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 clearances occurred at least 2 days before fatality in 3 non-survivors. Current treatment with any anti-viral agent or combination did not present the benefit of shortening viral shedding period and clinical course (all p > .05) in real-life settings. In conclusion, the viral shedding duration and clinical course in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces were shorter than those in Hubei Province, and current anti-viral therapies were ineffective for shortening viral shedding duration and clinical course in real-world settings.

This study aims to find a new antiviral combination regimen by investigating the frequency of clinically relevant and objectively identified comorbidities, and the clustering of these clinical syndromes and varying results of treatment with antiviral drugs in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited 151 severe COVID-19 infection cases diagnosed in our hospital examination and illustrated the clinical potential during a consecutive 25-day medication period. Potential differences in disease severity and clinical characteristics, hematological profile, and current pharmacologic treatments (single agent, double or triple combinations, and the combined antiviral drugs plus Lianhua Qingwen) among comorbidity clusters were explored. RESULTS: Although disease severity was comparable among three clusters, it was markedly different in terms of laboratory test status. Coagulable abnormality was mainly present in cluster 1 and cluster 2. Other indicators were normal, except for a significant increase of neutrophils presented in cluster 2. Patients showed the most complicated haematological results in cluster 3, including severe coagulation abnormalities, leukocytosis, neutrophilic granulocytosis, and lymphopenia. Our results for the first time suggest that a quadruple combination therapy (Ribavirin, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Umifenovir, and Lianhua Qingwen) can be considered as a preferred treatment approach to severe COVID-19 patients. After treatment, abnormal coagulation and leukocyte had markedly improved with a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: This study expands the understanding of the co-occurrence of combination therapy in patients with COVID-19, which provides the probability of developing novel combined therapy. Furthermore, explore clinical trials of variable antivirus treatments based on subgroup analyses or on using subgroups in the selection criteria would be the next step.","Li, Xin; Yang, Yi; Liu, Lancong; Yang, Xuefeng; Zhao, Xiaobo; Li, Yan; Ge, Yanyan; Shi, Yuxin; Lv, Ping; Zhang, Jianchu; Bai, Tao; Zhou, Hua; Luo, Pei; Huang, Shilong",Pharmacol Res,523,21

The SpotXplorer approach compiles small fragment libraries that maximize the coverage of experimentally confirmed binding pharmacophores at the most preferred hotspots. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated with a pilot library of 96 fragment-sized compounds (SpotXplorer0) that is validated on popular target classes and emerging drug targets. Biochemical screening against a set of GPCRs and proteases retrieves compounds containing an average of 70% of known pharmacophores for these targets. More importantly, SpotXplorer0 screening identifies confirmed hits against recently established challenging targets such as the histone methyltransferase SETD2, the main protease (3CLPro) and the NSP3 macrodomain of SARS-CoV-2.","Bajusz, Dávid; Wade, Warren S; Satala, Grzegorz; Bojarski, Andrzej J; Ilas, Janez; Ebner, Jessica; Grebien, Florian; Papp, Henrietta; Jakab, Ferenc; Douangamath, Alice; Fearon, Daren; von Delft, Frank; Schuller, Marion; Ahel, Ivan; Wakefield, Amanda; Vajda, Sándor; Gerencsér, János; Pallai, Péter; Keseru, György M",Nat Commun,523,16

This study aimed to (1) explore the dietary diversity during the lockdown time in China and (2) examine factors associated with dietary diversity including socio-economic characteristics, sources for food and food purchases, and specific dietary behaviors responding to COVID-19 and isolation. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted online in March 2020. Multi-stage sampling was used to recruit participants living in Hubei Province and other parts of China. Dietary diversity was assessed using the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and clustering analysis was used to categorize people with different propensities of methods for purchasing or obtaining foods. Logistic regression was used to model the associations among HDDS, participants' characteristics, approaches to purchase or obtain food, and behaviors adopted to cope with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1938 participants were included in the analysis. The overall mean HDDS was 9.7 ± 2.1, and the median (25th, 75th) was 10 (8, 12). There were relatively low consumptions of fish, legumes, and miscellaneous foods (e.g., processed food like snacks and beverages). After adjusting for age, family income, and geographic regions, people living in places where laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were above 500 (ORadjusted = 0.79, 95%CI 0.65, 0.96), or living in Hubei Province (ORadjusted = 0.60, 95%CI 0.39, 0.93) had a lower HDDS. During isolation time, the most common sources for food and food purchases were in-house storage and in person grocery shopping. More than half of the participants (55.9%) purchased food at least once via online ordering and delivery services. There was no significant difference in HDDS among people with distinct dependences on different ways to obtain or purchase food (i.e., dependence on in-person grocery shopping, dependence on both in-house storage and in-person grocery shopping, or dependence on online food purchasing). We also identified a total of 37.7% participants who consumed certain foods or nutritional supplements to cope with COVID-19, which included vitamin C, probiotics, other dietary supplements, alcohol, and vinegar. People who reported these specific dietary behaviors had a significantly higher HDDS (ORadjusted = 1.23, 95%CI 1.02, 1.45) than those who did not do so. This study revealed an overall good dietary diversity among the studied Chinese residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we observed a lower dietary diversity among people living in areas with a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Online ordering and delivery services were popular and could serve as a feasible method to obtain and purchase food, contributing to ensure diversified diets during the time of lockdown. Certain dietary behaviors associated with COVID-19 were also identified and had significant impacts on HDDS.","Zhao, Ai; Li, Zhongyu; Ke, Yalei; Huo, Shanshan; Ma, Yidi; Zhang, Yumei; Zhang, Jian; Ren, Zhongxia",Nutrients,523,1

Contact transmission occurs when contaminated hands touch the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, or eyes. Moreover, pathogens can also be transferred from one surface to another by contaminated hands, which facilitates transmission by indirect contact. Consequently, hands hygiene is extremely important to prevent the spread of the SARSCoV-2 virus. Additionally, hand washing and/or hand rubbing disrupts also the transmission of other viruses and bacteria that cause common colds, flu and pneumonia, thereby reducing the overall disease burden. The vast proliferation of wearable devices, such as smartwatches, containing acceleration, rotation, magnetic field sensors, etc., together with the modern technologies of artificial intelligence, such as machine learning and more recently deep-learning, allow the development of accurate applications for recognition and classification of human activities such as: walking, climbing stairs, running, clapping, sitting, sleeping, etc. In this work we evaluate the feasibility of an automatic system, based on current smartwatches, which is able to recognize when a subject is washing or rubbing its hands, in order to monitor parameters such as frequency and duration, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the gesture. Our preliminary results show a classification accuracy of about 95% and of about 94% for respectively deep and standard learning techniques.","Lattanzi, Emanuele; Calisti, Lorenzo; Freschi, Valerio",,523,5

It affected economies, stopped travel, and isolated individuals and populations around the world. Wildlife, especially bats, serve as reservoirs of coronaviruses from which the variant Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged that causes COVID-19. In this review, we describe the current knowledge on COVID-19 and the significance of wildlife hosts in its emergence. Mammalian and avian coronaviruses have diverse host ranges with distinct lineages of coronaviruses. Recombination and reassortments occur more frequently in mixed-animal markets where diverse viral genotypes intermingle. Human coronaviruses have evolved through gene gains and losses primarily in interfaces where wildlife and humans come in frequent contact. There is a gap in our understanding of bats as reservoirs of coronaviruses and there is a misconception that bats periodically transmit coronaviruses to humans. Future research should investigate bat viral diversity and loads at interfaces between humans and bats. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to evaluate viral strains circulating in mixed animal markets, where the coronaviruses circulated before becoming adapted to humans. We propose and discuss a management intervention plan for COVID-19 and raise questions on the suitability of current containment plans. We anticipate that more virulent coronaviruses could emerge unless proper measures are taken to limit interactions between diverse wildlife and humans in wild animal markets.","Perveen, Nighat; Bin Muzaffar, Sabir; Ali Al-Deeb, Mohammad",,523,16

METHOD: A pilot study was carried out to determine the feasibility of the pre-assembled kit of face-mask and HEPA filter adapted on a pre-set plastic-blanket. The first step consisted of washing hands, putting on safety glasses and gloves as the first personal protection equipment (PPE) and then covering the victim with an assembled plastic blanket. The second step consisted of 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with PPE and plastic blanket, following the technical recommendations for ventilation during COVID-19. RESULTS: Ten rescuers took part in the pilot study. The average time to wear PPE and place the pre-assembly kit on the victim was 82 s [IC 58-105]. After 10 min the quality of the resuscitation (QCPR) was 91% [87-94]. Quality chest compressions (CC) were 22% better than ventilations (V). Most of the rescuers (60%) thought that placing the plastic blanket on the victim on the beach was somewhat simple or very simple.

We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 10-20% of cases with mild disease but in greater than 50-60% in severe cases, contributing to patients' demise. Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock. Off-label therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available. A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the renin--angiotensin system as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells. However, to-date, no harm has been proven for these drugs. SUMMARY: In the cardiovascular system, COVID-19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas anti-COVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular side-effects. Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidence-based guidelines.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Theodora A; Manolis, Antonis A; Melita, Helen",Curr Opin Cardiol,523,20

Higher risk of spread can be caused due to prolonged exposure to a carrier person and shorter contacts with symptomatic individuals as briefer contacts with asymptomatic contacts are less inclined to transmission. The transmission can be either presymptomatic or asymptomatic. Wearing a face mask is becoming a requisite, in hospitals as well as community settings in this context as it can reduce the SARS Co-2 transmission rates. Masks has to be worn regularly and correctly to keep away from getting the virus. China recommended everyone to wear face masks and cloth masks to the ones less likely to spread or contract the infection when the current pandemic Covid-19 got outbursted. During this pandemic, when countries are facing shortage of resources, it is necessary to adopt and implement policies to ensure the balance of demand and supply to reduce the infection transmission rates. The irrational usage of surgical and the FFP masks by the general public has resulted into a shortage of their supply for the health care workers who need them the most, across the world. Awareness should be created among the public about the necessity of using face masks, selection of the mask, rational use in accordance with the situation, proper discarding of disposable masks, and other control measures that has to be kept in mind to prevent virus transmission. Face shields (Personal protective equipment-PPE) which are used by the healthcare providers in combination with face masks or respirators for eye protection, helps reduce transmission of the virus through respiratory droplets through the mucous membrane of the eyes offering a partial protection to the facial area.","Kumaraswamy, M.; Shaji, J.

Anxiety and depression can have negative effects on pregnant women and result in poor neonatal outcomes. Therefore, we analyzed stress, anxiety and depression in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cohort study of pregnant women during COVID-19 compared to pregnant women before COVID-19. Pregnant women were recruited through social media platforms from 21 May 2020 to 22 June 2020. Pregnant women &#8805; 18 years of age, who master the Dutch language were included. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were analyzed. Demographic features were summarized using descriptive statistics. Possible differences in demographic variables between groups were compared using Mann Whitney U test and Chi-squared test. Significant demographic differences between groups were controlled for using logistical regression analysis or an independent one-way analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Thousand hundred and two pregnant women completed the questionnaires during COVID-19, and 364 pregnant women before COVID-19. We found no differences in clinically high levels of anxiety (HADS-A &#8805; 8) and depression (HADS-D &#8805; 8) in women during COVID-19 (19.5% and 13.2%, respectively) and women before COVID-19 (23.1% and 15.7%, respectively). A question was implemented whether participants related their stress level to COVID-19. Women who related their stress to the COVID-19 pandemic reported significantly higher overall stress levels on the PSS-10 compared to women with stress unrelated to COVID-19 (mean, 15.62; standard deviation [SD], 6.44 vs. mean, 10.28; SD, 5.48; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous studies, COVID-19 did not increase anxiety and depression levels in Dutch pregnant women. Women who related their perceived stress to the COVID-19 pandemic experienced higher stress levels than women who did not relate their stress to the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that interventions that specifically aim to reduce COVID-19 stress, may help to reduce overall stress levels in pregnant women during the pandemic.","Zilver, S J M; Broekman, B F P; Hendrix, Y M G A; de Leeuw, R A; Mentzel, S V; van Pampus, M G; de Groot, C J M",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,523,24

Law is not an end in itself but should contribute to predictable and thus better relations in society. In this sense, the priority protection of public interest—which is characteristic of administrative relations between individual holders of rights and obligations and administrative bodies—presents certain limitations to simplification. Through qualitative research methods (dogmatic, normative, and comparative methods, as well as case studies), this article examines examples of debureaucratization in Slovenia provided by the amendments to the General Administrative Procedure Act. In most cases, e.g., in waiving the right to appeal or broad fiction of service, modifications were not appropriate since constitutional guarantees cannot be subject to “debureaucratization”. However, crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic call for even greater simplification. The approach to address bureaucratization as an obstacle to the economy should therefore be holistic and proportionate. Debureaucratization should be implemented in individual administrative areas rather than by an umbrella law that ensures fundamental administrative principles, and through process optimization rather than deregulation. The results of the analysis are useful for comparable, particularly Central European countries. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Kovač, P.",Administrative Sciences,523,2

Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear how hospitals in the federal states of Berlin and Brandenburg are structured with regard to structural adaptions, personnel situations, protective equipment and trainings. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the current status of all hospitals in both states. Methods: In April 2020, an online survey of all hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg (n = 99) was carried out. Structural capacities, the personnel situation, protective equipment and training were investigated. Results: The hospitals (response rate: 31.3 %) have made all structural changes except for n = 1 facility. The majority of the failure rate is critically stated as 5 - 10 % before (58.6 %) and during the pandemic (51.5 %). The proportion with > 10 % default rate increases from 20.7 % to 31.0 %. 45.2 % of hospitals report that they rarely have shortage in protective clothing. Nurses at peripheral wards are often trained in handling with respiratory patients. The duration is in median 2 - 8 hours. No significant differences between Berlin and Brandenburg were found. Conclusions: At the time of the survey, the hospitals in Berlin and Brandenburg were well prepared for the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the results indicate that hospitals are well prepared to ensure the health care provision.","Gräske, Johannes; Lengert-Brzozowski, Sandra; Neumann, Fränze; Görsch, Luisa; Biniok, Maria; Koppe, Louise",Pflege,523,26

Mutagenesis studies suggest that the allosteric binding site of cannabidiol (CBD) involves residues from the N terminal domain. In order to study the allosteric binding of CBD to CB1R we modeled the whole N-terminus of this receptor using the replica exchange molecular dynamics with solute tempering (REST2) approach. Then, the obtained structures of CB1R with the N terminus were used for ligand docking. A natural cannabinoid receptor agonist, &#916;9-THC, was docked to the orthosteric site and a negative allosteric modulator, CBD, to the allosteric site positioned between extracellular ends of helices TM1 and TM2. The molecular dynamics simulations were then performed for CB1R with ligands: (i) CBD together with THC, and (ii) THC-only. Analyses of the differences in the residue-residue interaction patterns between those two cases allowed us to elucidate the allosteric network responsible for the modulation of the CB1R by CBD. In addition, we identified the changes in the orthosteric binding mode of &#916;9-THC, as well as the changes in its binding energy, caused by the CBD allosteric binding. We have also found that the presence of a complete N-terminal domain is essential for a stable binding of CBD in the allosteric site of CB1R as well as for the allosteric-orthosteric coupling mechanism.","Jakowiecki, Jakub; Abel, Renata; Orzel, Urszula; Pasznik, Pawel; Preissner, Robert; Filipek, Slawomir",Molecules (Basel),523,26

METHODS: All stroke patients treated by thrombectomy (June 2015-October 2018) were prospectively enrolled in this observational study. At 90 days, functional outcome was assessed by the mRS, and patient-reported HRQoL by the EuroQol Group 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Self-report Questionnaire, consisting of five health domains. The EQ-5D utility index (EQ-5D-I; -0.594 to 1.00 with higher values indicating better HRQoL) was calculated. Linear regression analysis was applied to identify predictors of better HRQoL (higher EQ-5D-I). RESULTS: Of 504 patients (median age 76 years, 51.8% female), the mean EQ-5D-I was 0.39 (SD 0.44). The proportion of stroke survivors who reported complaints in the different domains decreased from 66% in Usual Activities, to 57% in Mobility, 50.4% in Selfcare, 41.7% in Pain/Discomfort and 40.8% Anxiety/Depression. A lower age, a lower pre-stroke mRS, a lower baseline NIHSS, and a higher ASPECT score, concomitant thrombolysis therapy, and a successful recanalization were independent predictors of better HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported HRQoL provides a more comprehensive assessment of stroke outcome than the mRS. Health domains involving motor function showed most frequently complaints in HRQoL after stroke thrombectomy, while a large proportion of patients did not report any complaints across the different health domains. Predictors of better HRQoL closely match the predictors of better functional outcome measured by the mRS in other thrombectomy studies.","Deb-Chatterji, Milani; Konnopka, Alexander; Flottmann, Fabian; Leischner, Hannes; Fiehler, Jens; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Neurology,523,2

Methods: We administered a Canada-wide survey to all Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Directors seeking the volume of CA for STEMI performed during 01/03/2020-31/05/2020 (pandemic period) and from two control periods (01/03/2019-31/05/2019 and 01/03/2018-31/05/2018). The number of left ventricular support devices used, as well as the number of ventricular septal defects or papillary muscle rupture cases diagnosed, were also recorded. We also assessed if the number of COVID-19 cases recorded in each province was associated with STEMI CA volume. Results: Forty-one out of 42 Canadian catheterization laboratories (98%) provided data. There was a modest but statistically significant 16% reduction (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR 0.84; 95%CI 0.80-0.87) in CA for STEMI during the first wave of the pandemic compared to control periods.

The rate of rapid dissemination, magnitude of viral contagiousness, person to person transmission at an asymptomatic phase of illness pose a unique and dangerous challenge for all patients, including neonatal and obstetric patients. Although scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, nature of transmission, and efficacy of mitigation strategies is growing, neither a cure or vaccine have been developed. While COVID-19 is primarily a disease of older patients, infection is now seen across all age demographics with reports of illness in pregnant patients and infants. Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2. Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial. Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection. The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.","Elgin, T G; Fricke, E M; Hernandez Reyes, M E; Tsimis, M E; Leslein, N S; Thomas, B A; Sato, T S; McNamara, P J",J Neonatal Perinatal Med,523,5

338901,338901,338901,Emergency department lung ultrasound findings in novel coronavirus,20.144611,8.101157,2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxyurea is one of the earliest drugs that showed promise in the management of haemoglobinopathies that include ß-thalassaemia and sickle cell disease. Despite this, many aspects of hydroxyurea are either unknown or understudied; specifically, its usefulness in ß-thalassaemia major and haemoglobin E ß-thalassaemia is unclear. However, during COVID-19 pandemic, it has become a valuable adjunct to transfusion therapy in patients with ß-haemoglobinopathies. In this review, we aim to explore the available in vitro and in vivo mechanistic data and the clinical utility of hydroxyurea in ß-haemoglobinopathies with a special emphasis on its usefulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN BODY: Hydroxyurea is an S-phase-specific drug that reversibly inhibits ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme which catalyses an essential step in the DNA biosynthesis. In human erythroid cells, it induces the expression of Î³-globin, a fetal globin gene that is suppressed after birth. Through several molecular pathways described in this review, hydroxyurea exerts many favourable effects on the haemoglobin content, red blood cell indices, ineffective erythropoiesis, and blood rheology in patients with ß-haemoglobinopathies. Currently, it is recommended for sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia. A number of clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate its usefulness in transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was widely used as an adjunct to transfusion therapy due to limitations in the availability of blood and logistical disturbances. Thus, it has become clear that hydroxyurea could play a remarkable role in reducing transfusion requirements of patients with haemoglobinopathies, especially when donor blood is a limited resource. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyurea is a well-tolerated oral drug which has been in use for many decades. Through its actions of reversible inhibition of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase enzyme and fetal haemoglobin induction, it exerts many favourable effects on patients with ß-haemoglobinopathies. It is currently approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease and non-transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia. Also, there are various observations to suggest that hydroxyurea is an important adjunct in the treatment of transfusion dependent ß-thalassaemia which should be confirmed by randomised clinical trials.","Yasara, Nirmani; Premawardhena, Anuja; Mettananda, Sachith",Orphanet J Rare Dis,523,1

Therefore, different scientific discovery strategies need to be connected, to generate a rational treatment which can be made available as rapidly as possible. This relies on a solid theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and host responses, which is coupled to the practical experience of clinicians that are treating patients. Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection. However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed. This means that preventing uptake of ACE2 into the cell by blocking AT1R would be a more logical approach to limit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. Since ACE2 plays an important protective role in maintaining key biological processes, treatments should not disrupt the functional capacity of ACE2, to counterbalance the negative effects of the infection. Based on known mechanisms and knowledge of the characteristics of SARS-CoV we propose the hypothesis that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms. The proposed mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 causes disease immediately suggests a possible treatment, since the AT1R is a key player in this whole process. AT1R antagonists appear to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of angiotesnin II and, in addition, they might even be involved in preventing the cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function. AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe. Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Offringa, Annette; Montijn, Roy; Singh, Sandeep; Paul, Martin; Pinto, Yigal M; Pinto-Sietsma, Sara-Joan",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Pharmacother,523,24

We hypothesized that the conserved response is associated with disease severity and is distinct between patients with different outcomes. To test this, we integrated 4,780 blood transcriptome profiles from patients aged 0 to 90 years infected with one of 16 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, chikungunya, and influenza, across 34 cohorts from 18 countries, and single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of 702,970 immune cells from 289 samples across three cohorts. Severe viral infection was associated with increased hematopoiesis, myelopoiesis, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We identified protective and detrimental gene modules that defined distinct trajectories associated with mild versus severe outcomes. The interferon response was decoupled from the protective host response in patients with severe outcomes.

A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. RESULTS: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures.","Alexander, Jan; Tinkov, Alexey; Strand, Tor A; Alehagen, Urban; Skalny, Anatoly; Aaseth, Jan",Nutrients,523,22

The aim was to assess the association between physical activity and self-reported CR fitness on COVID-19 infection characteristics. METHODS: Participants formerly testing positive for COVID-19 completed an online questionnaire measuring COVID-19 infection characteristics and complications, self-reported CR fitness level, physical activity, and sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Self-reported CR fitness was determined as the pace to cover 4.8 km without becoming overly fatigued (with slow walking, brisk walking, jogging, and running corresponding to low, moderate, good, and excellent levels of fitness, respectively). RESULTS: A total of 263 individuals completed the survey. Compared with the lowest level of self-reported CR fitness, the odds of hospitalization significantly decreased by 64% (odds ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.98; P = .04) in individuals reporting the ability to maintain a brisk walk. In individuals reporting the ability to maintain a jogging pace, the further reduction in hospitalization was not significant (odds ratio = 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-1.04; P = .05).

This study investigated the role of electroacupuncture in the immune balance of SHRs using Western blot, flow cytometry, and ELISA techniques. Electroacupuncture significantly improved blood pressure, downregulated the expression of RORÎ³t, and upregulated the expression of Foxp3, reduced the production of Th17 cells, promoted the production of Treg cells, reduced the secretion of IL-6 and IL-17, and increased the secretion of TGF-ß1 and IL-10. These findings suggest that electroacupuncture therapy effectively improved the systolic blood pressure of SHRs, and its mechanism may be related to promotion of the immune balance between Th17 and Treg.","Wang, Yang; Zhang, Lili; Li, Li; Hu, Hantong; Pan, Pan; Zhang, Baoyu; Ning, Wenhua; Zhao, Mengxiong; Wang, Shu",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,523,24

The risk haplotype was also associated with impaired spontaneous but not treatment-induced SARS-CoV-2 clearance in a clinical trial with pegIFN-{lambda}1. We demonstrate that two exonic variants, rs10774671 and rs1131454, affect splicing and nonsense-mediated decay of OAS1. We suggest that genetically-regulated loss of OAS1 expression contributes to impaired spontaneous clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and elevated risk of hospitalization for COVID-19.

The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a hospital haemodialysis (HD) unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID-19 (almost 1,000 patients in 100,000h). In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit. We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Fever was the most frequent symptom, 50% had lymphopenia and 18.4% <95% O2 saturation. Sixteen (43.2%) patients required hospital admission and 6 (16.2%) died. We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport. In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a high prevalence of COVID-19 with a high percentage detected by screening; hence the need for proactive diagnosis to stop the pandemic. Most cases are managed as outpatients, however severe symptoms are also appearing and mortality to date is 16.2%. In terms of staff, 20% have required sick leave in relation to COVID-19.","Albalate, Marta; Arribas, Patricia; Torres, Esther; Cintra, Melissa; Alcázar, Roberto; Puerta, Marta; Ortega, Mayra; Procaccini, Fabio; Martin, Juan; Jiménez, Eva; Fernandez, Inés; de Sequera, Patricia",Nefrologia,523,24

OBJECTIVE: To report the histopathological description of a series of chilblain-like lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. DESIGN: The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection with available skin biopsy. RESULTS: Two main histopathological patterns were observed: a chilblain-like histopathological pattern (10 cases out of 13, 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 cases out of 13, 23% of cases). The chilblain-like histopathological pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction possibly due to the fact that these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. CONCLUSION: The relationship of chilblain-like lesions to SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigations. Histopathological features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus and less frequently a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the two histopathological patterns described.","Sohier, Pierre; Matar, Stéphanie; Meritet, Jean-François; Laurent-Roussel, Sara; Dupin, Nicolas; Aractingi, Selim",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

This stress is associated with the intense fear of occupational exposure to the virus. These professionals are at risk of becoming physically and mentally ill not only due to the infection but also due to prolonged exposure to multidimensional stress and continued work overload. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms that indicate mental disorders and burnout syndrome, as well as to determine risk factors for burnout among postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This will be a prospective cohort study with parallel groups. Recruitment will take place from July to August/2020. The sample size will be of, at least, 1.144 participants. The research instruments that will be used are the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI).Two waves of data collection will occur: the first wave will included data related to sample characterization and psychosocial evaluation; the final wave will occur 12 weeks later and will include an evaluation of the incidence of burnout as well as correlations with the potential predictive factors collected in the first wave. Additionally, data regarding work withdrawal will be collected. RESULTS: The project has data collection in progress. Recruitment started on July 29, 2020.

While numerous studies have investigated trust as either a dependent or independent variable, little attention has been paid to its relationship with health-related behaviors in the context of a public health crisis. How trust in different entities influences people's social distancing intention is therefore an important question that merits academic scrutiny. Moreover, the relationship between trust and social distancing intention cannot be well understood without an account of the information environment. As previous studies have reached a consensus about the limited effects of information exposure on individual outcomes, this research focuses on possible moderating effects. Results show that information exposure, no matter via interpersonal or media sources, has no direct effects on behavioral intention. Rather, risk communication serves as a moderator of the relationship between trust and social distancing intention.","Wei, Lu; Lee, Tien-Tsung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),523,7

Healing Hearts Together (HHT) is an 8-week couples-based intervention designed to improve relationship quality, mental health, quality of life, and cardiovascular health among couples in which one partner has experienced a cardiac event. A randomized controlled trial began in October 2019 to test the efficacy of the in-person, group-based HHT program as compared to usual care. In March of 2020, all recruitment, assessments, and interventions halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by optimal virtual care principles, as well as by Hom and colleagues' four-stage framework-consultation, adaptation, pilot-testing, and test launch-this paper is a tutorial for the step-by-step transition planning and implementation of a clinical research intervention from an in-person to a web-based format, using the HHT program as an example. Clinical and research considerations are reviewed, including (1) privacy, (2) therapeutic aspects of the intervention, (3) group cohesion, (4) research ethics, (5) participant recruitment, (6) assessment measures, (7) data collection, and (8) data analyses.

This study aimed to evaluate performance of Abbott PanbioTM Ag-RDTs with regard to nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in the early stages of the disease. A cohort of 149,026 infected symptomatic patients, reported in Catalonia from November 2020 to January 2021, was selected. The positivity rates of the two tests were compared with respect to the dates of symptom onset. Ag-RDTs presented positivity rates of 84% in the transmission phases of the disease and 31% in the pre-symptomatic period, compared to 93% and 91%, respectively, for NAAT. The detection of many false negatives with Ag-RDTs during the pre-symptomatic period demonstrates the risk of virus dissemination with this diagnostic technique if used outside the symptomatic period.","Basile, Luca; Guadalupe-Fernández, Víctor; Valdivia Guijarro, Manuel; Martinez Mateo, Ana; Ciruela Navas, Pilar; Mendioroz Peña, Jacobo",Viruses,523,16

Despite the implementation of automated detection systems and previous efficiencies, including barcoding, electronic data transfer, and extensive robotics, capacities have struggled to meet the demand. Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to address this need. The greatest concern with this approach in clinical settings is the potential for reduced sensitivity, particularly detection failures with weakly positive samples. To investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with a focus on pools containing weakly positive specimens. Additionally, the frequencies of occurrence of weakly positive samples during the pandemic were reviewed. Weakly positive specimens, with threshold cycle (CT ) values of 33 or higher, were detected in 95% of 60 five-sample pools but only 87% of 39 nine-sample pools. The proportion of positive samples with very low viral loads rose markedly during the first few months of the pandemic, peaking in June, decreasing thereafter, and remaining level since August. At all times, weakly positive specimens comprised a significant component of the sample population, ranging from 29% to >80% for CT values above 31. In assessing the benefits of pooling strategies, however, other aspects of the testing process must be considered. Accessioning, result data management, electronic data transfer, reporting, and billing are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures. Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to implementing such a strategy.","Griesemer, Sara B; Van Slyke, Greta; St George, Kirsten",J. clin. microbiol,523,21

Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.","Zhou, Peng; Yang, Xing-Lou; Wang, Xian-Guang; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Wei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Li, Bei; Huang, Chao-Lin; Chen, Hui-Dong; Chen, Jing; Luo, Yun; Guo, Hua; Jiang, Ren-Di; Liu, Mei-Qin; Chen, Ying; Shen, Xu-Rui; Wang, Xi; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Zhao, Kai; Chen, Quan-Jiao; Deng, Fei; Liu, Lin-Lin; Yan, Bing; Zhan, Fa-Xian; Wang, Yan-Yi; Xiao, Geng-Fu; Shi, Zheng-Li",Nature,523,16

We aim to investigate the immunological characteristics of monocytes in critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The number and immune status of monocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy individuals. RESULTS: In critical patients with COVID-19, the absolute number of total monocytes and CD16- monocytes was significantly decreased but CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes was increased compared to healthy controls. Antigen presentation potential of monocytes, as measured by HLA-DR expression, was suppressed, while their inflammatory phenotype (CD38 expression) was enhanced. Cytokine levels showed sustained increases in critical patients. And the levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with CD16+ monocytes number. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HLA-DR expression of monocytes. During the recovery of COVID-19 patients, the count and immune status of monocyte subsets were restored by degrees. HLA-DR+ monocytes possessed good sensitivity and specificity for predicting the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In critical patients with COVID-19, decline in number and HLA-DR expression of monocytes might lead to decreased antigen presentation potential and thus immunosuppression, while increased CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes might mediate hyperinflammation. HLA-DR+ monocytes might be a meaningful assisted indicator to predict the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19.","Qin, Shuang; Jiang, Yujie; Wei, Xin; Liu, Xiaoyuan; Guan, Jingjing; Chen, Yingxiao; Lu, Hong; Qian, Jingjing; Wang, Zhongyong; Lin, Xiangyang",Hum. immunol,523,20

COVID-19 infection has been associated with poor outcomes after orthopedic surgery and elective, general surgery, but the impact of COVID-19 on outcomes after trauma is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to Pennsylvania trauma centers from March 21-July 31, 2020. The exposure of interest was COVID-19 (COV +) and the primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were length of stay and complications. We compared demographic and injury characteristics between positive, negative, and not-tested patients. We used multivariable regression with coarsened exact matching to estimate the impact of COV+ on outcomes. RESULTS: Of 15,550 included patients, 8,170 (52.5%) were tested for COVID-19 and 219 (2.7%) were positive (COV+). Compared to COVID-19 negative (COV-) patients, COV+ patients were similar in terms of age and sex, but were less often white (53.5% vs. 74.7%, p < 0.0001), and more often uninsured (10.1 vs 5.6%, p = 0.002). Injury severity was similar, but firearm injuries accounted for 11.9% of COV+ patients vs. 5.1% of COV- patients (p < 0.001). Unadjusted mortality for COV+ was double that of COV- patients (9.1% vs 4.7%, p < 0.0001) and length of stay was longer (median of 5 vs. 4 days, p < 0.001). Using coarsened exact matching, COV+ patients had an increased risk of death (OR 6.05, 95% CI 2.29, 15.99), any complication (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.08, 3.16), and pulmonary complications (OR 5.79, 95% CI 2.02, 16.54) compared to COV- patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with concomitant traumatic injury and COVID-19 infection have elevated risks of morbidity and mortality. Trauma centers must incorporate an understanding of these risks into patient and family counseling and resource allocation during this pandemic.

The illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade, the devastation of forests and other wild places, and rapid human mobility were the driving forces behind the increasing number of diseases leaping from wildlife to humans. This article analyzes present human-nature interactions during COVID-19 and projecting future interactions after the pandemic, based on review on academic literature and reports from international development organizations. We found that global pandemic such as COVID-19 is altering human-nature interactions in three major global ecological issues: wildlife, urban emission, and land use. For wildlife, COVID-19 affects human perception towards wildlife consumption and trade, as well as animal conservation. For land use, COVID-19 makes countries reduced efforts for forest monitoring and conservation. For urban emission, lockdown/mobility limitation and physical or social distancing policies are proven to some extent resulted in better human-nature interactions that reduce environmental problems. Reduced emission occurred from decreased industrial activities and mobilities. But this positive impact on environment may end once COVID-19 ends and human activities return to previous pattern. Therefore, structural change is required to prepare a resilient sustainable development by continuing existing positive human behavior during COVID-19 as a new normal of human-nature relationships. It is proven to reduce emission and if it is continued, it can have long term impacts on climate change mitigation.Alternate abstract:Ð§Ð°ÑÑ‚Ð¾Ñ‚Ð° Ð²Ð¾Ð·Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ½Ð¾Ð²ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ Ð¿Ð°Ð½Ð´ÐµÐ¼Ð¸Ð¹ Ð² Ð¼Ð¸Ñ€Ðµ Ð²Ð¾Ð·Ñ€Ð°ÑÑ‚Ð°ÐµÑ‚.

Neuromechanism of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism via our established non-human primate model of COVID-19. In rhesus monkey, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, viruses rapidly spread to functional areas of the central nervous system, such as hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 induces the inflammation possibly by targeting neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 infects neuro-derived SK-N-SH, glial-derived U251, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion in the NHP model, which provides important insights into the CNS-related pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Jiao, Li; Yang, Yun; Yu, Wenhai; Zhao, Yuan; Long, Haiting; Gao, Jiahong; Ding, Kaiyun; Ma, Chunxia; Li, Jingmei; Zhao, Siwen; Wang, Haixuan; Li, Haiyan; Yang, Mengli; Xu, Jingwen; Wang, Junbin; Yang, Jing; Kuang, Dexuan; Luo, Fangyu; Qian, Xingli; Xu, Longjiang; Yin, Bin; Liu, Wei; Liu, Hongqi; Lu, Shuaiyao; Peng, Xiaozhong",Signal Transduct Target Ther,523,5

Corona is a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections, from the common cold to the SARS epidemic that broke out in 2003, and now the newest member of the family (SARS-Cov-2) is present in Iran. Like other countries, it is expanding rapidly. Currently, COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most important health issues in Iran and around the World (1-4). The ""Corona crisis"" has led to various effects in the World, including economic, political, educational, cultural, lifestyle, and so on. But over time, the Corona outbreak appears to have led to an economic shock in the World. According to economists, there are three types of economic shocks caused by the virus; type L economic shock, in which economic growth slows and never improves; type U economic shock, in which economic growth decreases and subsequently improves, but never returns to its previous state; and type V economic shock, in which economic growth gradually decreases, but gradually returns to normal (5-8). It seems, in Iran, due to COVID-19 crisis, the hospitals as a heart of health services providing system were faced with the L type of economic shock.","Nasiri, T; Shams, L; Hosseini-Shokouh, S M",Ann Ig,523,16

However, data are lacking on the impact of COVID-19 on hip fractures, seen mainly in older patients. Using national claims data, we aimed to describe the epidemiology during the first COVID-19 wave in the USA. METHODS: We compared patients admitted for hip fractures during March and April of 2020 with those admitted in 2019 in terms of patient and healthcare characteristics, COVID-19 diagnosis, and outcomes. An additional comparison was made between COVID-19-positive and -negative patients. Outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), admission to an ICU, ICU LOS, use of mechanical ventilation, 30-day readmission, discharge disposition, and a composite variable of postoperative complications. RESULTS: Overall, 16 068 hip fractures were observed in 2019 compared with 7498 in 2020. Patients with hip fractures in 2020 (compared with 2019) experienced earlier hospital discharge and were less likely to be admitted to ICU, but more likely to be admitted to home. Amongst 83 patients with hip fractures with concomitant COVID-19 diagnosis, we specifically observed more non-surgical treatments, almost doubled LOS, a more than 10-fold increased mortality rate, and higher complication rates compared with COVID-19-negative patients.

Adult male SD rats were categorized into group 1 (sham-operated control), group 2 (IRI only) and group 3 (IRI + melatonin [ie mitochondrial donor rat received intraperitoneal administration of melatonin] pretreated mitochondria [10 mg/per rat by portal vein]). By the end of study period at 72 hours, 31 P-MRS showed that, as compared with group 1, the hepatic levels of ATP and NADH were significantly lower in group 2 than in groups 1 and 3, and significantly lower in group 3 than in group 1. The liver protein expressions of mitochondrial-electron-transport-chain complexes and mitochondrial integrity exhibited an identical pattern to 31 P-MRS finding. The protein expressions of oxidative stress, inflammatory, cellular stress signalling and mitochondrial-damaged biomarkers displayed an opposite finding of 31 P-MRS, whereas the protein expressions of antioxidants were significantly progressively increased from groups 1 to 3. Microscopic findings showed that the fibrotic area/liver injury score and inflammatory and DNA-damaged biomarkers exhibited an identical pattern of cellular stress signalling.

About 20% of COVID-19 patients exhibit moderate to severe symptoms. Severe COVID-19 manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with elevated plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP10), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1&#945;), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), with low levels of interferon type I (IFN-I) in the early stage and elevated levels of IFN-I during the advanced stage of COVID-19. Most of the severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients have had preexisting comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory diseases. These conditions are known to perturb the levels of cytokines, chemokines, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an essential receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. ACE2 downregulation during SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the angiotensin II/angiotensin receptor (AT1R)-mediated hypercytokinemia and hyperinflammatory syndrome. However, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including open reading frame 3b (ORF3b), ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, can inhibit IFN type I and II (IFN-I and -II) production. Thus, hyperinflammation, in combination with the lack of IFN responses against SARS-CoV-2 early on during infection, makes the patients succumb rapidly to COVID-19. Therefore, therapeutic approaches involving anti-cytokine/anti-cytokine-signaling and IFN therapy would favor the disease prognosis in COVID-19. This review describes critical host and viral factors underpinning the inflammatory ""cytokine storm"" induction and IFN antagonism during COVID-19 pathogenesis. Therapeutic approaches to reduce hyperinflammation and their limitations are also discussed.","Ramasamy, Santhamani; Subbian, Selvakumar",Clin. microbiol. rev,523,13

However, despite urgent need, there remains uncertainty surrounding best practices for pharmaceutical interventions to treat COVID-19. In particular, conflicting evidence has emerged surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, alone or in combination, for COVID-19. The COVID-19 Evidence Accelerator convened by the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, in collaboration with Friends of Cancer Research, assembled experts from the health systems research, regulatory science, data science, and epidemiology to participate in a large parallel analysis of different data sets to further explore the effectiveness of these treatments. METHODS: Electronic health record (EHR) and claims data were extracted from seven separate databases. Parallel analyses were undertaken on data extracted from each source. Each analysis examined time to mortality in hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and the two in combination as compared to patients not treated with either drug. Cox proportional hazards models were used, and propensity score methods were undertaken to adjust for confounding. Frequencies of adverse events in each treatment group were also examined. RESULTS: Neither hydroxychloroquine nor azithromycin, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with time to mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. No treatment groups appeared to have an elevated risk of adverse events. CONCLUSION: Administration of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination appeared to have no effect on time to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: After PROSPERO registration (CRD42021228755), the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized. The search terms ""Grasper Integrated Flexible Cystoscope,"" and ""Isiris,"" within the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched. RESULTS: In this review, a cumulative total experience (10 publications) included 970 ""SUGIFC"" procedures (755 patients). However, only 366/970 procedures were actually used for ""ureteral stent removal,"" with the remainder being surveillance cystoscopy only (603/970) or foreign body retrieval (1/970). Procedure-related and device failures in planned ""removal of ureteral stents,"" was reported in 8/366 (346 patients) and 1/366 (346 patients), respectively. The cost-benefit utilizing the SUGIFC device is advantageous compared to ""in-theatre"" stent removals and favours less busy centres where maintenance, repair and replacement costs are more relevant. Other listed benefits include shorter stent indwelling times, shorter procedure duration, lower rates of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections, fewer emergency department visits and lower readmission rates. Technical limitations include the absence of an independent working channel, a narrower visual field and the lack of image universality since the monitor is device-specific. CONCLUSION: The SUGIFC device needs to be outweighed against local costs and individual health systems. Its application in ambulatory ureteral stent removal may become significant due to the accessibility and convenience that it offers the attending urologist.","Adam, Ahmed; Lawrentschuk, Nathan; Bhattu, Amit S; Nagdee, Jameel",ANZ j.

General measures to keep COVID-19-free cancer divisions have been adopted worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of triage to identify COVID-19 among patients with cancer. METHODS: From March 20 to April 17, 2020, data were collected from patients who were treated or followed at the authors' institution in a prospective clinical trial. The primary endpoint was to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID-19-positive patients who were identified using a triage process through the aid of medical and patient questionnaires. Based on a diagnostic algorithm, patients with suspect symptoms underwent an infectious disease specialist's evaluation and a COVID-19 swab. Serologic tests were proposed for patients who had symptoms or altered laboratory tests that did not fall into the diagnostic algorithm but were suspicious for COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 562 patients were enrolled. Six patients (1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 4 (67%) had the disease detected through telehealth triage, and 2 patients (33%) without suspect symptoms at triage had the disease detected later. Seventy-one patients (13%) had suspect symptoms and/or altered laboratory tests that were not included in the diagnostic algorithm and, of these, 47 patients (73%) underwent testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody: 6 (13%) were positive for IgG (n = 5) or for both IgM and IgG (n = 1), and antibody tests were negative in the remaining 41 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The triage process had a positive effect on the detection of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. Telehealth triage was helpful in detecting suspect patients and to keep a COVID-19-free cancer center. The overall incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (1%) and antibody positivity (13%) in patients with suspect symptoms was similar to that observed in the general population.","Indini, Alice; Cattaneo, Monica; Ghidini, Michele; Rijavec, Erika; Bareggi, Claudia; Galassi, Barbara; Gambini, Donatella; Ceriani, Rosalia; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Berti, Emilio; Grossi, Francesco",Cancer,523,20

This internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted between April 30 and May 13, 2020. The participants were 1,200 caregivers of children aged 3-14 years. Child health issues were categorized into ""at least one"" or ""none"" according to caregivers' perception. Caregivers' mental status was assessed using the Japanese version of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6. The association between caregivers' mental status and child health issues was analyzed using logistic regression models. Among the participants, 289 (24.1%) had moderate and 352 (29.3%) had severe mental distress and 69.8% of children in their care had health issues. The number of caregivers with mental distress was more than double that reported during the 2016 national survey.

They are all directed at individuals and aimed at controlling the spread of infectious diseases (1) isolation, (2) quarantine, (3) recommended voluntary social distancing, (4) changes in health care provision for asymptomatic carriers of multi-resistant microorganisms, and (5) vaccination. The interventions will be briefly described including the various risks, burdens and harms individuals who are subject to these interventions may incur. The second part briefly surveys current compensation mechanisms as far as any exist and argue that even where they exist they are clearly insufficient and do not provide adequate compensation. The third part will then develop a general framework for compensation for losses incurred due to public health interventions in the infectious disease context. This is the major analytical and constructive part of the paper. It first analyses pragmatic and ethical arguments supporting the existence of an obligation on the part of the state to compensate for such losses, and then considers whether this obligation can be defeated by (1) resource considerations, or (2) issues relating to personal responsibility.","Holm, Søren",,523,1

Despite the conserved structures of the glycans involved in docking, they are still considered ""undruggable"", meaning these glycans are beyond the scope of conventional pharmacological strategies. Recent advances in the development of synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs), small molecules that bind carbohydrates, could bring carbohydrate-receptor interactions within the purview of druggable targets. Here we discuss the role of carbohydrate-receptor interactions in viral infection, the evolution of SCRs, and recent results demonstrating their ability to prevent viral infections in vitro. Common SCR design strategies based on boronic ester formation, metal chelation, and noncovalent interactions are discussed. The benefits of incorporating the idiosyncrasies of natural glycan-binding proteins-including flexibility, cooperativity, and multivalency-into SCR design to achieve nonglucosidic specificity are shown. These studies into SCR design and binding could lead to new strategies for mitigating the grave threat to human health posed by enveloped viruses, which are heavily glycosylated viroids that are the cause of some of the most pressing and untreatable diseases, including HIV, Dengue, Zika, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2.","Bravo, M Fernando; Lema, Manuel A; Marianski, Mateusz; Braunschweig, Adam B",,523,30

Increased alcohol use has been extensively documented during other crises, particularly among persons with anxiety and depression. Despite COVID-19's differential impact by age, the association of age, mental health and alcohol use during the pandemic has not been explored. This study aimed to examine whether age modified the association of anxiety and depressive symptoms with alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two online surveys were administered to U.S. adult social media users in March and April 2020. Generalized linear models were conducted in 2020 among 5850 respondents (52.9% female; 22.0% aged 18-39 years, 47.0% aged 40-59 years, and 31.0% aged &#8805;60 years) to examine if age modified the association of anxiety and depression symptomatology and alcohol use. Overall, 29% of respondents reported increased alcohol use. Adjusted odds ratios of reporting increased alcohol use were 1.41 (95% CI = 1.20-1.66) among respondents with anxiety symptoms and 1.64 (95% CI = 1.21-2.23) among those with depressive symptoms compared to those without such symptoms. Whereas respondents aged 18-39 years had the highest probability of reporting increased alcohol use, the probability of older persons (40-59 and &#8805;60 years) reporting increased drinking was much greater among those with symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those without symptoms. These findings warrant age-differentiated public health messaging on the risks of excessive alcohol use and scale-up of substance use services for middle-aged and older adults with symptoms of depression and anxiety.","Capasso, Ariadna; Jones, Abbey M; Ali, Shahmir H; Foreman, Joshua; Tozan, Yesim; DiClemente, Ralph J",Prev Med,523,1

Although some of the treatments are promising, it is thought to be early to clearly state that there is definitive treatment. Experiences and treatment protocols studies coming from the centers are still very important. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors affecting the treatment process in the first cases followed in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this retrospective and cross-sectional study. Datas were recorded from the electronic and written files of patients. RESULTS: Eighty three patients were evaluated. The median age was 50±15 years. Fourty eight (57.8%) patients had one or more comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was hypertension. The most common symptom was cough in 58 patients (70%). The overall mortality was 15% and 85% of the patients were discharged. The time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was statistically significantly longer in deceased patients (p=0,039). Age, D-Dimer, troponin, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, ferritin, procalcitonin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were statistically significantly higher in deceased patients than survivor patients. Performed subgroup analysis, in the patients receiving azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine and other antibiotics plus hydroxychloroquine, the duration of hospitalization was shorter in azithromycin group (p=0,027). CONCLUSION: Early treatment and early admission to the hospital can be crucial for the better treatment process. Combination therapy with azithromycin may be preferred in the first treatment choice because it can shorten the length of hospital stay.","TanriverdI, ElIf; ÇÖrtÜk, Mustafa; Yildirim, BInnaz Zeynep; UGur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Turan, Demet; Çinarka, HalIt; ÖzgÜl, Mehmet AkIf; ÇetInkaya, ErdoGan",Turkish journal of medical sciences,523,1

We used qualitative methods to gain an understanding of the social context within which SSPs are operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with program representatives from 18 programs and used the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) implementation framework to guide data analysis. We focused on 3 of the 4 EPIS constructs: Outer context, inner context, and innovation factors. Our data indicate that responding to the pandemic led to innovations in service delivery such as secondary and mail-based distribution, adoption of telemedicine for enrolling participants in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and use of virtual training platforms for overdose prevention. We found high levels of staff and volunteer commitment, which was a cornerstone to the success of these innovations. We observed that many SSPs were short-staffed because of their commitment to safety, and some lost current funding as well as opportunities for future funding. Despite minimal staffing and diminished funding, SSPs innovated at an accelerated pace. To ensure the sustainability of these new approaches, a supportive external context (federal, state, and local policies and funding) is needed to support the development of SSPs' inner contexts (organizational characteristics, characteristics of individuals) and sustainment of the innovations achieved regarding delivery of naloxone and MOUD.","Wenger, Lynn D; Kral, Alex H; Bluthenthal, Ricky N; Morris, Terry; Ongais, Lee; Lambdin, Barrot H",Transl. res,523,24

We performed a head-to-head assessment of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and point-of-care lateral flow assays (POCTs) to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, treatment, and mortality of patients whose sera were used were also reviewed. Six EIAs (Abbott, Affinity, Bio-Rad, DiaSorin, Euroimmun, and Roche) and six POCTs (BTNX, Biolidics, Deep Blue, Genrui, Getein BioTech, and Innovita) were evaluated for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in known COVID-19-infected individuals. Sensitivity of EIAs ranged from 50 to 100%, with only four assays having overall sensitivities of >95% after 21 days after symptom onset. Notably, cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza virus [PIV-4] [n = 5], human metapneumovirus [hMPV] [n = 3], rhinovirus/enterovirus [n = 1], CoV-229E [n = 2], CoV-NL63 [n = 2], and CoV-OC43 [n = 2]) was observed; however, overall specificity of EIAs was good (92 to 100%; all but one assay had specificity above 95%). POCTs were 0 to 100% sensitive >21 days after onset, with specificity ranging from 96 to 100%. However, many POCTs had faint banding and were often difficult to interpret. Serology assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as early as 10 days after symptom onset. Serology assays vary in their sensitivity based on the marker (IgA/IgM versus IgG versus total) and by manufacturer; however, overall only 4 EIAs and 4 POCTs had sensitivities of >95% >21 days after symptom onset. Cross-reactivity with other seasonal coronaviruses is of concern.

The annual average PM1 concentration was 26.31 µg/m3 (range: 7.00-73.40 µg/m3). The concentrations of most metals were higher in winter and lower in autumn and summer. Mn and Ni had the highest noncarcinogenic risk, and Cr the highest carcinogenic risk. The hazard index was below safe limit, and the integrated carcinogenic risk was less than precautionary value. There were no obvious differences in the simulation performances of BP-ANN and SVM models. However, in both models many elements had better simulation effects when input variables were atmospheric pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and PM2.5) rather than PM1 and meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and wind speed). Models performed better for Pb, Tl and Zn, as evidenced by training R and test R values consistently >0.85, whereas their performances for Ti and V were relatively poor.

Reply to Au Yong and colleagues (Br J Anaesth 2020; 125: e176-e178),20.424648,7.8994975,2020,"BACKGROUND: Lombardy was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic since February 2020 and the Health System underwent rapid reorganization. Outpatient clinics were stopped for non-urgent patients: it became a priority to manage hundreds of fragile neurological patients who suddenly had less reference points. In Italy, before the pandemic, Televisits were neither recognized nor priced. METHODS: At the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico C. Besta, we reorganized outpatient clinics to deliver Neuro-telemedicine services, including Televisits and Teleneurorehabilitation, since March 2020. A dedicated Working Group prepared the procedure, tested the system, and designed satisfaction questionnaires for adults and children. RESULTS: After a pilot phase, we prepared a procedure for Telemedicine outpatient clinics which was approved by hospital directions. It included prescription, booking, consenting, privacy and data protection, secure connection with patients (Teams Microsoft 365), electronic report preparation and delivery, reporting, and accountability of the services. During the March-September 2020 period, we delivered 3167 Telemedicine services, including 1618 Televisits, to 1694 patients (972 adults, 722 children) with a wide range of chronic neurological disorders. We successfully administered different clinical assessment and scales. Satisfaction among patients and caregivers was very high. CONCLUSIONS: During the dramatic emergency, we were able to take care of more than 1600 patients by organizing Neuro-telehealth in a few weeks, lessening the impact of the pandemic on fragile patients with chronic neurological disorders;this strategy is now stably embedded in our care pathways. In Italy, Telehealth is at present recognized and priced and is becoming a stable pillar of the health system.","Pareyson, D.; Pantaleoni, C.; Eleopra, R.; De Filippis, G.; Moroni, I.; Freri, E.; Zibordi, F.; Bulgheroni, S.; Pagliano, E.; Sarti, D.; Silvani, A.; Grazzi, L.; Tiraboschi, P.; Didato, G.; Anghileri, E.; Bersano, A.; Valentini, L.; Piacentini, S.; Muscio, C.; Leonardi, M.; Mariotti, C.; Eoli, M.; Nuzzo, S.; Tagliavini, F.; Confalonieri, P.; De Giorgi, F.; Besta-Telehealth Task, Force",Neurological Sciences,523,16

METHODS: This study used a large medical claims clearinghouse database representing 5%-7% of the Medicare fee-for-service population to characterize changes in the utilization of cancer care services and gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the US cancer population, including identification of new patients, gaps in access to care, and disruption of treatment journeys. RESULTS: In March-July 2020, in comparison with the baseline period of March-July 2019, there is a substantial decrease in cancer screenings, visits, therapy, and surgeries, with variation by cancer type and site of service. At the peak of the pandemic in April, screenings for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers were lower by 85%, 75%, 74%, and 56%, respectively. Significant utilization reductions were observed in April for hospital outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visits (-74%), new patient E&M visits (-70%), and established patient E&M visits (-60%). A decrease in billing frequency was observed for the top physician-administered oncology products, dropping in both April (-26%) and July (-31%). Mastectomies were reduced consistently in April through July, with colectomies similarly reduced in April and May and prostatectomies dipping in April and July. CONCLUSION: The current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in the United States has resulted in decreases and delays in identifying new cancers and delivery of treatment. These problems, if unmitigated, will increase cancer morbidity and mortality for years to come.","Patt, Debra; Gordan, Lucio; Diaz, Michael; Okon, Ted; Grady, Lance; Harmison, Merrill; Markward, Nathan; Sullivan, Milena; Peng, Jing; Zhou, Anan",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,523,23

Its function is dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders that are characterized by stress- or drug-induced alterations in mood, arousal, motivation, and social behavior. However, compared to the BNST's role in mood, arousal, and motivation, its role in social behavior has remained relatively understudied. Moreover, the precise cell types and circuits underlying the BNST's role in social behavior have only recently begun to be explored using modern neuroscience techniques. Here, we systematically review the existing literature investigating the neurobiological substrates within the BNST that contribute to the coordination of various sex-dependent and sex-independent social behavioral repertoires, focusing largely on pharmacological and circuit-based behavioral studies in rodents. We suggest that the BNST coordinates social behavior by promoting appropriate assessment of social contexts to select relevant behavioral outputs and that disruption of socially-relevant BNST systems by stress and drugs of abuse may be an important factor in the development of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders.","Flanigan, Meghan E; Kash, Thomas L",Eur. j. neurosci,523,16

We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients presenting with initial gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: We evaluated all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 10 and February 29, 2020. We divided these patients into two groups: patients with initial gastrointestinal symptoms (group A, n = 183) and patients with respiratory syndrome and/or fever (group B, n = 1228). The clinical characteristics, radiological features, and laboratory data were assessed. RESULTS: The clinical procedures of both groups underwent 1-2 weeks rising period and were downward trend at 3 weeks; less than 5% of patients progressed to critical illness. In both groups, mean leukocyte count (P = 0.354) and lymphocyte count (P = 0.386) were below normal, and C-reactive protein level was elevated (P = 0.412). There was mild liver function injury (aspartate aminotransferase, 65.8 ± 12.7 vs 67.4 ± 9.3 U/L, P = 0.246; alanine aminotransferase, 66.4 ± 13.2 vs 69.6 ± 12.7 U/L, P = 0.352), and normal renal function was intact (blood urea nitrogen 6.4 ± 2.5 vs 5.6 ± 2.8 mmol/L P = 0.358; creatinine 85.7 ± 37.2, 91.2 ± 32.6 µmol/L, P = 0.297).

The complement system is an important component of the innate immune system that is involved in the opsonization of viruses but also in triggering further immune cell responses. Complement activation was seen in plasma adsorber material that clogged during the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Apart from the lung, the kidney is the second most common organ affected by COVID-19. Using immunohistochemistry for complement factors C1q, MASP-2, C3c, C3d, C4d, and C5b-9 we investigated the involvement of the complement system in six kidney biopsies with acute kidney failure in different clinical settings and three kidneys from autopsy material of patients with COVID-19. Renal tissue was analyzed for signs of renal injury by detection of thrombus formation using CD61, endothelial cell rarefaction using the marker E-26 transformation specific-related gene (ERG-) and proliferation using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-staining. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Biopsies from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS, n = 5), severe acute tubular injury (ATI, n = 7), zero biopsies with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC, n = 7) and 1 year protocol biopsies from renal transplants (Ctrl, n = 7) served as controls. In the material clogging plasma adsorbers used for extracorporeal therapy of patients with COVID-19 C3 was the dominant protein but collectin 11 and MASP-2 were also identified. SARS-CoV-2 was sporadically present in varying numbers in some biopsies from patients with COVID-19. The highest frequency of CD61-positive platelets was found in peritubular capillaries and arteries of COVID-19 infected renal specimens as compared to all controls. Apart from COVID-19 specimens, MASP-2 was detected in glomeruli with DIC and ATI. In contrast, the classical pathway (i.e. C1q) was hardly seen in COVID-19 biopsies. Both C3 cleavage products C3c and C3d were strongly detected in renal arteries but also occurs in glomerular capillaries of COVID-19 biopsies, while tubular C3d was stronger than C3c in biopsies from COVID-19 patients. The membrane attack complex C5b-9, demonstrating terminal pathway activation, was predominantly deposited in COVID-19 biopsies in peritubular capillaries, renal arterioles, and tubular basement membrane with similar or even higher frequency compared to controls. In conclusion, various complement pathways were activated in COVID-19 kidneys, the lectin pathway mainly in peritubular capillaries and in part the classical pathway in renal arteries whereas the alternative pathway seem to be crucial for tubular complement activation. Therefore, activation of the complement system might be involved in the worsening of renal injury. Complement inhibition might thus be a promising treatment option to prevent deregulated activation and subsequent collateral tissue injury.","Pfister, Frederick; Vonbrunn, Eva; Ries, Tajana; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Überla, Klaus; Lochnit, Günter; Sheriff, Ahmed; Herrmann, Martin; Büttner-Herold, Maike; Amann, Kerstin; Daniel, Christoph",Front Immunol,523,24

We investigated how the immune response to ZIKV during pregnancy is primed and conduct a thorough evaluation of the inflammatory and cytotoxic profiles as well as the expression of CCR5 and CX3CR1. We compared the reactivity of T cells to ZIKV peptides in convalescent mothers infected during pregnancy. The child's clinical outcome (i.e., born with or without CZS) was taken to be the variable. The cells were stimulated in vitro with ZIKV peptides and evaluated using the ELISPOT and flow cytometry assays. After in vitro stimulation with ZIKV peptides, we observed a tendency toward a higher Interferon gamma (IFN-Î³)-producing T cell responses in mothers who had asymptomatic children and a higher CD107a expression in T cells in mothers who had children with CZS. We found a higher frequency of T cells expressing CD107a+ and co-expressing CX3CR1+CCR5+, which is much clearer in the T cells of mothers who had CZS children.

The model includes both asymptomatic and presymptomatic populations with the latter leading to sickness (with recovery, hospitalization and death as possible outcomes). We consider situations involving the application of social-distancing and other intervention measures in the time series of interest. We find optimal parametric fits to the time series of deaths (only), as well as to the time series of deaths and cumulative infections. We discuss the merits and disadvantages of each approach, we interpret the parameters of the model and assess the realistic nature of the parameters resulting from the optimization procedure. Importantly, we explore a model involving two sub-populations (younger and older than a specific age), to more accurately reflect the observed impact as concerns symptoms and behavior in different age groups. For definiteness and to separate people that are (typically) in the active workforce, our partition of population is with respect to members younger vs. older than the age of 65. The basic reproduction number of the model is computed for both the single- and the two-population variant. Finally, we consider what would be the impact of partial lockdown (involving only the older population) and full lockdown (involving the entire population) on the number of deaths and cumulative infections.","Cuevas-Maraver, J; Kevrekidis, P G; Chen, Q Y; Kevrekidis, G A; Villalobos-Daniel, Víctor; Rapti, Z; Drossinos, Y",Math Biosci,523,16

The effect of the conversion from belatacept to another immunosuppressive regimen is underreported. The aim of the present retrospective study was to assess the effect on kidney function and the clinical outcome of the conversion from belatacept to another regimen. Methods: We have identified 44 maintenance kidney transplantation patients from five French kidney transplantation centers who were converted from belatacept to another regimen either because of a complication (n = 28) or another reason (patients' request or belatacept shortage, n = 13). The follow-up after the conversion from belatacept was 27.5 ± 25.3 months. Results: Overall, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from 44.2 ± 16 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at conversion from belatacept to 35.7 ± 18.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at last follow-up (P = 0.0002). eGFR significantly decreased in patients who had been given belatacept at transplantation as well as in those who had been converted to belatacept earlier. The decrease was less significant in patients who had stopped belatacept without having experienced any complications. Finally, eGFR decreased more severely in patients who were converted to calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), compared to those who received mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi). Few patients also developed diabetes and hypertension. Conclusions: Thus, transplantation physicians should avoid stopping belatacept when not clinically required.","Gouin, Anna; Sberro-Soussan, Rebecca; Courivaud, Cécile; Bertrand, Dominique; Del Bello, Arnaud; Darres, Amandine; Ducloux, Didier; Legendre, Christophe; Kamar, Nassim",Kidney Int Rep,523,33

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the use of a telehealth platform for the follow-up of HCT patients during the first two weeks after discharge. METHODS: In total, 21 patients who received autologous or allogeneic HCT for hematological malignancies were screened from April 30, 2020, to July 15, 2020. The telehealth platform assisted in the daily collection of vital signs as well as physical and psychological symptoms for two weeks after hospital discharge. The required medical devices (oximeter and blood pressure monitor) were given to patients and a dedicated smartphone app was developed to collect this data. The data were reviewed daily through web-based software by a hematologist specializing in HCT. RESULTS: Only 12 of 21 patients were able to join and complete the study. Technological barriers were the most frequent limiting factor in this study. Among the 12 patients who completed the study, adherence to data reporting was high. The patients' experience of using such a system was considered good. In two cases, the system enabled the early recognition of acute complications. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study showed that telehealth systems can be applied in the early posttransplant setting, with evident advantages for physicians and patients for both medical and psychological aspects. Technological issues still represent a challenge for the applicability of such a system, especially for older adult patients. Easier-to-use technologies could help to expand the use of telehealth systems in this setting in the future.","Mussetti, Alberto; Salas, Maria Queralt; Condom, Maria; Antonio, Maite; Ochoa, Cristian; Ivan, Iulia; Jimenez Ruiz-De la Torre, David; Sanz Linares, Gabriela; Ansoleaga, Belen; Patiño-Gutierrez, Beatriz; Jimenez-Prat, Laura; Parody, Rocio; Sureda-Balari, Ana",JMIR Form Res,523,16

Respiratory infection transmission via the eye and lacrimal-nasal pathway elucidated during the 1918 influenza pandemic, remains to be explored in this crisis. The eye and its adnexae represent a large surface area directly exposed to airborne viral particles and hand contact. The virus may bind to corneal and conjunctival angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and potentially to the lipophilic periocular skin and superficial tear film with downstream carriage into the nasopharynx and subsequent access to the lungs and gut. Adenoviruses and influenza viruses share this ocular tropism and despite differing ocular and systemic manifestations and disease patterns, common lessons, particularly in management, emerge. Slit lamp usage places ophthalmologists at particular risk of exposure to high viral loads (and poor prognosis) and as for adenoviral epidemics, this may be a setting for disease transmission. Local, rather than systemic treatments blocking virus binding in this pathway (advocated for adenovirus) are worth considering. This pathway is accessible with eye drops or aerosols containing drugs which appear efficacious via systemic administration. A combination such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc, all of which have previously been used topically in the eye and which work at least in part by blocking ACE2 receptors, may offer a safe, cost-effective and resource-sparing intervention.","Coroneo, Minas Theodore",Ocular surf,523,16

The EXCELLENT Registry (NCT03685578) is a prospective, global, multi-center, observational registry of EmboTrap as the first line MT device for large vessel occlusion (LVO). We present an interim analysis of clot collected per pass in the registry. Methods: Five hundred thirty-three clot specimens from 376 subjects were collected by 20 sites and sent for analysis by independent Central Labs under standardized protocol. Analysis was interrupted by COVID-19, but the labs were fully operational as of June 2020 and on track to deliver results for 300 subjects in Q4. At the time of abstract submission, composition data for 234 clots from 163 subjects was available. All available data will be presented at the time of the conference. Results: Cardioembolic etiology (n=100) was associated with lower RBC (40.2 vs 47.2%) and higher fibrin content (31.7 vs 26.7%) compared to large artery disease (n=12). Hyperdense/vessel susceptibility sign (78+, 24-, per independent imaging core lab) corresponded to higher mean RBC content (44.4 vs 34.9%). Treatment with IV tPA (60+, 91-) had no clear impact on clot composition (42.3 vs 40.6% RBC;30.4 vs 30.0% fibrin). Notably, clots retrieved with the first 2 passes of were more RBC rich (42.1 vs 28.0%) and clots retrieved in higher passes had a higher average fibrin content (35.5 vs 29.6%) suggesting that higher fibrin content leads to greater refractoriness.

Human ACE2 acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is also widely expressed in epithelial cells of the lungs, heart, kidney, and pancreas. It is considered an important drug target for treating SARS-CoV-2 as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases, and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2 receptor remains unknown. Here, we have addressed this challenge through all-atom simulations using a novel ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method. Microsecond time scale LiGaMD simulations have unprecedentedly captured multiple times of spontaneous binding and unbinding of a potent inhibitor MLN-4760 in the ACE2 receptor. With ligand far away in the unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially Open, Closed, and Fully Closed conformations. Upon ligand binding to the active site, conformational ensemble of the ACE2 receptor is biased toward the Closed state as observed in the X-ray experimental structure. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection mechanism for ligand recognition by the highly flexible ACE2 receptor, which is expected to facilitate rational drug design targeting human ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.","Bhattarai, Apurba; Pawnikar, Shristi; Miao, Yinglong",J Phys Chem Lett,523,33

However, during the examination, the patient aspirated testing food and subsequently developed a fever. Based on his medical history and computed tomography (CT) images, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and admitted to the hospital to begin treatment. However, after admission, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and the result of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive. Previous reports have shown that CT images in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were normal in the early phase, and abnormalities usually appeared approximately 6-11 days after onset. Common findings of COVID-19 are consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and a distribution of lesions predominantly in the bilateral inferior lung field periphery.

One way to give effect to these principles is to socially distance emergency legislation from ordinary legislation. This makes emergency laws separate and distinct from ordinary laws, and reduces the chances of them being used for periods and purposes beyond their initial remit. Specific structural techniques to do this are: to use sunset clauses, to use a single legislative vehicle for emergency laws, to use non-textual amendments, to avoid the standard mosaic approach to making new laws, to expressly state their temporary nature, to specifically limit their use to the emergency and to give them a title which indicates their emergency nature.","Cormacain, Ronan",Theo.

All elective cases at our institution were postponed for approximately 3 months. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services considers organ transplant surgery a Tier 3b case, along with other high acuity procedures, recommending no postponement. Our transplant program collaborated with our transplant infectious disease colleagues to create a protocol that would ensure both patient and staff safety during these unprecedented times. METHODS: The living donor program was electively placed on hold until we had the proper protocols in place. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was required for all recipients and living donors. All patients underwent a rapid nasopharyngeal swab test. After testing negative by nasopharyngeal swab, recipients also underwent a low-radiation-dose computed tomography scan to rule out any radiographic changes suggestive of a COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We performed 8 living donor and 9 deceased donor kidney transplants. In comparison, we performed 10 living donor and 4 deceased donor transplants during the same time period in the previous year. Our testing protocol enabled efficient use of all suitable organs offered during the viral pandemic. No recipients or living donors tested positive or developed COVID-19.

Metformin which prescribed as the first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes has beneficial effects on Sars-cov2 infection. These effects are including regulation of immune system, Renin-Angiotensin System and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 function in Covid-19 infection. It also activates ACE2, the main receptor of Sars-cov2, in the epithelial cells of respiratory tissue through AMPK signaling and subsequently decreases the rate of viral adhesion. Metformin also declines the adherence of Sars-cov2 to DPP4 (the other receptor of the virus) on T cells. Hence, regulatory effects of metformin on membranous ACE2, and DPP4 can modulate immune reaction against Sars-cov2. Also, immunometabolic effects of metformin on inflammatory cells impair hyper-reactive immune response against the virus through reduction of glycolysis and propagation of mitochondrial oxidation. Metformin also decreases platelet aggravation and risk of thrombosis. In this article, we argue that metformin has beneficial effects on Covid-19 infection in patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.

Methods: The study included four different types of maculopathy: central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Stargardt disease (STGD) and phototoxic retinopathy. In all four cases, cone mosaic and cone density were obtained using AO fundus camera. Further, the high-resolution images were compared with the FAF and optical coherence tomography (OCT) results. Results: In CSC, FAF and AO, changes could be shown in the macula even two years after the subretinal fluid resorption, as opposed to a normal OCT. The improvement of FAF and cone mosaic appearance was concomitant with the visual acuity growth. Several cone mosaic phenotypes were observed in RP and STGD. In RP, the cone density was 24.240 cones /mm2 in the center, and decreased to 8.163 cones/ mm2 in the parafoveal area. In STGD, the cone density was lower in the center, 9.219 cones/ mm2, and higher at the periphery, 12.594 cones/ mm2. In the case of phototoxic retinopathy, AO and OCT were more effective than FAF in highlighting the photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium lesions. Conclusions: FAF and AO are very useful tools in macular pathologies examination. FAF can offer a true picture of the metabolic changes in the macula, while AO allows the view of changes up to the cellular level.

Little is known about the effects of prone positioning among patients with less severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, obesity, or those treated with pulmonary vasodilators. OBJECTIVES: We characterize the change in oxygenation, respiratory system compliance, and dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio in response to prone positioning in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome with a range of severities. A subset analysis of patients treated with inhaled nitric oxide and subsequent prone positioning explored the influence of pulmonary vasodilation on the physiology of prone positioning. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of all consecutively admitted adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus disease 2019 treated with mechanical ventilation and prone positioning in the ICUs of an academic hospital between March 11, 2020, and May 1, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Respiratory system mechanics and gas exchange during the first episode of prone positioning. RESULTS: Among 122 patients, median (interquartile range) age was 60 years (51-71 yr), median body mass index was 31.5 kg/m2 (27-35 kg/m2), and 50 patients (41%) were female. The ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 improved with prone positioning in 90% of patients. Prone positioning was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (from median 149 [123-170] to 226 [169-268], p &lt; 0.001) but no change in dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio or respiratory system compliance. Supine ratio of Pao2 to Fio2, respiratory system compliance, positive end-expiratory pressure, and body mass index did not correlate with absolute change in the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 with prone positioning. However, patients with ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 less than 150 experienced a greater relative improvement in oxygenation with prone positioning than patients with ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 greater than or equal to 150 (median percent change in ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 62 [29-107] vs 30 [10-70], p = 0.002). Among 12 patients, inhaled nitric oxide prior to prone positioning was associated with a significant increase in the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (from median 136 [77-168] to 170 [138-213], p = 0.003) and decrease in dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio (0.54 [0.49-0.58] to 0.46 [0.44-0.53], p = 0.001). Subsequent prone positioning in this subgroup further improved the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (from 145 [122-183] to 205 [150-232], p = 0.017) but did not change dead-space-to-tidal-volume ratio. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prone positioning improves oxygenation across the acute respiratory distress syndrome severity spectrum, irrespective of supine respiratory system compliance, positive end-expiratory pressure, or body mass index. There was a greater relative benefit among patients with more severe disease. Prone positioning confers an additive benefit in oxygenation among patients treated with inhaled nitric oxide.","Ziehr, D. R.; Alladina, J.; Wolf, M. E.; Brait, K.

473727,473727,473727,The geriatric emergency literature 2020: COVID and beyond,20.473648,7.940871,2021,"Background. Keratinocyte skin cancers are common in Australia, incurring disproportionately high health expenditure in comparison with mortality. General surgeons often excise these lesions as day-surgery. Balancing individual complexities of these cancers with trainee supervision and health expenditure is key to deliver efficacious care and maintain day-surgery volume for patients during a pandemic. Methods. A retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed, examining 414 procedures from January 2019 to December 2020. Pathology was reviewed, and benign lesions excluded. Complete excision was based on 5 mm margins for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 0.5 mm microscopic margins for low-risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC) subtypes, and 3 mm for high-risk. Results of trainee-performed local anesthetic (LA) excision and general anesthetic (GA) excision (consultant scrubbed) were compared. Results. 288 excisions were reviewed for completeness, location, and reconstruction modality. 69% were BCC (199), and 31% were SCC (89). These were excised under GA (72.5%) and LA (27.5%). 25.6% of BCC excisions were “close,” and 22.6% were “positive” under GA, whilst 31% were “close” and 15.5% were “positive” under LA. 52.8% of SCC excisions were “close,” and 7.8% were “positive” under GA, compared with 42.8% “close” and 9.5% “positive” under LA. Complex reconstruction (skin graft, flap) was more common under GA (38% SCC and 36.1% BCC), but occurred at a modest rate under LA (22% BCC and 28.5% SCC). Conclusions. The results confirm that comparable margins and reconstruction options are achievable when excising keratinocyte cancers under LA by surgical trainees. This is fundamental in cost and timesaving, as well as reducing risk of aerosolisation of virus during GA, in a pandemic.","McSweeney, William Leaning Matthew Dastouri Darius",Journal of Skin Cancer,523,7

METHOD: Ecological time-series based on cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 11 to May 12. Joinpoint regression models were applied to identify points of inflection in COVID-19 trends, considering the days since the 50th confirmed case as time unit. RESULTS: Brazil reached its 50th confirmed case of COVID-19 in 11 March 2020 and, 63 days after that, on May 12, 177,589 cases had been confirmed. The trends for all regions and FU are upward. In the last segment, from the 31st to the 63rd day, Brazil presented a daily percentage change (DPC) of 7.3% (95%CI= 7.2;7.5). For the country the average daily percentage change (ADPC) was 14.2% (95%CI: 13.8;14.5). The highest ADPC values were found in the North, Northeast and Southeast regions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our results show that all FUs in Brazil present upward trends of COVID-19. In some FUs, the slowdown in DPC in the last segment must be considered with caution. Each FU is at a different stage of the pandemic and, therefore, non-pharmacological measures should be adopted accordingly.","Lobo, Andréa de Paula; Cardoso-Dos-Santos, Augusto César; Rocha, Marli Souza; Pinheiro, Rejane Sobrino; Bremm, João Matheus; Macário, Eduardo Marques; Oliveira, Wanderson Kleber de; França, Giovanny Vinícius Araújo de",Int J Infect Dis,523,16

Building community resilience after COVID-19,20.170387,8.069126,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increases the demand for post-acute care in patients after a severe disease course. Various longterm sequelae are expected and rehabilitation medicine is challenged to support physical and cognitive recovery. AIM: We aimed to explore the dysfunctions and outcome of COVID-19 survivors after early post-acute rehabilitation. DESIGN: Observational cohort study. METHODS: This study evaluated the post-acute sequelae of patients hospitalized for SARS-Cov-2 infection and analyzed rehabilitative outcomes of a subgroup of patients included in the prospective observational multicenter CovILD study. RESULTS: A total of 23 subjects discharged after severe to critical COVID-19 infection underwent an individualized, multi-professional rehabilitation. At the start of post-acute rehabilitation, impairment of pulmonary function (87%), symptoms related to postintensive care syndrome, and neuropsychological dysfunction (85%) were frequently found, whereas cardiac function appeared to be largely unaffected. Of interest, multidisciplinary rehabilitation resulted in a significant improvement in lung function, as reflected by an increase of forced vital capacity (p=0.007) and forced expiratory volume in one second (p=0.014), total lung capacity (p=0.003), and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (p=0.002). Accordingly, physical performance status significantly improved as reflected by a mean increase of six-minute walking distance by 176 (SD ± 137) meters. Contrarily, a considerable proportion of patients still had limited diffusion capacity (83%) or neurological symptoms including peripheral neuropathy at the end of rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals discharged after a severe course of COVID-19 frequently present with persisting physical and cognitive dysfunctions after hospital discharge. Those patients significantly benefit from multi-disciplinary inpatient rehabilitation. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Our data demonstrate the highly promising effects of early post-acute rehabilitation in survivors of severe or critical COVID-19. This finding urges the need for further prospective evaluations and may impact future treatment and rehabilitation strategies.","Puchner, Bernhard; Sahanic, Sabina; Kirchmair, Rudolf; Pizzini, Alex; Sonnweber, Bettina; WÖll, Ewald; MÜhlbacher, Andreas; Garimorth, Katja; Dareb, Bernhard; Ehling, Rainer; Wenter, Johanna; Schneider, Sybille; Brenneis, Christian; Weiss, Günter; Tancevski, Ivan; Sonnweber, Thomas; LÖeffler-Ragg, Judith",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

Like other health behaviors, COVID-19 related behaviors may be related to risk representations. Risk representations are the cognitive responses a person holds about illness risk such as, identity (i.e., label/characteristics of risk), cause (i.e., factors causing condition), timeline (i.e., onset/duration of risk), consequences (i.e., intrapersonal/interpersonal outcomes), behavioral efficacy (i.e., if and how the condition can be controlled/treated), and illness risk coherence (i.e., extent to which representations, behaviors, and beliefs are congruent). The current study applies the Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM-SR) to evaluate how risk representations may relate to COVID-19 protective and risk behaviors. METHODS: Participants include 400 workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk aged &#8805; 18 years and US residents. Participants completed an online survey measuring risk representations (B-IPQ) and COVID-19 related behaviors, specifically, physical distancing, hand washing, and shopping frequency. RESULTS: Risk coherence, consequences, timeline, emotional representation, and behavioral efficacy were related to risk and protective behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Risk representations vary in their relationship to COVID-19 risk and protective behaviors. Implications include the importance of coherent, targeted, consistent health communication, and effective health policy in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.","Alegria, Katie E; Fleszar-Pavlovic, Sara E; Ngo, Dalena D; Beam, Aislinn; Halliday, Deanna M; Hinojosa, Bianca M; Hua, Jacqueline; Johnson, Angela E; McAnally, Kaylyn; McKinley, Lauren E; Temourian, Allison A; Song, Anna V",Int. j. behav. med,523,16

The majority of currently available commercial serological assays only quantify the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response against individual antigens, limiting our understanding of the immune response. To overcome this, we have developed a multiplex immunoassay (MultiCoV-Ab) including spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and the endemic human coronaviruses. Compared to three broadly used commercial in vitro diagnostic tests, our MultiCoV-Ab achieves a higher sensitivity and specificity when analyzing a well-characterized sample set of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. We find a high response against endemic coronaviruses in our sample set, but no consistent cross-reactive IgG response patterns against SARS-CoV-2. Here we show a robust, high-content-enabled, antigen-saving multiplex assay suited to both monitoring vaccination studies and facilitating epidemiologic screenings for humoral immunity towards pandemic and endemic coronaviruses.","Becker, Matthias; Strengert, Monika; Junker, Daniel; Kaiser, Philipp D; Kerrinnes, Tobias; Traenkle, Bjoern; Dinter, Heiko; Häring, Julia; Ghozzi, Stéphane; Zeck, Anne; Weise, Frank; Peter, Andreas; Hörber, Sebastian; Fink, Simon; Ruoff, Felix; Dulovic, Alex; Bakchoul, Tamam; Baillot, Armin; Lohse, Stefan; Cornberg, Markus; Illig, Thomas; Gottlieb, Jens; Smola, Sigrun; Karch, André; Berger, Klaus; Rammensee, Hans-Georg; Schenke-Layland, Katja; Nelde, Annika; Märklin, Melanie; Heitmann, Jonas S; Walz, Juliane S; Templin, Markus; Joos, Thomas O; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Krause, Gérard; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole",Nat Commun,523,4

The spectrum of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, which often requires invasive ventilation and intensive care. COVID-19-associated infection can be catastrophic, leading to both arterial and venous occlusion, microinfarcts, and multiorgan failure, although retinal vein occlusion has not yet been reported. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 40-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He also reported right calf pain and blurring of vision in both eyes. His medical history included hypertension and morbid obesity. The patient was found to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, right leg deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasonography, and bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fundal examination. He was started on full-dose anticoagulation and discharged on rivaroxaban for 3 months. After 2 weeks of therapy, he had fully recovered from his COVID-19 symptoms and had near-normal vision. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection can cause RVO. Early full-dose anticoagulation should be considered in high-risk patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Ophthalmologists and other clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for RVO in patients with COVID-19 infection who presenting with blurred vision and severe pneumonia.","Gaba, Waqar Haider; Ahmed, Deena; Al Nuaimi, Rawdha Khaleefa; Dhanhani, Aishah Ali; Eatamadi, Habibullah",Am J Case Rep,523,8

K777, an irreversible, covalent inactivator of cysteine proteases that has recently completed phase 1 clinical trials, reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity in several host cells: Vero E6 (EC50< 74 nM), HeLa/ACE2 (4 nM), Caco-2 (EC90 = 4.3 µM), and A549/ACE2 (<80 nM). Infectivity of Calu-3 cells depended on the cell line assayed. If Calu-3/2B4 was used, EC50 was 7 nM, but in the ATCC Calu-3 cell line without ACE2 enrichment, EC50 was >10 µM. There was no toxicity to any of the host cell lines at 10-100 µM K777 concentration. Kinetic analysis confirmed that K777 was a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin L, whereas no inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cysteine proteases (papain-like and 3CL-like protease) was observed. Treatment of Vero E6 cells with a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe identified human cathepsin B and cathepsin L as the intracellular targets of this molecule in both infected and uninfected Vero E6 cells. However, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was only carried out by cathepsin L. This cleavage was blocked by K777 and occurred in the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a different site from that previously observed for the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of cathepsin L-mediated viral spike protein processing.","Mellott, Drake M; Tseng, Chien-Te; Drelich, Aleksandra; Fajtová, Pavla; Chenna, Bala C; Kostomiris, Demetrios H; Hsu, Jason; Zhu, Jiyun; Taylor, Zane W; Kocurek, Klaudia I; Tat, Vivian; Katzfuss, Ardala; Li, Linfeng; Giardini, Miriam A; Skinner, Danielle; Hirata, Ken; Yoon, Michael C; Beck, Sungjun; Carlin, Aaron F; Clark, Alex E; Beretta, Laura; Maneval, Daniel; Hook, Vivian; Frueh, Felix; Hurst, Brett L; Wang, Hong; Raushel, Frank M; O039,; Donoghue, Anthony J; de Siqueira-Neto, Jair Lage; Meek, Thomas D; McKerrow, James H",ACS Chem Biol,523,24

Mandates to shelter-in-place were called in nearly every state to limit viral exposure. The impact of the mandate on acute burn admissions was unknown. Our objective was to assess the impact of a shelter-in-place order on acute burn admissions at our burn center. All patients admitted to the burn center with burn injuries- including inhalation injury only- and desquamating skin disorders between March 10th to May 22nd, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We compared all burn center admissions to a month-matched historical cohort from 2019, and summertime admissions for the last five years. Statistical significance was accepted as p < 0.05. There was a 9% increase in pediatric admissions after the shelter-in-place order. Compared to the 2019 cohort, there was a 28% increase in admissions of school aged children in 2020. This was not statistically significant. While the purpose of the ""shelter-in-place"" mandate was to reduce viral transmission of COVID-19, it consequently led to an increased percentage of admissions of school age children- comparable to our summertime numbers.

In the CQ period, with respect to SC, adolescents showed lower perception in the dimensions, such as psychological (p = 0.001), physical well-being (p = 0.001), mood/emotion (p = 0.008), autonomy (p = 0.001), and financial resources (p = 0.018). Relationship with the family (p = 0.021) and peers (p = 0.001), as well as the perception of bullying (p = 0.001) were reduced. In lifestyle, adolescents developed higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p = 0.001). Adolescents living in the village had greater reduction in both autonomy (p = 0.002) and peer relationships (p = 0.002). Moreover, the perception of physical well-being was lower in those living in the city instead of those living in the countryside (p = 0.03), in an apartment instead of a detached house (p = 0.002), and in those who did not have green space (p = 0.001). Gender effect emerged for the psychological (p = 0.007) and physical well-being (p = 0.001), mood/emotion (p = 0.001), and self-perception (p = 0.001). The study showed that health-related quality of life during quarantine changed in its psychosocial dimensions, from mood and self-esteem to social relationships, helping to define the educational policies at multiple points in the promotion process of health.","Mastorci, F.; Piaggi, P.; Doveri, C.; Trivellini, G.; Casu, A.; Pozzi, M.; Vassalle, C.; Pingitore, A.",Frontiers in Pediatrics,523,21

DATA AND METHODS: this study used a SIRD model in which the infection reproduction number R0 varied over time, according to a piecewise constant function. The fatality parameter and the time from contagion to infection resolution (death or recovery) were fixed to ensure parameter identifiability, and the model was calibrated on the Covid-19 deaths notified from March 9th to June 30th 2020. The uncertainty around the estimates was quantified through parametric bootstrap. Finally, the resulting model was used to produce medium-long term projections of the epidemic dynamics. RESULTS: the date of the first infection in Tuscany was estimated as February 21st 2020. The value of R0(t) ranged from 7.78 (95%CI 7.55-7.89), at the beginning of the outbreak, to a value very close to 0 between April 27th and May 17th. Finally, R0(t) rose, reaching an average of 0.66 (0.32, 0.88) between May 18th and June 30th. At the epidemic peak, estimated at the beginning of April, the notified infected people circulating in the region were just 22% of those predicted by the model. According to the estimated SIRD, under the hypothetical scenario that R0(t) slightly exceeds 1 from the beginning of October 2020, a new wave of contagion could arise by next spring. CONCLUSIONS: the estimated trend of R0(t) is suggestive of a strong effect of the lockdown in Tuscany and of a mild increase of the contagion potentially attributable to the easing of the containment measures. Medium-long term projections unequivocally indicate that the danger of a new epidemic wave has not been averted.","Cereda, Giulia; Viscardi, Cecilia; Gottard, Anna; Mealli, Fabrizia; Baccini, Michela",Epidemiol Prev,523,16

Four recent studies have reported its incidence among ICU COVID-19 patients. However, they do not share the same case definition, and have provided conflicting results. In this paper we have aimed at reported the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis for COVID-19 patients in our ICU, and at comparing the different definitions in order to assess their respective relevance. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 requiring ICU management between 1st March and 30th April 2020. RESULTS: Our results showed significantly lower incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (1.8%;1/53), compared to three out of four previous studies, and wide variation in the numbers of cases with regard to the different definitions. CONCLUSION: Large-scale studies are needed for a better definition and a more accurate estimation of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis coinfection during COVID-19.","Gouzien, Laura; Cocherie, Theophile; Eloy, Odile; Legriel, Stéphane; Bedos, Jean-Pierre; Simon, Christelle; Marque-Juillet, Stephanie; Ferré, Alexis; Bruneel, Fabrice",,523,22

Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients. We found that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients express high levels of CD11b and CD66b, spontaneously produce CXCL8 and CCL2 and show a strong association with platelets. Production of CXCL8 correlated with plasmatic concentrations of LDH and D-dimer. Whole blood assays revealed that neutrophils from severe COVID-19 patients show a clear association with IgG immune complexes. Moreover, we found that sera from severe patients contain high levels of immune complexes and activate neutrophils through a mechanism partially dependent on FcÎ³RII (CD32). Interestingly, when integrated in immune complexes, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from severe patients displayed a higher pro-inflammatory profile compared with antibodies from mild patients. Our study suggests that IgG immune complexes might promote the acquisition of an inflammatory signature by neutrophils worsening the course of COVID-19.","Mazzitelli, Ignacio; Bleichmar, Lucia; Ludueña, María Guillermina; Pisarevsky, Andrea; Labato, Mariana; Chiaradia, Verónica; Finocchieto, Paola; Paulin, Francisco; Hormanstorfer, Macarena; Baretto, María Constanza; Adanza, Santiago Piombi; Parodi, María Noel; Ragusa, Martín; Melucci, Claudia; Díaz, Fernando Erra; Paletta, Ana; Di Diego, Facundo; Ceballos, Ana; Geffner, Jorge",J. infect. dis,523,20

First, to generate a realistic, diverse set of opponents, we develop a novel method for self-play based on replica-exchange Markov chain Monte Carlo. Second, we propose a distributionally robust bandit optimization procedure that adaptively adjusts risk aversion relative to uncertainty in beliefs about opponents' behaviors.

Some specialists proposed chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for treating or preventing the disease. The efficacy and safety of these drugs have been assessed in randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 1) treating people with COVID-19 on death and time to clearance of the virus; 2) preventing infection in people at risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure; 3) preventing infection in people exposed to SARS-CoV-2. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Current Controlled Trials (www.controlled-trials.com), and the COVID-19-specific resources www.covid-nma.com and covid-19.cochrane.org, for studies of any publication status and in any language. We performed all searches up to 15 September 2020. We contacted researchers to identify unpublished and ongoing studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in people with COVID-19, people at risk of COVID-19 exposure, and people exposed to COVID-19. Adverse events (any, serious, and QT-interval prolongation on electrocardiogram) were also extracted. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility of search results, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We contacted study authors for clarification and additional data for some studies. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We performed meta-analysis using a random-effects model for outcomes where pooling of effect estimates was appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: 1. Treatment of COVID-19 disease We included 12 trials involving 8569 participants, all of whom were adults. Studies were from China (4); Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and North America (each 1 study); and a global study in 30 countries (1 study). Nine were in hospitalized patients, and three from ambulatory care. Disease severity, prevalence of comorbidities, and use of co-interventions varied substantially between trials. We found potential risks of bias across all domains for several trials. Nine trials compared HCQ with standard care (7779 participants), and one compared HCQ with placebo (491 participants); dosing schedules varied. HCQ makes little or no difference to death due to any cause (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.19; 8208 participants; 9 trials; high-certainty evidence). A sensitivity analysis using modified intention-to-treat results from three trials did not influence the pooled effect estimate. HCQ may make little or no difference to the proportion of people having negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory samples at day 14 from enrolment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10; 213 participants; 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in little to no difference in progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.37; 4521 participants; 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ probably results in an almost three-fold increased risk of adverse events (RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.49 to 5.64; 1394 participants; 6 trials; moderate-certainty evidence), but may make little or no difference to the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.79; 1004 participants; 6 trials; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on time to clinical improvement or risk of prolongation of QT-interval on electrocardiogram (very low-certainty evidence). One trial (22 participants) randomized patients to CQ versus lopinavir/ritonavir, a drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and did not report any difference for clinical recovery or adverse events. One trial compared HCQ combined with azithromycin against standard care (444 participants). This trial did not detect a difference in death, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital admission, or serious adverse events. A higher risk of adverse events was reported in the HCQ-and-azithromycin arm; this included QT-interval prolongation, when measured. One trial compared HCQ with febuxostat, another drug with unknown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 (60 participants). There was no difference detected in risk of hospitalization or change in computed tomography (CT) scan appearance of the lungs; no deaths were reported. 2. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Ongoing trials are yet to report results for this objective. 3. Preventing COVID-19 disease in people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 One trial (821 participants) compared HCQ with placebo as a prophylactic agent in the USA (around 90% of participants) and Canada. Asymptomatic adults (66% healthcare workers; mean age 40 years; 73% without comorbidity) with a history of exposure to people with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. We are very uncertain about the effect of HCQ on the primary outcomes, for which few events were reported: 20/821 (2.4%) developed confirmed COVID-19 at 14 days from enrolment, and 2/821 (0.2%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19 (very low-certainty evidence). HCQ probably increases the risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.83 to 3.11; 700 participants; 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence). HCQ may result in little or no difference in serious adverse events (no RR: no participants experienced serious adverse events; low-certainty evidence). One cluster-randomized trial (2525 participants) compared HCQ with standard care for the prevention of COVID-19 in people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Spain. Most participants were working or residing in nursing homes; mean age was 49 years. There was no difference in the risk of symptomatic confirmed COVID-19 or production of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 between the two study arms. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HCQ for people infected with COVID-19 has little or no effect on the risk of death and probably no effect on progression to mechanical ventilation. Adverse events are tripled compared to placebo, but very few serious adverse events were found. No further trials of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for treatment should be carried out. These results make it less likely that the drug is effective in protecting people from infection, although this is not excluded entirely. It is probably sensible to complete trials examining prevention of infection, and ensure these are carried out to a high standard to provide unambiguous results.","Singh, Bhagteshwar; Ryan, Hannah; Kredo, Tamara; Chaplin, Marty; Fletcher, Tom",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,523,16

Notably, a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 characterizes TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), a rare but potentially fatal disorder associated with thrombosis due to accumulation of prothrombotic ultra-large VWF multimers. Although prompt identification/exclusion of TTP can be facilitated by rapid ADAMTS13 testing, the most commonly utilized assays are based on ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and require long turnaround time and have relatively limited throughput. Nevertheless, several rapid ADAMTS13 assays are now available, at least in select geographies.

Intramyocardial dissecting hematoma (IDH) is one such complication of myocardial infarction. Case A 51 year-old male patient with a background of hypertension presented with a 7 hour history of typical chest pain. His initial ECG showed anterolateral ST segment elevation with reciprocal ST depression in the inferior leads, consistent with STEMI. Urgent angiography revealed a 100% acute occlusion in the mid-LAD. TIMI 3 flow was restored using a Xience 3.00 x 18mm stent, with resolution of pain and interval ECG improvement. Laboratory investigations revealed new significant anaemia. Decision-making Post-procedural transthoracic echocardiography revealed severely impaired systolic function and moderate concentric biventricular hypertrophy, and raised the suspicion of a mechanical complication (see image). This was further supported by his delayed presentation and extensive infarct area. His anaemia was suggestive of active haemorrhage. Endoscopic investigation failed to show a gastrointestinal source. Cardiac MRI (CMR) confirmed the presence of IDH. Conclusion This case highlights the need for a heightened index of suspicion for typically rare mechanical complications post-STEMI due to delayed hospital presentation during the current pandemic, as well as the growing utility of multimodality imaging such as CMR.

METHODS: Here, we tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 healthcare professionals of which 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure (SARS-CoV-2-Exp), with or without symptoms. RESULTS: Post-vaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5-18 days after the first dose compared to naïve subjects (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate Linear Regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG pre-vaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those that voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain and fever significantly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all a/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose. CONCLUSION: Thus, one vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.

Over the past decade, numerous prevention strategies have resulted in significant reductions in NI rates. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of current NI rates from large, geographically defined cohorts. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for evidence regarding epidemiology and prevention of NI in neonates. Extracted studies were synthesised in a narrative form with experiential reflection. RESULTS: Despite the abundance of geographically defined incidence proportions, an epidemiological overview of NI is difficult to provide, given the lack of consensus definition for neonatal NI and different baseline populations being compared. Successful prevention efforts have focused on implementing evidence-based practices while eliminating outdated strategies. The most promising model for reduction in infection rates is based on quality improvement (QI) collaboratives and benchmarking, involving identification and implementation of best practices, selection of measurable outcomes and fostering a sense of community and transparency. CONCLUSION: The preventative rather than curative approach forms the new paradigm for reducing the burden of neonatal infections. Despite progress achieved, continued work towards improved prevention practices is required in the strive towards zero NIs.","Jansen, Sophie J; Lopriore, Enrico; van der Beek, Martha T; Veldkamp, Karin Ellen; Steggerda, Sylke J; Bekker, Vincent",Acta paediatr. scand,523,16

We conducted a rapid systematic review by searching PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar for any study published between January and September 2020. We included a total of ten primary studies. COVID-19-related school closure was associated with a significant decline in the number of hospital admissions and pediatric emergency department visits. However, a number of children and adolescents lost access to school-based healthcare services, special services for children with disabilities, and nutrition programs. A greater risk of widening educational disparities due to lack of support and resources for remote learning were also reported among poorer families and children with disabilities. School closure also contributed to increased anxiety and loneliness in young people and child stress, sadness, frustration, indiscipline, and hyperactivity.

Surges in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) cases have clearly had profound effects on current cancer treatment paradigms. Considering the effect of antineoplastic treatment and the immunosuppressive properties of cancer itself, cancer patients are deemed to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Hence, the specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 must be carefully weighed against the benefit of antineoplastic treatment for cancer patients in the COVID-19 era. In this review, we discuss the current evidence in this important field, and in particular, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on antineoplastic treatment.","Zhang, Jia-Tao; Zhong, Wen-Zhao; Wu, Yi-Long",Lung Cancer,523,13

DESIGN: This is a service evaluation adopting a qualitative approach. SETTING: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted between 6 and 22 May 2020, 2 months after the introduction of the UK COVID-19 Action Plan, allowing GPs to adapt to the new changes and reflect on their impact. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen GPs working in NWL were interviewed, until data saturation was reached. OUTCOME MEASURES: The impact of COVID-19 policies on the management and safety of complex elderly patients in primary care from the GPs' perspective. RESULTS: Participants' average experience was fourteen years working in primary care for the NHS. They stated that COVID-19 policies have affected primary care at three levels, patients' behaviour, work conditions, and clinical practice. GPs reflected on the impact through five major themes; four of which have been adapted from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) framework, changes in primary care (at the three levels mentioned above), involvement of GPs in policy making, communication and coordination (with patients and in between medical teams), stressors and worries; in addition to a fifth theme to conclude the GPs' suggestions for improvement (either proposed mitigation strategies, or existing actions that showed relative success). A participant used an expression of ""infodemic"" to describe the GPs' everyday pressure of receiving new policy updates with their subsequent changes in practice. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all levels of the health system in the UK, particularly primary care. Based on the GPs' perspective in NWL, changes to practice have offered opportunities to maintain safe healthcare as well as possible drawbacks that should be of concern.","Alboksmaty, Ahmed; Kumar, Sonia; Parekh, Ravi; Aylin, Paul",PLoS One,523,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 187 patients with COVID-19 treated at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College from February 15, 2020, to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area. Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p &lt; 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744-0.861: p &lt; 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The classification accuracy of quantitative CT parameters was significantly superior to that of semiquantitative visual score in terms of evaluating the severity of COVID-19.","Yin, Xi; Min, Xiangde; Nan, Yan; Feng, Zhaoyan; Li, Basen; Cai, Wei; Xi, Xiaoqing; Wang, Liang",Korean J Radiol,523,20

The department advised residents not to touch their faces ""unless"" they had washed their hands but advised them to masturbate ""especially if"" they had washed their hands. Those recommendations reshaped New Yorkers' relationship to their bodies and, in so doing, contributed to a new permutation of biopower. Drawing on several theories of biopower, this essay's first section explains that the department's recommendations used large-scale biopolitical tactics with small-scale implications to encourage New Yorkers to meet the expectations of what Nikolas Rose has called ""biological citizenship."" Exploring potential responses to the body's biopolitical regulation, this essay's second section considers the prohibition against touching in Sigmund Freud's outdated but culturally resonant theory of obsessional neurosis. While obsessional neurosis may transgress, cancel, or achieve a compromise with that prohibition, only a ceremonial such as handwashing offers promise for responsible action. However, it, like the obsessional's other actions, operates in a cycle of desire and prohibition which cannot fully account for how biopower now promotes and regulates bodily knowledge and movement. In search of alternatives, this essay's final section turns to four coronavirus-themed pornographic videos produced by gay and bisexual men. These videos troubled public-health guidelines while providing potential viewers in New York and beyond with critical and creative options for pandemic-era action. In sum, these productions revealed that creation can come out of crisis. © 2021 OpenEditions Journals. All rights reserved.","Daffron, E.",Angles,523,16

Here, we design a dynamic graph streaming algorithm that can trace the contacts under the control of the Public Health Authorities (PHA). The algorithm can work as the augmented part of the PHA for the crisis period. Our algorithm receives proximity data from the mobile devices as contact data streams and uses a sliding window model to construct a dynamic contact graph sketch. Prominently, we introduce the edge label of the contact graph as a contact vector, which acts like a sliding window and holds the latest D days of social interactions. Importantly, the algorithm prepares the direct and indirect (multilevel) contact list from the contact graph sketch for a given set of infected persons. The algorithm also uses a disjoint set data structure to construct the infectious trees for the trace list.

Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. METHODS: Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type format or a membrane-anchored format lacking the polybasic cleavage site. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these NDV-based vaccines were investigated. FINDINGS: We report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly in mice. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs. INTERPRETATION: The results suggested that the NDV vector expressing either the wild type S or membrane-anchored S without the polybasic cleavage site could be used as live vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Treatment with ACEI/ARB (combined and individually) had no effect on mortality (OR, 0.62; 95%CI, 0.17-2.26; P = .486), heart failure (OR, 1.37; 95%CI, 0.39-4.77; P = .622), hospitalization rate (OR, 0.85; 95%CI, 0.45-1.64; P = .638), ICU admission (OR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.30-2.50; P = .798), or major acute cardiovascular events (OR, 1.06; 95%CI, 0.39-2.83; P = .915). This neutral effect remained in a subgroup analysis of patients requiring hospitalization. Conclusions: Previous treatment with ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19 had no effect on mortality, heart failure, requirement for hospitalization, or ICU admission. Withdrawal of ACEI/ARB in patients testing positive for COVID-19 would not be justified, in line with current recommendations of scientific societies and government agencies.","López-Otero, Diego; López-Pais, Javier; Cacho-Antonio, Carla Eugenia; Antúnez-Muiños, Pablo José; González-Ferreiro, Teba; Pérez-Poza, Marta; Otero-García, Óscar; Díaz-Fernández, Brais; Bastos-Fernández, María; Bouzas-Cruz, Noelia; Sanmartín-Pena, Xoan Carlos; Varela-Román, Alfonso; Portela-Romero, Manuel; Valdés-Cuadrado, Luis; Pose-Reino, Antonio; González-Juanatey, José Ramón",Rev. esp. cardiol.

Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. METHODS: We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms ""suicide"" and ""cause of death"", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). FINDINGS: We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0·81 [95% CI 0·72-0·91]); Alberta, Canada (0·80 [0·68-0·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0·76 [0·66-0·87]); Chile (0·85 [0·78-0·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0·49 [0·32-0·74]); Japan (0·94 [0·91-0·96]); New Zealand (0·79 [0·68-0·91]); South Korea (0·94 [0·92-0·97]); California, USA (0·90 [0·85-0·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0·79 [0·67-0·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0·82 [0·68-0·98]); and Ecuador (0·74 [0·67-0·82]). INTERPRETATION: This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

The retrospective cohort on 12 countries that have already experienced the epidemic of COVID-19 with available open data on the conformed cases with detailed information on mild respiratory disease (MRD), pneumonia, ARDS, and deaths were used. The pooled estimates from three countries with detailed information were 73% from MRD to pneumonia and 27% from MRD to recovery and the case-fatality rate of ARDS was 43%. The progression from pneumonia to ARDS varied from 3% to 63%. These key estimates were highly associated with the case fatality rates reported for each country with a statistically significant positive relationship (adjusted R2 = 95%).

Here, we report on the binding mode and inhibition properties of several inhibitors using room-temperature X-ray crystallography and in vitro enzyme kinetics.

The mechanism of this RA is not well understood. Objective We sought to explore the relationship between neutrophils and other biomarkers of RA. Method Sixty patients with RA, 30 patients with nonrefractory asthma (NRA), and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled. We performed a comprehensive characterization of these study subjects, which included laboratory and pulmonary function studies, chest computed tomography, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We analyzed BAL fluid and serum for a total of 244 biomolecules using a multiplex assay and correlated them with clinical and other laboratory parameters. Results RA was significantly different from NRA with regard to pulmonary function indices, bronchial basement membrane thickness, and BAL fluid neutrophil and lymphocyte counts but not eosinophil counts. BAL fluid neutrophil counts negatively and positively correlated with forced vital capacity and age, respectively. Of the 244 biomolecules studied, 52 and 14 biomolecules from BAL fluid and serum, respectively, were significantly different among the study groups. Thirteen of these 52 molecules correlated with BAL fluid neutrophil counts. BAL fluid from 40% of patients with RA was positive for a pathogenic microbe. Infection-negative neutrophilic RA was associated with an increase in levels of select biomarkers of inflammation in the serum, suggesting the presence of systemic inflammation. Conclusions RA was associated with increased numbers of neutrophils and proneutrophilic biomolecules in the airways. Subclinical infection was present in 40% of patients with RA, which likely contributed to neutrophilic inflammation. A subgroup of patients with noninfected neutrophilic RA was associated with systemic inflammation.","Alam, Rafeul; Good, James; Rollins, Donald; Verma, Mukesh; Chu, HongWei; Pham, Tuyet-Hang; Martin, Richard J.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,523,6

Several bumble bee taxa have been described from northern North America, these considered either valid species or placed into synonymy with other taxa. However, some of these synonymies were made under the assumption of variable hair colour only, without detailed examination of other morphological characters (e.g., male genitalia, hidden sterna), and without the aid of molecular data. Recently, Bombus interacti Martinet, Brasero & Rasmont, 2019 was described from Alaska where it is considered endemic; based on both morphological and molecular data, it was considered a taxon distinct from B. lapponicus (Fabricius, 1793). Bombus interacti was also considered distinct from B. gelidus Cresson, 1878, a taxon from Alaska surmised to be a melanistic form of B. lapponicus sylvicola Kirby, 1837, the North American subspecies (Martinet et al. 2019). Unfortunately, Martinet et al. (2019) did not have DNA barcode sequences (COI) for females of B. interacti, but molecular data for a melanistic female specimen matching the DNA barcode sequence of the holotype of B. interacti have been available in the Barcodes of Life Data System (BOLD) since 2011. Since then, additional specimens have been obtained from across northern North America. Also unfortunate was that B. sylvicola var. johanseni Sladen, 1919, another melanistic taxon described from far northern Canada, was not considered. Bombus johanseni is here recognized as a distinct taxon from B. lapponicus sylvicola Kirby, 1837 (sensuMartinet et al. 2019) in the Nearctic region, showing the closest affinity to B. glacialis Friese, 1902 of the Old World. As the holotype male of B. interacti is genetically identical to material identified here as B. johanseni, it is placed into synonymy. Thus, we consider B. johanseni a widespread species occurring across arctic and subarctic North America in which most females are dark, with rarer pale forms (i.e., “interacti”) occurring in and seemingly restricted to Alaska. In addition to B. johanseni showing molecular affinities to B. glacialis of the Old World, both taxa also inhabit similar habitats in the arctic areas of both Nearctic and Palearctic, respectively. It is also likely that many of the specimens identified as B. lapponicus sylvicola from far northern Canada and Alaska might actually be B. johanseni, so that should be considered for future studies of taxonomy, distribution, and conservation assessment of North American bumble bees.","Sheffield, Cory S.; Oram, Ryan; Heron, Jennifer M.",Zookeys,523,1

We constructed a human behavior integrated hierarchical (HiHi) model based on the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) model, the Wells-Riley equation, and population movement considering both spatial and temporal dimensions. The model considers more than 7 million people, 3 million indoor environments, and 2566 public transport routes in Hong Kong. Smallpox, which could be spread through airborne routes, is studied as an example. The simulation is based on people's daily commutes and indoor human behaviors, which were summarized by mathematical patterns. We found that 59.6%, 18.1%, and 13.4% of patients become infected in their homes, offices, and schools, respectively. If both work stoppage and school closure measures are taken when the number of infected people is greater than 1000, an infectious disease will be effectively controlled after 2 months. The peak number of infected people will be reduced by 25% compared to taking no action, and the time of peak infections will be delayed by about 40 days if 90% of the infected people go to hospital during the infectious period. When ventilation rates in indoor environments increase to five times their default settings, smallpox will be naturally controlled. Residents of Kowloon and the north part of Hong Kong Island have a high risk of infection from airborne infectious diseases. Our HiHi model reduces the calculation time for infection rates to an acceptable level while preserving accuracy.","Zhang, Nan; Huang, Hong; Su, Boni; Ma, Xun; Li, Yuguo",Build Environ,523,16

Disease clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to severe multiple organ damage. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cellular receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine, allowing viral replication in the gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has been detected in the stool of COVID-19 patients and viable viruses had been isolated in some of these samples. Thus, a putative role of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission has been argued. SARS-CoV-2 is shed in human excreta and further disposed in the sewerage or in the environment, in poor basic sanitation settings. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable population level approach for monitoring viral pathogens and has been successfully used in different contexts. This review summarizes the current global experience on SARS-CoV-2 WBE in distinct continents and viral detection in polluted surface water. The advantages and concerns of this strategy for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance are discussed. Outcomes suggest that WBE is a valuable early warning alert and a helpful complementary surveillance tool to subside public health response, to tailor containment and mitigation measures and to determine target populations for testing. In poor sanitation settings, contaminated rivers could be alternatively used as a source for environmental surveillance.","Aguiar-Oliveira, Maria de Lourdes; Campos, Aline; R.

The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494, and asparagine by valine or threonine at position 501. Substitutions at positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.","Polydorides, Savvas; Archontis, Georgios",Biophys J,523,16

How to systematically understand the complex interaction mechanism between human microbes and drugs remains a challenge nowadays. Identifying microbe-drug associations can not only provide great insights into understanding the mechanism, but also boost the development of drug discovery and repurposing. Considering the high cost and risk of biological experiments, the computational approach is an alternative choice. However, at present, few computational approaches have been developed to tackle this task. RESULTS: In this work, we leveraged rich biological information to construct a heterogeneous network for drugs and microbes, including a microbe similarity network, a drug similarity network, and a microbe-drug interaction network. We then proposed a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based framework for predicting human Microbe-Drug Associations, named GCNMDA. In the hidden layer of GCN, we further exploited the Conditional Random Field (CRF), which can ensure that similar nodes (i.e., microbes or drugs) have similar representations. To more accurately aggregate representations of neighborhoods, an attention mechanism was designed in the CRF layer. Moreover, we performed a random walk with restart (RWR) based scheme on both drug and microbe similarity networks to learn valuable features for drugs and microbes respectively. Experimental results on three different datasets showed that our GCNMDA model consistently achieved better performance than seven state-of-the-art methods. Case studies for three microbes including SARS-CoV-2 and two antimicrobial drugs (i.e., Ciprofloxacin and Moxifloxacin) further confirmed the effectiveness of GCNMDA in identifying potential microbe-drug associations.

STUDY DESIGN: We designed a case-control study to analyze 47 clusters derived from 1332 patients with Kawasaki disease over a 17-yr. period (2002-2019) from a single clinical site and compared the cluster characteristics with two control groups of synthetic KD clusters. We defined a “true” KD cluster as at least 5 patients within a 7-day moving window. The observed and synthetic KD clusters were compared with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics and median values for standard laboratory data using univariate analysis and a multivariate, Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis (REOFs). RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, the median values for age, coronary artery Z score, white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and age-adjusted hemoglobin for several of the true KD clusters exceeded the 95th percentile for the two synthetic clusters. REOFs revealed distinct patterns of demographic and clinical measures within clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Cases of Kawasaki disease within a cluster were more similar with respect to demographic and clinical features, and levels of inflammation than would be expected by chance.

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Two men, aged 73 and 56 years, with a history of penetrating keratoplasty due to keratoconus were noted to have acute corneal graft rejection 2 weeks after receiving a first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Both patients were treated with hourly dexamethasone 0.1% and oral prednisone 60 mg per day with prompt resolution of keratoplasty rejection. CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine may be have been associated with a low-risk corneal graft rejection that responded well to topical and systemic steroids. Treating physicians should be aware of this potential complication and patients should be advised to report any visual changes after vaccination.","Wasser, Lauren M.; Roditi, Eduardo; Zadok, David; Berkowitz, Liron; Weill, Yishay",Cornea,523,1

In 2019, the infants least likely to be exclusively breastfed at 6 months are African Americans (AA) (17.2%). Materials and Methods: A scoping review of the literature was undertaken by using Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage framework to determine key themes of AA women's experience BF through an equity lens. Electronic databases of CINAHL and PubMed were searched for peer-reviewed, full-text articles written in the English language within the past 5 years by using the terms BF, AA, Black, sociological, cultural, equity, health, attitude, exposure, initiation, continuation, barriers, and facilitators. Results: Initially, 497 articles were identified, and 26 peer-reviewed articles met the eligibility criteria. Through an equity lens, three main themes emerged, which summarized AA women's BF experience: cultural (family, peers and community support; misconceptions; personal factors), sociological (prejudices, racism, home environment; financial status; sexuality issues; BF role models; employment policies), and health dimensions (family involvement; timely and honest information from staff; baby-friendly hospital initiatives; postnatal follow-up; special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children). Conclusion: For AA women, exclusively BF is beset with diverse cultural, health, and sociological challenges. Multifaceted approaches are needed for successful resolution of BF challenges to bridge the racial gap in BF in the United States. Future studies may explore interventions targeted to modifiable barriers to improve BF outcomes.","Gyamfi, Adwoa; O'Neill, Barbara; Henderson, Wendy A.; Lucas, Ruth",Breastfeed Med,523,28

Features include short stature, fasting hypoglycemia with ketosis, hepatomegaly, and transaminitis. GSD IXɑ2 is caused by hemizygous pathogenic variants in PHKA2, and results in deficiency of the phosphorylase kinase enzyme, particularly in the liver. Like other GSDs, GSD IXɑ2 can present with hypoglycemia and post-prandial lactic acidosis, but has never been reported in a newborn, nor with lactic acidosis as the presenting feature. Here we describe the clinical presentation and course of a newborn boy with profound neonatal lactic and metabolic acidosis, renal tubulopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) diagnosed with GSD IXɑ2 through exome sequencing. Review of the literature suggests this case represents an atypical and severe presentation of GSD IXɑ2 and proposes expansion of the phenotype to include neonatal lactic acidosis and renal tubulopathy.","Morales, J.

Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Influenza A H5N1 has had a profound effect on the poultry industry. The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches. These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the effect of health systems through generation of drug resistance. Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million people residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37 500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head.

Proteolytic cleavage activates the spike protein, thereby affecting both the cellular entry pathway and cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we investigated the impact of the furin cleavage site on viral growth and pathogenesis using a hamster animal model infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing mutations at the furin cleavage site (S gene mutants). In the airway tissues of hamsters, the S gene mutants exhibited low growth properties. In contrast to parental pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, hamsters infected with the S gene mutants showed no body weight loss and only a mild inflammatory response, thereby indicating the attenuated variant nature of S gene mutants. This transient infection was sufficient for inducing protective neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Consequently, hamsters inoculated with S gene mutants showed resistance to subsequent infection with both the parental strain and the currently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants belonging to lineages B.1.1.7 and P.1. Taken together, our findings revealed that the loss of the furin cleavage site causes attenuation in the airway tissues of hamsters and highlighted the potential benefits of S gene mutants as potential immunogens.","Sasaki, Michihito; Toba, Shinsuke; Itakura, Yukari; Chambaro, Herman M.; Kishimoto, Mai; Tabata, Koshiro; Intaruck, Kittiya; Uemura, Kentaro; Sanaki, Takao; Sato, Akihiko; Hall, William W.; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi",mBio,523,16

The circulating biomarkers seen across the spectrum of COVID-19 have not been characterized compared to healthy controls, but such analyses are likely to yield insights into the pursuit of interventions that adequately reduce the burden of these cytokine storms. Objective To identify and characterize the host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed levels of proteins related to immune responses and cardiovascular disease, in patients stratified as mild, moderate, and severe, versus matched healthy controls. Methods Blood samples from adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were analyzed using high-throughput and ultrasensitive proteomic platforms and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls to provide insights into differential regulation of 185 markers. Results Results indicate a dominant hyperinflammatory milieu in the circulation and vascular endothelial damage markers within COVID-19 patients, and strong biomarker association with patient response as measured by Ordinal scale. As patients progress, we observe statistically significant dysregulation of IFNγ, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-10, IL-19, MCP-1, -2, -3, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL5, ENRAGE and PARP-1. Furthermore, in a limited series of patients who were sampled frequently confirming reliability and reproducibility of our assays, we demonstrate that intervention with baricitinib attenuates these circulating biomarkers associated with the cytokine storm. Conclusion These wide-ranging circulating biomarkers show an association with increased disease severity and may help stratify patients and selection of therapeutic options.

Conceptions of critical care medicine in China stemmed in the early 1970s. Ever since the establishment of the first intensive care unit (ICU) along with the increasingly incomparable role of ICU in medical practices, critical care medicine has become an indispensable part of the Chinese medical and health system. Currently, critical care medicine as a secondary clinical discipline and a well-constructed science is in sustainable development on the way towards systematization and standardization. METHODS: The gross domestic product (GDP) and population data were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics. The number of ICUs, ICU beds, and hospital beds and other data regarding ICU staffing and facility resources were obtained from the Yearbook of Health in the People's Republic of China and National Bureau of Statistics. The mortality rates of SARS and COVID-19 and the number of health workers aiding Hubei amid COVID-19 pandemic were obtained from the National Health Commission. Findings. Critical care medicine in mainland China has made significant strides: both quantity and quality are progressing at a fast pace after SARS in 2003.

All individuals, especially children, are exposed to various viruses including human coronavirus (CoVs) that can generally lead to respiratory infections.

Based on the high-homology between the Spike protein epitopes of taxonomically-related coronaviruses, we theorize that past/recurrent contact with CoVs might shield children also against the circulating COVID-19 through a possible neutralizing antibody response previously CoVs-induced.

We tested the hypothesis that early SARS‐CoV‐2 viral infection disrupts innate immune responses. These changes may be important for understanding subsequent clinical outcomes. We obtained residual nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals who requested COVID‐19 testing for symptoms at drive‐through COVID‐19 clinical testing sites operated by the University of Utah. We applied multiplex immunoassays, real‐time polymerase chain reaction assays and quantitative proteomics to 20 virus‐positive and 20 virus‐negative samples. ACE‐2 transcripts increased with infection (OR =17.4, 95% CI [CI] =4.78–63.8) and increasing viral N1 protein transcript load (OR =1.16, CI =1.10–1.23). Transcripts for two interferons (IFN) were elevated, IFN‐λ1 (OR =71, CI =7.07–713) and IFN‐λ2 (OR =40.2, CI =3.86–419), and closely associated with viral N1 transcripts (OR =1.35, CI =1.23–1.49 and OR =1.33 CI =1.20–1.47, respectively). Only transcripts for IP‐10 were increased among systemic inflammatory cytokines that we examined (OR =131, CI =1.01–2620). We found widespread discrepancies between transcription and translation. IFN proteins were unchanged or decreased in infected samples (IFN‐γ OR =0.90 CI =0.33–0.79, IFN‐λ2,3 OR =0.60 CI =0.48–0.74) suggesting viral‐induced shut‐off of host antiviral protein responses.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not an exception, and therefore the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, like any other invading microbe, enacts a generalized immune response once the virus contacts the body. Melatonin is a systemic dealer that does not overlook any homeostasis disturbance, which consequently brings into play its cooperative triad, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-stimulant backbone, to stop the infective cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or any other endogenous or exogenous threat. In COVID-19, the corporal propagation of SARS-CoV-2 involves an exacerbated oxidative activity and therefore the overproduction of great amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). The endorsement of melatonin as a possible protective agent against the current pandemic is indirectly supported by its widely demonstrated beneficial role in preclinical and clinical studies of other respiratory diseases. In addition, focusing the therapeutic action on strengthening the host protection responses in critical phases of the infective cycle makes it likely that multi-tasking melatonin will provide multi-protection, maintaining its efficacy against the virus variants that are already emerging and will emerge as long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate among us.","Ramos, Eva; López-Muñoz, Francisco; Gil-Martín, Emilio; Egea, Javier; Álvarez-Merz, Iris; Painuli, Sakshi; Semwal, Prabhakar; Martins, Natália; Hernández-Guijo, Jesús M.; Romero, Alejandro",Antioxidants (Basel),523,28

Despite considerable efforts on effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, novel therapeutic options for COVID-19 comorbidities are warranted. One of the fast ways to introduce possible effective drugs for clinical trials is bioinformatics methods. We have conducted a comprehensive enrichment analysis of genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 and neurological disorders associated with COVID-19. For this purpose, gene sets were extracted from the GeneWeaver database. To find out some significant enriched findings for common genes between SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological disorders, several practical databases were used. Finally, to repurpose an efficient drug, DrugBank databases were used. Overall, we detected 139 common genes concerning SARS-CoV-2 and their neurological disorders. Interestingly, our study predicted around 6 existing drugs (ie, carvedilol, andrographolide, 2-methoxyestradiol, etanercept, polaprezinc, and arsenic trioxide) that can be used for repurposing.

Hence, we have synthesized pure CuS and CuO@CuS core-shell heterostructure based photo detectors with high performance by simple and cost-effective two-step chemical co-precipitation method. The phase purity of CuS and CuO@CuS composite was observed by XRD analysis and the result were verified with Raman spectroscopy studies. Sphere like morphology of pure CuS and core-shell structure formation of CuO@CuS are observed with scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The presence of expected elements has been confirmed with EDX elemental mapping. Light harvesting photodiodes were fabricated by using n-type silicon substrate through drop cost method. Photo sensitive parameters of fabricated diodes were analyzed by I–V characteristics. The p-CuO@CuS (1:1)/n-Si diode owned a maximum photosensitivity (Ps) ∼ 7.76 [Formula: see text] 10(4) %, photoresponsivity (R) ∼ 798.61 mA/W, external quantum efficiency ([Formula: see text])∼309.66 % and specific detectivity (D*) ∼ 8.19 × 10(11) Jones when compared to p-CuS/n-Si diode. The obtained results revealed that the core/shell heterostructure of CuO@CuS is the most appropriate for photo detection.","Gunasekeran, S.; Thangaraju, D.; Marnadu, R.; Chandrasekaran, J.; Shkir, Mohd.; Durairaja, A.; Valente, M.A.; Elang, M.",Sens Actuators A Phys,523,26

The aim of the present study was to evaluated an antiviral effect of ORNs-D-M against parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3); influenza CA709, PR834; avian influenza virus H5N2 (AIV) in vitro by a TCID(50); hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity assays; and clinical efficiency of ORNs-D-M in patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) of various etiologies by PCR assay and AmpliSens test systems. It was observed that ORNs-D-M have an antiviral activity against the influenza CA709, PR834, PIV3, and AIV in vitro. The injectable dosage form of ORNs-D-M was shown to have a stronger antiviral effect compared to capsule form. It was also detected that the injectable form of ORNs-D-M significantly reduced the neuraminidase activity of influenza PR834. A complex treatment of patients with ORNs-D-M had a positive effect on the course of the disease, it accelerated patients’ recovery. Treatment with ORNs-D-M caused eradication of adeno- and influenza viruses in patients with ARI. This drug contributed to significant decrease in duration of febrile period and cough. Comprehensive treatment with ORNs-D-M improved the disease clinical findings significantly. Collectively, these results suggested that ORNs-D-M may be used at co-infection with influenza and other respiratory viruses as a medical antiviral drug.","Melnichuk, Nataliia; Zarubaev, Vladimir; Iosyk, Iaryna; Andreychyn, Mychaylo; Semernikova, Larisa; Tkachuk, Zenoviy",Pharmaceutics,523,16

However, only limited research has been conducted in clinical populations. We investigated the association between smartphone-collected monitoring data and validated psychiatric ratings and questionnaires in a well-characterized clinical sample of patients diagnosed with UD. Methods: Smartphone data, clinical ratings, and questionnaires from patients with UD were collected 6 months following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization as part of a randomized controlled study. Smartphone data were collected daily, and clinical ratings (i.e., Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item) were conducted three times during the study. We investigated associations between (1) smartphone-based patient-reported mood and activity and clinical ratings and questionnaires; (2) automatically generated smartphone data resembling physical activity, social activity, and phone usage and clinical ratings; and (3) automatically generated smartphone data and same-day smartphone-based patient-reported mood and activity. Results: A total of 74 patients provided 11,368 days of smartphone data, 196 ratings, and 147 questionnaires. We found that: (1) patient-reported mood and activity were associated with clinical ratings and questionnaires (p < 0.001), so that higher symptom scores were associated with lower patient-reported mood and activity, (2) Out of 30 investigated associations on automatically generated data and clinical ratings of depression, only four showed statistical significance. Further, lower psychosocial functioning was associated with fewer daily steps (p = 0.036) and increased number of incoming (p = 0.032), outgoing (p = 0.015) and missed calls (p = 0.007), and longer phone calls (p = 0.012); (3) Out of 20 investigated associations between automatically generated data and daily patient-reported mood and activity, 12 showed statistical significance. For example, lower patient-reported activity was associated with fewer daily steps, shorter distance traveled, increased incoming and missed calls, and increased screen-time. Conclusion: Smartphone-based self-monitoring is feasible and associated with clinical ratings in UD. Some automatically generated data on behavior may reflect clinical features and psychosocial functioning, but these should be more clearly identified in future studies, potentially combining patient-reported and smartphone-generated data.","Tønning, Morten Lindbjerg; Faurholt-Jepsen, Maria; Frost, Mads; Bardram, Jakob Eyvind; Kessing, Lars Vedel",Front Psychiatry,523,20

Medical practitioners have been prompted to consider prophylactic anticoagulation in special populations diagnosed with COVID-19. Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are predisposed to a hypercoagulable state. Despite the concern for development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in these patients, there are no standardized guidelines for routine thromboprophylaxis in either adults or children with SCD. Thus, VTE management options are often extrapolated from guidelines for the general population. Methods: A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed to pediatric and adult hematology oncology practitioners through 7 SCD specific interest groups. Pediatric and adult practitioners were defined as those who medically manage patients 0-21 years of age and >21 years of age respectively. We examined responses to survey questions focused on routine thromboprophylaxis practices in children and adults with SCD prior to the pandemic and in patients with SCD admitted with COVID-19. Chi-square analyses or Fisher’s exact tests for small samples were used to compare proportions as needed. Results: The survey was distributed to approximately 2,550 providers. Of 93 total responses, 14% (N=13) only treat patients >21yo; 38.7% (N=36) only treat patients 0-21yo and 47.3% (N=44) treat both. Nearly all adult practitioners (96.6%) would recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis, mechanical prophylaxis or both for hospitalized adults, but only 76% of pediatric treaters would recommend any prophylaxis (PPX) in hospitalized children (p<0.0001, Figure 1). Only 16% would recommend pharmacologic PPX only for patients 0-21yo, with 36% preferring non-pharmacologic only methods and 24% preferring both forms. In contrast, for the >21yo patients, 51% preferred to use both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic PPX, 25% preferred pharmacologic alone, with just 5.3% preferring non-pharmacologic PPX only. Enoxaparin was the most frequently used anticoagulant among both pediatric and adult practitioners [78% vs 89% respectively] (Figure 2). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS) were infrequently recommended (3.8% for SCD children and 10.9% for adults); of these, rivaroxaban was used most often. The most common indication for starting thromboprophylaxis for both 0-21yo and >21yo patients was history of prior VTE [81% and 81% respectively], followed by hip replacement [57% and 75% respectively]. In patients admitted with COVID-19, prophylactic anticoagulation was recommended for adults by 94% of treaters. There was a significant increase in the use of prophylactic anticoagulation in children with COVID-19 vs. those without (84% vs. 40%; p=.0001). Figure 3 shows extended thromboprophylaxis practices upon discharge for COVID related admissions. Almost half of respondents (46%) would not recommend any thromboprophylaxis for children on discharge; 37% would recommend either 2-4 weeks or >4weeks of post-discharge PPX. The majority of adult providers would recommend discharge thromboprophylaxis for adults with 2 weeks post discharge (33%), and 2-4 weeks (30%) being the most common regimens. Conclusion: This pilot survey describes the thromboprophylaxis practices used for adult and pediatric SCD patients by specialty practitioners. In general, practitioners were likely to prescribe pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for adults while mechanical PPX was preferred for children. However, in the high-risk setting of COVID-19 infection, pediatric practitioners would modify their practice to include pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Interestingly, despite the long-term availability of direct oral anticoagulants in adults, and recent completion of pediatric studies, the most commonly used pharmacologic agent pre-COVID in adults and children was enoxaparin. Of note, this survey was conducted prior to release of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidelines regarding discharge PPX in COVID-19. (Spyropoulos AC, J Thromb Haemost, 2020) These results highlight the influence of COVID-19 on the use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, specifically in the pediatric population. Due to frequent hospitalization, studies are needed to guide decision making surrounding VTE PPX for the adult and pediatric inpatient SCD population.

SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), an essential factor in viral pathogenesis, is recognized as a prospective therapeutic target in drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2. To tackle this pandemic, Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs are being screened against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) via in silico and in vitro methods to detect the best conceivable drug candidates. However, identification of natural compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) potential have been recommended as rapid and effective alternative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development. Thereof, a total of 653 natural compounds were identified against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) from NP-lib database at MTi-OpenScreen webserver using virtual screening approach. Subsequently, top four potential compounds, i.e. 2,3-Dihydroamentoflavone (ZINC000043552589), Podocarpusflavon-B (ZINC000003594862), Rutin (ZINC000003947429) and Quercimeritrin 6”-O-L-arabinopyranoside (ZINC000070691536), and co-crystallized N3 inhibitor as reference ligand were considered for stringent molecular docking after geometry optimization by DFT method. Each compound exhibited substantial docking energy >−12 kcal/mol and molecular contacts with essential residues, including catalytic dyad (His(41) and Cys(145)) and substrate binding residues, in the active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) against N3 inhibitor. The screened compounds were further scrutinized via absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion - toxicity (ADMET), quantum chemical calculations, combinatorial molecular simulations and hybrid QM/MM approaches. Convincingly, collected results support the potent compounds for druglikeness and strong binding affinity with the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Hence, selected compounds are advocated as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and can be utilized in drug development against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bharadwaj, Shiv; Dubey, Amit; Yadava, Umesh; Mishra, Sarad Kumar; Kang, Sang Gu; Dwivedi, Vivek Dhar",Brief Bioinform,523,27

In the present study, one EV-G strain, named CH/17GXQZ/2017, was isolated and purified from piglets with diarrheic symptoms from the Guangxi Province, China. This strain produced stable cytopathic effects on Marc-145 cells with a titer of 5 × 10(6) PFU/mL. The spherical enterovirus particles with diameters of 25–30 nm were observed by using transmission electron microscopy.

It may present as de novo or, more frequently, as a result of acute decompensation of chronic heart failure (ADHF). Apart from the economic burden on patient and health care system, each AHF related hospitalization is associated with significant increases in 12-month rehospitalization and mortality rate (44% and 17% in ESC-HF pilot study; 30.2 and 30.8% in Trivandrum Heart Failure Registry) Maggioni et al. (2013), Harikrishnan et al. (2017) [1,2]. As of July 15th, India has about 936,181 cases and nearly 24,309 death attributed to novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection (Solomon et al., n.d. [3]). Unprecedented apprehension due to the rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering other diseases, including HF. Also, spread of COVID-19 pandemic attracted the major allocation of healthcare infrastructure and human resources, including emergency services, for the care of COVID-19 infected patients, and little is known about the effect of this stressed-out healthcare system on short and long term outcome in patients suffering from HF. Although, the implementation of lockdown by the Government (from March 25, 2020) initially slowed the community spread of COVID-19, but inadvertently, suspension of public transport further affected the delivery of medical care for HF patients, as most of the patients in India still use public transport for their emergency department (ED) visits. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients who were admitted for AHF (de novo and ADHF; left ventricular ejection fraction <40%) in two Medical college hospitals providing healthcare services in Jodhpur, western India. Both are regional tertiary care centres of local hub and spike networks for the management of various cardiovascular emergencies. Our EDs have a separate registration desks for patients coming with non-Covid-19 emergencies and COVID-19 symptoms, with clear signs at the entrance directing patients to the designated registration desk. Also, ED was expanded to avoid overcrowding and separate waiting area was created for those who have COVID-19 signs and symptoms. We analysed demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and outcome parameters in patients admitted for AHF during the study period of 16 weeks (March 25 to July 14, 2020; starting from the day when lockdown was imposed by Government of India) and compared this data with a control period of 16 weeks (Dec 05, 2019 to March 24, 2020; when there was no lockdown and number of COVID-19 attributed death ≤10). In addition, hospitalization rates during the study period were also compared with data from the same period in 2018–19. Patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were not included in study. Our analysis of patients admitted during the study (lockdown) period revealed 69% reduction in AHF hospitalizations as compared to the control period (241 vs 782) and 60% reduction compared to same calendar period from the previous year (144 vs 602; Figure 1). It was contrary to an expected increase due to the availability issue of guideline-directed medical therapy in follow-up patients and an anticipated surge in AHF due to late presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarction associated mechanical complications. Among the patients from the lockdown period, 96.7% presented with NYHA IV symptoms, this was significantly higher than the rate during the control period (out of 782; 76.6% presented with NYHA IV symptoms during the control period; p value <0.001; Table 1). The mean age (±SD) of patients in study and control period was 63.5(±11.2) and 61.1(±11.9) respectively, with no significant difference. Compared with control group, study group patients were more commonly male (82.6 vs 71.6%; p value <0.02), more likely to have atrial fibrillation (23.7 vs 18.2%; p value <0.02), lower eGFR (64.6 vs 77.7%; p value <0.05), lower mean ejection fraction (24.2 ± 5.6 vs 30.4 ± 4.9%; p value <0.001) and higher NT pro BNP levels (mean value 7349.2 vs 5680.4 pg/ml; p value <0.001). Median length of stay during study and control period was 5 and 4 days respectively. We also observed significantly increased in-hospital mortality during the lockdown period as compared to the control period (8.3% vs 5.4%; p value <0.001). The number of patients presenting to ED with AHF in western India has reduced significantly, and yet, late presentations with advanced symptoms and low EF seem to have increased. Similar pattern of decreased admission for cardiovascular emergency was reported from California, where weekly rates of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction decreased by up to 48% during the Covid-19 period (Solomon et al., n.d. [3]). The current case fatality rate for COVID-19 in India is approximately 2.6% [4], which is far less than that of AHF and we presume that many untreated AHF patients must have died at home during COVID-19 pandemic. There have been reports of the inexplicable increase in out of hospital cardiac arrests, revealing that patients were staying too long at home to seek care for a more severe medical condition (Wong et al., 2020 [5]). Complete suspension of public transit system along with lack of emergency medical services in India, risk of acquiring COVID-19 at ED and misleading information in media and social platforms about flooding of hospital beds due to COVID-19, even when there were reserved wards for other emergencies, led to hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering from even the most serious medical conditions. Hospitals are now erroneously perceived as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Community educational campaigns are imperative to convey that hospitals are secured, resourceful, and fully prepared for life-threatening emergencies; which if untreated, has higher morbidity and mortality rate as compared to COVID-19.","Choudhary, Rahul; Sharma, Jai Bharat; Deora, Surender; Kaushik, Atul; Sanghvi, Sanjeev; Mathur, Rohit",Am J Emerg Med,523,20

ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter‐regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID‐19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication and several co‐morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2‐expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID‐19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID‐19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID‐19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence‐based treatment strategies. Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers and RAAS inhibitors. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID‐19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines. In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID‐19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID‐19 severity. In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID‐19.

The world urgently needs a cost-effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus vaccine, antiviral and therapeutic drugs to control the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we engineered the Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike protein (S) variants (Receptor binding domain, RBD and S1 domain) of SARS-CoV-2 genes and produced in Nicotiana benthamiana plant. The purification yields were at least 20 mg of pure protein/kg of plant biomass for each target protein. The S protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 showed specific binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The purified plant produced N and S variants were recognized by N and S protein specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies demonstrating specific reactivity of mAb to plant produced N and S protein variants. In addition, IgG responses of plant produced N and S antigens elicited significantly high titers of antibody in mice. This is the first report demonstrating production of functional active S1 domain and Nucleocapsid protein of SARC-CoV-2 in plants. In addition, in this study, for the first time, we report the co-expression of RBD with N protein to produce a cocktail antigen of SARS-CoV-2, which elicited high-titer antibodies compared to RBD or N proteins. Thus, obtained data support that plant produced N and S antigens, developed in this study, are promising vaccine candidates against COVID-19.","Mamedov, Tarlan; Yuksel, Damla; Ilgın, Merve; Gürbüzaslan, İrem; Gulec, Burcu; Mammadova, Gulshan; Say, Deniz; Hasanova, Gulnara",bioRxiv,523,28

Even though respiratory manifestations are the most prevalent and responsible for disease morbidity and mortality, extrapulmonary involvement has progressively gained relevance. In particular, gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms, reported in up to two-thirds of patients with COVID-19, might represent the first and, in some cases, the only disease presentation. Their presence has been associated in some studies with an increased risk of a severe disease course. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms explaining GI tract involvement are either direct viral access to intestinal cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or indirect damage of the intestinal wall through mesenteric ischemia induced by the hypercoagulable state associated with COVID-19 infection. Although not typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection, several small bowel manifestations have been described in infected patients who underwent any form of abdominal imaging. The radiological findings were mainly reported in patients with abdominal symptoms, among which abdominal pain was the most common. AIM: To discuss small bowel radiological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in abdominal imaging studies. METHODS: Bibliographical searches were performed in PubMed, using the following keywords: “COVID-19” AND “imaging” AND “gastrointestinal” OR “abdominal” OR “small bowel”. RESULTS: Of 62 patients with described radiologic small bowel alterations, mesenteric ischemia was diagnosed in 31 cases (50%), small bowel wall thickening in 10 cases (16%), pneumatosis in nine cases (15%), intussusception in eight cases (13%), pneumoperitoneum in two cases (3%) and paralytic ileus in two cases (3%). We also reported mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy and lymph nodes enlargement in a young woman. CONCLUSION: So far it is difficult to establish whether these manifestations are the direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or collateral findings in infected patients, but their recognition would be pivotal to set a closer follow-up and to reduce missed diagnoses.","Pirola, Lorena; Palermo, Andrea; Mulinacci, Giacomo; Ratti, Laura; Fichera, Maria; Invernizzi, Pietro; Viganò, Chiara; Massironi, Sara",World J Gastrointest Surg,523,16

This article aims to determine whether the daily variation of glucose is influenced by the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients treated in Lima-Peru. METHODOLOGY: A prospective cohort study was undertook, in which glucose was measured four times a day in 53 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. These values were associated with the use of corticosteroids and adjusted for other socio-educational variables, all by means of PA-GEE models. RESULTS: Nested multivariate analysis of daily glucose variation found that those using corticosteroids increased the daily average glucose as well as the first and last glucose measurements, this is, at 6am and 10pm, respectively (all p-values <0.026). An increase in glucose levels was also observed in those with diabetes (all p-values <0.001). In contrast, we found that there was a decrease in the last glucose measurement of the day in obese patients (p-value = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The patients who used corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 increased the average glucose per day, especially in the first and last measurement.","Cardoza-Jiménez, Kennlly J.; Carranza-Zavala, Blanca; Manrique-Franco, Katty; Espinoza-Morales, Frank; Mejia, Christian R.",Diabetes Metab Syndr,523,21

There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus. In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, it became clear that emergency department design must evolve in order to be adequately prepared to handle the epidemic. The purpose of this research is to examine the design of the emergency department at a University Hospital using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation based on the ANSYS CFX package. Turbulence Kinetic Energy and Velocity profiles were analyzed to determine which areas of the ED were most susceptible to virus spread. The analysis revealed that three critical areas of the emergency department, namely overnight patient beds, operating rooms, and resuscitation rooms, had significantly higher air velocity, dispersion, and mixing levels than the rest of the department's spaces. According to the scenario examined, the possibility of air transmission from these locations to neighboring areas becomes apparent, increasing the likelihood of transmitting the virus from these locations and infecting people in the adjacent areas, including patients or health care providers. Using the results of these simulations, a solution in the form of instructions for the arrangement of inlets and outlets, the separation of spaces, and the interior design of the spaces and hallways can be presented to the hospital administration. All of which can be implemented in the current design of the emergency department.","Obeidat, Bushra; Fawwaz Alrebei, Odai; Atef Abdallah, Ibrahim; Faris, Eman; Amhamed, Abdulkarem",Alexandria Engineering Journal,523,30

However, few studies take into consideration the imbalanced data distribution, which can impair the performance of a classifier. METHOD: A novel combined dynamic ensemble selection (DES) method is proposed for imbalanced data to detect COVID-19 from complete blood count. This method combines data preprocessing and improved DES. Firstly, we use the hybrid synthetic minority over-sampling technique and edited nearest neighbor (SMOTE-ENN) to balance data and remove noise. Secondly, in order to improve the performance of DES, a novel hybrid multiple clustering and bagging classifier generation (HMCBCG) method is proposed to reinforce the diversity and local regional competence of candidate classifiers. RESULTS: The experimental results based on three popular DES methods show that the performance of HMCBCG is better than only use bagging. HMCBCG+KNE obtains the best performance for COVID-19 screening with 99.81% accuracy, 99.86% F1, 99.78% G-mean and 99.81% AUC. CONCLUSION: Compared to other advanced methods, our combined DES model can improve accuracy, G-mean, F1 and AUC of COVID-19 screening.","Wu, Jiachao; Shen, Jiang; Xu, Man; Shao, Minglai",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,523,16

Methods: We evaluated the 2018 WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization for country reports on adult immunization programs. We described countries with programs and used multivariable regression to identify independent factors associated with having them. Results: Of 194 WHO Member States, 120 (62%) reported having any adult vaccination program. The Americas and Europe had the most adult immunization programs, most commonly Hepatitis B and influenza vaccines (>45% and >90% of countries). Africa and South-East Asia had the fewest adult immunization programs, with <11% of countries reporting any adult immunization programs for influenza or hepatitis vaccines, and none for pneumococcal vaccines. In bivariate analyses, high- or upper-middle income, introduction of new or underused vaccines, having achieved pediatric vaccine coverage goals, and meeting National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups basic functional indicators were significantly associated (p<0.001) with having any adult immunization programs. In multivariable analyses, the factor most strongly associated with adult immunization programs was country income, with high- or upper-middle income countries significantly more likely to report having a program (aOR 19.3, 95% CI 6.5, 57.7). Discussion: That 38% of countries lack functional platforms for adult immunization has major implications for future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine deployment. Systems for vaccine storage and handling, delivery, and waste management for adult immunization do not exist in much of the world. Developing countries should strengthen immunization programs to reach adults with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines when they become available.","Williams, S. R.; Driscoll, A. J.; LeBuhn, H. M.; Chen, W.

Lower respiratory infection (LRI) is a sensitive response to short-term exposure to outdoor PM pollution. The airborne transmission of etiological agents of LRI, as an important pathway for infection and morbidity, bridges the public health issues of air quality and pathogen infectivity, virulence, resistance, and others. Enormous efforts are underway to identify common pathogens and substances that are etiological agents for LRI and to understand the underlying toxicological and clinical basis of health effects by identifying mechanistic pathways. Seasonal variations and geographical disparities in the survival and infectivity of LRI pathogens are unsolved mysteries. Weather conditions in geographical areas may have a key effect, but also potentially connect LRI with short-term increases in ambient air PM pollution. Statistical associations show that short-term elevations in fine and coarse PM lead to increases in respiratory infections, but the causative agents could be chemical or microbiological and be present individually or in mixtures, and the interactions between chemical and microbiological agents remain undefined. Further investigations on high-resolution monitoring of airborne pathogens in relation to PM pollution for an integrated exposure–response assessment and mechanistic study are warranted. Improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal features of pathogenic bioaerosols and air pollutants and translating scientific evidence into effective policies is vital to reducing the health risks and devastating death toll from PM pollution.

Our objective is to report our practice implementation and experience of COVID- 19 recovery during the resumption of routine imaging at a tertiary academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines for this practice implementation. Recover Wisely focused on a data driven, strategic rescheduling and redesigning patient flow process. We used scheduling simulations and meticulous monitoring and control of outpatient medical imaging volumes to achieve a linear restoration to our pre-COVID imaging studies. We had a tiered plan to address the backlog of rescheduled patients with gradual opening of our imaging facilities, while maintaining broad communication with our patients and referring clinicians. RESULTS: Recover Wisely followed our anticipated linear modelling. Considering the last 10 weeks in the recovery, outpatient growth was linear with an increase of approximately 172 cases per week, (R 2 =0.97). We achieved an overall recovery of 102% in week 10, as compared to average weekly pre-COVID outpatient volumes. The modalities recovered as follows in outpatient volumes: CT (113%), MRI (101%), nuclear medicine including PET (138%), mammograms (97%), ultrasound (99%) and interventional radiology (106%). When compared to identical 2019 calendar weeks (5/4/20-7/10/20), the total 2020 radiology volume was 11% reduced from the 2019 volume. The reduction in total weighted relative value units was 8% in this time period, as compared to 2019. CONCLUSION: Our department utilized a data-driven, team approach based on our guiding principles to “Recover Wisely”. We created and implemented a methodology that achieved a linear increase in outpatient studies over a 10-week recovery period.","Vagal, Achala; Mahoney, Mary; Anderson, Jeffrey L; Allen, Becky; Hudepohl, Joseph; Chadalavada, Seetharam; Choe, Kyuran; Kapur, Sangita; Gaskill-Shipley, Mary; Makramalla, Abouelmagd; Brown, Ann; Braley, Susan; England, Eric; Scheler, Jennifer; Udstuen, Gavin; Rybicki, Frank",Acad Radiol,523,20

RT-PCR detects RNA, not infectious virus, thus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. Infectivity is a critical determinant in informing public health guidelines/interventions. Our goal was to determine the relationship between E gene SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values from respiratory samples, symptom onset to test (STT) and infectivity in cell culture. METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we took SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed positive samples and determined their ability to infect Vero cell lines. RESULTS: Ninety RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were incubated on Vero cells. Twenty-six samples (28.9%) demonstrated viral growth. Median TCID50/ml was 1780 (282-8511). There was no growth in samples with a Ct > 24 or STT > 8 days. Multivariate logistic regression using positive viral culture as a binary predictor variable, STT and Ct demonstrated an odds ratio for positive viral culture of 0.64 (95% CI 0.49-0.84, p<0.001) for every one unit increase in Ct. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for Ct vs. positive culture was OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.85-0.97, p<0.001), with 97% specificity obtained at a Ct of >24. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 Vero cell infectivity was only observed for RT-PCR Ct < 24 and STT < 8 days. Infectivity of patients with Ct >24 and duration of symptoms >8 days may be low. This information can inform public health policy and guide clinical, infection control and occupational health decisions. Further studies of larger size are needed.","Bullard, Jared; Dust, Kerry; Funk, Duane; Strong, James E; Alexander, David; Garnett, Lauren; Boodman, Carl; Bello, Alexander; Hedley, Adam; Schiffman, Zachary; Doan, Kaylie; Bastien, Nathalie; Li, Yan; Van Caeseele, Paul G; Poliquin, Guillaume",Clin Infect Dis,523,24

Lung-protective ventilation in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory failure may result in severe respiratory acidosis without significant hypoxemia. Low-flow extracorporeal Co(2) removal can facilitate lung-protective ventilation and avoid the adverse effects of severe respiratory acidosis. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal Co(2) removal using the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System in correcting severe respiratory acidosis in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 mechanically ventilated with severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis and treated with low-flow extracorporeal Co(2) removal. SETTING: Eight tertiary ICUs in the United States. PATIENTS: Adult patients supported with the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System from March 1, to September 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Extracorporeal Co(2) removal with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System under a Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was improvement in pH and Paco(2) from baseline. Secondary outcomes included survival to decannulation, mortality, time on ventilator, and adverse events. Thirty-one patients were treated with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System with significant improvement in pH and Pco(2) in this cohort. Two patients experienced complications that prevented treatment. Of the 29 treated patients, 58% survived to 48 hours post treatment and 38% to hospital discharge. No difference in age or comorbidities were noted between survivors and nonsurvivors. There was significant improvement in pH (7.24 ± 0.12 to 7.35 ± 0.07; p < 0.0001) and Paco(2) (79 ± 23 to 58 ± 14; p < 0.0001) from baseline to 24 hours.

There is an opportunity for decision makers to learn from past policies that facilitated recovery from other disease outbreaks, crises, and natural disasters that have had a devastating effect on economies around the world. To support the development of the United Nations Research Roadmap for COVID-19 Recovery, this review examined and synthesized peer-reviewed studies and gray literature that focused on macroeconomic policy responses and multilateral coalition strategies from past pandemics and crises to provide a map of the existing evidence. We conducted a systematic search of academic and gray literature databases. After screening, we found 22 records that were eligible for this review. The evidence found demonstrates that macroeconomic and multilateral coalition strategies have various impacts on a diverse set of countries and populations. Although the studies were heterogeneous in nature, most did find positive results for macroeconomic intervention policies that addressed investments to strengthen health and social protection systems, specifically cash and unconventional/nonstandard monetary measures, in-kind transfers, social security financing, and measures geared toward certain population groups.","Embrett, Mark; Bielska, Iwona A.; Manis, Derek R.; Cooper, Rhiannon; Agarwal, Gina; Nartowski, Robert; Moore, Emily; Lopatina, Elena; Conway, Aislinn; Clark, Kathryn",Int J Health Serv,523,7

Molecules or extracts inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 chymotripsin-like protease (3CL(Pro)) could contribute to reducing or suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Using a targeted approach, we identified 17 plant products that are included in current and traditional cuisines as promising inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity. Methanolic extracts were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CL(Pro) activity using a quenched fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Extracts from turmeric (Curcuma longa) rhizomes, mustard (Brassica nigra) seeds, and wall rocket (Diplotaxis erucoides subsp. erucoides) at 500 µg mL(−1) displayed significant inhibition of the 3CL(Pro) activity, resulting in residual protease activities of 0.0%, 9.4%, and 14.9%, respectively. Using different extract concentrations, an IC(50) value of 15.74 µg mL(−1) was calculated for turmeric extract. Commercial curcumin inhibited the 3CL(Pro) activity, but did not fully account for the inhibitory effect of turmeric rhizomes extracts, suggesting that other components of the turmeric extract must also play a main role in inhibiting the 3CL(Pro) activity. Sinigrin, a major glucosinolate present in mustard seeds and wall rocket, did not have relevant 3CL(Pro) inhibitory activity; however, its hydrolysis product allyl isothiocyanate had an IC(50) value of 41.43 µg mL(−1). The current study identifies plant extracts and molecules that can be of interest in the search for treatments against COVID-19, acting as a basis for future chemical, in vivo, and clinical trials.","Guijarro-Real, Carla; Plazas, Mariola; Rodríguez-Burruezo, Adrián; Prohens, Jaime; Fita, Ana",Foods,523,1

In principle, it is straightforward to estimate this quantity from individual follow‐up data that provides times from onset to death or recovery. In particular, in a competing risks context, the case fatality ratio is defined by the limiting value of the sub‐distribution function, F (1)(t) = Pr(T ⩽t and J = 1), associated with death, as t → ∞, where T denotes the time from onset to death (J = 1) or recovery (J = 2). When censoring is present, however, estimation of F (1)(∞) is complicated by the possibility of little information regarding the right tail of F (1), requiring use of estimators of F (1)(t(*)) or F (1)(t (*))/(F (1)(t (*))+F (2)(t (*))) where t (*) is large, with F (2)(t) = Pr(T ⩽t and J = 2) being the analogous sub‐distribution function associated with recovery. With right censored data, the variability of such estimators increases as t (*) increases, suggesting the possibility of using estimators at lower values of t (*) where bias may be increased but overall mean squared error be smaller. These issues are investigated here for non‐parametric estimators of F (1) and F (2).

However, the use of masks often causes soaring temperatures and thick humid air, leading to thermal and wear discomfort and breathing difficulties for a number of people, and further increasing the elevated risk of heat illnesses including heat stroke and heat exhaustion. When wearers become highly active or work under high tension, the excess sweat generated negatively affects the functionality of masks. Here, we report on an innovative design of an air-conditioned mask (AC Mask) system, facilitating thermoregulation in the mask microclimate, ease of breathing, and wear comfort. The AC Mask system is developed by integrating a cost-effective and lightweight thermoelectric (TE) and ventilation unit in a wearable 3D printed mask device, compatible with existing disposable masks, to protect end users safely against toxic particles such as viruses. A wind-guided tunnel has been developed for quick and efficient ventilation of cooling air. Based on a human trial, reductions in the apparent microclimate temperature and the humidity by 3.5 °C and 50%, respectively, have been achieved under a low voltage. With the excellent thermal management properties, the AC Mask will find also wide application among professional end-users such as construction workers, firefighters, and medical personnel.","Suen, Wing Sze; Huang, Guanghan; Kang, Zhanxiao; Gu, Yuheng; Fan, Jintu; Shou, Dahua",Build Environ,523,16

All U.S. optometry school deans and state optometric association presidents were mailed a questionnaire and instructions to return it by mail on completion; 2 repeated mailings were made. Descriptive statistics were produced and differences between deans and association presidents were tested by Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 50% (25 returned/50 sent) for the state association presidents and 65% (11/17) for the deans. There were no statistically significant differences between the leadership groups for any survey questions. All agreed that optometrists have the skills, are ethically obligated to help, and that optometrists should receive additional training for participation in disaster response. There was general agreement that optometrists should provide first-aid, obtain medical histories, triage, maintain infection control, manage a point of distribution, prescribe medications, and counsel the “worried well.” Starting intravenous lines, interpreting radiographs, and suturing were less favorably supported. There was some response variability between the 2 leadership groups regarding potential sources for training.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify availability and wait times for new patient appointments in primary care and to describe how primary care practices are guiding patients with suspected COVID-19. DESIGN: Trained callers conducted simulated patient calls to 800 randomly sampled primary care practices between September 14, 2020, and September 28, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: We extracted complete primary care physician listings from large commercial insurance networks in four geographically dispersed states between September 10 and 14, 2020 (n=11,521). After excluding non-physician providers and removing duplicate phone numbers, we identified 2705 unique primary care physician practices from which we randomly sampled 200 practices in each region. MAIN MEASURES: Primary care appointment availability, median wait time in days, and practice guidance to patients suspecting COVID-19 infection. KEY RESULTS: Among 56% of listed practices that had accurate contact information listed in the directory, 84% offered a new patient in-person or virtual appointment. Median wait time was 10 days (IQR 3–26 days). The most common guidance in case of suspected COVID-19 was clinician consultation, which was offered in 41% of completed calls. Callers were otherwise directed to on-site testing (14%), off-site testing (24%), a COVID-19 hotline (8%), or an urgent care/emergency department (12%), while 2% of practices had no guidance to offer. CONCLUSIONS: Despite resource constraints, most reachable primary care practices offered timely new patient appointments as well as direct COVID-19 care.

METHODS: This was an electronic survey comprising ICUs in two administrative regions of Poland. The aim of the study was to determine the number of influenza patients with respiratory failure admitted to the ICU in the autumn–winter season of 2018/2019. Furthermore, respiratory support, outcome and other pathogens detected in the airways were investigated. RESULTS: Influenza infection was confirmed in 76 patients. The A(H1N1)pdm09 strain was the most common. 34 patients died (44.7%). The median age was 62 years, the median sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 11 and was higher in patients who died (12 vs. 10, p = 0.017). Mechanical ventilation was used in 75 patients and high flow nasal oxygen therapy in 1 patient. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used in 7 patients (6 survived), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) in 2 (1 survived). The prone position was used in 16 patients. In addition, other pathogens were detected in the airways on admittance to the ICU. CONCLUSION: A substantial number of influenza infections occurred in the autumn–winter season of 2018/2019 that required costly treatment in the intensive care units. Upon admission to the ICU, influenza patients had a high degree of organ failure as assessed by the SOFA score, and the mortality rate was 44.7%.

Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce one’s carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.","Taylor, Steven",J Anxiety Disord,523,15

Both acute and chronic cardiovascular impacts have so far been attributed to particulate-mediated oxidative stress in the lung and/or via ‘secondary’ pathways, including endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. However, increasing evidence indicates the translocation of inhaled nanoparticles to major organs via the circulation. It is essential to identify the composition and intracellular targets of such particles, since these are likely to determine their toxicity and consequent health impacts. Of potential major concern is the abundant presence of iron-rich air pollution nanoparticles, emitted from a range of industry and traffic-related sources. Bioreactive iron can catalyse formation of damaging reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and cell damage or death. Here, we identify for the first time, in situ, that exogenous nanoparticles (∼15 – 40 nm diameter) within myocardial mitochondria of young, highly-exposed subjects are dominantly iron-rich, and co-associated with other reactive metals including aluminium and titanium. These rounded, electrodense nanoparticles (up to ∼ 10 x more abundant than in lower-pollution controls) are located within abnormal myocardial mitochondria (e.g. deformed cristae; ruptured membranes). Measurements of an oxidative stress marker, PrP(C) and an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, GRP78, identify significant ventricular up-regulation in the highly-exposed vs lower-pollution controls. In shape/size/composition, the within-mitochondrial particles are indistinguishable from the iron-rich, combustion- and friction-derived nanoparticles prolific in roadside/urban environments, emitted from traffic/industrial sources. Incursion of myocardial mitochondria by inhaled iron-rich air pollution nanoparticles thus appears associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and excess formation of reactive oxygen species through the iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction. Ventricular oxidative stress, as indicated by PrP(C) and GRP78 up-regulation, is evident even in children/young adults with minimal risk factors and no co-morbidities. These new findings indicate that myocardial iron overload resulting from inhalation of airborne, metal-rich nanoparticles is a plausible and modifiable environmental risk factor for cardiac oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease, on an international scale.","Barbara A, Maher; González-Maciel, A.; Reynoso-Robles, R.; Torres-Jardón, R.; Calderón-Garcidueñas, L.",Environ Res,523,26

Existing research on coronavirus mutations is based on small data sets, and multiple sequence alignment using a global-scale data set has yet to be conducted. Statistical analysis of integral mutations and global spread are necessary and could help improve primer design for nucleic acid diagnosis and vaccine development. Here, we optimized multiple sequence alignment using a conserved sequence search algorithm to align 24,768 sequences from the GISAID data set. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. Coronavirus subtypes were analyzed via t-SNE clustering. We performed haplotype network analysis and t-SNE clustering to analyze the coronavirus origin and spread. Overall, we identified 33 sense, 17 nonsense, 79 amino acid loss, and 4 amino acid insertion mutations in full-length open reading frames. Phylogenetic trees were successfully constructed and samples clustered into subtypes. The COVID-19 pandemic differed among countries and continents. Samples from the United States and western Europe were more diverse, and those from China and Asia mainly contained specific subtypes. Clades G/GH/GR are more likely to be the origin clades of SARS-CoV-2 compared with clades S/L/V. Conserved sequence searches can be used to segment long sequences, making large-scale multisequence alignment possible, facilitating more comprehensive gene mutation analysis. Mutation analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 can inform primer design for nucleic acid diagnosis to improve virus detection efficiency.

Comparisons of plaque assays before and after NTP treatment found exponentially increasing inactivation of aerosolized MS2 phage with increasing applied voltage. At 30 kV and an air flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute, a greater than 2.3 log reduction of infective virus was achieved across the reactor. This reduction represented ~2 log of the MS2 inactivated and ~0.35 log physically removed in the packed bed. Increasing the air flow rate from 170 to 330 liters per minute did not significantly impact virus inactivation effectiveness. Activated carbon-based ozone filters greatly reduced residual ozone, in some cases down to background levels, while adding less than 20 Pa pressure differential to the 45 Pa differential pressure across the packed bed at the flow rate of 170 standard liters per minute.","Xia, T; Kleinheksel, A; Lee, E M; Qiao, Z; Wigginton, K R; Clack, H L",J Phys D Appl Phys,523,28

The objective of this work was to analyze the association of leisure, domestic and professional physical activities with mild and moderate cognitive disorders in older people living in the community. Methods: We used retrospective data from the “FRéLE” (FRagilité: étude Longitudinale de ses Expressions) a longitudinal and observational study. Data collected included socio-demographic variables, lifestyle and health status. Cognitive disorders were assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Two cut-offs of MoCA were used to analyze mild and moderate cognitive disorders. Physical activity was assessed by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) structured in three sections: leisure, household, and professional activities. Spline and logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk of cognitive disorders. Results: At baseline, 428 participants (for study of mild disorders) and 1,271 participants (for study of moderate disorders) without cognitive disorders were included in the analysis. The mean ages were 74 and 78 years, respectively. After a 2-year follow-up, we found mild cognitive disorders in 154 participants (36%) and 71 cases of moderate cognitive disorders (5.6%). In multi-adjusted logistic models, domestic activities were associated with cognitive disorders, but not leisure and professional activities. Conclusion: We found an inverse relation between domestic sub-score and cognitive disorders defined by MoCA < 18. With a specific questionnaire and quantitative information on the type of activities, this study contributed to the debate on the beneficial effects of physical activity on cognition.","Dupré, Caroline; Hupin, David; Goethals, Luc; Béland, François; Roche, Frédéric; Célarier, Thomas; Carrière, Isabelle; Barth, Nathalie; Bongue, Bienvenu",Front Public Health,523,1

This affects continuity in the implementation of the neuroanatomy component of the medical neuroscience laboratory activities during COVID-19. We hypothesized that pivoting wet laboratory neuroanatomy activities to online using an adaptive flexible blended method might represent an effective approach in the implementation of laboratory neuroanatomy activities during a pandemic. METHODS: The current study describes an adaptive flexible blended learning approach that systematically mixes virtual face-to-face interaction activities with the online learning of brain structures, and the discussion of clinical cases. Learning materials are delivered through both synchronous and asynchronous modes, and Year 1 medical students learn neuroanatomy laboratory activities at different locations and different times. Student performances in the adaptive flexible blended learning approach were compared with the learning of similar activities during an in-person implementation of neuroscience laboratory activities. RESULTS: The results of using this adaptive flexible blended learning approach provided an autonomous independent learning, self-study approach that broadened student performance such that we have more students scoring between 80 and 89%, whereas the in-person learning resulted in most of the students scoring > 90% in the medical neuroscience laboratory activities. CONCLUSION: An adaptive flexible blended learning approach that combined virtual face-to-face instruction using digital technology with online learning of neuroscience laboratory activities provided a unique educational experience for Year 1 medical students to learn neuroscience laboratory activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nathaniel, Thomas I.; Black, Asa C",Med Sci Educ,523,16

METHODS: Ninety-two patients with mild-to-moderate COVID19-associated ARDS were allocated to the placebo (45-cases) or NAC groups (47-cases). Besides standard-of-care treatment, the patients received either intravenous NAC at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day or the placebo for three consecutive days. The efficacy outcomes were overall mortality over 28-day, clinical status on day 28, based on the WHO Master Protocol, the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, changes in ARDS-severity (based on the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores 48 and 96 h after intervention, RESULTS: No differences were found in the 28-day mortality rate between the two groups (25.5% vs. 31.1% in the NAC and placebo groups, respectively). Although the distribution of the clinical status at day 28 shifted towards better outcomes in the NAC-treated group, it did not reach a statistical significance level (p value = 0.83). Similar results were achieved in terms of the proportion of patients who required invasive ventilator support (38.3% vs. 44.4%), the number of ventilator-free days (17.4 vs. 16.6), and median time of ICU and hospital stay. Results regarding the change in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and SOFA scores also showed no significant differences between the groups.

Secondary aortoenteric fistula has relative higher incidence compared to primary and is more common with open aortic repair versus endovascular stent graft repair. Ectopic gas in the aneurysm sac and extravasation of enteric contrast into the aneurysm sac is diagnostic for aortoenteric fistula. However, enteric contrast is not recommended for routine evaluation of aortoenteric because the aforementioned finding is extremely rare.

Significant variation in treatment protocols and management is evident in the literature. Reducing geographical treatment variation has been identified as one of The James Lind Alliance priorities in children’s orthopaedics. For this reason, the British Society of Children’s Orthopaedic Surgery (BSCOS) commissioned a consensus document to form a benchmark for practitioners and ensure consistent high quality care for children with CTEV. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The consensus will follow an established Delphi approach aiming at gaining an agreement on the items to be included in the consensus statement for the management of primary idiopathic CTEV up to walking age. The process will include the following steps: (1) establishing a steering group, (2) steering group meetings, (3) a two-round Delphi survey aimed at BSCOS members, (4) final consensus meeting and (5) dissemination of the consensus statement. Degree of agreement for each item will be predetermined. Descriptive statistics will be used for analysis of the Delphi survey results.

Diagnostic criteria are derived from canine studies and to our knowledge, have not been critically reviewed for cats. Objective: To evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings in cats with multiple myeloma and appraise diagnostic criteria. Methods: Retrospective evaluation of medical records was performed. Inclusion required an antemortem diagnosis of multiple myeloma using 2 of 4 criteria: 1) ≥20% plasma cells in the bone marrow, or ≥10% if atypical plasma cells; 2) paraproteinemia; 3) radiographically‐evident osteolysis; 4) light chain proteinuria. Alternatively, a postmortem diagnosis was based on the findings of multiple plasma cell neoplasms, with marrow involvement. Results: Sixteen cats were diagnosed with multiple myeloma between 1996 and 2004, with a median age of 14.0 years; 9 of 16 (56%) were castrated males, and 7 of 16 (44%) were spayed females.

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, and with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the only ones to cause severe diseases. Lessons from these two previous outbreaks guided the identification of critical therapeutic targets such as the spike viral proteins promoting the virus’s cellular entry through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on the surface of multiple types of eukaryotic cells. Although several therapeutic agents are currently evaluated, none seems to provide a clear path for a cure.

For instance, skew analysis of the nucleotide bias of several viral RNA genomes indicated that it is enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded genome regions, thus creating an even more striking virus-specific signature. The comparison of skew graphs for many virus isolates or families is difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative. Here, we present a procedure for a more simple identification of similarities and dissimilarities between nucleotide skew data of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 RNA genomes. Window and step sizes were normalized to correct for differences in length of the viral genome. Cumulative skew data are converted into pairwise Euclidean distance matrices, which can be presented as neighbor-joining trees. We present skew value trees for the four virus families and show that closely related viruses are placed in small clusters. Importantly, the skew value trees are similar to the trees constructed by a “classical” model of evolutionary nucleotide substitution. Thus, we conclude that the simple calculation of Euclidean distances between nucleotide skew data allows an easy and quantitative comparison of characteristic sequence signatures of virus genomes. These results indicate that the Euclidean distance analysis of nucleotide skew data forms a nice addition to the virology toolbox.","van Hemert, Formijn; Jebbink, Maarten; van der Ark, Andries; Scholer, Frits; Berkhout, Ben",Comput Math Methods Med,523,4

METHODS: We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. RESULTS: In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th(,) 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. INTERPRETATION: Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada.

Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15.0%) compared to White (5.5%; P<.001) and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9% vs 7.8%; P<.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smokers and patients who recently received cancer therapy (<6 months). The COVID-19 attributable mortality was 10.9%. Higher attributable mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with higher Charlson comorbidity score, and in certain cancer types. Recent (<6 months) or past treatment did not influence attributable mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher COVID-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar attributable mortality as White patients. CONCLUSION: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall COVID-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, comorbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.","Fillmore, Nathanael R; La, Jennifer; Szalat, Raphael E; Tuck, David P; Nguyen, Vinh; Yildirim, Cenk; Do, Nhan V; Brophy, Mary T; Munshi, Nikhil C",J Natl Cancer Inst,523,29

ET is not synthesized by animals, including humans, but is avidly taken up from the diet, especially from mushrooms. In the current study, we elucidated the effect of ET on the hCMEC/D3 human brain endothelial cell line. Endothelial cells are exposed to high levels of the cholesterol oxidation product, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and this process is thought to mediate pathological inflammation. 7KC induces a dose-dependent loss of cell viability and an increase in apoptosis and necrosis in the endothelial cells. A relocalization of the tight junction proteins, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, towards the nucleus of the cells was also observed. These effects were significantly attenuated by ET. In addition, 7KC induces marked increases in the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), as well as COX2 enzymatic activity, and these were significantly reduced by ET. Moreover, the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ET were significantly reduced by co-incubation with an inhibitor of the ET transporter, OCTN1 (VHCL). This shows that ET needs to enter the endothelial cells to have a protective effect and is unlikely to act via extracellular neutralizing of 7KC. The protective effect on inflammation in brain endothelial cells suggests that ET might be useful as a nutraceutical for the prevention or management of neurovascular diseases, such as stroke and vascular dementia. Moreover, the ability of ET to cross the blood-brain barrier could point to its usefulness in combatting 7KC that is produced in the CNS during neuroinflammation, e.g. after excitotoxicity, in chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and possibly COVID-19-related neurologic complications.","Koh, Sally Shuxian; Ooi, Samantha Chia-Yi; Lui, Natalie Man-Yin; Qiong, Cao; Ho, Leona Ting-Yuke; Cheah, Irwin Kee-Mun; Halliwell, Barry; Herr, Deron R.; Ong, Wei-Yi",Neuromolecular Med,523,20

Plasmids containing cDNAs corresponding to each of the full-length double-stranded RNA genome segments of AHSV-4 under control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter were co-transfected in cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase, and infectious AHSV-4 was recovered. This reverse genetics system was improved by reducing the required plasmids from 10 to five and resulted in enhanced virus recovery. Subsequently, a T7 RNA polymerase expression cassette was incorporated into one of the AHSV-4 rescue plasmids. This modified 5-plasmid set enabled virus recovery in BSR or L929 cells, thus offering the possibility to generate AHSV-4 in any cell line. Moreover, mutant and cross-serotype reassortant viruses were recovered. These plasmid DNA-based reverse genetics systems thus offer new possibilities for investigating AHSV biology and development of designer AHSV vaccine strains.","Conradie, Andelé M.; Stassen, Liesel; Huismans, Henk; Potgieter, Christiaan A.; Theron, Jacques",Virology,523,16

However, general community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations are poorly understood. Thus, the study aimed to investigate community knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards COVID-19 vaccinations in Bangladesh. METHODS: An exploratory and anonymous population-based e-survey was conducted among 1658 general individuals (55.6% male; mean age = 23.17 ± 6.05 years; age range = 18–65 years). The survey was conducted using a semi-structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with four sections (i.e., socio-demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions). Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables predicting knowledge, and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations. RESULTS: The mean scores of knowledge and attitudes were 2.83 ± 1.48 (out of 5) and 9.34 ± 2.39 (out of 12) respectively. About a quarter of participants thought that the COVID-19 vaccination available in Bangladesh is safe, only 60% will have the vaccination and about two-thirds will recommend it to family and friends. In the multiple regression model, higher SES, having university/ higher levels of education, having nuclear families and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake were associated with knowledge; whilst attitudes were significantly associated with being female and having previous history of essential vaccines uptake. Just over half of the participants thought that everyone should be vaccinated and 61% responded that health workers should be vaccinated first on priority basis. 95% of respondents believed the vaccine should be administered free of charge in Bangladesh and almost 90% believed that the COVID-19 vaccine used in Bangladesh may have side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reflect inadequate knowledge but more positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine among the general population in Bangladesh. In order to improve knowledge, immediate health education programs need to be initiated before mass vaccination are scheduled.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions regarding the technological instruction and accommodations provided to deaf students in online distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was qualitative in nature and used anonymous, one-to-one semi-structured interviews. In June 2020, we interviewed a convenience sample of deaf students (n = 15) and their instructors (n = 3) and analysed the responses thematically. Upon achieving theme saturation, the thematic structure analysis was finalised. The results revealed five main themes related to deaf students’ experience with online distance learning during COVID-19. The themes are as follows: course content delivered, technology used, delivery method, assessment tools used, and social interactions. Each theme is discussed and compared with the related literature to scientifically encapsulate its suggested dimensions. The interviewed students described their experience of using online technology in both negative and positive terms. Instructors also provided their input to express their experiences during that time. Online distance learning was described as a difficult and challenging experience that lacked efficient communication channels and failed to address the needs of the deaf with respect to the communication medium. The typical course delivery methods were described as challenging, and the lack of social interaction was highlighted as a liability. At the same time, participants acknowledged some ancillary benefits of online distance learning especially that it enhanced their technology skills and their competences in adapting to a new environment.","Alshawabkeh, Abdallah A.; Woolsey, M.

However, the diagnostic challenges are the remaining concerns for its wider adoption by pathologists, and these concerns should be addressed in a specific subspecialty. We aim to identify the common diagnostic pitfalls of whole slide imaging (WSI), one modality of DM, in gastrointestinal (GI) pathology. From validating studies of primary diagnosis performance, we included 16 records with features on GI cases involved, at least two weeks wash-out periods, and more than 60 case study designs. A tailored quality appraisal assessment was utilized to evaluate the risks of bias for these diagnostic accuracy studies. Furthermore, due to the highly heterogeneous studies and unstandardized definition of discordance, we extract the discordant cases in GI pathology and calculate the discrepant rate, resulting from 0.5% to 64.28%. Targeting discrepancy cases between digital microscopy and light microscopy, we demonstrate five main diagnostic pitfalls regarding WSI as follows: additional time to review slides in WSI, hard to identify dysplasia nucleus, missed organisms like Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), specific cell recognitions, and technical issues. After detailed reviews and analysis, we generate two essential suggestions for further GI cases signing out by DM. One is to use systematized 20x scans for diagnostic workouts and requesting 40x or even 60x scans for challenging cases; another is that a high-volume slides training should be set before the real clinical application of WSI for primary diagnosis, particularly in GI pathology.","Shi, Wangpan; Georgiou, Petros; Akram, Aqsa; Proute, Matthew C; Serhiyenia, Tatsiana; Kerolos, Mina E; Pradeep, Roshini; Kothur, Nageshwar R; Khan, Safeera",Cureus,523,20

However, sustained lifestyle change is difficult for everyone and may be more difficult for those with executive dysfunction, including some people living with HIV. Thus, the key question is how we can improve adherence to the most promising interventions among people living with HIV experiencing cognitive difficulties. Goal management training is a cognitive rehabilitation program that targets executive dysfunction by teaching goal-directed behaviour and self-management. It is a promising means to improve adherence to lifestyle interventions. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the extent to which goal management training before a healthy lifestyle program is associated with greater adherence to health recommendations, achievement of health-related goals, and better brain health and health outcomes compared to the healthy lifestyle program alone among people living with HIV. METHODS: Brain Health Now cohort participants with cognitive difficulties or are not aging successfully are eligible. All participants will be given health resources, a health coach, a goal-setting digital application, and access to an online goal-setting workshop. The intervention group will participate in nine 2-h goal management training sessions and then will enter the healthy lifestyle program. Control participants will enter the healthy lifestyle program directly. A total sample of 100 participants will participate for 12 months. The main outcome is adherence to the healthy lifestyle program, defined as the number of weeks where physical activity adherence targets were met (150 min per week, measured with an activity monitor). Weekly social activities will be captured via self-report with confidential photo validation. We will send weekly health state reports to the participants. Downstream outcomes include cognitive ability, health-related quality of life, mobility, vascular risk profile, and social network size. We will analyze the data using a linear regression model. DISCUSSION: This project is the first to test whether goal management training can augment adherence to health recommendations among individuals with cognitive difficulties. If successful, behavioural interventions such as goal management training could be implemented as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions in other clinical populations.

This study is focused on assessing the level of practice and factors affecting practice towards COVID-19 among health care workers in health care facility of West Guji Zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia. METHODS: health facility based cross-sectional study design was carried out from December 1(st) to 30(th) 2020 among health care providers in West Guji Zone. The simple random sampling technique was used in study and total sample size for this study was 281. The data enter into Epi Data version 4.4.3.1 and SPSS Version 25 used for analysis. The descriptive statistics and logistic regression are needed. The cut point for statically significance settled at p < 0.05. RESULTS: the response rate in this study was 97.8%. Of all study participants, 50.2%, 8.4%, and 6.5% had traveling history, chronic illnesses, and contact with COVID-19 confirmed cases. Too much working, lack of training, and shortage of protective equipment were reported by 54.5%, 50.9%, and 29.1% respectively. About 36.4% and 38.2% of health care providers had poor level of knowledge and prevention practice towards COVID-19.

Responsibility is a useful lens through which to examine the current state of food poverty in the UK in the context of the Covid‐19 crisis, noting that this concept contains several paradoxes. Currently, responsibility involves the voluntary sector, the food industry and the state, a situation which the author has been exploring for the last five years in an ethnographic study of food poverty and food aid in the UK. Food aid organizations, especially food banks, have mushroomed during the period of austerity. This reveals the first paradox: namely, that the existence of food banks conveys the message that ‘something is being done’, but in actuality this is very far from being sufficient to meet the needs of either the ‘old’ or ‘new’ food insecure. The second paradox is that at the onset of the crisis, a government which had been responsible for inflicting austerity on the country for 10 years, dramatically reversed some of its policies. However, predictably, this did not change the situation vis‐à‐vis food insecurity. The third paradox is that the frequent rhetoric invoking the two world wars has not resulted in lessons being learned – notably, the creation of a ministry to deal with food and rationing, as in the Second World War. The final paradox relates to Brexit and its likely deleterious effects on food security, particularly if no ‘deal’ is achieved with the European Union, as seems likely. The voluntary food aid sector, try as it may, cannot possibly assume responsibility for the long‐standing and now hugely increased problems of food insecurity. That belongs to the state.","CAPLAN, PAT",Anthropol Today,523,9

In this prospective study, we determined T and NK cell numbers together with NK activation status in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) in HSCT recipients and healthy controls using multiparametric flow cytometry. We also determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Samples were collected pre-HSCT, at day 0, +10, +20 and +30 after HSCT. Peripheral blood (PB) was also analyzed to determine T and NK cell numbers. A total of 27 pediatric HSCT recipients were enrolled and 16 of them had at least one viral detection (60%). Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen (84% of positive NPAs). NPAs of patients contained fewer T and NK cells compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0132 and p = 0.120, respectively). Viral PCR + patients showed higher NK cell number in their NPAs. The activating receptors repertoire expressed by NK cells was also higher in NPA samples, especially NKp44 and NKp46.

We report the production of specific IgM and IgG antibodies after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its implication for the diagnosis, pathology and the course of the disease as well as the recurrence of positive nucleic acid tests after discharge. Methods: Test results for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies of 221 confirmed COVID-19 patients were retrospectively examined, and their clinical data were collected and analyzed based on various subgroups. SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies were determined with the chemiluminescence method. Findings: The concentration (S/CO) of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, with a median of 17.38 (IQR 4.39-36.4) for IgM and 5.59 (IQR 0.73-13.65) for IgG. Detection rates reached highest on day 16-18 and day 19-21 for IgM and IgG, which were 73.6% and 98.6%, respectively, with significantly higher concentration of IgG in critically ill patients than in those with mild to moderate disease (P=0.027). The concentration of the antibodies on day 16-21 is not correlated with the course or outcome of the disease (Spearman r < 0.20, P > 0.05). Nasopharyngeal swabs revealed positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA in up to 52.7% of recovered patients after discharge, whose IgG proved to be significantly lower than that of those with negative RNA results (P = 0.009). IgG and IgM were tested twice within 14 days after discharge with a 7-day interval, and the second testing of these antibodies displayed a decrease in concentration of 21.2% (IQR, 11.2%34.48%) for IgG and 23.05% (IQR, -27.96%46.13%) for IgM, without statistical significance between the patients with re-detectable positive RNA results and those with negative RNA results after discharge. However, those with positive results experienced a count decrease in lymphocyte subsets. Interpretation: The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies peaked on day 19-21 after symptom onset, and antibody testing on day 16-21 is associated with increased detection rates, but the antibody concentration does not affect the course and outcome of the infection. Recovering patients with re-detectable positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA displayed lower concentration of IgG, but the downward trend of IgG during recovery indicated its limited duration of protection, and the protective effect of IgG remains to be investigated.","Hu, Q.; Cui, X.; Liu, X.; Peng, B.; Jiang, J.; Wang, X.; Li, Y.; Hu, W.; Ao, Z.; Duan, J.; Zhu, L.; Guo, S.; Wu, G.",,523,12

RNA recombination is required during normal CoV replication for subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis and generates defective viral genomes (DVGs) of unknown function. However, the determinants and patterns of CoV recombination are unknown. Here, we show that divergent β-CoVs SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) perform extensive RNA recombination in culture, generating similar patterns of recombination junctions and diverse populations of DVGs and sgmRNAs. We demonstrate that the CoV proofreading nonstructural protein (nsp14) 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) is required for normal CoV recombination and that its genetic inactivation causes significantly decreased frequency and altered patterns of recombination in both infected cells and released virions. Thus, nsp14-ExoN is a key determinant of both high fidelity CoV replication and recombination, and thereby represents a highly-conserved and vulnerable target for virus inhibition and attenuation.","Gribble, Jennifer; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Agostini, Maria L.; Anderson-Daniels, Jordan; Chappell, James D.; Lu, Xiaotao; Stevens, Laura J.; Routh, Andrew L.; Denison, Mark R.",bioRxiv,523,33

In a similar manner to an epidemic, it spreads between humans via digital and physical information systems. It makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. OBJECTIVE: A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation on responding to the infodemic related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was held, entirely online, to crowdsource suggested actions for a framework for infodemic management. METHODS: A group of policy makers, public health professionals, researchers, students, and other concerned stakeholders was joined by representatives of the media, social media platforms, various private sector organizations, and civil society to suggest and discuss actions for all parts of society, and multiple related professional and scientific disciplines, methods, and technologies. A total of 594 ideas for actions were crowdsourced online during the discussions and consolidated into suggestions for an infodemic management framework. RESULTS: The analysis team distilled the suggestions into a set of 50 proposed actions for a framework for managing infodemics in health emergencies. The consultation revealed six policy implications to consider. First, interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence, and must reach citizens and enable them to make informed decisions on how to protect themselves and their communities in a health emergency. Second, knowledge should be translated into actionable behavior-change messages, presented in ways that are understood by and accessible to all individuals in all parts of all societies. Third, governments should reach out to key communities to ensure their concerns and information needs are understood, tailoring advice and messages to address the audiences they represent. Fourth, to strengthen the analysis and amplification of information impact, strategic partnerships should be formed across all sectors, including but not limited to the social media and technology sectors, academia, and civil society. Fifth, health authorities should ensure that these actions are informed by reliable information that helps them understand the circulating narratives and changes in the flow of information, questions, and misinformation in communities. Sixth, following experiences to date in responding to the COVID-19 infodemic and the lessons from other disease outbreaks, infodemic management approaches should be further developed to support preparedness and response, and to inform risk mitigation, and be enhanced through data science and sociobehavioral and other research. CONCLUSIONS: The first version of this framework proposes five action areas in which WHO Member States and actors within society can apply, according to their mandate, an infodemic management approach adapted to national contexts and practices. Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the related infodemic require swift, regular, systematic, and coordinated action from multiple sectors of society and government. It remains crucial that we promote trusted information and fight misinformation, thereby helping save lives.","Tangcharoensathien, Viroj; Calleja, Neville; Nguyen, Tim; Purnat, Tina; D’Agostino, Marcelo; Garcia-Saiso, Sebastian; Landry, Mark; Rashidian, Arash; Hamilton, Clayton; AbdAllah, Abdelhalim; Ghiga, Ioana; Hill, Alexandra; Hougendobler, Daniel; van Andel, Judith; Nunn, Mark; Brooks, Ian; Sacco, Pier Luigi; De Domenico, Manlio; Mai, Philip; Gruzd, Anatoliy; Alaphilippe, Alexandre; Briand, Sylvie",J Med Internet Res,523,33

While there are numerous options for enrichment/isolation of cells from tissues, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) is accepted as a method that results in superior purification of a wide variety of cell types. Flow cytometry requires extensive fluidics and aerosol droplets can be generated during collection of target cells. Pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, and SARS-CoV-2 require manipulation at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3). Due to the concern of potential aerosolization of these pathogens, use of flow cytometric-based cell sorting in these laboratory settings requires placement of the equipment in dedicated biosafety cabinets within the BSL-3. For many researchers, this is often not possible due to expense, space, or expertise available. Here we describe the safety validation and utility of a completely closed cell sorter that results in gentle, rapid, high purity, and safe sorting of cells on the benchtop at BSL-3. We also provide data demonstrating the need for cell sorting versus bead purification and the applicability of this technology for BSL-3 and potentially BSL-4 related infectious disease projects. Adoption of this technology will significantly expand our ability to uncover important features of the most dangerous infectious diseases leading to faster development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.","Roberts, Lydia M; Anderson, Rebecca; Carmody, Aaron; Bosio, Catharine M",bioRxiv,523,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We represent RCT cohort enrollment as random binary classification fairness problems, and then show how ML fairness metrics based on enrollment fraction can be efficiently calculated using easily computed rates of subpopulations in RCT cohorts and target populations. We propose standardized versions of these metrics and deploy them in an interactive tool to analyze 3 RCTs with respect to type 2 diabetes and hypertension target populations in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. RESULTS: We demonstrate how the proposed metrics and associated statistics enable users to rapidly examine representativeness of all subpopulations in the RCT defined by a set of categorical traits (eg, gender, race, ethnicity, smoking status, and blood pressure) with respect to target populations. DISCUSSION: The normalized metrics provide an intuitive standardized scale for evaluating representation across subgroups, which may have vastly different enrollment fractions and rates in RCT study cohorts. The metrics are beneficial complements to other approaches (eg, enrollment fractions) used to identify generalizability and health equity of RCTs. CONCLUSION: By quantifying the gaps between RCT and target populations, the proposed methods can support generalizability evaluation of existing RCT cohorts. The interactive visualization tool can be readily applied to identified underrepresented subgroups with respect to any desired source or target populations.","Qi, Miao; Cahan, Owen; Foreman, Morgan A; Gruen, Daniel M; Das, Amar K; Bennett, Kristin P",JAMIA Open,523,16

Beyond morbidity and mortality, pandemics carry secondary impacts, such as children orphaned or bereft of their caregivers. Such children often face adverse consequences, including poverty, abuse, and institutionalisation. We provide estimates for the magnitude of this problem resulting from COVID-19 and describe the need for resource allocation. METHODS: We used mortality and fertility data to model minimum estimates and rates of COVID-19-associated deaths of primary or secondary caregivers for children younger than 18 years in 21 countries. We considered parents and custodial grandparents as primary caregivers, and co-residing grandparents or older kin (aged 60–84 years) as secondary caregivers. To avoid overcounting, we adjusted for possible clustering of deaths using an estimated secondary attack rate and age-specific infection–fatality ratios for SARS-CoV-2. We used these estimates to model global extrapolations for the number of children who have experienced COVID-19-associated deaths of primary and secondary caregivers. FINDINGS: Globally, from March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, we estimate 1 134 000 children (95% credible interval 884 000–1 185 000) experienced the death of primary caregivers, including at least one parent or custodial grandparent. 1 562 000 children (1 299 000–1 683 000) experienced the death of at least one primary or secondary caregiver. Countries in our study set with primary caregiver death rates of at least one per 1000 children included Peru (10·2 per 1000 children), South Africa (5·1), Mexico (3·5), Brazil (2·4), Colombia (2·3), Iran (1·7), the USA (1·5), Argentina (1·1), and Russia (1·0). Numbers of children orphaned exceeded numbers of deaths among those aged 15–50 years. Between two and five times more children had deceased fathers than deceased mothers. INTERPRETATION: Orphanhood and caregiver deaths are a hidden pandemic resulting from COVID-19-associated deaths. Accelerating equitable vaccine delivery is key to prevention. Psychosocial and economic support can help families to nurture children bereft of caregivers and help to ensure that institutionalisation is avoided. These data show the need for an additional pillar of our response: prevent, detect, respond, and care for children.

Significant numbers of health professionals are now required to provide end-of-life care with minimal training. Many health professionals report they lack confidence to provide this care, particularly those in acute hospital settings. This study explored the perceived benefits of online education on health professionals’ capacity to provide end-of-life care. METHODS: This qualitative study adopted a pragmatic approach. Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with allied health professionals, nurses and doctors who had completed a minimum of three End-of-Life Essentials online education modules. Interviews were held on line and face-to-face, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Demographic data were also collected. Three major themes and one minor theme were constructed from the data using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Themes were (1). Perceptions of preparedness to provide end-of-life care, (2). Shifts in approaching end-of-life discussions and (3). Motivation for engagement with online modules. Participants reported validation of knowledge and improved confidence to have end-of-life discussions with patients, carers and team members. They also noted improved ability to recognise the dying process and improved conversations with team members about patient and carer needs. Videos portraying a novice and then more able end-of-life discussions were particularly valued by participants. Modules provided practical guidance on how to engage in discussions about the end of life and care needs. Participants were self-motivated to improve their knowledge and skills to enhance end-of-life care provision. Continuing professional development requirements were also a motivator for module completion. CONCLUSIONS: This study explored health professionals’ perspectives about the perceived benefits of online education modules on their clinical practice. Module completion enhanced participant confidence and self-reported improved competence in end-of-life care provision. Findings build on existing research that supports the valuable role online education plays in supporting confidence and ability to actively engage with patients, carers and colleagues about provision of end-of-life care; however, self-report cannot be used as a proxy for improved clinical competence.","Morgan, Deidre D; Litster, Caroline; Winsall, Megan; Devery, Kim; Rawlings, Deb",BMC Palliat Care,523,5

Unfortunately, currently, there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19. As SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike proteins (S) to bind to a host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2(ACE2), and this interaction is proved to be responsible for entering a virus into host cells, it makes an ideal target for antiviral drug development. In this work, we design three very short peptides based on the ACE2 sequence/structure fragments, which may effectively bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein and may, in turn, disrupt the important virus-host protein–protein interactions, blocking early steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two of our peptides bind to virus protein with affinity in nanomolar range, and as very short peptides have great potential for drug development.","Odolczyk, Norbert; Marzec, Ewa; Winiewska-Szajewska, Maria; Poznański, Jarosław; Zielenkiewicz, Piotr",Molecules,523,22

People are now using digital technologies, including social media, more than ever before. The objectives of this study were to analyze the social media usage pattern of people during the COVID-19 imposed lockdown and to understand the effects of emotion on the same. We scraped messages posted on Twitter by users from India expressing their emotion or view on the pandemic during the first 40 days of the lockdown. We identified the users who posted frequently and analyzed their usage pattern and their overall emotion during the study period based on their tweets. It was observed that 222 users tweeted frequently during the study period. Out of them, 13.5% were found to be addicted to Twitter and posted 13.67 tweets daily on an average (SD: 4.89), while 3.2% were found to be highly addicted and posted 40.71 tweets daily on an average (SD: 9.90) during the study period. The overall emotion of 40.1% of the users was happiness throughout the study period. However, it was also observed that users who tweeted more frequently were typically angry, disgusted, or sad about the prevailing situation. We concluded that people with a negative sentiment are more susceptible to addictive use of social media.","Arora, Anshika; Chakraborty, Pinaki; Bhatia, M. P.

This pandemic has not only threatened human life but has also triggered economic downturns across the world. Researchers have made significant strides in discovering molecular insights into SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and developing vaccines, but there is still no successful cure for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. OBJECTIVE: The present study has proposed a drug-repositioning pipeline for the design and discovery of an effective fungal-derived bioactive metabolite as a drug candidate against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Fungal derivative ""Cordycepin"" was selected for this study to investigate the inhibitory properties against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (PDB ID: 6M71) of SARS-CoV-2. The pharmacological profile, intermolecular interactions, binding energy, and stability of the compound were determined utilizing cheminformatic approaches. Subsequently, molecular dynamic simulation was performed to better understand the binding mechanism of cordycepin to RdRp. RESULTS: The pharmacological data and retrieved molecular dynamics simulations trajectories suggest excellent drug-likeliness and greater structural stability of cordycepin, while the catalytic residues (Asp760, Asp761), as well as other active site residues (Trp617, Asp618, Tyr619, Trp800, Glu811) of RdRp, showed better stability during the overall simulation span. CONCLUSION: Promising results of pharmacological investigation along with molecular simulations revealed that cordycepin exhibited strong inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 polymerase enzyme (RdRp). Hence, cordycepin should be highly recommended to test in a laboratory to confirm its inhibitory potential against the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase enzyme (RdRp).","Bibi, Shabana; Hasan, Mohammad Mehedi; Wang, Yuan-Bing; Papadakos, Stavros P; Yu, Hong",Curr. med. chem,523,21

A consensus report by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD),20.327358,8.280136,2021-09-30,"Epidemiological studies have revealed the emergence of multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC), including the lineage B.1.1.7 that is rapidly replacing old variants. The B.1.1.7 variant has been linked to increased morbidity rates, transmissibility, and potentially mortality. To assess viral fitness in vivo and to address whether the B.1.1.7 variant is capable of immune escape, we conducted infection and reinfection studies in naive and convalescent Syrian hamsters (>10 months old). Nasal wash samples from hamsters infected by a B.1.1.7 variant exhibited slightly higher viral RNA levels but lower infectious titers than those from B.1 (G614) variant-infected hamsters, and the two variants induced comparable lung pathologies in hamsters. Despite a sporadic and transient low-level infection in the nasal cavity, convalescent hamsters that had recovered from a previous USA-WA1 isolate (D614) infection displayed no observable clinical signs or lung pathology following B.1.1.7 rechallenge. Altogether, our study did not find that the B.1.1.7 variant significantly differs from the B.1 variant in pathogenicity in Syrian hamsters and that a heterologous natural infection-induced immunity confers protection against a secondary challenge by the B1.1.7 variant. IMPORTANCE The rapid emergence of several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 calls for evaluations of viral fitness and pathogenicity in animal models in order to understand the mechanism of enhanced transmission and the possible increases in morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we demonstrated that immunity naturally acquired through a prior infection with the first-wave variant does confer nearly complete protection against the B.1.1.7 variant in Syrian hamsters upon reexposure. Strikingly, although the B.1.1.7 variant appears to replicate to a higher level in the nose than the ancestral B.1 variant, it does not induce more severe lung pathology in hamsters.","Nuñez, Ivette A.; Lien, Christopher Z.; Selvaraj, Prabhuanand; Stauft, Charles B.; Liu, Shufeng; Starost, Matthew F.; Wang, Tony T.",mSphere,523,3

The increased frequency in the use of the Internet via computer or mobile devices provides an opportunity for social media to be the medium through which people can be provided with valuable health information quickly and directly. While traditional methods of detection relied predominately on hierarchical or bureaucratic lines of communication, these often failed to yield timely and accurate epidemiological intelligence. New web-based platforms promise increased opportunities for a more timely and accurate spreading of information and analysis. This article aims to provide an overview and discussion of the availability of timely and accurate information. It is especially useful for the rapid identification of an outbreak of an infectious disease that is necessary to promptly and effectively develop public health responses. These web-based platforms include search queries, data mining of web and social media, process and analysis of blogs containing epidemic key words, text mining, and geographical information system data analyses. These new sources of analysis and information are intended to complement traditional sources of epidemic intelligence. Despite the attractiveness of these new approaches, further study is needed to determine the accuracy of blogger statements, as increases in public participation may not necessarily mean the information provided is more accurate.","Yang, Y.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the survival of patients admitted to Brazilian hospitals due to the COVID-19 and estimate prognostic factors. This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study, based on data from 46285 hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Brazil. Survival functions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Log-rank test compared the survival functions for each variable and from that, hazard ratios were calculated and the proportional hazards model was used in Cox multiple regression. The smallest survival curves were the ones for patients at the age of 68 years or more, black / brown race, illiterate, living in the countryside, dyspnea, respiratory distress, influenza-like outbreak, O2 saturation <95%, X-ray change, length of stay in the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, previous heart disease, pneumopathy, diabetes, down's syndrome, neurological disease and kidney disease. Better survival was observed in the symptoms and in an asthmatic patient. The multiple model for increased risk of death when they were admitted to the ICU HR 1.28 (95% CI 1.21;1.35), diabetes HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.11;1.24), neurological disease HR 1.34 (95% CI 1.22;1.46), kidney disease HR 1.11 (95% CI 1.02;1.21), heart disease HR 1.14 (95% CI 1.08;1.20), black or brown race of HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.43;1.58), asthma HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61;0.81) and pneumopathy HR 1.12 (95% CI 1.02;1.23). The overall survival time was low in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and this reinforces the importance of sociodemographic and clinical factors as a prognosis for death. The lack of a protocol for scientific clinical management puts a greater risk of death for about 80 million Brazilians, who are chronically ill or living in poverty. COVID-19 can promote selective mortality that borders the eugenics of specific social segments in Brazil.","Santos, M.; Lucena, E. E.; Lima, K. C.; Brito, A. A.; Bay, M. B.; Bonfada, D.",,523,11

Cannot-intubate-cannot-ventilate scenarios are the most critical emergency in airway management, and belong to the worst imaginable scenarios in an anaesthetist’s life. In such situations, apnoeic oxygenation might be useful to avoid hypoxaemia. Anaesthesia guidelines recommend careful preoxygenation and application of high flow oxygen in difficult intubation scenarios to prevent episodes of deoxygenation. In this study, we evaluated the decrease in oxygen concentration in a model when using different strategies of oxygenation: using a special oxygenation laryngoscope, nasal oxygen, nasal high flow oxygen, and control. METHODS: In this experimental study we compared no oxygen application as a control, standard pure oxygen application of 10 l·min(− 1) via nasal cannula, high flow 90% oxygen application at 20 l·min(− 1) using a special nasal high flow device, and pure oxygen application via our oxygenation laryngoscope at 10 l·min(− 1). We preoxygenated a simulation lung to 97% oxygen concentration and connected this to the trachea of a manikin model simulating apnoeic oxygenation. Decrease in oxygen concentration in the simulation lung was measured continuously for 20 min. RESULTS: Oxygen concentration in the simulation lung dropped from 97 ± 1% at baseline to 40 ± 1% in the no oxygen group, to 80 ± 1% in the standard nasal oxygen group, and to 73 ± 2% in the high flow nasal oxygenation group. However, it remained at 96 ± 0% in the oxygenation laryngoscope group (p < 0.001 between all groups). CONCLUSIONS: In this technical simulation, oxygenation via oxygenation laryngoscope was more effective than standard oxygen insufflation via nasal cannula, which was more effective than nasal high flow insufflation of 90% oxygen.","Herff, H.; Wetsch, W.

OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic with those of influenza patients in previous influenza seasons at the same hospital DESIGN: Admission rates, clinical measurements, and clinical outcomes from confirmed COVID-19 cases between March 1 and April 30, 2020, were compared with those from confirmed influenza cases in the previous five influenza seasons (8 months each) beginning September 1, 2014. SETTING: Large tertiary care teaching hospital in Boston, MA PARTICIPANTS: Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and influenza inpatients MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographics and medical history, mortality, incidence and duration of mechanical ventilation, incidences of vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy, and hospital and intensive care admissions. RESULTS: Data was abstracted from medical records of 1052 influenza patients and 582 COVID-19 patients. An average of 210 hospital admissions for influenza occurred per 8-month season compared to 582 COVID-19 admissions over 2 months. The median weekly number of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 17 (IQR: 4, 34) compared to a weekly median of 1 (IQR: 0, 2) influenza patient (p=0.001). COVID-19 patients were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation (31% vs 8%) and had significantly higher mortality (20% vs. 3%; p<0.001 for all). Relatively more COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation lacked pre-existing conditions compared with mechanically ventilated influenza patients (25% vs 4%, p<0.001). Pneumonia/ARDS secondary to the virus was the predominant cause of mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients (94%) as opposed to influenza (56%). LIMITATION: This is a single-center study which could limit generalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 resulted in more weekly hospitalizations, higher morbidity, and higher mortality than influenza at the same hospital.

The global COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to characterize and compare health behaviors across multiple countries and to examine how these behaviors are shaped by the pandemic experience. Undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in universities in China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands and the United States (USA) were recruited into this cross-sectional study. Eligible students filled out an online survey comprised of validated tools for assessing sleep quality and duration, dietary risk, alcohol misuse and physical activity between late April and the end of May 2020. Health behaviors were fairly consistent across countries, and all countries reported poor sleep quality. However, during the survey period, the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the health behaviors of students in European countries and the USA more negatively than Asian countries, which could be attributed to the differences in pandemic time course and caseloads. Students who experienced a decline in sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher dietary risk scores than students who did not experience a change in sleep quality (p = 0.001). Improved sleep quality was associated with less sitting time (p = 0.010). Addressing sleep issues among higher education students is a pressing concern, especially during stressful events. These results support the importance of making education and behavior-based sleep programming available for higher education students in order to benefit students’ overall health.","Du, Chen; Zan, Megan Chong Hueh; Cho, Min Jung; Fenton, Jenifer I.; Hsiao, Pao Ying; Hsiao, Richard; Keaver, Laura; Lai, Chang-Chi; Lee, HeeSoon; Ludy, Mary-Jon; Shen, Wan; Swee, Winnie Chee Siew; Thrivikraman, Jyothi; Tseng, Kuo-Wei; Tseng, Wei-Chin; Almotwa, Juman; Feldpausch, Clare E.; Folk, Sara Yi Ling; Gadd, Suzannah; Wang, Linyutong; Wang, Wenyan; Zhang, Xinyi; Tucker, Robin M.",Clocks Sleep,523,29
