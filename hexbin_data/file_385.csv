3019,3019,3019,Global trends in research related to social media in psychology: mapping and bibliometric analysis,20.771357,3.066962,2018-01-19,"BACKGROUND: Social media, defined as interactive Web applications, have been on the rise globally, particularly among adults. The objective of this study was to investigate the trend of the literature related to the most used social network worldwide (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, and Instagram) in the field of psychology. Specifically, this study will assess the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, author productivity, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology. METHODS: Publications related to social media in the field of psychology published between 2004 and 2014 were obtained from the Web of Science. The records extracted were analysed for bibliometric characteristics such as the growth in publications, citation analysis, international collaboration, emerging topics and the mapping of frequent terms in publications pertaining to social media in the field of psychology. VOSviewer v.1.6.5 was used to construct scientific maps. RESULTS: Overall, 959 publications were retrieved during the period between 2004 and 2015. The number of research publications in social media in the field of psychology showed a steady upward growth. Publications from the USA accounted for 57.14% of the total publications and the highest h-index (48).The most common document type was research articles (873; 91.03%). Over 99.06% of the publications were published in English. Computers in Human Behavior was the most prolific journal. The University of Wisconsin–Madison ranked first in terms of the total publications (n = 39). A visualisation analysis showed that personality psychology, experimental psychology, psychological risk factors, and developmental psychology were continual concerns of the research. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting the global trends in the research related to social media in the psychology field. Based on the raw data from the Web of Science, publication characteristics such as quality and quantity were assessed using bibliometric techniques over 12 years. The USA and its institutions play a dominant role in this topic. The most preferred topics related to social media in psychology are personality psychology, experimental psychology, psychological risk factors, and developmental psychology.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.; Sweileh, Waleed M.; Awang, Rahmat; Al-Jabi, Samah W.",Int J Ment Health Syst,385,5
3186,3186,3186,Mental health of nurses after the Fukushima complex disaster: a narrative review,20.782137,3.1181011,2018-04-13,"Work-related mental health impairment is recognized as a real problem in the context of helping responders, including health professionals, due to adverse health outcomes after a severe disaster. The Great East-Japan Earthquake, which occurred on 11 March 2011, was an unprecedented complex disaster that caused a nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). In addition to disaster stress and daily work, medical and health-care professionals, particularly nurses, provided counseling services to residents concerned about radiation health risks or mental health issues. This review focuses on the psychological aspects of the complex nuclear disaster, which was a combined artificial nuclear accident and natural disaster, and we investigated the psychological effects on hospital nurses associated with their experiences during the disaster. We looked at several investigations into the mental health of nurses after a nuclear disaster and in other situations. It was shown that mental health of nurses is impacted, not only after nuclear disasters but also in other circumstances. Furthermore, we noted the effects of extended periods of a heavy workload and daily life. Regarding anxiety about radiation exposure, nurses who had more knowledge of radiation tended to have better mental health, suggesting that education about the health risks of radiation exposure is important for health-care professionals. In summary, it is essential that nurses are provided with education about radiation exposure and its associated health risks, and also that there is a comprehensive approach to mental health care for nurses during the chronic phase of a disaster.","Nukui, Hiroshi; Midorikawa, Sanae; Murakami, Michio; Maeda, Masaharu; Ohtsuru, Akira",J Radiat Res,385,5

The present study addresses the question as to whether type 2 diabetes with an HCMV-positive pancreas differs from those with HCMV-negative pancreases with respect to age, sex, treatment, duration of disease, volume densities of B-cells and D-cells, mRNA levels of insulin and somatostatin, islet amyloid peptide deposits and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II gene transcription, and protein expression. HCMV-positive type 2 diabetic patients showed a tendency towards a shorter duration of disease and significantly increased levels of MHC class II on RNA. In addition, expression of MHC class II product (HLA-DR) was identified in duct epithelial cells and/or islet cells in 9 diabetic pancreases and in 2 non-diabetic glands. No MHC class I expression could be detected. No other clinical differences between HCMV-positive and HCMV-negative glands were found. All 10 HCMV-positive diabetics showed a strong expression of MHC class II mRN in the pancreas. By immunocytochemistry, 4 of 10 demonstrated expression on the islets; three of ten also expressed MHC DRβ on ductal cells. This finding might be related to the viral infection, as only 2 of the 9 HCMV-negative patients were HLA-DRβ positive and none of the non-diabetic controls showed increased levels of MHC class II mRNA. These data suggest that HCMV infection in the pancreas is associated with type 2 diabetes. However, no conclusions as to a role of this virus in the aetiopathology of type 2 diabetes can be drawn at present.","Löhr, M.; Bergstrome, B.; Maekawa, R.; Oldstone, M. B.

In this study, we investigated the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the prevalence of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among patients with HIV-1 infection in Henan Province, China. HIV-1 strains in blood samples taken from inpatients and outpatients visiting the Sixth People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou from August 2017 to July 2019 with a viral load (VL) greater than 1000 copies/ml were subjected to subtype and DRMs analysis. Out of a total of 769 samples, subtype and DRM data were obtained from 657 (85.43%) samples. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial pol gene sequences indicated that the most commonly found genotype was subtype B (45.51%, 299/657), followed by CRF01_AE (28.61%, 188/657), CRF07_BC (15.68%, 103/657), CRF08_BC (0.76%, 5/657), C (0.61%, 4/657), A (0.30%, 2/657), and others (8.52%, 56/657). Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) were most commonly found in patients who were naïve to antiretroviral treatment (ART) (68.67%, 160/233). The percentage of patients with one or more major drug-resistance mutations was 50.99% (335/657), and it was 6.44% (15/233) in ART-naive patients that were primarily infected with subtype B (17.74%). Resistance mutations were most common at codons 65, 103, 106, 184, and 190 of the reverse transcriptase gene and codon 46 of the protease gene. Our study provides detailed information about the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes and the incidence of drug resistance mutations of different subtypes in ART-experienced and naïve patients. This can guide policymakers in making decisions about treatment strategies against HIV-1.","Yang, Zhaojie; Wei, Shuguang; Liu, Jinjin; Piao, Junyan; Xu, Lixia; Sun, Yan; Deng, Xin; Yang, Xuan; Liu, Chunli; Ma, Shuhuan; Zhao, Qingxia; Huo, Yuqi",Arch Virol,385,5

Persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) has an incidence of up to 30–50% and has negative outcome of quality of life and negative burden on individuals, family, and society. The 2016 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines states that enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) forms an integral part of Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) and is now recommended to use a multimodal opioid-sparing approach for management of postoperative pain. As such, dexmedetomidine is now being used as part of ERAS protocols along with regional nerve blocks and other medications, to create a satisfactory postoperative outcome with reduced opioid consumption in the Post anesthesia care unit (PACU). RECENT FINDINGS: Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha(2) agonist, possesses analgesic effects and has a different mechanism of action when compared with opioids. When dexmedetomidine is initiated at the end of a procedure, it has a better hemodynamic stability and pain response than ropivacaine. Dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjuvant in epidurals with local anesthetic sparing effects. Its use during nerve blocks results in reduced postoperative pain. Also, local infiltration of IV dexmedetomidine is associated with earlier discharge from PACU. SUMMARY: Perioperative use of dexmedetomidine has significantly improved postoperative outcomes when used as part of ERAS protocols. An in-depth review of the use of dexmedetomidine in ERAS protocols is presented for clinical anesthesiologists.","Kaye, Alan David; Chernobylsky, David J.; Thakur, Pankaj; Siddaiah, Harish; Kaye, Rachel J.; Eng, Lauren K.; Harbell, Monica W.; Lajaunie, Jared; Cornett, Elyse M.",Curr Pain Headache Rep,385,5

We carried out screening investigations of the extracts of 85 Rosaceous tea plants. Among the extracts analyzed Agrimonia asiatica herb extract demonstrated the highest inhibitory activity against the enzyme α-glucosidase (20.29 µg/mL). As a result of chromato-mass-spectrometric profiling of A. asiatica herb with high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array and electrospray triple quadrupole mass-spectrometric detection (HPLC-PDA-ESI-tQ-MS) 60 compounds were identified, including catechins, ellagitannins, flavones, flavonols, gallotannins, hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, most for the very first time. The analysis of the seasonal variation of metabolites in A. asiatica herb demonstrated that the phenolic content was highest in summer samples and lower in spring and autumn. HPLC activity-based profiling was utilized to identify compounds of A. asiatica herb with the maximal α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The most pronounced inhibition of α-glucosidase was observed for agrimoniin, while less significant results of inhibition were revealed for ellagic acid and isoquercitrin. The evaluation of phenolic content in A. asiatica herbal teas with the subsequent determination of α-glucosidase inhibiting potential was discovered. Maximum inhibition of α-glucosidase was observed for hot infusion (75.33 µg/mL) and the minimum for 30 min decoction (159.14 µg/mL). Our study demonstrated that A. asiatica herbal tea is a prospective functional beverage in which dietary intake may help to reduce blood glucose.","I.

HYPOTHESES: Intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) would (a) decrease endogneous AA concentrations, (b) induce CIRCI and (c) administration of a combination of AA and hydrocortisone (HC) would have decreased indices of inflammation compared to either drug alone. ANIMALS: Thirty‐two healthy horses. METHODS: Randomized placebo‐controlled experimental trial. Horses were assigned to 1 of 4 groups (saline, AA and HC, AA only, or HC only). Treatments were administered 1 hour after completion of LPS infusion. Clinical signs, clinicopathological variables, pro‐inflammatory cytokine gene expression and production, and plasma AA concentrations were assessed at various time points. Serum cortisol concentrations and ACTH stimulation tests were used to detect CIRCI. RESULTS: There was no effect of drug on clinical signs or pro‐inflammatory cytokine gene expression or production compared to controls at any time point. Administration of AA was associated with higher blood neutrophil counts 6 hours after LPS infusion (11.01 ± 1.02 K/μl) compared to other groups (8.99 ± 0.94 K/μL; P < .009). Adminstration of HC was associated with higher blood neutrophil counts 12 hours after LPS infusion (10.40 ± 0.75 K/μl) compared to other groups (6.88 ± 0.68 K/μl; P < .001). Serum cortisol increased from 5.11 ± 1.48 μg/dL before LPS administration to 9.59 ± 1.83 μg/dL 1 h after completion of LPS infusion (T1) without an effect of treatment (P = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Ascorbic acid and HC appeared to protect against LPS‐induced neutrophil depletion and could be considered as adjunctive therapy in horses with endotoxemia.","Anderson, Melinda J.; Ibrahim, Alina S.; Cooper, Bruce R.; Woolcock, Andrew D.; Moore, George E.; Taylor, Sandra D.",J Vet Intern Med,385,5

TAVI improves symptoms, induces reverse left ventricular (LV) remodelling and increases overall survival. However, a careful patient selection is essential to achieve better outcome. Evidence on LV functional recovery and LV mass regression after TAVI based on contemporary registry data is scarce. The impact of TAVI on the arterial vasculature is also less explored. METHOD AND ANALYSES: This is a study of 600 consecutive patients with AS who underwent a TAVI at Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. Demographics, clinical data, arterial haemodynamics and echocardiographic parameters were prospectively collected. In the present paper, we describe the design, major scientific objectives and echocardiography imaging protocol of the TAVI-NOR (TAVI in western NORway) study. The main objectives are: To explore the impact of TAVI on cardiac structure and function in patients with severe AS, identify the echocardiographic predictors of reverse LV remodelling, assess survival benefits according to baseline risk profile, evaluate long-term therapeutic success as reflected by reduction in valvular-arterial impedance and to investigate the impact of various types of blood pressure response immediately after TAVI on clinical outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK vest, ref. number 33814) and the Institutional Data Protection Services. Patients’ consent was waived. The study findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentation in national and international scientific meetings and conferences.

However, few family physicians conduct research, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Early-career and trainee family physicians are a key part of the primary care research pipeline and have an expressed need for research training and mentorship. OBJECTIVE: AfriWon Research Collaborative (ARC) was an online research training and mentorship pilot program whose objective was to increase research activity among participants from AfriWon Renaissance, the family physician young doctors’ movement of sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: ARC utilized a 10-module online curriculum, supported by peer and faculty e-mentorship, to guide participants through writing a research protocol. The feasibility, acceptability, and scalability of this program was evaluated via a mixed-methods RE-AIM-guided process evaluation using descriptive statistics and inductive/deductive thematic analysis. FINDINGS: The pilot reached participants from Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and was adopted by mentors from 11 countries across three continents. Four of the 10 pilot participants completed a full research protocol by the end of the six-month core program. Seven out of the 10 participants, and nine out of the 15 mentors, planned to continue their mentorship relationships beyond the core program. The program helped instill a positive research culture in active participants. Some participants’ and mentors’ engagement with the ARC program was limited by confusion over mentorship structure and role, poor network connectivity, and personal life challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Online research training and mentorship for trainee and early-career family physicians in sub-Saharan Africa is feasible and acceptable to participants and mentors. Similar programs must pay careful attention to mentorship training and provide a flexible yet clearly organized structure for mentee-mentor engagement. Additional work is needed to determine optimal implementation strategies and ability to scale.","McGuire, Chelsea M.; Fatusin, Bolatito B.; Kodicherla, Hithaishini; Yakubu, Kenneth; Ameh, Pius; van Waes, Alexandra; Rhoad, Ethan; Jack, Brian W.; Scott, Nancy A.",,385,5

In elderly persons who are cognitively normal, synaptic hypometabolism as shown by reduced cerebral uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F‐FDG), provides a premonitory signal of potential, future loss of cognition if those individuals also have present evidence of amyloid deposition seen in the Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB‐PET) scan for amyloid. Those are the persons who should be targeted if one aims to prevent AD. The synaptic hypometabolism implies that the brain's availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is inadequate for performance of all required synaptic functions. This review first describes the basis for asserting that reduced cerebral uptake of (18)F‐FDG accurately reflects synaptic hypometabolism; second, explains the basis for asserting that hypometabolism implies inadequate ATP; third, shows that amyloid beta (Aβ) itself, Aβ modified by pyroglutamate to become a molecule termed pE(3)Aβ, and cyclophilin‐D, in concert are the main contributors to inadequate synaptic ATP and that, therefore, reducing all of their levels would neutralize their combined effect and correct the hypometabolism. pE(3)Aβ is more neurotoxic than unmodified Aβ; and cyclophilin D inhibits ATP synthase and reduces ATP formation. Finally, this review describes an mRNA self‐replicating vaccine that will raise brain levels of ATP by reducing Aβ, pyroglutamate‐modified Aβ, and cyclophilin‐D, and thereby—in cognitively normal elderly persons who have synaptic hypometabolism—prevent initiation of the process that terminates in AD.","Fessel, Jeffrey",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),385,5

As a secreted protein, the potential interaction between Cst-3 and extracellular matrix components has not been well studied. Here we investigated the interaction between Cst-3 and heparan sulfate (HS), a major component of extracellular matrix. We discovered that Cst-3 is a HS-binding protein only at acidic pH. By NMR and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two HS binding regions in Cst-3: the highly dynamic N-terminal segment and a flexible region located between residue 70-94. The composition of the HS-binding site by two highly dynamic halves is unique in known HS-binding proteins. We further discovered that HS-binding severely impairs the inhibitory activity of Cst-3 towards papain, suggesting the interaction could actively regulate Cst-3 activity. Using murine bone tissues, we showed that Cst-3 interacts with bone matrix HS at low pH, again highlighting the physiological relevance of our discovery.","Zhang, Xiaoxiao; Liu, Xinyue; Su, Guowei; Li, Miaomiao; Liu, Jian; Wang, Chunyu; Xu, Ding",Commun Biol,385,5

Gymnasts seem to be at greater risk of developing body dissatisfaction, eating disorders and osteoporosis due to inadequate nutrition and attention to the appearance of the body. The objective of this work was to investigate the association between the artistic gymnast and a more favorable body image compared to their sedentary peers and if a preworkout high-carbohydrate meal (HCM; 300 kcal, 88% carbohydrates, 9% protein, 3% fat) or high-protein meal (HPM; 300 kcal, 55% carbohydrates, 31% protein, 13% fat) is able to attenuate bone resorption in young rhythmic gymnasts. Twenty-eight preadolescent female gymnasts were examined. Self-esteem tests were used to analyze body image perception. Preworkout eating habits were examined by short food frequency questions (FFQ) validated for children. The biomarker of the bone resorption C-terminal telopeptide region of collagen type 1 (CTX) was measured in the urine (fasting, postmeal and postworkout). Gymnasts reported higher satisfaction with their body appearance compared to sedentary peers. Of the gymnasts, 30% did not have a preworkout meal regularly, and the timing of the consumption was variable. Bone resorption was decreased by the HCM, consumed 90 min before the training, with respect to the HPM. The study suggests that playing artistic gymnastics is associated with a positive body self-perception in a child. The variability in preworkout meal frequency and timing need attention to prevent inadequate eating habits in light of the ability of the HCM to reduce acute bone resorption.","Amato, Alessandra; Proia, Patrizia; Caldara, Gaetano Felice; Alongi, Angelina; Ferrantelli, Vincenzo; Baldassano, Sara",Int J Environ Res Public Health,385,5

The current study demonstrated the synthesis of 2-aminothiazole [S3(a-d) and S5(a-d)] and 2-aminopyridine [S4(a-d) and S6(a-d)] derivatives that can target multiple cellular networks implicated in cancer development. METHODS: Biological assays were performed to investigate the antioxidant and anticancer potential of synthesized compounds. Redox imbalance and oxidative stress are hallmarks of cancer, therefore, synthesized compounds were preliminarily screened for their antioxidant activity using DPPH assay, and further five derivatives S3b, S3c, S4c, S5b, and S6c, with significant antioxidant potential, were selected for investigation of in vitro anticancer potential. The cytotoxic activities were evaluated against the parent (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant (A2780CISR) ovarian cancer cell lines. Further, Molecular docking studies of active compounds were performed to determine binding affinities. RESULTS: Results revealed that S3c, S5b, and S6c displayed promising inhibition in cisplatin-resistant cell lines in comparison to parent cells in terms of both resistance factor (RF) and IC(50) values. Moreover, S3c proved to be most active compound in both parent and resistant cell lines with IC(50) values 15.57 µM and 11.52 µM respectively. Our docking studies demonstrated that compounds S3c, S5b, and S6c exhibited significant binding affinity with multiple protein targets of the signaling cascade. CONCLUSION: Anticancer activities of compounds S3c, S5b, and S6c in cisplatin-resistant cell lines suggested that these ligands may contribute as lead compounds for the development of new anticancer drugs.","Naz, Shagufta; Shah, Fawad Ali; Nadeem, Humaira; Sarwar, Sadia; Tan, Zhen; Imran, Muhammad; Ali, Tahir; Li, Jing Bo; Li, Shupeng",Drug Des Devel Ther,385,5

Better understanding of burden and etiology of diarrheal diseases is important for development of effective prevention measures. METHODS: Population-based diarrhea surveillance was conducted in Sanjiang (southern China) year-round and Zhengding (northern China) in autumn/winter. Stool specimens were collected from children < 5 years of age experiencing diarrhea. The TaqMan Array Card (TAC), based on multiplex real-time PCR, was applied to detect multiple enteric microbial agents simultaneously. Results using these methods were compared to those derived from conventional PCR assays. RESULTS: During the study period, 6,380 children in Zhengding and 3,581 children in Sanjiang < 5 years of age participated. Three hundred and forty (31.2%) and 279 (22.9%) diarrhea episodes were identified as moderate-to-severe in the two counties, with incidence of 60.4 and 88.3 cases per 1,000 child-years in Zhengding and Sanjiang, respectively. The five most frequently detected bacterial and viral agents in Sanjiang were adenovirus, enterovirus, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), rotavirus, and sapovirus all the year round, while the most common viral agents in Zhengding were rotavirus, followed by astrovirus and adenovirus during the cool season. Compared to conventional PCR assay, the average incremental detection via the TAC method was twofold. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated high diversity and prevalence of multiple major bacterial and viral agents, including rotavirus and calicivirus, among children in China. Further studies are needed to define the public health significance of neglected but frequently detected pathogens such as EAEC, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Campylobacter, adenovirus, and enterovirus.

In this analysis, we apply the Wilson-Jungner framework to appraise the potential utility of a prenatal ZIKV screening programme, outline potential screening strategies within the case-finding pathway, and consider other epidemiological factors that may influence the planning of such a screening programme. Our evaluation of a potential prenatal ZIKV screening programme highlights factors affirming its usefulness, including the importance of Congenital Zika Syndrome as a public health problem and the existence of analogous congenital prenatal screening programmes for STORCH agents (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, others (eg, human immunodeficiency virus, varicella-zoster virus, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus). However, our assessment also reveals key barriers to implementation, such as the need for more accurate diagnostic tests, effective antiviral treatments, increased social service capacity, and surveillance. Given that the reemergence of ZIKV is likely, we provide a guiding framework for policymakers and public health leaders that can be further elaborated and adapted to different contexts in order to reduce the burden of adverse ZIKV-related birth outcomes during future outbreaks.","Qiao, Luxi; Martelli, Celina M Turchi; Raja, Amber I; Sanchez Clemente, Nuria; de Araùjo, Thalia Velho Barreto; Ximenes, Ricardo Arraes de Alencar; Miranda-Filho, Demócrito de Barros; Ramond, Anna; Brickley, Elizabeth B",BMJ Glob Health,385,5

Aim of the present study was to investigate the overall immune response elicited by two different booster doses in CD-1 mice, by exploiting the largely used 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar 13® (PCV13). Immunization was performed by two primary doses of PCV13 two weeks apart, and a full or fractional (1/5) booster dose on week 10. Serotype-specific antibody titer, avidity, and opsonophagocytic activity were evaluated one week later, and compared to cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses determined as the frequency of cytokines producing splenocytes by in vitro recall with the antigens (carrier protein and polysaccharides). Data showed that regardless of the booster dose, a comparable humoral response was produced, characterized by similar amounts of serotype-specific antibodies, with analog avidity and opsonophagocytic properties. On the other hand, when CMI was evaluated, the presence of CRM197-specific IL-5 and IL-2 producing cells was evident in splenocytes from mice immunized with the full dose, while in those immunized with the fractional booster dose, IFN-γ producing cells responsive to both protein and polysaccharide antigens were significantly increased, whereas the number of IL-5 and IL-2 positive cells remained unaffected. Overall the present findings show that PCV13 humoral response in mice is associated to a Th2 predominant response at the full booster dose, while the fractional one favors a mixed Th1/Th2 response, suggesting an important role of CMI besides measurement of functional protective antibodies, as an additional and important key information in vaccine development.","Catalioto, Rose-Marie; Valenti, Claudio; Bellucci, Francesca; Cialdai, Cecilia; Altamura, Maria; Digilio, Laura; Pellacani, Andrea Ugo Enrico; Meini, Stefania",Heliyon,385,5

The aim was a proof of principle for a method to discover proteins and/or peptides of plasma that show greater observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in AD. The endogenous tryptic peptides of Alzheimer’s were compared to normals, multiple sclerosis, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, female normal, sepsis, ICU Control, heart attack, along with their institution-matched controls, and normal samples collected directly onto ice. METHODS: Endogenous tryptic peptides were extracted from blinded, individual AD and control EDTA plasma samples in a step gradient of acetonitrile for random and independent sampling by LC–ESI–MS/MS with a set of robust and sensitive linear quadrupole ion traps. The MS/MS spectra were fit to fully tryptic peptides within proteins identified using the X!TANDEM algorithm. Observation frequency of the identified proteins was counted using SEQUEST algorithm. The proteins with apparently increased observation frequency in AD versus AD Control were revealed graphically and subsequently tested by Chi Square analysis. The proteins specific to AD plasma by Chi Square with FDR correction were analyzed by the STRING algorithm. The average protein or peptide log(10) precursor intensity was compared across disease and control treatments by ANOVA in the R statistical system. RESULTS: Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as complement C2, C7, and C1QBP among others showed increased observation frequency by Chi Square and/or precursor intensity in AD. Cellular gene symbols with large Chi Square values (χ2 ≥ 25, p ≤ 0.001) from tryptic peptides included KIF12, DISC1, OR8B12, ZC3H12A, TNF, TBC1D8B, GALNT3, EME2, CD1B, BAG1, CPSF2, MMP15, DNAJC2, PHACTR4, OR8B3, GCK, EXOSC7, HMGA1 and NT5C3A among others. Similarly, increased frequency of tryptic phosphopeptides were observed from MOK, SMIM19, NXNL1, SLC24A2, Nbla10317, AHRR, C10orf90, MAEA, SRSF8, TBATA, TNIK, UBE2G1, PDE4C, PCGF2, KIR3DP1, TJP2, CPNE8, and NGF amongst others. STRING analysis showed an increase in cytoplasmic proteins and proteins associated with alternate splicing, exocytosis of luminal proteins, and proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, mitochondrial functions or metabolism and apoptosis. Increases in mean precursor intensity of peptides from common plasma proteins such as DISC1, EXOSC5, UBE2G1, SMIM19, NXNL1, PANO, EIF4G1, KIR3DP1, MED25, MGRN1, OR8B3, MGC24039, POLR1A, SYTL4, RNF111, IREB2, ANKMY2, SGKL, SLC25A5, CHMP3 among others were associated with AD. Tryptic peptides from the highly conserved C-terminus of DISC1 within the sequence MPGGGPQGAPAAAGGGGVSHRAGSRDCLPPAACFR and ARQCGLDSR showed a higher frequency and highest intensity in AD compared to all other disease and controls. CONCLUSION: Proteins apparently expressed in the brain that were directly related to Alzheimer’s including Nerve Growth Factor (NFG), Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase, Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), the cell death regulator retinitis pigmentosa (NXNl1) that governs the loss of nerve cells in the retina and the cell death regulator ZC3H12A showed much higher observation frequency in AD plasma vs the matched control. There was a striking agreement between the proteins known to be mutated or dis-regulated in the brains of AD patients with the proteins observed in the plasma of AD patients from endogenous peptides including NBN, BAG1, NOX1, PDCD5, SGK3, UBE2G1, SMPD3 neuronal proteins associated with synapse function such as KSYTL4, VTI1B and brain specific proteins such as TBATA.

The objective of our study was to determine the effects of a 6-month swimming, land-based stretching, strengthening and breathing exercise intervention in AS patients. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 29 (14 females, 15 males) patients diagnosed with AS according to the Modified New York Criteria participated in our study. Participants were randomly assigned to an exercise group (ASE) (16 participants) and a control group (ASC) (13 participants). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (CRP); anthropometric measurements; pulmonary function; aerobic capacity; balance; Bath AS Metrology Index; Bath AS Disease Activity Index and the Bath AS Functional Index were assessed. DISCUSSION: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP did not change notably within or between the groups from pre- to post-intervention. The between group analyses of the physical assessments favoured the ASE with observable improvements in chest expansion (p = 0.002), forced expiration volume (p = 0.012), absolute (p = 0.017) and relative (p = 0.003) maximal oxygen consumption, absolute (p = 0.028) and relative (p = 0.001) physical work capacity. Within the ASE, there is statistical evidence of improvements in 11 of the 19 physical variables. Within the ASC, five of the physical variables deteriorated substantially (p between 0.004 and 0.037) and only balance overall stability on the right improved (p = 0.016). The three functional assessments in the ASE improved (p < 0.007) compared with the ASC post-intervention. A 6-month combined exercise programme may improve physical and functional capacity of AS patients. CONCLUSION: A multimodal exercise intervention may be useful in the management of ankylosing spondylitis. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: An unsupervised well -explained exercise programme combining swimming, land-based strengthening and stretching exercises and breathing exercises may be an option for patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

A great body of evidence suggests that depression causes changes in neuroplasticity in specific regions of the brain which are correlated to symptom severity, negative emotional rumination as well as fear learning. Depression is correlated with atrophy of neurons in the cortical and limbic brain regions that control mood and emotion. Antidepressant therapy can exhibit effects on neuroplasticity and reverse the neuroanatomical changes found in depressed patients. The investigation of fast-acting agents that reverse behavioral and neuronal deficiencies of chronic depression, especially the glutamate receptor antagonist NMDA ketamine, and the cellular mechanisms underlying the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine and related agents are of real interest in current research. Actual medication such as serotonin (5-HT) selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, require weeks to months of administration before a clear therapeutic response. The current review aimed to underline the negative effects of depression on neuroplasticity and present the current findings on the effects of antidepressant medication.","Rădulescu, Ioana; Drăgoi, Ana Miruna; Trifu, Simona Corina; Cristea, Mihai Bogdan",Exp Ther Med,385,5

In 2018, 45.0% of neurology and neurological subspecialty residents were women. Despite a notable rise in the proportion of women neurologists over the past decades, inequalities regarding publication proportions between men and women persist in the field. This cohort study examines authorship trends in articles published in 155 international neurology journals, identified as those listed in the annual Journal Citation Reports' “Clinical Neurology” section. Authors' names, authorship positions and countries of affiliation were extracted from PubMed for indexed articles published from 1946 to 2020. Gender-API (a validated and highly accurate application program interface) assigned binary genders to authors. Author gender proportions were compared across subspecialties, authorship position and years. In 303,385 unique articles, 1,663,036 total authors were identified of which 34.1% were women. Neuroradiology demonstrated the lowest proportion of women authors (21.3%), while neurogenetics displayed the highest (44.5%). In articles with multiple authors, both men and women last authors were more likely to publish with a male first author, though this was significantly more pronounced for men last authors (1.86 vs. 1.08; p < 0.001). From 2002 to 2020, women remained in the minority of last (24.6%), first (36.2%), and middle author positions (35.8%). The authorship gender distribution in neurological journals neither reflects the gender proportion of neurologists in the field overall nor in any subspecialty examined. We also find a tendency for senior and junior authors of the same gender to publish together which perpetuates authorship inequity. Further work is needed to identify underlying causes so that interventions might be developed to improve authorship diversity.","Nguyen, Anne X.; Yoffe, Lilian; Li, Anna; Trinh, Xuan-Vi; Kurian, Jerry; Moss, Heather E.; Wu, Albert Y.",Front Neurol,385,5

Vaccines for seasonal influenza have been available for decades and there is a wealth of data available on the immune response to these vaccines in humans, with well-established correlates of protection for inactivated influenza virus vaccines. Many of the seminal studies on vaccines for epidemic influenza were conducted in human subjects. Studies in humans are performed less frequently now than they were in the past. Therefore, as the quest for improved influenza vaccines continues, it is important to consider the use of animal models for the evaluation of influenza vaccines, and a major challenge for research on influenza vaccines is the selection of an appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and the protective immune response to influenza infection in humans. The emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (AI) viruses and the threat of a pandemic caused by AI viruses of this or another subtype has resulted in a resurgence of interest in influenza vaccine research. The development of vaccines for pandemic influenza presents a unique set of obstacles, not the least of which is that the demonstration of efficacy in humans is not possible. Since the correlates of protection from pandemic influenza are not known, we rely on extrapolation of lessons from seasonal influenza vaccines and on data from the evaluation of pandemic influenza vaccines in animal models to guide our decisions on vaccines for use in humans.

The first activity that could be observed is the growth of the epithelial cells. At the site of entry into the body, microorganisms that are shed directly to the exterior multiply in the epithelial surface producing a spreading infection in the epithelium. Certain microorganisms spread through the body to reach susceptible target organs after free microorganism particles have entered vessels below the skin or intestinal epithelium. The infected host has a variety of defenses that operate without delay, before the immune response comes into action. However, many microbes have strategies for interfering with these defenses. After traversing the epithelial cell layer, a microorganism encounters the basement membrane. After reaching the subepithelial tissues they are exposed to three important host defense systems: the tissue fluids, the lymphatic system leading to the lymph nodes, and phagocytic cells. In addition to being able to resist host defense mechanisms, a pathogenic organism—be it an obligate intracellular, facultative intracellular, or extracellular pathogen—must also overcome the problem of obtaining essential nutrients if it is to be successful.","Mims, Cedric A.; Nash, Anthony; Stephen, John",Mims' Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease,385,5

Our aim was to assess whether airway gene expression of mediators of pulmonary epithelial sodium and liquid absorption, and further, respiratory morbidity, associate with cord blood GC concentrations. METHODS: The study included 64 infants delivered <32 weeks gestation. Cortisol and betamethasone in umbilical cord blood were quantified with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The total GC concentration was calculated. Gene expression of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Na,K-ATPase, and serum- and GC-inducible kinase 1 at <2 h and at 1 day postnatally in nasal epithelial cell samples was quantified with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The mean oxygen supplementation during the first 72 h was calculated. RESULTS: Concentrations of cord blood betamethasone and total GC were significantly lower in infants with RDS and correlated with mean oxygen supplementation. Expression of αENaC and α1- and β1Na,K-ATPase at <2 h correlated with betamethasone and total GC concentrations. Expression of Na,K-ATPase was lower in infants with RDS. CONCLUSION: Enhancement of lung liquid absorption via increased expression of sodium transporters may contribute to the beneficial pulmonary effects of antenatal GCs. IMPACT: RDS is related to lower umbilical cord blood GC concentrations and lower airway expression of sodium transporters. In addition to the timing of antenatal GC treatment, resulting concentrations may be of importance in preventing RDS. Induction of sodium transport may be a factor contributing to the pulmonary response to antenatal GCs.","Süvari, Liina; Helve, Otto M.; Kari, M. Anneli; Turpeinen, L. Ursula; Palojärvi, P.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, are promising tools that could enhance functional recovery of reach-to-grasp post-brain injury. Though the rodent literature provides a causal understanding of post-injury recovery mechanisms, it has had a limited impact on NIBS protocols in human research. The high degree of homology in reach-to-grasp circuitry between humans and rodents further implies that the application of NIBS to brain injury could be better informed by findings from pre-clinical rodent models and neurorehabilitation research. Here, we provide an overview of the advantages and limitations of using rodent models to advance our current understanding of human reach-to-grasp function, cortical circuitry, and reorganization. We propose that a cross-species comparison of reach-to-grasp recovery could provide a mechanistic framework for clinically efficacious NIBS treatments that could elicit better functional outcomes for patients.","Latchoumane, Charles-Francois V.; Barany, Deborah A.; Karumbaiah, Lohitash; Singh, Tarkeshwar",Front Neurol,385,29

Moreover, this phenomenon is deteriorating the relation with public institutions and industries. The purpose of this article is to provide a more advanced understanding of the individual psychological factors and the social influence that contributes to the belief in food-related online fake news and the aspects that can increase or mitigate this risk. Data were collected with a self-report questionnaire between February and March 2019. We obtained 1004 valid questionnaires filled out by a representative sample of Italian population, extracted by stratified sampling. We used structural equation modelling and the multi-group analyses to test our hypothesis. The results show that self-evaluation negatively affects the social-influence, which in turn positively affects the belief in online fake news. Moreover, this latter relationship is moderated by the readiness to change. Our results suggest that individual psychological characteristics and social influence are important in explaining the belief in online fake news in the food sector; however, a pivotal role is played by the motivation of lifestyle change. This should be considered to engage people in clear and effective communication.","Castellini, Greta; Savarese, Mariarosaria; Graffigna, Guendalina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,385,1

Return-of-service (ROS) initiatives are government-funded strategies used to educate health professionals by contracting beneficiaries to undertake government work on a year-for-year basis after their qualification. It is envisaged that once they have served their contract, they will be attracted to serve in the same area or government establishment beyond the duration of their obligatory period. Little is known about the processes that led to the development and implementation of ROS policies. Furthermore, there is no systematic evaluation of the strategies that demonstrate their utility. This research aims to evaluate the ROS initiatives, explore their efficacy and sustainability in five Southern African countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be conducted in South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana and Namibia in a phased approach through a multimethods approach of policy reviews, quantitative and qualitative research. First, a review will be conducted to explore current ROS schemes. Second, a quantitative retrospective cohort study of ROS scheme recipients for the period 2000–2010 will be undertaken. Information will be sourced from multiple provincial or national information systems and/or databases. Third, we will conduct semistructured group or individual interviews with senior health, education, ROS managing agency managers (where appropriate) and finance managers and/policy makers in each country to determine managers’ perceptions, challenges and the costs and benefits of these schemes. Fourth, we will interview or conduct group discussions with health professional regulatory bodies to assess their willingness to collaborate with ROS initiative funders. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for this study was obtained through the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of New South Wales (HC200519), Australia; South Africa and Lesotho (065/2020); Eswatini (SHR302/2020); Namibia (SK001); and Botswana (HPDME 13/18/1). Relevant findings will be shared through presentations to participating governments, publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at relevant conferences.","Mabunda, Sikhumbuzo; Angell, Blake; Joshi, Rohina; Durbach, Andrea",BMJ Open,385,5

It is possible that the male sex hormone, testosterone, contributes to the morbidity from COVID-19. SARS-CoV2 viruses use cell membrane protein Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and undergo S protein priming by the Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS2) to enter the cells. Hence, the expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may affect disease susceptibility and possible severity. TMPRSS2 is regulated by the androgen receptor. We, therefore, examined if an association exists between serum testosterone concentrations and ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression level in men. Methods: We analyzed fasting serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from 42 men. Total and free testosterone and estradiol were measured by liquid chromatography/equilibrium dialysis. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was measured by chemiluminescence. mRNA was prepared from MNC. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted using commercially available, pre-designed TaqMan primers and probes targeting ACE2. The ACE2 relative level was calculated after normalization to beta Actin and GAPDH, with lowest ACE2 level being set to 1. Results: Subjects’ age ranged from 20 to 65 years. Type 2 diabetes was present in 74% of the men and the mean HbA1 was 7.2±1.6% (mean ± S.D.). Fifteen subjects had subnormal free testosterone (<50 pg/ml). Compared to the 27 subjects with normal free testosterone, they were older (49±12 vs 40±13 years, p=0.03) but had similar BMI (36±10, 35±10 kg/m(2), p=0.71). As expected, they had lower total testosterone (Median [25(th), 75(th) percentile]; 222 [171-266] vs 431 [335, 618] ng/dl, p<0.001) and free testosterone concentrations (39 [21, 44] vs 72 [59, 92], p<0.001). Total estradiol was also lower in this group (19±1 vs 29±13 pg/ml, p=0.03) but free estradiol (0.44±0.33 vs 0.56±0.34 pg/ml, p=0.44) and SHBG (27 [19, 33] vs 30 [21, 39] nmol/L, p=0.52) were similar. Quantitative PCR data showed there was a large inter-individual variation of ACE2 expression level, up to 15-fold difference. Average ACE2 level did not differ between subnormal and normal testosterone groups (3.4 [2.7, 5.0] vs 3.9 [2.5, 5.7] arbitrary units). ACE2 expression was not related to free testosterone (r=0.11), free estradiol (r=0.18) or sex hormone binding globulin (r=0.15) on linear regression analyses (p>0.30 for all). ACE2 expression was also not related to age (r= -0.15, p=0.34), BMI (r= -0.2, p=0.23) or presence of diabetes. We were not able to detect a significant expression of TMPRSS2 in MNC. Conclusion: Our results do not support a role for testosterone or estradiol as regulators of ACE2 expression in peripheral blood MNC in males.","Ling, Guyou; Campbell, Robert; Bruno, Jonathan; Goffinet, Aaron; Krebs, Joseph; Jain, Ajay; Dhindsa, Sandeep S",J Endocr Soc,385,1

This article investigates the research question: What barriers need to be addressed to maximise the New Colombo Plan alumni’s contribution to Australia’s public diplomacy in China? Recommendations to practitioners are offered, including the need for higher language skills and increased collaboration between the NCP and the Australian Studies Centres. The findings support current studies tracking alumni stories to combat inevitable criticism of funding domestic students to study abroad. Future success requires, the continued high-profile support by the Foreign Minister. Interviewees reported that the NCP has received positive comments in-country but measurable outcomes will be slow in coming.

Since the onset of the pandemic, the focus of many healthcare systems has shifted toward limiting non-essential visits to the hospital in order to prioritize and allocate resources toward treating those affected by COVID-19. While the effect of COVID-19 has been felt amongst many patient populations, those with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) have been particularly impacted. We aimed to determine how changes to the provision of IBD care due to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected IBD patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in patients with an IBD diagnosis comparing patients admitted to two tertiary care centres affiliated with Western University in London, Canada between March 17 and August 31 2019 (2019 cohort or pre-pandemic), to patients admitted between March 17 and August 31 2020 (2020 cohort or pandemic). Patients were reviewed to assess any differences in care utilization and IBD-related outcomes such as hospitalization, need for surgery, length of stay in hospital and in-patient drug therapy during the defined time periods. RESULTS: A total of 863 patients were reviewed in 2019, and 554 in 2020. Of those, 184 (CD, n= 125; UC, n= 59) and 172 (CD, n= 109; UC, n= 62) encounters met the inclusion criteria for 2019 and 2020 respectively. Patient demographics were similar between 2019 and 2020 cohort with the exception of age (2019, mean age = 44.76 years ± 16.78; 2020, mean age=50.36 years ± 17.82, p=0.002). The length of stay in hospital was shorter in 2020 (6.88 days vs 9.63, p=0.045). Significantly fewer patients were initiated on Infliximab in hospital in 2020 (2020, 3.50 per month; 2019, 6.83 per month, p=0.001). Fewer in-patient surgeries were performed in 2020 (2019, 76; 2020, 57; p=0.112). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data demonstrate during the COVID-19 pandemic there was a significant reduction in the length of stay for patients with IBD as well as fewer patients initiated on infliximab while in hospital. There was also a decrease in the number of surgeries performed in 2020. These differences may reflect an effort to minimize contact between patients and health care facilities as well as reduce the introduction of further immunosuppression. Further research will be to determine whether if more ER visits became hospitalizations and any delays in appointment times or endoscopies, or compliance issues with medications may have led to these aforementioned outcomes.","Malhi, G; Chambers, J; Minhas, G; Mikail, M; Khanna, R; Wilson, A",J Crohns Colitis,385,1
54508,54508,54508,Providing mental health services within schools: A post‐pandemic imperative,20.758165,3.0976102,2021-05-06,"Over the past three decades, corporate sponsorship has evolved into a key element in the marketing communications mix. More recently, the concept of “sponsorship-linked internal marketing” has attracted interest among scholars who study how sponsorship can build corporate identity and increase employee involvement. However, existing knowledge about the effects of sponsorship on employees is still sparse, despite the prevalent rationale that an employer’s sponsorship activity may influence employees’ perceptions of their employer and their behavior within the organization. This research responds to calls to investigate the strategic application of sponsorship within the firm (Farrelly et al. in J Sport Manag 26(6):506–520, 2012). Grounded in signaling theory and prior sponsorship research, we develop and empirically test a sponsorship effectiveness model among employees of a Swiss retail company. Our findings demonstrate that a high level of sports, cultural, and ecological sponsorship quality, as well as a high level of sports and ecological sponsorship quantity, positively impacts employees’ brand commitment and brand behavior through their perception of the brand image and brand understanding. Furthermore, the effects of sponsorship quality are stronger than sponsorship quantity.","Batt, Verena; Holzer, Matthias; Bruhn, Manfred; Tuzovic, Sven",J Brand Manag,385,16

However, such systems are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by fake face videos and thereby gaining unauthorized access in the system. For a robust biometric system anti spoofing approaches like liveness detection ought to be implemented in order to counter the aforesaid print and replay attacks. This article proposes a novel approach of anti spoofing using Multivariate histogram of oriented gradients descriptor in the auto detected micro expression (μE) regions of human facial videos. Facial μE are very brief, spontaneous facial expressions that highlight the face of humans when they either unconsciously or deliberately conceal an emotion. The work emphasizes the variations in μE in fake and original video representation by a considerable amount and claims such a variance is a tool to combat against presentation attacks. In particular, the method automatically extracts the ROI of major changes in μE using the Multivariate orientation gradients parameter and thus proposes this descriptor as one of the most suitable tools to characterize the liveness. The entire implementation is carried out on the self-created Database for replay attacks. The result obtained is satisfactory and tested statistically significant.","Karmakar, Dhiman; Mukherjee, Puja; Datta, Madhura",Pattern Recognit,385,16

DATA: We tracked daily official crime reports in a sample of 21 high-crime Bedfordshire (UK) Lower-layer Super Output areas (LSOAs). We measured time spent by two-person police foot patrols in those areas with daily GPS data from handheld devices given to officers working on overtime. We also counted proactively initiated arrests. METHODS: We used a crossover randomised controlled trial on the 21 “hot spot” LSOAs, each of which was randomly assigned daily to be either in a treatment condition of 15-min of patrol (as one of seven each day) or a control condition of no patrol (as one of 14 each day) for each of 90 days. We used an intention-to-treat framework to analyse the impact of patrols on the outcome measures overall, on consecutive days of assignment to the same condition, and in 100-m ‘buffer’ zones around each hot spot. FINDINGS: We found that on treatment days the hot spots had 44% lower Cambridge crime harm index scores from serious violence than on control days, as well as 40% fewer incidents across all public crimes against personal victims. Statistically significant differences in lower prevalence, counts and harm of both non-domestic violent crime and robbery and other non-domestic crimes against personal victims were also found. We found no evidence of either displacement of serious crime into a 100-m buffer zone, nor any evidence of residual deterrence on no-patrol days following patrol days. We did find evidence of a cumulative effect: the largest differences in crime harm on control days were found in treatment days that came after 3 days of consecutive patrol in the same LSOA. CONCLUSIONS: Even minimal amounts of foot patrol can prevent serious violent crime across a large area, and repeated patrols over several days help even more. Our findings suggest that, to reduce both violent and other forms of crime, uniformed officers need to patrol hot spots for short amounts of times on consecutive days.","Bland, Matthew; Leggetter, Michelle; Cestaro, David; Sebire, Jacqueline",Camb J Evid Based Polic,385,17

DDX3 has emerged as a potent target for several cancers, including breast cancer to which currently there are no reported or approved drugs. METHODS: To find effective cancer therapeutics, three compounds were computationally designed tweaking the structure of natural compound butein. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer property in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines targeting DDX3. The in silico molecular docking studies have shown that the compounds have occupied the binding site of the human DDX3 target. Furthermore, to investigate the cell viability effect of 3a, 3b, and 3c on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, the cell lines were treated with different concentrations of compounds for 24 and 48 h and measured using MTT assay. RESULTS: The cell viability results showed that the have induced dose dependent suppression of DDX3 expression. Additionally, 3b and 3c have reduced the expression of DDX3 in MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231 cell lines. 3b or 3c treated cell lines increased apoptotic protein expression. Both the compounds have induced the apoptotic cell death by elevated levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 and repression of the anti-apoptosis protein BCL-xL. Additionally, they have demonstrated the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in both the cell lines. Additionally, 3c decreased PI3K and AKT levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results shed light on the anticancer ability of the designed compounds. These compounds can be employed as chemical spaces to design new prospective drug candidates. Additionally, our computational method can be adapted to design new chemical scaffolds as plausible inhibitors.","Rampogu, Shailima; Kim, Seong Min; Shaik, Baji; Lee, Gihwan; Kim, Ju Hyun; Kim, Gon Sup; Lee, Keun Woo; Kim, Myeong Ok",Front Oncol,385,1

Those features are equally found in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), defined as modular materials built from metal-nodes connected through organic-ligands. Because of the electronic and structural complexity of MOFs, the computational description of their excited states is a formidable challenge for which two different approaches have been usually followed: the solid state and the molecular perspective. The first consists in analysing the frontier electronic bands and crystal orbitals of the electronic ground state (GS) in periodic boundary conditions, while the latter points to an accurate computation of the excited states in representative clusters at the molecular level. Herein, we apply both approaches to evaluate the optical absorption properties of three experimentally reported Ti(iv) mononuclear MOFs with in silico metal substitutions with Zn(ii), Cd(ii), Fe(ii), Ru(ii) and Zr(iv) ions, thus covering d10, d6 and d0 electronic configurations of 1st and 2nd row TMCs in MOFs.

In Australasia, 90 % of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) practice point-of-care fnECHO. The Australian Society of Ultrasound Medicine offers a training certificate for fnECHO. In Europe, the use and indications of fnECHO and the extent of point-of-care fnECHO training and accreditation are unknown. We aimed to assess utilisation and training of fnECHO in Europe. For this, we conducted an email survey of 45 randomly chosen tertiary NICUs in 17 European countries. The recall rate was 89 % (n = 40). Neonatologists with skills in fnECHO worked in 29 NICUs (74 %), but paediatric cardiologists would routinely perform most fnECHOs. Twenty-four-hour echocardiography service was available in 31 NICUs (78 %). Indications for fnECHO included assessment of haemodynamic volume status (53 %), presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension of the neonate (55 %), indication for and effect of volume replacement therapy (58 %), PDA assessment and monitoring of PDA treatment (80 %). Teaching of fnECHO was offered to trainees in 22 NICUs (55 %). Teaching of fnECHO was provided by paediatric cardiologists (55 %) or by neonatologists (45 %). Only six (15 %) national colleges accredited fnECHO teaching courses. CONCLUSION fnECHO is widely practiced by neonatologists across Europe for a broad range of clinical questions. However, there is a lack of formal training and accreditation of fnECHO skills. This could be addressed by designing a dedicated European fnECHO training programme and by agreeing on a common European certificate of fnECHO.","Roehr, C C; Te Pas, A B; Dold, Simone K; Breindahl, M; Blennow, M; Rüdiger, M; Gupta, Samir",European journal of pediatrics,385,31

Thus far, the integrated assessment modelling community and the IPCC have neglected to consider degrowth scenarios, where economic output declines due to stringent climate mitigation. Hence, their potential to avoid reliance on negative emissions and speculative rates of technological change remains unexplored. As a first step to address this gap, this paper compares 1.5 °C degrowth scenarios with IPCC archetype scenarios, using a simplified quantitative representation of the fuel-energy-emissions nexus. Here we find that the degrowth scenarios minimize many key risks for feasibility and sustainability compared to technology-driven pathways, such as the reliance on high energy-GDP decoupling, large-scale carbon dioxide removal and large-scale and high-speed renewable energy transformation. However, substantial challenges remain regarding political feasibility. Nevertheless, degrowth pathways should be thoroughly considered.","Keyßer, Lorenz T; Lenzen, Manfred",Nature communications,385,16

Two calves were euthanized before and 1, 2, 4, 7, or 14 days after BHV-1 inoculation. Another 10 calves were inoculated intranasally with BHV-1 only and euthanized 1, 2, 4, 7, or 14 days later. Two calves were inoculated intranasally with virus-free tissue culture fluid and euthanized as negative controls. Pathological changes and viral antigen distribution in various tissue samples from calves with and without BVDV infection (all of which had been experimentally inoculated with BHV-1) were compared. RESULTS Following BHV-1 challenge, calves with preexisting subclinical BVDV infection had earlier development of more severe inflammatory processes and, consequently, more severe tissue lesions (limited to lymphoid tissues and respiratory and digestive tracts) and greater dissemination of BHV-1, compared with calves without preexisting BVDV infection. Moreover, coinfected calves had an intense lymphoid depletion in the Peyer patches of the ileum as well as the persistence of BVDV in target organs and the reappearance of digestive tract changes during disease progression. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In calves, preexisting infection with BVDV facilitated the establishment of BHV-1 infection, just as the presence of BHV-1 favors BVDV persistence, thereby synergistically potentiating effects of both viruses and increasing the severity of the resultant clinical signs.","Risalde, María A; Molina, Verónica; Sónchez-Cordón, Pedro J; Pedrera, Miriam; Romero-Palomo, Fernando; Bautista, María J; Moreno, Alberto; Gómez-Villamandos, José C",American journal of veterinary research,385,31

Methods: TEOSS randomized 119 predominantly outpatient youth ages 8-19 years with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder to 8 weeks of treatment with molindone, risperidone, or olanzapine. We used proportional hazards regression to determine whether these three antipsychotics differed in the time until clinical response, defined as the time from treatment initiation to the point of achieving a Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale score of 1 (""very much improved"") or 2 (""much improved"") that was maintained until week 8. Results: Of the 116 youth who initiated treatment, 56 (48%) achieved clinical response. Among clinical responders, the median (±interquartile range) time until clinical response was 4.0 (±4.0) weeks for olanzapine, 4.5 (±4.0) weeks for risperidone, and 6.0 (±4.0) weeks for molindone. There were no significant differences in time course for clinical response between medications (p = 0.84). Youth without symptom improvement (CGI-I ≥ 4) after 3 weeks were more likely to be clinical nonresponders at week 8 (relative risk ratio = 1.98, 95% confidence interval 1.29-3.05), compared with youth with at-least-minimal symptom improvement after 3 weeks when looking at all antipsychotics combined. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate medication differences in treatment response timing in early onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Clinical response times for molindone, risperidone, and olanzapine were not significantly different. Furthermore, while lack of early improvement predicted clinical nonresponse, whether or not to continue antipsychotic treatment after 3 or more weeks without symptom improvement should be based on clinical judgment after weighing potential risks, benefits, and alternatives.

Unfortunately, such orders may have been associated with intimate partner violence (IPV) against women but there is no study conducted to assess the magnitude of IPV during the lock-downs in the country. Thus, this study intended to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of IPV against women during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on sample of 617 married or cohabited women. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to identify and enroll women who are married. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of IPV among women and all statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 14.2. In this study, amongst the 589 married women who were included in the analysis, 22.4% [95% CI: 19.1%, 25.9%] were experienced at least one form of IPV. Additionally, 11.0%, 20.0%, and 13.8% of women also experienced physical, psychological, and sexual IPVs respectively. After adjusting for covariate; being illiterate [AOR=2.37: 95% CI 1.29, 4.35], having illiterate husband [AOR=2.67: 95% CI 1.36, 5.21], having substance user husband (alcohol, chat or cigarettes) [AOR=2.75: 95% CI 1.42, 5.34], and community tolerant attitude to violence [AOR=2.97: 95% CI 1.17, 7.61] were the independent predictors of IPV amongst married women. In conclusion, the prevalence of IPV among married women was comparable to the national pre-COVID figure of IPV. Therefore, national and regional governments should work toward enhancing gender equality, coupled with addressing risk factors at multiple levels, using community- and institution-based approaches to prevent IPV and to specifically achieve SDG5 of eliminating violence against women by 2030.","Tadesse, Abay Woday; Tarekegn, Setegn Mihret; Wagaw, Gebeyaw Biset; Muluneh, Muluken Dessalegn; Kassa, Ayesheshim Muluneh",Journal of interpersonal violence,385,31

Since then, the threat of H5N1 avian influenza, the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic have underscored the importance of considering infectious events within such a framework. Pediatric emergency departments (EDs) were disproportionately burdened by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and therefore serve as a robust context for evaluation of pandemic preparedness. The objective of this study was to explore pediatric ED leaders' experiences with preparedness, response, and postincident actions related to the H1N1 pandemic to inform future pandemic and all-hazards planning and policy for EDs. METHODS The authors selected a qualitative design, well suited for exploring complex, multifaceted organizational processes such as planning for and responding to a pandemic and learning from institutional experiences. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit medical directors or their designated physician respondents from pediatric emergency medicine training institutions representing a range of geographic regions across the United States, hospital types, and annual ED volumes; snowball sampling identified additional information-rich respondents. Recruitment began in May 2011 and continued until thematic saturation was reached in January 2012 (n = 20). Data were collected through in-depth individual phone interviews that were recorded and professionally transcribed. Using a standard interview guide, respondents were asked open-ended questions about pandemic planning, response, and institutional learning related to the H1N1 pandemic. Data analysis was performed by a multidisciplinary team using a grounded theory approach to generate themes inductively from respondents' expressed perspectives. The constant comparative method was used to identify emerging themes. RESULTS Five common themes characterized respondents' experiences with pandemic planning and response: 1) national pandemic influenza preparedness guidance has not fully penetrated to the level of pediatric emergency physician (EP) leaders, leading to variable states of preparedness; 2) pediatric EDs that maintained strong relationships with local public health and other health care entities found those relationships to be beneficial to pandemic response; 3) pediatric EP leaders reported difficulty reconciling public health guidance with the reality of ED practice; 4) although many anticipated obstacles did not materialize, in some cases pediatric EP leaders experienced unexpected institutional challenges; and 5) pediatric EP leaders described varied experiences with organizational learning following the H1N1 pandemic experience. CONCLUSIONS Despite a decade of investment in hospital preparedness, gaps in pediatric ED pandemic preparedness remain. This work suggests that raising awareness of pandemic planning standards and promoting strategies to overcome barriers to their adoption could enhance ED and hospital preparedness. Helping hospitals better prepare for pandemic events may lead to strengthened all-hazards preparedness.","Filice, Clara E; Vaca, Federico E; Curry, Leslie; Platis, Stephanie; Lurie, Nicole; Bogucki, Sandy",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,385,24

It does so via a heuristic comparison between two molecular technologies that are central to the promotion of sexual health: the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in two sexual health institutions in the western part of Switzerland, the article presents two main findings. First, it argues that bodies are constructed as being at low or high risk by sexual health professionals (based on health and lifestyle criteria). Second, it shows that access to either the COCP or PrEP is largely based on this former classification. The article also demonstrates that there are ambivalent situations in which sexual health professionals seek compromises between different risks, and pragmatically adapt their medical protocols.","Debergh, Marlyse",Health sociology review : the journal of the Health Section of the Australian Sociological Association,385,1

MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) and cytokeratin-18 (K18) are DILI biomarkers. To explore their utility in this global context, circulating miR-122 and K18 were measured in UK and Ugandan populations on anti-TB therapy for mycobacterial infection. METHODS Healthy subjects and patients receiving anti-TB therapy were recruited at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, UK (ALISTER-ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03211208). African patients with HIV-TB coinfection were recruited at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Kampala, Uganda (SAEFRIF-NCT03982277). Serial blood samples, demographic and clinical data were collected. In ALISTER samples, MiR-122 was quantified using PCR. In ALISTER and SAEFRIF samples, K18 was quantified by ELISA. RESULTS The study had 235 participants (healthy volunteers (n=28); ALISTER: active TB (n=30), latent TB (n=88), non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (n=25); SAEFRIF: HIV-TB coinfection (n=64)). In the absence of DILI, there was no difference in miR-122 and K18 across the groups. Both miR-122 and K18 correlated with alanine transaminase activity (ALT) (miR-122:r=0.52,95%CI=0.42-0.61,P<0.0001. K18:r=0.42,95%CI=0.34-0.49,P<0.0001). miR-122 distinguished those patients with ALT>50U/L with higher sensitivity/specificity than K18. There were two DILI cases: baseline ALT,18 and 28 IU/L, peak ALT 431 and 194 IU/L; baseline K18, 58 and 219 U/L, peak K18 1247 and 3490 U/L; baseline miR-122 4 and 17 fM, peak miR-122 60 and 336 fM, respectively. CONCLUSION In patients treated with anti-TB therapy miR-122 and K18 correlated with ALT and increased with DILI.

Emergency Department (ED) specific RRS are relatively new and the factors associated with their effectiveness are largely unknown. This study describes the period prevalence of deterioration and characteristics of care for deteriorating patients in an Australia ED and examine relationships between system factors and escalation of care. METHODS A retrospective medical record audit of all patients presenting to an Australian ED in two weeks. RESULTS Period prevalence of deterioration was 10.08% (n=269). Failure to escalate care occurred in nearly half (n=52, 47.3%) of the patients requiring a response (n=110). Appropriate escalation practices were associated with where the patient was being cared for (p=0.01), and the competence level of the person documenting deterioration (p=0.005). Intermediate competence level nurses were nine times more likely to escalate care than novices and experts (p=0.005). While there was variance in escalation practice related to system factors, these associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION The safety of deteriorating ED patients may be improved by informing care based on the escalation practices of staff with intermediate ED experience and competence levels.","Connell, Clifford J; Endacott, Ruth; Cooper, Simon",Australasian emergency care,385,1

Parenting Health Initiative (SELPHI) provides expectant and parenting youth ages 16-24 in Philadelphia with supports to improve educational, social, and economic outcomes to shape their health and the health of their children. Phone, text, video-based, and social media communication technology is built in to SELPHI's program design to facilitate case management and connect clients to a broad referral network. Given the novelty of using information and communication technology (ICT) in case management, the reported lessons learned seek to give providers a specific and nuanced picture of ICT in case management. METHODS In its initial 6-month implementation period, SELPHI's five case managers, called Navigators, served 59 clients. Data from feedback surveys and case records were collected from clients and Navigators. Data included client demographic characteristics, needs assessment, and contact records to inform continuous quality improvement (CQI). RESULTS ICT's benefits included having multiple ways to connect to difficult-to-reach clients, the ability to be more responsive to clients, and the flexibility to address scheduling and transportation barriers. ICT's challenges are related to Navigators' boundary setting, limitations on rapport building, and data security considerations. CQI data are presented to illustrate the lessons learned. Text messages were the most prevalent ICT; phone calls were most successful in engaging clients. Clients' ICT preferences differed by purpose of communication. DISCUSSION Findings suggest that programs should understand the nuances of client contact preferences. To maximize the benefits of ICT, programs must develop or adapt protocols based on preference and purpose of communication.","Kang, Nichole; Patrick, Morgan; Williams, Frances; Hemady, Katharine; Aussendorf, Mara; Greenbacker, Livia; Kannam, Allison",Maternal and child health journal,385,1

Concentration-dependent photoluminescence (PL) is a unique feature of CDs and is regarded as one way to realize tunable PL, providing information on their PL mechanism. In this work, we synthesized concentration-dependent blue/red dual-color-emissive CDs under single excitation at 365 nm. With the increase in concentration, the blue emission band showed a large red-shift from 431 to 500 nm, while the red emission band at around 650 nm showed only a relative intensity change, without a significant spectral shift. We performed spectroscopic analysis by changing the solution environment including the solvent type and pH to investigate the origins of the two emission bands. These results, combined with the zeta potential and fluorescence microscopy results, confirmed that the interparticle distance of CDs is a key factor for their dual-emissive PL behavior. With the advantage of unique PL features, we showed the potential of the CDs for white light-emitting diode (WLED) and ratiometric pH sensing applications.","Yoo, Hyo Jeong; Kwak, Byeong Eun; Kim, Do Hyun",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,385,31

METHODS This prospective study, approved by local ethical committee, enrolled 38 patients with primary OC, 2011-2014. After preoperative DCE-MRI (3.0 T), two observers measured perfusion (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp) and semi-quantitative parameters (area under the curve, peak, time-to-peak) by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) covering the large solid lesion (L-ROI) and the most enhancing small area (S-ROI) (NordicICE platform). Kruskal-Wallis was used to analyze associations between MRI parameters and classified prognostic factors. RESULTS Mean Ktrans values were higher in high-grade serous OC than in other types (L-ROI, P = 0.041; S-ROI, P = 0.018), and lower mean Ktrans values predicted residual tumor (L-ROI P = 0.030; S-ROI, P = 0.012). Higher minimum Vp values were associated with higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (S-ROI, P = 0.023).Shorter recurrence-free survival was predicted by higher Ve (minimum L-ROI, P = 0.035; maximum S-ROI, P = 0.046), Vp (maximum S-ROI, P = 0.033), and lower time-to-peak (maximum S-ROI, P = 0.047) in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multiparametric MRI variables combining DCE and diffusion weighted data were also predictive for survival. CONCLUSION DCE-MRI parameters may represent imaging biomarkers for predicting tumor aggressiveness and prognosis in OC. Higher Ktrans levels were associated with better results in cytoreductive surgery but with earlier recurrence.","Lindgren, Auni; Anttila, Maarit; Arponen, Otso; Rautiainen, Suvi; Könönen, Mervi; Vanninen, Ritva; Sallinen, Hanna",European journal of radiology,385,28

Secondary outcomes included initial complete or near-complete occlusion, long-term good neurologic outcome, procedure-related morbidity, and procedure-related mortality. Data were analyzed by using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS In total, 38 studies including 2446 patients with 2556 aneurysms were included. For all wide-neck aneurysms, immediate complete or near-complete occlusion rate was 57.4% (95% CI, 48.1%-66.8%). Follow-up near-complete occlusion rate was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.0%-81.0%). Recanalization and retreatment rates were 9.4% (95% CI, 7.1%-11.7%) and 5.8% (95% CI, 4.1%-7.5%), respectively. Long-term good neurologic outcome was 91.4% (95% CI, 88.5%-94.2%). For wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms, initial complete or near-complete occlusion rate was 60.0% (95% CI, 42.7%-77.3%), long-term complete or near-complete occlusion rate was 71.9% (95% CI, 52.6%-91.1%), and the recanalization and retreatment rates were 9.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-12.5%) and 5.2% (95% CI, 1.9%-8.4%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our study of angiographic and clinical outcomes for patients with wide-neck aneurysms demonstrates that endovascular coiling with or without stent-assisted coiling is safe, with low rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Initial and long-term angiographic outcomes were generally satisfactory, but not ideal. These data provide some baseline comparisons against which emergent technologies can be assessed.","Zhao, B; Yin, R; Lanzino, G; Kallmes, D F; Cloft, H J; Brinjikji, W",AJNR.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns of even greater unpredictability in the drug supplies and unprecedented rates of overdoses. Portable drug-checking technologies are increasingly being integrated within overdose prevention strategies. These emerging responses are raising new questions about which technologies to pursue and what service models can respond to the current risks and contexts. In what has been referred to as the epicenter of the overdose crisis in Canada, a multi-technology platform for drug checking is being piloted in community settings using a suite of chemical analytical methods to provide real-time harm reduction. These include infrared absorption, Raman scattering, gas chromatography with mass spectrometry, and antibody-based test strips. In this Perspective, we illustrate some advantages and challenges of using multiple techniques for the analysis of the same sample, and provide an example of a data analysis and visualization platform that can unify the presentation of the results and enable deeper analysis of the results. We also highlight the implementation of a various service models that co-exist in a research setting, with particular emphasis on the way that drug checking technicians and harm reduction workers interact with service users. Finally, we provide a description of the challenges associated with data interpretation and the communication of results to a diverse audience.","Wallace, Bruce; Hills, Rory; Rothwell, Jake; Kumar, Deepak; Garber, Ian; van Roode, Thea; Larnder, Ashley; Pagan, Flora; Aasen, Jarred; Weatherston, Jorin; Gozdzialski, Lea; Ramsay, Margo; Burek, Piotr; Azam, Md Shafiul; Pauly, Bernie; Storey, Margaret-Anne; Hore, Dennis",Drug testing and analysis,385,24

The 3 tubal sterilization procedures were completed in 18 to 30 minutes, with negligible blood loss. Operative time for the 3 salpingectomies because of ectopic pregnancy was 62 to 116 minutes. One of these procedures included management of 2000 mL hemoperitoneum. Three of the 4 attempts at ovarian enucleation were successfully completed within 64 to 162 minutes, with estimated blood loss ≤ 50 mL. One NOTES procedure failed because of a misdiagnosed peritoneal mucinous tumor located anterior to the uterus and inaccessible, leading to subsequent conversion to transabdominal laparoscopy. Our preliminary results show that purely transvaginal NOTES is feasible and safe for use in performing uterine adnexal procedures in selected patients. However, the procedure cannot be used in patients with cul-de-sac disease, and could have limited use in treating lesions located anterior to the uterus.","Lee, Chyi-Long; Wu, Kai-Yun; Su, Hsuan; Ueng, Shir-Hwa; Yen, Chih-Feng",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,385,1

This study aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery compared with open surgery in the oldest-old. METHODS Forty-four patients aged 85 years and older with colorectal cancer who underwent elective laparoscopic surgery (LAC group) were compared with 37 patients aged 85 years and older who underwent open surgery (OC group). RESULTS There were no significant differences in the age, the sex, the body mass index, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists grade between the groups. The comorbidity rate was slightly higher in the LAC group than in the OC group (68% vs. 57%). The mean operating time was significantly longer (209 vs. 194 min, P=0.014), but the mean estimated blood loss was significantly less (30 vs. 286 mL, P<0.001) in the LAC group than in the OC group. The mean time to flatus (1.7 vs. 3.9 d, P<0.0001), the time to liquid diet (2.7 vs. 7.7 d, P<0.0001), and the length of postoperative hospital stay (14.7 vs. 21.7 d, P<0.0001) were significantly shorter in the LAC group than in the OC group. The rate of postoperative complications tended to be lower in the LAC group than in the OC group (13.6% vs. 27%).

How other factors can explain this bias remains unclear. So two experiments investigated how complying with public health recommendations during the COVID19 pandemic depended on victim portrayal, reflection, and philosophical beliefs (Total N = 998). Only one experiment found that messaging about individual victims increased compliance compared to messaging about statistical victims-i.e., ""flatten the curve"" graphs-an effect that was undetected after controlling for other factors. However, messaging about flu (vs. COVID19) indirectly reduced compliance by reducing perceived threat of the pandemic. Nevertheless, moral beliefs predicted compliance better than messaging and reflection in both experiments. The second experiment's additional measures revealed that religiosity, political preferences, and beliefs about science also predicted compliance. This suggests that flouting public health recommendations may be less about ineffective messaging or reasoning than philosophical differences.","Byrd, Nick; Białek, Michał",Cognition,385,12

Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early- and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. Infection of aged, but not young, mice with recombinant viruses bearing spike glycoproteins derived from early human or palm civet isolates resulted in death accompanied by pathological changes associated with ARDS. In aged mice, a greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed than in young mice, whose responses were significantly delayed. Differences between lethal and nonlethal virus phenotypes in aged mice could be attributed to differences in host response kinetics rather than virus kinetics. SARS-CoV infection induced a range of interferon, cytokine, and pulmonary wound-healing genes, as well as several genes associated with the onset of ARDS. Mice that died also showed unique transcriptional profiles of immune response, apoptosis, cell cycle control, and stress. Cytokines associated with ARDS were significantly upregulated in animals experiencing lung pathology and lethal disease, while the same animals experienced downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These data suggest that the magnitude and kinetics of a disproportionately strong host innate immune response contributed to severe respiratory stress and lethality. Although the molecular mechanisms governing ARDS pathophysiology remain unknown in aged animals, these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which SARS-CoV infection induces changes in the host response, leading to death.","Rockx, Barry; Baas, Tracey; Zornetzer, Gregory A; Haagmans, Bart; Sheahan, Timothy; Frieman, Matthew; Dyer, Matthew D; Teal, Thomas H; Proll, Sean; van den Brand, Judith; Baric, Ralph; Katze, Michael G",Journal of virology,385,15

As a result, it has become important to understand the disease trends in order to mitigate its effects. The aim of this study is firstly to develop a prediction model for daily confirmed COVID-19 cases based on several covariates, and secondly, to select the best prediction model based on a subset of these covariates. METHODOLOGY This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH) and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18 April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase). RESULTS The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020. Observed cases during the forecast period were accurately predicted and were placed within the prediction intervals generated by the fitted model. CONCLUSIONS This study finds that ARIMA models with optimally selected covariates are useful tools for monitoring and predicting trends of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia.","Singh, Sarbhan; Murali Sundram, Bala; Rajendran, Kamesh; Boon Law, Kian; Aris, Tahir; Ibrahim, Hishamshah; Chandra Dass, Sarat; Singh Gill, Balvinder",Journal of infection in developing countries,385,8

The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of chronic pain after hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy. METHODS Living kidney donors who donated between 2011 and 2017 at the University Medical Centre Groningen were included. All patients underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. Postdonation pain and movement disabilities were assessed using the Carolinas Comfort Scale (CCS) and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The prevalence, severity of pain and the need for analgesics were reported. RESULTS Some 333 living kidney donors with a mean age of 56 years were included. At a median of 19 (i.q.r. 10-33) months after donation, 82 donors (24·6 per cent) had a CCS score above 0, of which 58 (71 per cent) had a CCS score of at least 2 and 57 (70 per cent) reported movement limitations. Some 110 donors (33·0 per cent) had a VAS score of more than 0. Complaints mainly occurred during bending over (12·3 per cent) and exercising (12·4 per cent). Thirty-two donors (9·7 per cent) required analgesics during follow-up between donation and the time of measurement, and six of 82 (7 per cent) reported chronic inguinal pain. In multivariable analysis, donor age (odds ratio (OR) 0·97, 95 per cent c.i. 0·95 to 0·99; P = 0·020) and length of hospital stay (OR 1·21, 1·01 to 1·51; P = 0·041) were independently associated with chronic pain. CONCLUSION One-quarter of donors experienced chronic postdonation pain or discomfort, most of which was bothersome.

It is imperative to prepare for local and national disasters by increasing public knowledge on how to control bleeding, and this preparation should extend to both adults and children. The purpose of this study is to describe a training effort to teach basic hemorrhage control techniques to early adolescent children. METHODS The trauma and emergency departments at a combined level I adult and level II pediatric trauma center piloted a training initiative with early adolescents (grades 6-8) focused on 2 skills: packing a wound and holding direct pressure, and applying a Combat Application Tourniquet. Students were evaluated on each skill and completed presurveys and postsurveys indicating their likelihood to use the skills. RESULTS Of the 194 adolescents who participated in the trainings, 97% of the students could successfully pack a wound and hold pressure, and 97% of the students could apply a tourniquet. Before the training, 71% of the adolescents indicated that they would take action to assist a bleeding victim; this increased to 96% after the training. CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrate that basic hemorrhage control skills can be effectively taught to adolescents as young as 6th grade (ages 11-12 years) in a small setting with age-appropriate content and hands-on opportunities to practice the skills and such training increases students' perceived willingness to take action to assist a bleeding victim.","Sidwell, Richard A; Spilman, Sarah K; Feist, Brian; Fuchsen, Elizabeth A; Taber, Philip S; Pelaez, Carlos A",Pediatric emergency care,385,1

Recent data suggest that these patients have significant competing risks of death, some of which may be increased by chronic renal insufficiency. Therefore, we compared overall survival, cancer specific survival and cardiac specific survival in patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy for cT1b tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 1999 to 2006, 1,004 patients with renal masses between 4 and 7 cm underwent extirpative surgery, partial nephrectomy (524) or radical nephrectomy (480). We generated a propensity model based on preoperative patient characteristics, and then modeled survival with the additional variables of pathological stage and new baseline renal function. RESULTS On multivariate analysis cancer specific survival was equivalent for patients treated with partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy. Those patients undergoing radical nephrectomy lost significantly more renal function than those undergoing partial nephrectomy. The average excess loss of renal function observed with radical nephrectomy was associated with a 25% (95% CI 3-73) increased risk of cardiac death and 17% (95% CI 12-27) increased risk of death from any cause on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Partial nephrectomy offers cancer specific survival equivalent to that of radical nephrectomy and is technically feasible in at least 50% of patients with cT1b tumors. Preservation of renal function was significantly better in patients treated with partial nephrectomy. Postoperative renal insufficiency was a significant independent predictor of overall and cardiovascular specific survival, and efforts should be made to limit the renal function loss associated with surgery for localized renal masses.","Weight, Christopher J; Larson, Benjamin T; Fergany, Amr F; Gao, Tianming; Lane, Brian R; Campbell, Steven C; Kaouk, Jihad H; Klein, Eric A; Novick, Andrew C",The Journal of urology,385,7

This prospective study was performed to assess this technique in ruptured AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-one consecutive patients with ruptured brain AVMs who underwent transvenous embolization were prospectively followed between November 2016 and November 2018. The Spetzler-Martin grade was I in 3 AVMs (14.3%), II in four (19.0%), III in eleven (52.4%), and IV in three (14.3%). The complete AVM occlusion rate was calculated from 6-month follow-up DSA images. Occurrence of hemorrhage and infarction after embolization was evaluated using CT and MR imaging within 1 month after the operation. The mRS was used to assess the functional outcomes. RESULTS Complete AVM nidus obliteration was shown in 16 (84%) of 19 patients with technically feasible AVMs immediately after embolization. One (5%) patient with a small residual nidus after treatment showed complete obliteration at 13-month follow-up. There were 5 hemorrhages and 1 infarction; 4 patients' symptoms improved gradually. The percentage of cases with mRS ≤ 2 rose from 57.1% (12/21) before embolization to 66.7% (14/21) at 1-month follow-up. Both the morbidity and mortality rates were 4.8% (1/21). CONCLUSIONS Transvenous embolization can be performed only in highly selected hemorrhagic brain AVMs with high complete obliteration rates, improved functional outcomes, and acceptable morbidity and mortality rates, but it should not be considered as a first-line treatment.","He, Y; Ding, Y; Bai, W; Li, T; Hui, F K; Jiang, W-J; Xue, J",AJNR.

Unnecessary transfers overload trauma centers, occupy emergency transfer resources, and delay definitive patient care. Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) trauma, especially in isolation, is a frequent culprit. Objective The aim of this study is to assess the perspectives of facial trauma surgeons regarding the interfacility transfer of patients with isolated CMF trauma. Methods A 31-item survey was developed using Likert-type scale and open-ended response systems. Internal consistency testing among facial trauma surgeons yielded a Cronbach's α calculation of .75. The survey was distributed anonymously to the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons, the North American Division of AO Craniomaxillofacial, and the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Statistical significance in response plurality was determined by nonoverlapping 99.9% confidence intervals (P < .001). Sum totals were reported as means with standard deviations and z scores with P values of less than .05 considered significant. Results The survey yielded 196 responses. Seventy-seven percent of respondents did not believe that most isolated CMF transfers required emergency surgery and roughly half (49%) thought that most emergency transfers were unnecessary. Fifty-four percent of respondents agreed that most patients transferred could have been referred for outpatient management and 87% thought that transfer guidelines could help decrease unnecessary transfers. Twenty-seven percent of respondents had no pre-transfer communication with the referring facility. Perspectives on the transfer of specific fracture patterns and their presentations were also collected. Conclusion Most facial trauma surgeons in this study believe that emergent transfer for isolated CMF trauma is frequently unnecessary. Such injuries rarely require emergent surgery and can frequently be managed in the outpatient setting without activating emergency transfer services. The fracture-specific data collected are a representation of the national, multidisciplinary opinion of facial trauma surgeons and correlate with previously published data on which specific types of facial fractures are most often transferred unnecessarily. The results of this study can serve as the foundation for interfacility transfer guidelines, which may provide a valuable resource in triaging transfers and decreasing associated health-care costs.","Pontell, Matthew; Mount, Delora; Steinberg, Jordan P; Mackay, Donald; Golinko, Michael; Drolet, Brian C",Craniomaxillofacial trauma & reconstruction,385,1

Direct viral entry as well as systemic mechanisms such as cytokine storm are thought to contribute to neuroinflammation in these patients. Biomarkers of COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment are currently lacking, but there is some limited evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could preferentially target the frontal lobes, as suggested by behavioral and dysexecutive symptoms, fronto-temporal hypoperfusion on MRI, EEG slowing in frontal regions, and frontal hypometabolism on 18F-FDG-PET. Possible confounders include cognitive impairment due to hypoxia and mechanical ventilation and post-traumatic stress disorder. Conversely, patients already suffering from dementia, as well as their caregivers, have been greatly impacted by the disruption of their care caused by COVID-19. Patients with dementia have experienced worsening of cognitive, behavioral, and psychological symptoms, and the rate of COVID-19-related deaths is disproportionately high among cognitively impaired people. Multiple factors, such as difficulties in remembering and executing safeguarding procedures, age, comorbidities, residing in care homes, and poorer access to hospital standard of care play a role in the increased morbidity and mortality. Non-pharmacological interventions and new technologies have shown a potential for the management of patients with dementia, and for the support of their caregivers.","Toniolo, Sofia; Scarioni, Marta; Di Lorenzo, Francesco; Hort, Jakub; Georges, Jean; Tomic, Svetlana; Nobili, Flavio; Frederiksen, Kristian Steen",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,385,28

This review seeks to shed more light on the workings of the Nlrp3 inflammasome, which is an intracellular innate immunity pattern recognition receptor and sensor of changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment, and focus on its role in hematopoieisis. RECENT FINDINGS Hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) are exposed to several external mediators of innate immunity. Moreover, since hemato/lymphopoietic cells develop from a common stem cell, their behavior and fate are coregulated by intracellular innate immunity pathways. Therefore, the Nlrp3 inflammasome is functional both in immune cells and in HSPCs and affects hematopoiesis in either a positive or negative way, depending on its activity level. Specifically, while a physiological level of activation regulates the trafficking of HSPCs and most likely maintains their pool in the bone marrow, hyperactivation may lead to irreversible cell damage by pyroptosis and HSPC senescence and contribute to the origination of myelodysplasia and hematopoietic malignancies. SUMMARY Modulation of the level of Nrp3 inflammasome activation will enable improvements in HSPC mobilization, homing, and engraftment strategies. It may also control pathological activation of this protein complex during HSPC senescence, graft-versus-host disease, the induction of cytokine storms, and the development of hematopoietic malignancies.","Ratajczak, Mariusz Z; Kucia, Magdalena",Current opinion in hematology,385,1

The disease, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily known as a respiratory tract infection. Although SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multi-system disease with varying degrees of severity and affects several human systems including the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, hematopoietic, and immune systems. From the existing data, most COVID-19 cases develop a mild disease typically presented with fever and respiratory illness. However, in some patients, clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 might progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction, and septic shock resulting in a critical condition. Likewise, specific organ dysfunction seems to be related to the disease complication, worsens the condition, and increases the lethality of COVID-19. The neurological manifestations in association with disease severity and mortality have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Despite the continuously increasing reports of the neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, our knowledge about the possible routes of nervous system involvement associated with COVID-19 is limited. Herein, we will primarily describe the critical aspects and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 related to nervous system impairment and then discuss possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 nervous system involvement based on the current evidence.","Norouzi, Mahnaz; Miar, Paniz; Norouzi, Shaghayegh; Nikpour, Parvaneh",Molecular neurobiology,385,1

Schultheiss, Martin G. Köllner, Holger Busch and Jan Hofer (Neuropsychology, 2021[Mar], Vol 35[3], 323-333). In the original article, there was an error in Table 1. The df for ""18-50 years (adult men and premenopausal women),"" originally read ""1, 17,"" but should have read ""1, 71."" The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-71595-001). Objective: Despite evidence for an estradiol-linked sex difference in verbal fluency favoring women, recent reviews question this difference. We therefore examined the issue based on a narrative task that we have administered to different populations for over 20 years. Method: We meta-analyzed 98 studies (N = 11,528) conducted by our laboratories and that featured measures of biological sex and storytelling. We ran primary-data analyses (N = 797) on an overlapping subset of these studies that also included salivary hormone and digit ratio measures. Results: Women told longer stories than men, d = 0.31, 95% CI [0.24, 0.38], an effect that did not vary by geographic region but was moderated by cue type (verbal: d = 0.57, [0.44, 0.71]; pictures: d = 0.29, [0.22, 0.36]), response modality (oral: d = -0.04, [-0.18, 0.09]; handwriting: d = 0.39, [0.31, 0.47]; typing: d = 0.31, [0.21, 0.42]), and age (prepubertal children: d = 0.13, [-0.04, 0.30]; pubescents: d = 0.48, [0.23, 0.74]; premenopausal adults: d = 0.36, [0.29, 0.42]; postmenopausal adults: d = -0.09, [-0.35, 0.16]). Consistent with the age effect, estradiol, a sex-dimorphic hormone during the reproductive life stage, was a specific mediator of the sex difference in narrative-writing fluency. This mediation effect was moderated by prenatal hormone exposure, estimated via digit ratio. Conclusions: When verbal fluency is assessed through narrative writing, a robust female advantage becomes evident. It is associated with the reproductive life stage and variations in current estradiol concentrations, particularly in individuals prenatally exposed to relatively more estradiol than testosterone.

To better target antimicrobial therapy, control and prevention towards the involved pathogens, there is a growing interest in microbiological tests on respiratory samples. However, these tests are time consuming, cost money and sampling might compromise animal welfare. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to develop immediately applicable decision trees for pathogen identification in outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease based on circumstantial factors. Data from a cross sectional study, involving 201 outbreaks of bovine respiratory disease in dairy and beef farms between 2016 and 2019 was used. Pathogens were identified by a semi-quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on a pooled non-endoscopic broncho-alveolar lavage sample from clinically affected animals. Potential risk factors of involved animals, environment, management and housing were obtained by enquiry. Classification and regression tree analysis was used for decision tree development with cross-validation. Different trees were constructed, involving a general 3-group classification tree (viruses, Mycoplasma bovis or Pasteurellaceae family) and a tree for each single pathogen. The general 3- group classification tree was 52.7 % accurate and had a sensitivity of 81.5 % and a specificity 52.2 % for viruses, respectively 51.7 % and 84.4 % for M. bovis and 28.9 % and 93.6 % for Pasteurellaceae. The single-pathogen trees were more specific than sensitive: Histophilus somni (Se = 25.8 %; Sp = 94.5 %), Mannheimia haemolytica (Se = 69.2 %; Sp = 70.6 %), bovine coronavirus (Se = 42.2 %; Sp = 89.6 %) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Se = 34.0 %; Sp = 96.6 %). For Pasteurella multocida, M. bovis and parainfluenzavirus type 3 no meaningful tree was obtained. The concept and trees are promising, but currently lack sensitivity and specificity in order to be a reliable tool for practice. For now, the obtained trees can already be informative for decision making to some extend depending on the end node in which an outbreak falls.","Lowie, T; Callens, J; Maris, J; Ribbens, S; Pardon, B",Preventive veterinary medicine,385,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS From February 1 to December 31, 2020, all tweets with a #Radiology hashtag were identified using the healthcare social media analytics tool, Symplur Signals. Data collected included number of tweets, retweets, impressions, links, and user characteristics. Data were stratified by the presence of a COVID-19-related keyword, and a social media network analysis was further performed. RESULTS Of the 68,172 tweets, 10,093 contained COVID-19 content from 2809 users generating 65,513,669 impressions. More tweets with COVID-19 content contained links than without (P < 0.01). Network analysis demonstrated most users were physicians (48.10%), authoring the most tweets (40.38%), using the most mentions (32.15%), and retweeting the most (51.45%). The most impressions, however, were by healthcare organizations not providing clinical care (20,235,547 impressions, 30.89%). Users came from 80 countries, most from the United States (29.3%) and the United Kingdom (8.69%). During early March, COVID-19 dominated the #Radiology conversation, making up 54.67% of tweets the week of March 14 and 64.74% of impressions the week of March 21 compared to 13.97% of tweets and 16.76% of impressions in the remainder of the study period (P < 0.01).There was an influx of new users to the #Radiology conversation during this time period with more users tweeting about COVID-19 than not (P < 0.01).

As a result, most clinicians now have experience with telemedicine. Questions/Purposes: We studied factors independently associated with a clinician desiring to continue telemedicine services after the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondarily, we sought factors independently associated with clinician satisfaction with the quality of care provided through telemedicine and factors associated with telemedicine platform preference by clinicians. Methods: A large multispecialty medical group of physicians were invited to complete a survey, including demographics, telemedicine experience, satisfaction with various elements of telemedicine encounters, desired features in a telemedicine platform, personality traits, and preferences. A total of 220 complete responses were analyzed. Results: A desire to continue offering telemedicine visits after the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with a higher satisfaction with the quality of telemedicine care, endorsement of the ease of performing a physical examination with telemedicine, belief that adaptability is an important element of being a clinician, and less preference for in-person work meetings over virtual meetings. Higher satisfaction with the quality of telemedicine care was associated with belief that adaptability is an important element of being a clinician, clinicians who identify as being more perceiving (value flexibility) than judging (value organization), providers from relatively urban counties, and those with less preference for in-person work meetings over virtual meetings. Clinicians ranked ease of use for patients and physicians as the most important features of telemedicine platforms. Conclusions: The observed association of clinician personality and interpersonal preferences with the appeal, satisfaction, and perceived effectiveness of telemedicine merit additional study. Early implementation of telemedicine might be easiest with clinicians that take pride in their adaptability and value a technology-based workstyle.","Miner, Harrison; Fatehi, Amirreza; Ring, David; Reichenberg, Jason S",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,385,17

Our objective was to determine if county of residence or neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics were associated with treatment for CaP in New York City (NYC). MATERIALS AND METHODS We used the NYSPACED database to identify men aged 40 to 80 years with localized CaP in NYC between 2004 and 2016. We categorized patients into receiving either aggressive local therapy (ALT) or non-aggressive treatment (NT). We identified borough of residence through NYSPACED and used Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) designation to define neighborhood characteristics using United States Census data. We hypothesized that differences exist in use of ALT according to county of residence and neighborhood characteristics. We used multivariable logistic regression to test the association between county of residence and ALT as well as between ALT and PUMA characteristics. RESULTS Our cohort included 40,668 patients. Overall, 80% had ALT, and 21% had NT. NT use increased over time from 16% in 2004 to 32% in 2016 (P < .001). On multivariable logistic regression, patients in Manhattan were less likely to receive ALT compared with those in other boroughs (P < .001). PUMAs with lower education attainment, larger foreign-born populations, lower crime rate, and higher median income were significantly associated with receipt of ALT (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS We observed significant differences in use of treatment for men with newly diagnosed CaP in NYC. The ability to receive this treatment was associated with borough of residence as well as neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. Additional research is required to identify barriers in access to NT within NYC.","Smigelski, Michael; Wallace, Brendan K; Lu, Jun; Li, Gen; Anderson, Christopher B",Clinical genitourinary cancer,385,23

We show that this RNase L-dependent decay selectively affects transcripts regulated by microRNA (miR)-17/miR-29/miR-200 and other miRs that function as suppressors of mammalian cell adhesion and proliferation. RNase L mimics the effects of these miRs and acts as a suppressor of proliferation and adhesion in mammalian cells.

The lower rectum was transected, and retroperitoneal dissection was performed transanally using flexible endoscopic equipment to achieve high ligation of the caudal mesenteric vessels. After rectal resection, hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis was performed. DISCUSSION Both swine had good postoperative outcomes, and the postoperative period was captured on video.

Because meaning and purpose are often threatened by a cancer diagnosis and treatment, interventions have been developed to promote meaning and purpose. The present meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated effects of psychosocial interventions on meaning/purpose in adults with cancer and tested potential moderators of intervention effects. Six literature databases were systematically searched to identify RCTs of psychosocial interventions in which meaning or purpose was an outcome. Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, rater pairs extracted and evaluated data for quality. Findings were synthesized across studies with standard meta-analytic methods, including meta-regression with robust variance estimation and risk-of-bias sensitivity analysis. Twenty-nine RCTs were identified, and they encompassed 82 treatment effects among 2305 patients/survivors. Psychosocial interventions were associated with significant improvements in meaning/purpose (g = 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22-0.52; P < .0001). Interventions designed to enhance meaning/purpose (g = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24-0.60) demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes than those targeting other primary outcomes (g = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09-0.27; P = .009). Few other intervention, clinical, or demographic characteristics tested were significant moderators. In conclusion, the results suggest that psychosocial interventions are associated with small to medium effects in enhancing meaning/purpose among patients with cancer, and the benefits are comparable to those of interventions designed to reduce depression, pain, and fatigue in patients with cancer. Methodological concerns include small samples and ambiguity regarding allocation concealment. Future research should focus on explicitly meaning-centered interventions and identify optimal treatment or survivorship phases for implementation.","Park, Crystal L; Pustejovsky, James E; Trevino, Kelly; Sherman, Allen C; Esposito, Craig; Berendsen, Mark; Salsman, John M",Cancer,385,5

Methods From 2012 to 2016, we conducted a study at two sites in Kandal and Battambang provinces where fruit bats (Pteropus lylei) roost. We combined research on: bat ecology (reproductive phenology, population dynamics and diet); human practices and perceptions (ethnographic research and a knowledge, attitude and practice study); and Nipah virus circulation in bat and human populations (virus monitoring in bat urine and anti-Nipah-virus antibody detection in human serum). Findings Our results confirmed circulation of Nipah virus in fruit bats (28 of 3930 urine samples positive by polymerase chain reaction testing). We identified clear potential routes for virus transmission to humans through local practices, including fruit consumed by bats and harvested by humans when Nipah virus is circulating, and palm juice production. Nevertheless, in the serological survey of 418 potentially exposed people, none of them were seropositive to Nipah virus. Differences in agricultural practices among the regions where Nipah virus has emerged may explain the situation in Cambodia and point to actions to limit the risks of virus transmission to humans. Conclusion Human practices are key to understanding transmission risks associated with emerging infectious diseases. Social science disciplines such as anthropology need to be integrated in health programmes targeting emerging infectious diseases. As bats are hosts of major zoonotic pathogens, such integrated studies would likely also help to reduce the risk of emergence of other bat-borne diseases.","Cappelle, Julien; Hoem, Thavry; Hul, Vibol; Furey, Neil; Nguon, Kunthy; Prigent, Steven; Dupon, Liane; Ken, Sreymom; Neung, Chhoeuth; Hok, Visal; Pring, Long; Lim, Thona; Bumrungsri, Sara; Duboz, Raphaël; Buchy, Philippe; Ly, Sowath; Duong, Veasna; Tarantola, Arnaud; Binot, Aurélie; Dussart, Philippe",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,385,19

A cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, and assessed inpatients under investigation for SARI by the hospital epidemiology department, and all patients who had nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from January 2012 to December 2013 to detect respiratory viruses (RVs). Viral infection was detected by multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with primers specific to the subtypes HCoV-229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1. The overall positivity rate was 58.8% (444/755), and HCoVs were detected in 7.6% (n = 34) of positive samples. Children below two years of age were most frequently affected (62%). Comorbidities were more likely to be associated with HCoVs than with other RVs. Immunosuppression was an independent risk factor for HCoV infection (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.6-7.6). Dyspnea was less frequently associated with HCoV infection (p < 0.001), and HCoV accounted for 6% of the SARI cases. Three patients infected with HCoV (9%) died from respiratory infection. HCoVs are important respiratory pathogens, especially in hospitalized children under 2 years of age and in immunosuppressed patients. They may account for a small proportion of SARI diagnoses, increased need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death.","Trombetta, Hygor; Faggion, Heloisa Z; Leotte, Jaqueline; Nogueira, Meri B; Vidal, Luine R R; Raboni, Sonia M",Pathogens and global health,385,11

This hampers measurement of interbeat intervals (IBIs) and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ). Our objective was to develop a generic algorithm to remove periodic motion artifacts, recovering artifact-reduced PPG signals for beat-to-beat analysis. METHODS The algorithm was retrospectively evaluated on forehead PPG signals measured while walking on a treadmill. The step rate was tracked in a motion reference signal via a second-order generalized integrator with a frequency-locked loop. Two reference signals were compared: sensor motion relative to the skin ( ∆x[n]) measured via self-mixing interferometry and head motion ( av[n] ) measured via accelerometry. The step rate was used in a quadrature harmonic model to estimate the artifacts. Quadrature components need only two coefficients per frequency leading to a short filter and prevent undesired frequency-shifted components in the artifact estimate. Subtracting the estimate from the measured signal reduced the artifacts. RESULTS Compared to ∆x[n] , av[n] had a better signal-to-noise ratio and more consistently contained a component at the step rate. Artifact reduction was effective for distinct step rate and pulse rate, since the artifact-reduced signals provided more stable IBI and SpO 2 measurements. CONCLUSION Accelerometry provided a more reliable motion reference signal. The proposed algorithm can be of significance for monitoring in ADL, CPX, or CPR, by providing artifact-reduced PPG signals for improved IBI and SpO 2 measurements during periodic motion.","Wijshoff, Ralph W C G R; Mischi, Massimo; Aarts, Ronald M",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,385,1

This rapid pandemic may overwhelm health care capacity and shortage of resources is a major concern. Literature provided guidelines on management of COVID-19 patients but healthcare service to the normal population should be continued meanwhile. Health system should act immediately and wisely to support essential surgical care while fighting against COVID-19. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in the major data bases since 2020, using the combination of MeSH words of ""COVID-19 "" and ""surgery"" and finally 34 full texts entered to data extraction phase to define a plan for surgical practice during COVID-19 pandemic. Results Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early stage of outbreak when they were not aware of the different aspects of COVID-19 pandemic. All healthcare staff must be trained to properly use PPE. All patients have to be screened at the hospital triage. All elective surgical interventions must be postponed. Operation room is considered as a place with high risk of cross infection so the highest level of protection should be maintained. Anesthesia, endoscopy and oral surgery are considered as aerosol producing procedures with very high risk of contamination. There is not any evidence to support the risk of infection trough blood products. Postoperative respiratory problems are more common among COVID-19 patients that may increases the estimated risk of morbidity and mortality. Conclusion COVID-19 pandemic is a dynamic challenge for health system to save the healthcare staff and equipment resources by timely decisions. Healthcare workers are at the higher risk of contamination by COVID-19 especially in early phase of epidemic when the protection is sub-optimal.","Abdi, Reza; Shojaeian, Reza; Hajian, Sara; Sheikh, Shahrzad",The archives of bone and joint surgery,385,1

The possibility that the sequence around the signal-anchor is a factor for identifying each localization group was evaluated. The discrimination accuracy between the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane-localized type II membrane proteins was as high as 90%, indicating that, in addition to other factors, the sequence around signal-anchor is an essential component of the selection mechanism for the Golgi and plasma membrane localization.

The outcomes of anterior versus posterior circulation thrombectomy for LVOs were compared at a high volume center employing a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT). METHODS We retrospectively studied a database of AIS cases that underwent ADAPT thrombectomy for LVOs. Cases were grouped by anatomical location of thrombectomy (posterior vs anterior circulation), and analysis was performed on both entire sample size. RESULTS A total of 436 AIS patients (50.2% women, mean age 67.3 years) underwent ADAPT thrombectomy for LVO during the study period, of whom 13% of had posterior circulation thrombectomy. Patients with posterior circulation thrombectomy did not show a significant difference in preprocedural variables, including age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and onset to groin time, compared with anterior circulation (P>0.05). There were also no differences in procedural variables between the two groups. Patients in the posterior group were found to have a similar likelihood of good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) at 90 days compared with the anterior group (42.9% vs 43.2%, respectively), and a small but not significant increase in mortality at 90 days. Multilogistic regression analysis showed that the anatomical location (anterior vs posterior) was not an independent predictor of good outcome or mortality after thrombectomy. Prominent predictors of outcome/mortality included age, female gender, procedure time, and baseline NIHSS. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that when patients are carefully selected for thrombectomy, those with posterior circulation LVOs can achieve similar outcomes compared with anterior circulation thrombectomy, indicating comparable safety and efficacy profiles.","Alawieh, Ali; Vargas, Jan; Turner, Raymond D; Turk, Aquilla S; Chaudry, M Imran; Lena, Jonathan; Spiotta, Alejandro",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,385,11

Inflexible responding is observed early in the course of the illness and contributes to the financial and social morbidities of FTD. Reversal learning is an established cognitive paradigm that indexes flexible responding in the face of feedback signaling a change in reinforcement contingencies, with components of reversal learning associated with specific neurotransmitter systems. The objective of the study was to evaluate the neural mechanisms underlying impaired flexible behavioural responding in FTD using a reversal learning paradigm combined with fMRI. METHODS Twenty-two patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for FTD and twenty-one healthy controls completed the study. Participants completed an fMRI-adapted reversal learning task that indexes behavioural flexibility when provided positive and negative feedback. RESULTS Patients with FTD demonstrated poorer behavioural flexibility relative to controls and abnormal BOLD responses within the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to incorrect responses made during the learning phase, and during correct responses when reward contingencies were reversed. As well, patients showed decreased activity within the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex to incorrect responses compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that reversal learning impairments in patients with FTD, in particular those with frontal predominant atrophy, may be related to impaired flexible motor responding when selecting among several choices and deficient attention to relevant stimuli during instances of conflict (i.e., receiving negative feedback). These results and the associated neurotransmitter systems mediating these regions may provide targets for future pharmacological or behavioural interventions mediating these cognitive deficits.","Tavares, Tamara P; Mitchell, Derek G V; Coleman, Kristy K L; Finger, Elizabeth",Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,385,1

In this study, we show in a mouse model of Ehrlichia muris that type 1 T follicular helper (TFH1) cells provide help to CD11c+ T-bet+ B cells via the dual secretion of IL-21 and IFN-γ in a CD40/CD40L-dependent manner. TFH1 cell help was delivered in two phases: IFN-γ signals were provided early in infection, whereas CD40/CD40L help was provided late in infection. In contrast to T-bet+ T cells, T-bet+ B cells did not develop in the absence of B cell-intrinsic Bcl-6 but were generated in the absence of T-bet. T-bet-deficient memory B cells were largely indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts, although they no longer underwent switching to IgG2c. These data suggest that a primary function of T-bet in B cells during ehrlichial infection is to promote appropriate class switching, not lineage specification. Thus, CD11c+ memory B cells develop normally without T-bet but require Bcl-6 and specialized help from dual cytokine-producing TFH1 cells.","Levack, Russell C; Newell, Krista L; Popescu, Maria; Cabrera-Martinez, Berenice; Winslow, Gary M",Journal of immunology,385,5

However, a subset of patients fail to benefit from thrombectomy procedures, the reasons for which remain poorly defined. In this study, we investigated whether the effectiveness of thrombectomy was affected by left- or right-sided occlusion among patients with similar stroke severities. Methods: Patients with proximal anterior circulation occlusion (internal carotid or M1 of middle cerebral artery) treated with the Solitaire stent retriever within 8 h of the onset of acute ischemic stroke were enrolled from the Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College. Stroke severity was measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission. The functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days. Results: We enrolled 174 patients including 90 left-sided occlusion and 84 right-sided occlusion. The NIHSS scores on admission were higher in the left-sided (median, 19; interquartile range, 16 to 20) compared to the right-sided occlusion group (median, 15, interquartile range, 13 to 18) (P < 0.001). Following adjustment for potential risk factors, patients with left-sided occlusion had higher rates of functional independence (mRS ≤ 2) and lower rates of mortality (mRS = 6) compared to the right-sided occlusion patients (39.5 vs. 19.6% and 28.9 vs. 47.8%, respectively) in the severe stroke group (NIHSS ≥ 15). Conclusions: In severe stroke patients with proximal anterior circulation occlusion, stent retriever thrombectomy within 8 h of the onset of symptoms provides more benefits to left-sided occlusion.","Li, Zibao; Chu, Zhaohu; Zhao, Shoucai; Ma, Lingsong; Yang, Qian; Huang, Xianjun; Zhou, Zhiming",Frontiers in neurology,385,11

As with other infectious diseases, in recent years there has been a marked increase in resistance to the antibiotics commonly used against the pathogens that cause CAP. Antimicrobial stewardship denotes coordinated interventions to improve and measure the appropriate use of antibiotics by encouraging the selection of optimal drug regimens. Areas covered: Several elements can be applied to antibiotic stewardship strategies for CAP in order to maintain or improve patient outcomes. In this regard, antibiotic de-escalation, duration of antibiotic treatment, adherence to CAP guidelines recommendations about empirical treatment, and switching from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy may each be relevant in this context. Antimicrobial stewardship strategies, such as prospective audit with intervention and feedback, clinical pathways, and dedicated multidisciplinary teams, that have included some of these elements have demonstrated improvements in antimicrobial use for CAP without negatively affecting clinical outcomes. Expert commentary: Although there are a limited number of randomized clinical studies addressing antimicrobial stewardship strategies in CAP, there is evidence that antibiotic stewardship initiatives can be securely applied, providing benefits to both healthcare systems and patients.","Viasus, Diego; Vecino-Moreno, Milly; De La Hoz, Juan M; Carratalà, Jordi",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,385,16

METHODS We analyzed clinic records from 2010 to 2019. Prais-Winsten analyses were performed, and the average annual percentages change (AAPC) for amalgam and composite was estimated. RESULTS There were 397,013 procedures, including 80,995 direct posterior restorations. Amalgam use decreased from 12.9% in 2010 to 0.5% in 2019 among students, while composite use has increased from 87.1% to 99.5% of posterior restorations. The annual increase of composite was 1.4% per year for students, while amalgam decreased by 30.2% per year on average. A similar trend was noted among the dentists.

Dose increase depends on uptake yield and emission characteristics of radioisotopes. We used an in vitro model to compare the impact of cellular uptake of (188)Re-perrhenate and (99m)Tc-pertechnetate on cellular survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rat thyroid PC Cl3 cells in culture were incubated with (188)Re or (99m)Tc in the presence or absence of perchlorate for 1 hour. Clonogenic cell survival was measured by colony formation. In addition, intracellular radionuclide uptake was quantified. RESULTS Dose effect curves were established for (188)Re and (99m)Tc for various extra- and intracellular distributions of the radioactivity. In the presence of perchlorate, no uptake of radionuclides was detected and (188)Re reduced cell survival more efficiently than (99m)Tc. A(37), the activity that is necessary to yield 37% cell survival was 14 MBq/ml for (188)Re and 480 MBq/ml for (99m)Tc. In the absence of perchlorate, both radionuclides showed similar uptakes; however, A(37) was reduced by 30% for the beta-emitter and by 95% for (99m)Tc. The dose D(37) that yields 37% cell survival was between 2.3 and 2.8 Gy for both radionuclides. CONCLUSIONS Uptake of (188)Re and (99m)Tc decreased cell survival. Intracellular (99m)Tc yielded a dose increase that was higher compared to (188)Re due to emitted Auger and internal conversion-electrons. Up to 5 Gy there was no difference in radiotoxicity of (188)Re and (99m)Tc. At doses higher than 5 Gy intracellular (99m)Tc became less radiotoxic than (188)Re, probably due to a non-uniform lognormal radionuclide uptake.","Freudenberg, Robert; Wendisch, Maria; Runge, Roswitha; Wunderlich, Gerd; Kotzerke, Jörg",International journal of radiation biology,385,17

PURPOSE We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid artery stent placement and analyzed outcomes of standard-versus-selective poststent angioplasty. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Web of Science was performed for studies published between January 2000 and January 2015. STUDY SELECTION We included studies with >30 patients describing standard or selective poststent angioplasty during carotid artery stent placement. DATA ANALYSIS A random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following outcomes: periprocedural stroke/TIA, procedure-related neurologic/cardiovascular morbidity/mortality, bradycardia/hypotension, long-term stroke at last follow-up, long-term primary patency, and technical success.

Older adults living in long-term care centers have access to healthcare resources in their residence, and several programs have been created with the intent of treating medical conditions on-site. The aim of this study is to identify and systematically review programs and interventions at long-term care centers that aim to treat patients on-site, avoiding unscheduled transportation to the emergency department. METHODS We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We will perform a comprehensive search of Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov , PROSPERO, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials using a broad search strategy. Two independent reviewers will assess titles and abstracts against inclusion criteria, and we will further evaluate relevant full-text articles for inclusion. We will assess the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for included non-randomized studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials. We will present a narrative synthesis of results and complete a meta-analysis only if enough homogeneity is found. We will create funnel plots to evaluate possible reporting bias and use The Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to assess the confidence in cumulative evidence. DISCUSSION As pressure on the healthcare system continues to rise, many areas are looking for alternative models of care. Several programs have been put in place in long-term care centers that seek to avoid transportation to the emergency department by providing enhanced care on-site. These programs are quite variable, and, to date, there is no standardized program or model of care.

Given its high metal surface area coverage, there is concern for the patency of branch vessels that become covered by the device. Limited data exist regarding the patency of branch vessels adjacent to aneurysms that are covered by PEDs. The authors assessed the rate of intracranial internal carotid artery, anterior circulation branch vessel patency following PED placement at their institution. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 82 patients who underwent PED treatment between 2009 and 2014 and in whom the PED was identified to cover branch vessels. Patency of the anterior cerebral, posterior communicating, anterior choroidal, and ophthalmic arteries was evaluated using digital subtraction angiography preoperatively and postoperatively after PED deployment and at longer-term follow-up. RESULTS Of the 127 arterial branches covered by PEDs, there were no immediate postoperative occlusions. At angiographic follow-up (mean 10 months, range 3-34.7 months), arterial side branches were occluded in 13 (15.8%) of 82 aneurysm cases and included 2 anterior cerebral arteries, 8 ophthalmic arteries, and 3 posterior communicating arteries. No cases of anterior choroidal artery occlusion were observed. Patients with branch occlusion did not experience any neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS In this large series, the longer-term rate of radiographic side branch arterial occlusion after coverage by a flow diverter was 15.8%.

The impact of Pokémon GO on physical activity and related health outcomes.,20.57845,3.60371,2021,"The immune system is an evolutionary hallmark of higher organisms that defends the host against invading pathogens and exogenous infections. This defense includes the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection and the initiation of an inflammatory response to contain and eliminate pathogens. However, an inflammatory response may also be triggered by noninfectious stimuli such as major surgery, and, in case of an overshooting, still not comprehensively understood reaction, lead to tissue destruction and organ dysfunction. Unfortunately, in some cases, the immune system may not effectively distinguish between stimuli elicited by major surgery, which ideally should only require a modest inflammatory response, and those elicited by trauma or pathogenic infection. Surgical procedures thus represent a potential trigger for systemic inflammation that causes the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction, glycocalyx damage, activation of neutrophils, and ultimately tissue and multisystem organ destruction. In this review, we discuss and summarize currently available mechanistic knowledge on surgery-associated systemic inflammation, demarcation toward other inflammatory complications, and possible therapeutic options. These options depend on uncovering the underlying mechanisms and could include pharmacologic agents, remote ischemic preconditioning protocols, cytokine blockade or clearance, and optimization of surgical procedures, anesthetic regimens, and perioperative inflammatory diagnostic assessment. Currently, a large gap between basic science and clinically confirmed data exists due to a limited evidence base of translational studies. We thus summarize important steps toward the understanding of the precise time- and space-regulated processes in systemic perioperative inflammation.","Margraf, Andreas; Ludwig, Nadine; Zarbock, Alexander; Rossaint, Jan",Anesthesia and analgesia,385,17

The aim here is to clarify costs and benefits through an economic evaluation of the two therapy models. METHOD The cost-effectiveness analysis (cost per quality-adjusted life year; QALY) was derived from a single-centre (UK-based), two-arm randomised control trial. Data from 78 patients were available for the main analysis, which includes both an NHS cost perspective and a societal perspective which includes the cost of time off work and any additional private care. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken, which included patients only completing the four core therapy sessions (46 patients) and considering only patients taking both core and the additional therapy sessions which were optional (32 patients). RESULTS The base-case analysis, adopting an NHS perspective, showed that T-CBT was associated with an incremental cost of £50 (95% CI: -£759 to £989) and a 0.03 QALY (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.03) decrement per patient when compared to TAU-CBT. The analysis adopting a societal perspective yielded similar results, with T-CBT providing an incremental cost of £171 (95% CI: -£769 to £1,112) and a 0.03 QALY (95% CI: -0.08 to 0.03) decrement per patient in comparison to TAU-CBT. The first sensitivity analysis, considering patients only taking the core therapy sessions, showed that T-CBT provided an incremental cost of £100 (95% CI: -£945 to £1,247) and yielded a decrement of 0.01 QALY (95% CI: -0.03 to 0.01) per patient compared to TAU-CBT. The second sensitivity analysis, which focused solely on patients who also underwent optional sessions, showed that T-CBT was associated with an incremental cost of £17 (95% CI: -£1,307 to 1,454) and a 0.04 QALY (95% CI: -0.11 to 0.03 decrement per patient when compared to TAU-CBT. CONCLUSIONS Based on this single trial, T-CBT is not cost-effective as a therapy option for cancer patients with high psychological needs when compared to TAU-CBT.

Functional testing of the variants IFIH1 alleles demonstrated that the resulting proteins are unable to induce IFN-β, are intrinsically less stable than wild-type IFIH1, and lack ATPase activity. In vitro assays showed that IFIH1 effectively restricts replication of human respiratory syncytial virus and rhinoviruses.

As no effective treatment is known, prediction of disease severity is very important in order to estimate a patients outcome. Aim of this study was to evaluate routine hematology parameters in time after admission. METHODS Data from routine blood analyses from confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the University Hospital of Leuven in Belgium were collected. COVID-19 patients (n = 197) were assigned to three groups: a 'non-ICU' group, a 'ICU' group and a 'deceased' group. A control group of 60 Influenza A (non-COVID-19) patients was also included. The parameters evaluated were platelet count (PLT, 109/L), hemoglobin concentration (Hb, g/dL), leukocyte count (LEU, 109/L), neutrophil count (NEU, %), eosinophil count (EO, %), lymphocyte count (LYM, %) and monocyte count (MONO, %). RESULTS Deceased COVID-19 patients had significant lower platelet count, higher leukocyte/neutrophil count, and lower eosinophil/lymphocyte/monocyte count compared to recovered patients. Especially lymphocyte count showed important differences; they were significantly lower between day 9 and 12 after admission making this time window important in predicting clinical worsening of a patient. CONCLUSION Patients with COVID-19 with poor outcome showed significant differences in results of routine hematological parameters compared with patients that recovered. Especially lymphocyte count can be helpful in the prediction of a patients outcome.","Blomme, S; Smets, L; Van Ranst, M; Boeckx, N; Van Laer, C",Acta clinica Belgica,385,11

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 6,003 Italian adults aged 18-74 years, representative of the Italian general population. Study subjects were recruited at the time of the Nation-wide stay-at-home order (from April 27 to May 3, 2020). We identified characteristics associated to decreased frequency of sex during lockdown, differentiating between cohabiting and non-cohabiting subjects. RESULTS Over one third (35.3%) of Italians reported to have changed (8.4% increased and 26.9% decreased) their sexual activity during lockdown. When focusing on cohabitants (N=3,949, 65.8%), decreased sexual activity (20.7%) was more frequently reported by men (22.3%; compared to women, multivariable odds ratio=1.23; 95% confidence interval=1.05-1.44), younger (p for trend <0.001), more educated subjects (p for trend=0.004), subjects living in smaller houses (p for trend=0.003), and those reporting longer time spent outdoor before the lockdown (p for trend <0.001). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 lockdown drastically altered people's day-to-day life and is likely to have impacted on lifestyle habits and behavioral risk factors, including sexual attitudes and practice. This is the first national population-level study exploring changes in sexual life in this COVID-19 era. As we report sexual practice to have been affected by lockdown restrictions, we suggest these changes are to be explored beyond imposed social distancing, into mental health, social, and other determinants.","Amerio, Andrea; Lugo, Alessandra; Bosetti, Cristina; Fanucchi, Tiziana; Gorini, Giuseppe; Pacifici, Roberta; Odone, Anna; Gallus, Silvano",Journal of epidemiology,385,16

The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between the ICVH index and HRQoL in adolescents. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary analyses from the LabMed Physical Activity Study (n=407 adolescents, 53% girls). ICVH, as defined by the American Heart Association, was determined as meeting ideal behaviors (physical activity, body mass index, smoking status, and diet intake) and health factors (blood pressure, total glucose, and cholesterol). HRQoL was measured with the Kidscreen-10 self-report questionnaire. RESULTS Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a significant association between the accumulation of ideal cardiovascular health metrics and HRQoL (F(4,403)=4.160; p=0.003). In addition, the higher the number of ideal health behaviors accumulated, the higher the mean values of HRQoL (p-value for trend=0.001), after adjustments for age, sex, socioeconomic status and pubertal stage. CONCLUSIONS ICVH index was positively associated with HRQoL in adolescents.

Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) is commonly used for DVT prevention, however suffers from low compliance and issues of usability and portability. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been shown to improve lower limb hemodynamics but direct comparison with IPC in terms of hemodynamics is rare but very important to determine the potential effectiveness of NMES in DVT prevention.Lower limb IPC was compared to calf NMES, in 30 healthy volunteers (18-23 years). Each intervention was carried out on each leg, on the popliteal vein measured using Doppler ultrasound. All interventions produced significantly greater haemodynamic responses compared to baseline. Calf-IPC and NMES produced significant increases in venous blood velocity (cm/s) and volume of blood ejected per cycle (1 cycle of NMES expels 23.22 ml compared to the baseline ejected volume of 2.52 ml, measured over 1 s (p < 0.001 versues baseline).Improving lower limb hemodynamics is vital in preventing DVT. NMES resulted in larger ejected volumes compared to IPC (x3 greater than foot-IPC and x1.7 greater than calf-IPC) more effectively emptying the veins and soleal sinuses. This is an important finding as DVT occurs predominantly in the soleal sinuses. NMES is silent and portable and thus does not suffer many of the issues associated with IPC. This work supports the potential widespread application of NMES in hospital and home settings where the risk of DVT formation is high.","Broderick, Barry J; O'Connell, Sandra; Moloney, Shelly; O'Halloran, Kevin; Sheehan, James; Quondamatteo, Fabio; Quinlan, Leo R; OLaighin, Gearoid",Physiological measurement,385,1

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to systematically review and appraise evidence for palliative care needs, models of care, interventions, and outcomes in Greater China. METHODS Four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were searched, with hand searching of local journals and databases. Narrative synthesis was applied to the qualitative and quantitative evidence. RESULTS Nineteen qualitative studies and 47 quantitative studies were retained. With respect to care needs, nine themes were synthesised: pain control, reduced aggressive end-of-life care, truth telling, physical, emotional and spiritual support, and achieving preferred place of care/death. Informal caregivers expressed their needs for education and burden reduction. Healthcare professionals called for training and national policy support. Twenty-four studies evaluated interventions, mostly among advanced cancer patients. Positive effects were suggested for improvements in quality of life, pain, anxiety and depression, readmission rate, and costs. Models of care evaluated were mostly specialist palliative care delivered in various settings (hospitals, residential care and home). Outcome measures used were grouped into six categories of construct: quality of life, pain, physical assessment, psycho-spiritual assessment, quality of care, and implementation assessment. Limited rigorous randomised controlled trials is available to document intervention outcomes, and some problems (such as high attrition rates) reduced the strength of the evidence. CONCLUSION Palliative care services within Greater China should pay more attention to management of non-malignant disease, and to integration into primary services.

PD-L1 is the most commonly used biomarker to select benefiting groups, while not all patients with high PD-L1 expression benefit from immunotherapy. Therefore, identifying other prognostic and predictive biomarkers, including peripheral blood indexes, is essential. Methods We retrospectively collected medical records and hematological data of 151 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PD-1 inhibitor-based combination therapy in our hospital. The peripheral blood indexes of interest were NLR, PLR, PAR, Hb, LDH, CEA, and NSE. The association between peripheral blood indexes and treatment responses or survival outcomes was examined by multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression, respectively. Results The decreased CEA at week 6 (OR = 4.209, 95%CI: 1.287-13.758) or 12 (OR = 7.267, 95%CI: 1.508-35.006) post-treatment was related to a higher disease control rate.

The aim of this study was to explore the financial impact of a diagnosis of young onset dementia on individuals and families. An online survey, comprising binary yes/no, multiple-response and open-ended questions, was codesigned with people living with young onset dementia. The survey was promoted via networks and online platforms. Data were collected from August to October 2019. Survey respondents across the United Kingdom (n = 55) who had received a diagnosis of young onset dementia were aged between 45 and 64, were at different stages of dementia and had been diagnosed with thirteen different types of dementia. Of the 55 respondents, 71% (n = 39) had received assistance from family members when completing the survey. The main financial impact of a diagnosis of young onset dementia resulted from premature loss of income and reduced and often deferred pension entitlements. In some cases, care-costs became unaffordable. Lack of clarity of processes and procedures around needs assessments, carers' assessments and financial assessments by different organisations resulted in some families having to ask for legal advice and, in some cases, involved lengthy appeal processes.

METHODS In this study a retrospective cohort of 264 COVID-19 cases admitted at Macarena University was used for development and internal validation of a risk score to predict the occurrence of critical illness in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to derive the model, including clinical and laboratory variables predictive of critical illness. Internal validation of the final model used bootstrapped samples and the model scoring derived from the coefficients. External validation was performed in a cohort of 154 cases admitted at Valme and Virgen del Rocio University Hospital. RESULTS A total of 62 (23.5%) patients developed a critical illness during their hospitalization stay, 21 (8.0%) patients needed invasive ventilation, 34 (12.9%) were admitted at the ICU and the overall mortality was of 14.8% (39 cases). 5 variables were included in the final model: age >59.5 years (OR: 3.11;95%CI 1.39-6.97), abnormal CRP results (OR: 5.76;95%CI 2.32-14.30), abnormal lymphocytes count (OR: 3.252;95%CI 1.56-6.77), abnormal CK results (OR: 3.38;95%CI 1.59-7.20) and abnormal creatinine (OR: 3.30;95%CI 1.42-7.68).

The severity varies between studies, partly reflecting differences in study design where only severe cases from referral centers often are reported. The aim of this study was to prospectively study the clinical picture and etiology of acute encephalitis in childhood at a primary and tertiary pediatric hospital in Sweden. METHODS All children with acute encephalitis were prospectively included from 2011 to 2016. Laboratory tests, investigations and follow-up were performed according to standardized study protocols. RESULTS Eighty-nine children were included (46 female and 43 male) with a median age of 53 months. An etiology was established in 61/89. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, enterovirus and rotavirus dominated and 34% were caused by a virus preventable by vaccination. Immune-mediated encephalitis was seen in 7 children. An abnormal electroencephalography picture was seen in 77/86, pathological findings on neuroimaging in 13/49, and 38/89 children had seizures. Sequelae were reported by 49%. A high prevalence of previous contact with child and adolescent psychiatry was seen and, although not statistically significant, the need for extra support at school before encephalitis and the presence of central nervous system disease in the family seemed to predispose for a longer hospital stay. CONCLUSION Encephalitis is a condition with long-term consequences. Most children need admission to hospital, and many need surveillance in the intensive care unit. The etiology can be determined in a majority of cases, and 1/3 could have been prevented by vaccination. This study corroborates electroencephalography as a cornerstone in diagnosis.","Fowler, Åsa; Ygberg, Sofia; Svensson, Eva; Bergman, Kristian; Cooray, Gerald; Wickström, Ronny",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,385,16

Results The following new recommendations were made: 1) Influvac® Tetra may be considered as an option among the standard dose quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4-SD) offered to adults and children three years of age and older; 2) Fluzone High Dose Quadrivalent (IIV4-HD) may be considered an option for individuals 65 years of age and older who are currently recommended to receive Fluzone® High Dose (trivalent); and 3) Flucelvax® Quad may be considered amongst the quadrivalent influenza vaccines offered to adults and children nine years of age and older for annual influenza immunization. Guidance for use of influenza immunizations during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is also highlighted. Conclusion NACI continues to recommend that an age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be offered annually to anyone six months of age and older who does not have contraindications to the vaccine. Vaccination should be offered as a priority to people at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, people capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of complications, and others as indicated.",,Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,385,24

We examined the histological effects of mucosal ablation as a technique for closing bronchial stumps to prevent bronchial fistulae in an animal model. METHODS Left lower lobectomy was performed in beagles under general anesthesia. The bronchial stumps were closed using one of the following four methods: (A) manual suturing using 3-0 absorbable sutures, (B) ablation of bronchial mucosa with electric cautery and manual sutures, (C) stapling and reinforcement with manual sutures, or (D) ablation and stapling followed by reinforcement with manual sutures. Bronchial stumps were histologically evaluated on postoperative day 14. RESULTS No bronchial fistulae were noted in the animals during the observation period. Histologically, there were no adhesions between the bronchial mucosae at the suture and staple lesions in groups A and C. The bronchial mucosae were adherent at the ablation sites in groups B and D. Inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and neovascular vessels were abundant around the ablated lesions. CONCLUSIONS Bronchial mucosal ablation may play a key role in mucosal adhesion and tight union of the bronchial stump.","Makidono, Kimitaka; Miyata, Yoshihiro; Ikeda, Takuhiro; Tsutani, Yasuhiro; Kushitani, Kei; Takeshima, Yukio; Okada, Morihito",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,385,29

One factor that is being explored throughout patient care is the idea of diet and the role it has on patient outcomes. But the effects of diet following neurotrauma need to be carefully explored in animal models to ensure that they have beneficial effects. The ketogenic diet provides sufficient daily caloric requirements while being potentially neuroprotective and analgesic. In this study, animals were fed a high fat, low carbohydrate diet that led to a high concentration of blood ketone levels that was sustained for as long as the animals were on the diet. Mice fed a ketogenic diet had significantly lower levels of tyrosine and tryptophan but the levels of other monoamines within the spinal cord remained similar to control mice. Mice were fed a standard or ketogenic diet for 7 days before, and 28 days following the injury. Our results show that mice hemisected over the T10-11 vertebrae showed no beneficial effects of being on a ketogenic diet over a 28 day recovery period. Similarly, ligation of the common peroneal and tibial nerve showed no differences between mice fed normal or ketogenic diets. Tests included von Frey, open field, and ladder-rung crossing. We add to existing literature showing protective effects of the ketogenic diet in forelimb injuries by focusing on neurotrauma in the hindlimbs. The results suggest that ketogenic diets need to be assessed based on the type and location of neurotrauma.Significance Statement There is an urgent need for therapeutics to improve outcomes for patients with neurotrauma. Here we test the effects of a non-invasive diet-based therapy. Ketogenic diets, which are high fat and low carbohydrate-based, have been shown to be effective in treating epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease, and show promise for treating other neurotrauma and neurodegenerative conditions. Here we show that while we were successful in producing high ketone concentrations in mice, the effects on recovery of function and pain following a thoracic spinal cord hemisection or spared nerve injury were minimal. Therefore, ketogenic diets, while effective in certain cases, should be evaluated depending on the injury type.","Mayr, Kyle A; Kwok, Charlie H T; Eaton, Shane E A; Baker, Glen B; Whelan, Patrick J",eNeuro,385,19

The rising popularity and scale of social networking sites such as Twitter may play an important role in detecting, affecting, and predicting influenza epidemics. In this paper, we develop a simple mathematical model including the dynamics of ``tweets'' --- short, 140-character Twitter messages that may enhance the awareness of disease, change individual's behavior, and reduce the transmission of disease among a population during an influenza season. We analyze the model by deriving the basic reproductive number and proving the stability of the steady states. A Hopf bifurcation occurs when a threshold curve is crossed, which suggests the possibility of multiple outbreaks of influenza. We also perform numerical simulations, conduct sensitivity test on a few parameters related to tweets, and compare modeling predictions with surveillance data of influenza-like illness reported cases and the percentage of tweets self-reporting flu during the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak in England and Wales. These results show that social media programs like Twitter may serve as a good indicator of seasonal influenza epidemics and influence the emergence and spread of the disease.","Pawelek, Kasia A; Oeldorf-Hirsch, Anne; Rong, Libin",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,385,24

In this study, we analyzed the human antibody response to cytomegalovirus (human cytomegalovirus, HCMV) infection and found that antibodies to glycoprotein (g)B, a surface glycoprotein that has been developed as a HCMV vaccine, were primarily nonneutralizing. In contrast, most of the antibodies to the complex formed by gH, gL, protein (p)UL128, pUL130, and pUL131 (the gHgLpUL128L pentamer) neutralized HCMV infection with high potency. Based on this analysis, we developed a single polycistronic vector encoding the five pentamer genes separated by ""self-cleaving"" 2A peptides to generate a stably transfected CHO cell line constitutively secreting high levels of recombinant pentamer that displayed the functional antigenic sites targeted by human neutralizing antibodies. Immunization of mice with the pentamer formulated with different adjuvants elicited HCMV neutralizing antibody titers that persisted to high levels over time and that were a hundred- to thousand-fold higher than those found in individuals that recovered from primary HCMV infection. Sera from mice immunized with the pentamer vaccine neutralized infection of both epithelial cells and fibroblasts and prevented cell-to-cell spread and viral dissemination from endothelial cells to leukocytes. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from immunized mice showed the same potency as human antibodies and targeted the same as well as additional sites on the pentamer. These results illustrate with a relevant example a general and practical approach of analytic vaccinology for the development of subunit vaccines against complex pathogens.","Kabanova, Anna; Perez, Laurent; Lilleri, Daniele; Marcandalli, Jessica; Agatic, Gloria; Becattini, Simone; Preite, Silvia; Fuschillo, Dario; Percivalle, Elena; Sallusto, Federica; Gerna, Giuseppe; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,385,31

Thus, Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic's trajectory.

These NPs enable the sensitive enrichment of cTnI (<1 ng/mL) with high specificity and reproducibility, while simultaneously depleting highly abundant proteins such as human serum albumin (>1010 more abundant than cTnI). We demonstrate that top-down nanoproteomics can provide high-resolution proteoform-resolved molecular fingerprints of diverse cTnI proteoforms to establish proteoform-pathophysiology relationships.

In nature, archaeal and extremophilic organisms utilize amorphous silica as a protective biomineral and exhibit considerable thermal tolerance. Here we present a bioinspired approach to generate thermostable virus by introducing an artificial hydrated silica exterior on individual virion. Similar to thermophiles, silicified viruses can survive longer at high temperature than their wild-type relatives. Virus inactivation assays showed that silica hydration exterior of the modified virus effectively prolonged infectivity of viruses by ∼ 10-fold at room temperature, achieving a similar result as that obtained by storing native ones at 4 °C. Mechanistic studies indicate that amorphous silica nanoclusters stabilize the inner virion structure by forming a layer that restricts molecular mobility, acting as physiochemical nanoanchors. Notably, we further evaluate the potential application of this biomimetic strategy in stabilizing clinically approved vaccine, and the silicified polio vaccine that can retain 90% potency after the storage at room temperature for 35 days was generated by this biosilicification approach and validated with in vivo experiments. This approach not only biomimetically connects inorganic material and living virus but also provides an innovative resolution to improve the thermal stability of biological agents using nanomaterials.","Wang, Guangchuan; Wang, Hong-Jiang; Zhou, Hangyu; Nian, Qing-Gong; Song, Zhiyong; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Wang, Xiaoyu; Zhu, Shun-Ya; Li, Xiao-Feng; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Tang, Ruikang",ACS nano,385,28

These public health measures may have affected the provision of care for patients with epilepsy. Social isolation may have also adversely affected well-being and quality of life due to informal and formal support networks becoming less accessible. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the lived experiences of patients with epilepsy and to see how their quality of life and healthcare has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS From April 27 to May 15, 2020 we performed remote interviews with 18 participants who had virtual appointments with their healthcare providers and were enrolled in the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program registry. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, after which transcripts were analyzed and coded into relevant themes using NVivo 12. RESULTS Three broad themes emerged throughout the interviews:1) impact of pandemic on informal and formal support systems; 2) impact of pandemic on healthcare provision; and 3) concerns about the impact of the pandemic on personal situations and society in the future. Participants reported anxiety and stress about decreased social engagement and activity cessations. Although face-to-face appointments were preferred, virtual care was well-received. Common concerns about the future included securing employment and burnout from balancing family responsibilities. Some patients also feared they would be stigmatized as society adapted to the situation. SIGNIFICANCE This study highlights the need for additional research in anticipation of the implementation of remote medicine in the management and treatment of epilepsy. It also highlights the tenacity of those living with epilepsy during difficult periods despite social and familial pressures. Raising awareness during this time about the lives and experiences of epilepsy patients can help challenge misconceptions and stigma in the workplace and wider society.","Subotic, Arsenije; Pricop, Diana F; Josephson, Colin B; Patten, Scott B; Smith, Eric E; Roach, Pamela",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,385,1

However, the nature of ovarian cysts lacks accurate judgement, leading to that many patients with benign nodules still need Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies or surgeries, increasing the physical pain and mental pressure of patients as well as unnecessary medical health care costs. Therefore, we present an image diagnosis system for classifying the ovarian cysts in color ultrasound images, which novelly applies the image features fused by both high-level features from deep learning network and low-level features from texture descriptor. Firstly, the ultrasound images are enhanced to improve the quality of training data set and the rotation invariant uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) features are extracted from each of the images as the low-level texture features. Then the high-level deep features extracted by the fine-tuned GoogLeNet neural network and the low-level ULBP features are normalized and cascaded as one fusion feature that can represent both the semantic context and the texture patterns distributed in the image. Finally, the fusion features are input to the Cost-sensitive Random Forest classifier to classify the images into ""malignant"" and ""benign"". The high-level features extracted by the deep neural network from the medical ultrasound image can reflect the visual features of the lesion region, while the low-level texture features can describe the edges, direction and distribution of intensities. Experimental results indicate that the combination of the two types of features can describe the differences between the lesion regions and other regions, and the differences between lesions regions of malignant and benign ovarian cysts.","Zhang, Lei; Huang, Jian; Liu, Li",Journal of medical systems,385,19

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) primary care fee bump temporarily eliminated this differential in 2013-2014. OBJECTIVE To examine how dual payment policy impacts primary care physicians' (PCP) acceptance of duals. RESEARCH DESIGN We assessed differences in the likelihood that PCPs had dual caseloads of ≥10% or 20% in states with lower versus full dual reimbursement using linear probability models adjusted for physician and area-level traits. Using a triple-difference approach, we examined changes in dual caseloads for PCPs versus a control group of specialists in states with fee bumps versus no change during years postbump versus prebump. SUBJECTS PCPs and specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons, general surgeons) that billed fee-for-service Medicare. MEASURES State dual payment policies and physicians' dual caseloads as a percentage of their Medicare patients. RESULTS In 2012, 81% of PCPs had dual caseloads of ≥10% and this was less likely among PCPs in states with lower versus full dual reimbursement (eg, difference=-4.52 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.80 to -2.25). The proportion of PCPs with dual caseloads of ≥10% or 20% decreased significantly between 2012 and 2017 and the fee bump was not consistently associated with increases in dual caseloads. CONCLUSIONS Pre-ACA, PCPs' participation in the dual program appeared to be lower in states with lower reimbursement for duals.

Isothermal amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. In addition, there are limited reports of saliva as the sample source, and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when comparing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity assay from saliva using a two-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10 min RT step is performed with only B3 and backward inner primers before the final reaction. We show that while the one-step RT-LAMP demonstrates satisfactory results, the optimized two-step approach allows detection of only few molecules per reaction and performs significantly better than the one-step RT-LAMP and conventional two-step RT-LAMP approaches with all primers included in the RT step.

The potential of sequence data on pathogens is not fully realized until raw data are translated into public health intelligence. Sequencing technologies have become highly mechanized. If the political will for data sharing remains strong, the frontier for progress in emerging infectious diseases will be in analysis of sequence data and translation of results into better public health science and policy. For example, applying analytical tools such as Supramap (http://supramap.osu.edu) to genomic data for pathogens, public health scientists can track specific mutations in pathogens that confer the ability to infect humans or resist drugs.

We hypothesized that this treatment strategy could lead to satisfying results in selected patients after preoperative microorganism isolation. METHODS Ten patients underwent cementless one-stage revision hip arthroplasty with antibacterial hydrogel coating for the treatment of an infected THA. Inclusion criteria were: the presence of a known organism with known sensitivity, patients non-immunocompromised with healthy soft tissues with minimal or moderate bone loss. Mean age at surgery was 69.4 years. Assessment included objective examination, Harris hip score, visual analog scale pain score, standard X-rays. RESULTS At a mean follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 2-5 years), none of the patients had clinical or radiographic signs suggesting recurrent infection. Follow-up examination showed significant improvement of all variables compared to pre-operative values (p < 0.05). Radiographs did not show progressive radiolucent lines or change in the position of the implant. CONCLUSIONS One-stage revision THA with antibacterial hydrogel coated implants represents a safe and effective procedure providing infection eradication and satisfying subjective functional outcomes in selected patients.","Pellegrini, Antonio; Legnani, Claudio",The International journal of artificial organs,385,1

Comment on ""Doctor Retention: A Cross-sectional Study of How Ireland Has Been Losing the Battle"".",20.554293,3.078135,2020-10-20,"INTRODUCTION Repeat prostate biopsy (PBx) is recommended under persistent suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) or in the face of the following findings: atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP), extense (≥3 biopsy sites) high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), or HGPIN with atypical glands, suspicious for adenocarcinoma (PIN-ATYP). Nowadays, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and mpMRI targeted PBx (MRI-TBx) are recommended in repeat PBx. Our objective was to analyze the current value of ASAP, mHGPIN, PIN-ATYP and other histological findings to predict clinically significant PCa (csPCa) risk. METHODS Retrospective analysis of 377 repeat PBxs. MRI-TBx was performed when Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score>3 and 12-core transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) systematic PBx when≤2. ASAP, HGPIN, mHGPIN, PIN-ATYP, and 8 other histological findings were prospectively reported in negative PBx. CsPCa was defined as ISUP group grade>2. RESULTS Incidence of ASAP, multifocal HGPIN (mHGPIN) and PINATYP was 4.2%, 39.7% and 3.7% respectively, and csPCa rate was statistically similar among men with these histological findings. However, the rate of csPCa was 22.2% when proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA) was present, and 36.1% when it was not. PIA was the only histological finding which predicted lower risk of csPCa, with an OR of .54 (95% CI: .308-.945, P=.031). In addition, PIA was an independent predictor of a model combining clinical variables and mpMRI which reached area under de ROC curve of .86 (95% CI: .83-.90). CONCLUSIONS PIA emerged as the only predictive histological finding of csPCa risk and can contribute to a predictive model. mHGPIN failed to predict csPCa risk. The low incidence of ASAP (4.2%) and PIN-ATYP (3.7%) prevented us from drawing conclusions.","Schwartzmann, I; Celma, A; Regis, L; Planas, J; Roche, S; de Torres, I M; Semidey, M E; Morote, J",Actas urologicas espanolas,385,1

We developed a flexible approach based on a magnetic field-enhanced agglutination (MFEA) readout to detect either genomes or host-derived antibodies. Dengue viruses (DENVs) were selected as models. For genome detection, a pan-flavivirus amplification was performed before capture of biotinylated amplicons between magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) grafted with DENV probes and anti-biotin antibodies. Magnetization cycles accelerated this chaining process to within 5 min while simple turbidimetry measured the signal. This molecular MFEA readout was evaluated on 43 DENV RNA(+) and 32 DENV RNA(-) samples previously screened by real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity and the specificity were 88.37% (95% CI, 78.76%-97.95%) and 96.87% (95% CI, 90.84%-100%), respectively. For anti-DENV antibody detection, 103 plasma samples from donors were first screened using ELISA assays. An immunological MFEA readout was then performed by adding MNPs grafted with viral antigens to the samples. Anti-DENV antibodies were detected with a sensitivity and specificity of 90.62% (95% CI, 83.50%-97.76%) and 97.44% (95% CI, 92.48%-100%), respectively.

By 1 y posttransplantation, both patients displayed patterns of peripheral blood gene expression converging upon the IOT-RISET signature. Furthermore, both patients maintained levels of peripheral blood FOXP3 and TOAG-1 mRNA expression within the range consistent with nonrejection.

Several publications exist, but no previous systematic review has been made to evaluate the real benefits of this approach in terms of feasibility and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed an electronic search in PubMed up to March 2012 with the terms ""single AND incision OR site OR port OR trocar AND children"" including related articles and obtained 197 articles. After applying our inclusion criteria, 78 articles were reviewed. RESULTS We identified prospective controlled trials (n=1), case-control studies (n=12), case series (n=49), and case reports (n=16). In total, 4212 patients had been operated on by SIPES and were separated by systems: gastrointestinal (n=2888), urologic (n=390), gynecologic (n=27), other abdominal (n=874), and thoracic (n=33) procedures. The most common procedure was SIPES appendectomy, and a unique prospective controlled trial supports its safety and effectiveness. Technically demanding surgeries such as hepatojejunostomy and colonic surgeries were described. Multichannel ports and multiple ports, standard and articulated instruments, transparietal instruments, retraction sutures, and magnets were used. Operative times, length of stay, and complications similar to standard laparoscopic surgery were described. A low conversion rate (to a reduced port, standard laparoscopy and open procedures) was also mentioned. No comparable measure for pain and cosmesis assessment was used. CONCLUSIONS A wide experience in SIPES and feasibility has already been described with good clinical outcomes and low rate of conversion. Appendectomy is the unique procedure in which SIPES has been demonstrated to be safe and effective. It is pending the execution of prospective controlled trials for other operations to demonstrate, with objective evidence, the real benefits of this less invasive approach.","Saldaña, Lily J; Targarona, Eduardo M",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The crystallized trimeric glycoprotein gB of herpes simplex virus has been described as a postfusion conformation, and several studies prove that like other class III fusion proteins, gB undergoes a pH-dependent switch between the pre- and postfusion conformations. Using several biophysical techniques, we show that peptides corresponding to the long helix of the gB postfusion structure interfere with the membrane fusion event, likely hampering the conformational rearrangements from the pre- to the postfusion structures. Those peptides represent good candidates for further design of peptidomimetic antagonists capable of blocking the fusion process.","Cantisani, Marco; Falanga, Annarita; Incoronato, Novella; Russo, Luigi; De Simone, Alfonso; Morelli, Giancarlo; Berisio, Rita; Galdiero, Massimiliano; Galdiero, Stefania",Journal of medicinal chemistry,385,16

METHOD This study is a follow-up of a single centre randomised controlled trial (RCT). Thirty patients were randomly allocated to RVMR (n=16) and LVMR (n = 14). The primary endpoint was the maintenance of the restored pelvic anatomy 5 years after the operation as assessed by magnetic resonance (MR) defaecography. Secondary outcome measures included the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) measures and functional results assessed using symptom questionnaires. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (14 RVMR and 12 LVMR) completed the 5-year follow-up and were included in the study. The MR imaging (MRI) results, POP-Q measurements and symptom-specific quality of life measures did not differ between the RVMR and LVMR groups. The MRI measurements of the total study population remained unchanged between 3 months and 5 years. In the pelvic floor distress inventory (PFDI-20), the RVMR group had lower symptom scores (mean 96.0, SD 70.7) than the LVMR group (mean 160.6, SD 58.9; p=0.004). In the subscales of pelvic organ prolapse (POPDI-6) (mean 23.2, SD 24.3 vs mean 52.4, SD 22.4; p=0.001) and the colorectal-anal distress inventory (CRADI-8) (mean 38.4, SD 23.3 vs mean 58.6, SD 25.4; p=0.009), the patients in the RVMR group had significantly better outcomes. CONCLUSION After VMR, the corrected anatomy was preserved. There were no clinically significant differences in anatomical results between the RVMR and LVMR procedures 5 years after surgery based on MR defaecography. However functional outcomes were better after RMVR.","Laitakari, K E; Mäkelä-Kaikkonen, J K; Pääkkö, E; Kata, I; Ohtonen, P; Mäkelä, J; Rautio, T T",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,385,12

Polymyxin, an ancient polypeptide antibiotic, has been given renewed attention over recent years, resulting in resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to polymyxin, but its resistance mechanism is not completely clear. Thus, it is important to study its resistance mechanisms. In this study, an in vitro induced polymyxin-resistant strain of Salmonella typhimurium in the laboratory were constructed to investigate the mechanism of resistance of Salmonella to polymyxin. Gradual induction of Salmonella typhimurium ATCC13311 (AT) by concentration increment was used to screen for a highly polymyxin-resistant strain AT-P128. The broth dilution technique was used to compare the sensitivity of the two strains to different antimicrobial drugs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then identified by whole genome sequencing, and differences in gene expression between the two strains were compared by transcriptome sequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Finally, for the first time, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system was used to construct gene deletion mutants in Salmonella to knock out the phoP gene of AT-P128. The results showed that strain AT-P128 was significantly more resistant to amoxicillin, ceftiofur, ampicillin, fluphenazine, and chloramphenicol and significantly less resistant to sulfamethoxazole than the parental strain AT. The growth curve results showed no significant change in the growth rate between AT-P128 and AT. Motility and biofilm formation assays showed a significant decrease in AT-P128. Additionally, the WGS results showed that AT-P128 had mutations in 9 genes involving 14 SNPs. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results showed increased expression of phoPQ. The loss of the phoP gene decreased AT-P128ΔphoP resistance to polymyxin by 32-fold. These results suggested that polymyxin resistance affected the biology, genome components, and gene expression levels of Salmonella and that the PhoPQ two-component system played a key role in polymyxin resistance in Salmonella, providing insights into the diversity and complexity of polymyxin resistance in Salmonella.","Li, Lin; Li, Rui; Qi, Caili; Gao, Haixia; Wei, Qiling; Tan, Lei; Sun, Feifei",Veterinary microbiology,385,20

In particular, it was examined whether the relationship between out-of-pocket health expenditure and poverty was contingent on a certain threshold level of out-of-pocket health spending. The dynamic panel threshold method, which allows for the endogeneity of the threshold regressor (out-of-pocket health expenditure), was used. Three indicators were adopted as poverty measures, namely the poverty headcount ratio, the poverty gap index, and the poverty gap squared index. At the same time, out-of-pocket health expenditure was measured as a percentage of total health expenditure. The results showed the validity of the estimated threshold models, indicating that only beyond the turning point, which was about 29 percent, that out-of-pocket health spending led to increased poverty. When heterogeneity was controlled for in the sample, using the World Bank income classification, the findings showed variations in the estimated threshold, with higher values for the low- and lower-middle-income groups, as compared to the high-income group. For the lower-income groups, below the threshold for out-of-pocket health expenditure, it had a positive or insignificant effect on poverty reduction, while it led to higher poverty above the threshold. Further, the sampled countries were divided into regions, according to the World Health Organization. Generally, improving health care systems through tolerable levels of out-of-pocket health expenditure is an inevitable step toward better health coverage and poverty reduction in many developing countries.","Sirag, Abdalla; Mohamed Nor, Norashidah",Healthcare,385,1

It was sought herein, to summarize the studies published to date regarding the vitamin D supplementation to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcome were 14-day and in-hospital mortality reported as an odds ratio (OR) with the associated 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS Eight articles were included in the review with a combined total of 2,322 individual patients, 786 in the vitamin D supplementation group and 1,536 in the control group. The use of vitamin D compared to the group without vitamin D supplementation was associated with a lower 14-day mortality (18.8% vs. 31.3%, respectively; OR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.12-2.19; p = 0.36), a lower in-hospital mortality (5.6% vs. 16.1%; OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.23-1.37; I² = 74%; p = 0.20), the rarer intensive care unit admission (6.4% vs. 23.4%; OR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.54; I² = 77%; p = 0.002) as well as rarer mechanical ventilation (6.5% vs. 18.9%; OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16-0.80; I² = 0.48; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D supplementation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients has the potential to positively impact patients with both mild and severe symptoms.

Should vitamin D prove to reduce hospitalization rates and symptoms outside of the hospital setting, the cost and benefit to global pandemic mitigation efforts would be substantial.","Szarpak, Luiza; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Gawel, Wladyslaw; Koziel, Dorota; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Chmielewski, Jaroslaw; Gozhenko, Anatolii; Bielski, Karol; Wroblewski, Pawel; Savytskyi, Ivan; Szarpak, Lukasz; Rafique, Zubaid",Cardiology journal,385,8

Technical developments in Massively Parallel Sequencing (MPS) enable the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of DNA markers, which improves successful Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP). The EU-funded VISAGE (VISible Attributes through GEnomics) Consortium has developed various targeted MPS-based lab tools to apply FDP in routine forensic analyses. Here, we present an evaluation of the VISAGE Basic tool for appearance and ancestry prediction based on PowerSeq chemistry (Promega) on a MiSeq FGx System (Illumina). The panel consists of 153 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that provide information about EVCs (41 SNPs for eye, hair and skin color from HIrisPlex-S) and continental BGA (115 SNPs; three overlap with the EVCs SNP set). The assay was evaluated for sensitivity, repeatability and genotyping concordance, as well as its performance with casework-type samples. This targeted MPS assay provided complete genotypes at all 153 SNPs down to 125 pg of input DNA and 99.67% correct genotypes at 50 pg. It was robust in terms of repeatability and concordance and provided useful results with casework-type samples. The results suggest that this MPS assay is a useful tool for basic appearance and ancestry prediction in forensic genetics for users interested in applying PowerSeq chemistry and MiSeq for this purpose.","Palencia-Madrid, Leire; Xavier, Catarina; de la Puente, María; Hohoff, Carsten; Phillips, Christopher; Kayser, Manfred; Parson, Walther",Genes,385,1

Health systems need to ensure that MT is delivered to as many patients as quickly as possible. Using decision modelling, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of secondary transfer by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) compared with ground emergency medical services (GEMS) of rural patients eligible for MT in England. METHODS The model consisted of (1) a short-run decision tree with two branches, representing secondary transfer transportation strategies and (2) a long-run Markov model for a theoretical population of rural patients with a confirmed ischaemic stroke. Strategies were compared by lifetime costs: quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost per QALY gained and net monetary benefit. Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored uncertainty around parameter values. RESULTS We used the base case of early-presenting (<6 hours to arterial puncture) patient aged 75 years who had stroke to compare HEMS and GEMS. This produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £28 027 when a 60 min reduction in travel time was assumed. Scenario analyses showed the importance of the reduction in travel time and futile transfers in lowering ICERs. For late presenting (>6 hours to arterial puncture), ground transportation is the dominant strategy. CONCLUSION Our model indicates that using HEMS to transfer patients who had stroke eligible for MT from remote hospitals in England may be cost-effective when: travel time is reduced by at least 60 min compared with GEMS, and a £30 000/QALY threshold is used for decision-making. However, several other logistic considerations may impact on the use of air transportation.","Coughlan, Diarmuid; McMeekin, Peter; Flynn, Darren; Ford, Gary A; Lumley, Hannah; Burgess, David; Balami, Joyce; Mawson, Andrew; Craig, Dawn; Rice, Stephen; White, Phil",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,385,12

We sampled 140 herbarium specimens collected between 1845 and 1991 from six continents and used 12-plex microsatellite genotyping (SSR) to identify FAM-1 and the mtDNA lineage (Herb-1/Ia) present in historic samples. FAM-1 was detected in approximately 73% of the historic specimens and was found on six continents. The US-1 genotype was found later than FAM-1 on all continents except Australia/Oceania and in only 27% of the samples. FAM-1 was the first genotype detected in almost all the former British colonies from which samples were available. The data from historic outbreak samples suggest the FAM-1 genotype was widespread, diverse, and spread to Asia and Africa from European sources.

METHODS An online survey was conducted by the Turkish Endometriosis & Adenomyosis Society and administered to patients with endometriosis who agreed to participate in the study. The survey included 25 questions prepared by an expert committee of four professionals (two gynecologists and two endometriosis specialists). RESULTS Of the 290 questionnaires sent out, 261 (90%) were returned. A total of 213 (83.86%) patients reported that they were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. In addition, 133 (53.63%) patients thought the management of their endometriosis was affected because of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Clinical studies clearly indicate that endometriosis is a condition associated with high levels of chronic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has led the public to experience psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. The majority of patients with endometriosis were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. The majority of elective endometriosis surgeries have not been postponed. Patients were highly aware of the pandemic and practiced social distancing and hygiene. Only 4 (1.59%) patients with endometriosis required hospitalization.","Bahat, Pınar Y; Kaya, Cihan; Selçuki, Nura F T; Polat, İbrahim; Usta, Taner; Oral, Engin",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,385,16

Stent retrievers have now replaced 'first-generation' devices, which have been the principle devices tested in stroke trials.Our aims were to determine the rates of successful recanalization and functional independence in acute stroke patients treated with stent retrievers. We also sought to assess the safety outcomes of stent retrievers by assessing the rates of mortality and intra-cranial haemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies which utilized stent retrievers as sole treatment or as part of a multi-modal approach in acute ischaemic stroke. RESULTS We identified 20 eligible studies: 17 on Solitaire (ev3/Covidien, Irvine, California, USA) (n = 762) and three on Trevo (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) (n = 210). The mean age of participants was 66.8 (range 62.1-73.0) years and the M:F ratio was 1.1:1. The average stroke severity score (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)) at presentation was 17.2. The weighted mean symptom onset to arterial puncture and procedural duration were 265.4 minutes and 54.8 minutes, respectively.Successful recanalization was achieved in 84.5% of patients with a weighted mean of 2.0 stent retriever passes. Independent functional outcome was achieved in 51.2% and the mortality rate was 16.8%. CONCLUSION Stent retrievers have the potential to achieve a high rate of recanalization and functional independence whilst being relatively safe. They should be assessed in well-designed randomized controlled trials to determine their efficacy and assess whether they compare favourably with 'standard treatment' in stroke.","Grech, Reuben; Mizzi, Adrian; Pullicino, Richard; Thornton, John; Downer, Jonathan",The neuroradiology journal,385,8

Moreover, chemical modifications based on the isoflavone scaffold, has generated synthetic chemodiversity to enhance the bioactivities of isoflavones. Areas covered: The current review summarizes the discovery of new chemotherapeutic agents possessing the isoflavone skeleton. This review incorporates patents filed between 2012 and 2016 mostly related to anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-HIV, anti-gastric ulcer, anti-gastritis, antiparasitic and some other biological effects demonstrated by isoflavone analogs. Expert opinion: The number of interesting patents published during the five year period (2012-2016) on the therapeutic potential of isoflavones indicated the importance of this molecule. Natural isoflavones possess potent anticancer, anti-HIV and antidiabetic activities and chemical analogs of natural isoflavones increase the abovementioned biological effects. Additionally isoflavones have only been tested for a limited number of biological activities and thus future research should focus on additional biological activities viz., anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, and anti-leishmanial effects. However, the absence of SAR studies and in vivo data restricted the rational design of more potent isoflavone analogs and we believe that in order to get lead compounds, there needs to be a greater focus on SAR and in vivo studies.","Hussain, Hidayat; Green, Ivan R",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,385,1

Intra-operative ultrafiltration during CPB is a strategy developed by pediatric cardiac specialists, aiming to dampen the inflammatory syndrome by removing circulating cytokines and improving coagulation profiles during the cardiac operation. Although ultrafiltration is commonly used in the pediatric population, it is not routinely used in the adult population. This study aims to evaluate if randomized evidence supports the use of continuous intra-operative ultrafiltration to enhance recovery for adults undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis will include randomized controlled trials (RCT) that feature continuous forms of ultrafiltration during adult cardiac surgery with CPB, specifically assessing for benefit in mortality rates, invasive ventilation time and intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS). Relevant RCTs will be retrieved from databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and Scopus, by a pre-defined search strategy. Search results will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent persons with consensus. Selected RCTs will have study demographics and outcome data extracted by two independent persons and transferred into RevMan. Risk of bias will be independently assessed by the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (RoB2) tool and studies rated as low-, some-, or high- risk of bias. Meta-analyses will compare the intervention of continuous ultrafiltration against comparators in terms of mortality, ventilation time, ICU LOS, and renal failure. Heterogeneity will be measured by the χ2 test and described by the I2 statistic. A sensitivity analysis will be completed by excluding included studies judged to have a high risk of bias. Summary of findings and certainty of the evidence, determined by the GRADE approach, will display the analysis findings. DISCUSSION The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will summarize the evidence to date of continuous forms of ultrafiltration in adult cardiac surgery with CPB, to both inform adult cardiac specialists about this technique and identify critical questions for future research in this subject area.

A recent systematic literature review concluded that there were no appreciable differences in either clinical presentation or disease severity among these subtypes, but study parameters limit the applicability of these results to military populations. We sought to evaluate differences in disease severity among influenza subtypes in a cohort of healthy, primarily outpatient adult U.S. Department of Defense beneficiaries. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 2009 to 2014, we enrolled otherwise healthy adults age 18 to 65 years with influenza-like illness in an observational cohort study based in 5 U.S. military medical centers. Serial nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for determination of etiology and viral shedding by polymerase chain reaction. The presence and severity of symptoms was assessed by interview and patient diary. RESULTS Over a 5-year period, a total of 157 adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza subtype were enrolled. Of these, 69 (44%) were positive for influenza A(H1N1), 69 (44%) for influenza A(H3N2), and 19 (12%) for influenza B. About 61% were male, 64% were active duty military personnel, and 72% had received influenza vaccine in the past 8 months. Almost 10% were hospitalized with influenza. Seasonal influenza virus distribution among enrollees mirrored that of nationwide trends each year of study. Individuals with A/H1N1 had upper respiratory composite scores that were lower than those with A/H3N2. Multivariate models indicated that individuals with A(H1N1) and B had increased lower respiratory symptom scores when compared to influenza A(H3N2) (A[H1N1]: 1.51 [95% CI 0.47, 2.55]; B: 1.46 [95% CI 0.09, 2.83]), whereas no other differences in symptom severity scores among influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B infection were observed. Overall, influenza season (maximum in 2012-2013 season) and female sex of the participant were found to be associated with increased influenza symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS Our study of influenza in a cohort of otherwise healthy, outpatient adult Department of Defense beneficiaries over 5 influenza seasons revealed few differences between influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B infection with respect to self-reported disease severity or clinical outcomes. This study highlights the importance of routine, active, and laboratory-based surveillance to monitor ongoing trends and severity of influenza in various populations to inform prevention measures.","Schofield, Christina; Colombo, Rhonda E; Richard, Stephanie A; Chen, Wei-Ju; Fairchok, Mary P; Maves, Ryan C; Arnold, John C; Danaher, Patrick J; Deiss, Robert G; Lalani, Tahaniyat; Rajnik, Michael; Millar, Eugene V; Coles, Christian L; Burgess, Timothy H",Military medicine,385,31

Objective: The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of endovascular rescue treatment (ERT, continuous intraarterial nimodipine; IAN, transcutaneous balloon angioplasty, TBA). Methods: In this prospective observational study, we assessed periprocedural complications and side effects in context of ERT. We evaluated neurological status, multimodal neuromonitoring (ptiO2, lactate/pyruvate ratio, transcranial doppler), and cranial imaging (CTP, DSA). All parameters were included into multivariate analysis to determine predictors for the need of retreatment. Results: We included 33 consecutive patients with 54 ERT (IAN n = 35; TBA n = 13; TBA + IAN n = 6). We recorded no serious complications and initial improvement in all parameters (neurostatus 72.3% of patients; ptiO2 15.0 ± 11.7 to 25.8 ± 15.5 mmHg, p < 0.0001; lactate/pyruvate ratio 46.3 ± 27.5 to 31.0 ± 9.7, p <0.05; transcranial doppler 139.0 ± 46.3 to 98.9 ± 29.6 cm/s, p < 0.05; CTP 81.6% of patients; DSA 93.1% of patients). Retreatment (n = 16, 48.5%) was independently associated with preinterventional ptiO2 < 5 mmHg (p <0.01) and early (<72 h) discontinuation of IAN treatment (p = 0.08). DCI related cerebral infarction was noted in n = 8 patients (24.2%). At 3 months after discharge, favorable outcome was noted for n = 11 (35.5%) patients. Conclusion: Provided a detailed decision tree, timely ERT can provide a relatively safe and effective treatment option in those highly-selected patients undergoing multimodality monitoring where conservative treatment options are exhausted. Continuous treatment in particular may be suitable to surpass sustained DCI and was associated with a low rate of DCI related infarction and comparably high percentage of good outcome.","Weiss, Miriam; Conzen, Catharina; Mueller, Marguerite; Wiesmann, Martin; Clusmann, Hans; Albanna, Walid; Schubert, Gerrit Alexander",Frontiers in neurology,385,19

A therapeutic strategy that may escape viral resistance is targeting host cellular mechanisms involved in viral replication and pathogenesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a primitive, evolutionary conserved molecular signaling cascade that has been implicated in multiple biological phenomena including innate immunity and the pathogenesis of certain viral infections. We investigated the effect of influenza A viral infection on ER stress pathways in lung epithelial cells. Influenza A virus induced ER stress in a pathway-specific manner. We showed that the virus activates the IRE1 pathway with little or no concomitant activation of the PERK and the ATF6 pathways. When we examined the effects of modulating the ER stress response on the virus, we found that the molecular chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) significantly inhibits influenza A viral replication. In addition, a specific inhibitor of the IRE1 pathway also blocked viral replication. Our findings constitute the first evidence that ER stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of influenza A viral infection. Decreasing viral replication by modulating the host ER stress response is a novel strategy that has important therapeutic implications.","Hassan, Ihab H; Zhang, Michael S; Powers, Linda S; Shao, Jian Q; Baltrusaitis, Jonas; Rutkowski, D Thomas; Legge, Kevin; Monick, Martha M",The Journal of biological chemistry,385,16

The availability of simple, efficient and reproducible radiolabeling procedures is essential for developing new SPECT radiopharmaceuticals for clinical translation. The aim of this research was to prepare 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-Lys(Nal)-Urea-Glu (99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA) obtained from lyophilized kit formulations and evaluate the in vitro and in vivo radiopharmaceutical binding to prostate cancer cells over-expressing PSMA, as well as the 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA normal biodistribution in humans and the preliminary uptake in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS 99mTc labeling was performed by adding sodium pertechnetate solution and a 0.2M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to a lyophilized formulation containing HYNIC-iPSMA, EDDA, tricine, mannitol and stannous chloride. The radiochemical purity was evaluated by reversed-phase HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. Stability studies in human serum were performed by size-exclusion HPLC. In vitro cell uptake was tested using prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) with blocked and non-blocked receptors. Biodistribution and tumor uptake were determined in LNCaP tumor-bearing nude mice with blocked and non-blocked receptors, and images were obtained using a micro-SPECT/CT. Whole-body images from three healthy men and two patients with histologically-confirmed prostate cancer (one of them with a previous 68Ga-PSMA-617scan) were acquired at 1h and 3h after 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA administration with radiochemical purities of >98%. RESULTS In vitro and in vivo studies showed high radiopharmaceutical stability in human serum, specific recognition for PSMA, high tumor uptake (10.22±2.96% ID/g at 1h) with rapid blood clearance and mainly kidney elimination. Preliminary images in patients demonstrated the ability of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA to detect tumors and metastases of prostate cancer as well as 68Ga-PSMA-617 does.

Despite some controversial reports, the activation of AT2R generally antagonizes the effects of Ang II binding on AT1R. Studying AT2R signaling, function, and its specific ligands in cell culture or animal studies have confirmed its beneficial effects throughout the body. These characteristics classify AT2R as part of the protective arm of the RAS that, along with functions of Ang (1-7) through Mas receptor signaling modulates the harmful effects of Ang II on AT1R in the activated classical arm of the RAS. Although Ang II is the primary ligand for AT2R, we have summarized other natural or synthetic peptide and nonpeptide agonists with critical evaluation of their structure, mechanism of action, and biological activity. Significance Statement AT2R is one of the main components of the RAS and has a significant prospective for mediating the beneficial action of the RAS through its protective arm on the body's homeostasis. Targeting AT2R offers substantial clinical application possibilities for modulating various pathological conditions.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines are considered as the root cause of apoptosis, although the mechanism is not fully explained and/or understood at this time. In addition, depression may induce gastrointestinal perturbations that maintain the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been shown that some specific probiotic formulations may reduce gastrointestinal problems induced by stress and the pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio. Therefore, we hypothesised that probiotics, when given prophylactically, may diminish the apoptosis propensity in the limbic system following a MI. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum in combination) or placebo in their drinking-water for four consecutive weeks.

Bax/Bcl-2 (pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic) ratio and caspase-3 (pro-apoptotic) activity were reduced in the amygdala (lateral and medial), as well as in the dentate gyrus in the probiotics group when compared with the placebo. Akt activity (anti-apoptotic) was increased in these same three regions. No significant difference was observed in Ca1 and Ca3 for the different markers measured. In conclusion, the probiotics L. helveticus and B. longum, given in combination as preventive therapy, reduced the predisposition of apoptosis found in different cerebral regions following a MI.","Girard, Stéphanie-Anne; Bah, Thierno Madjou; Kaloustian, Sévan; Lada-Moldovan, Laura; Rondeau, Isabelle; Tompkins, Thomas A; Godbout, Roger; Rousseau, Guy",The British journal of nutrition,385,1

Twenty-one patients with 30 tumors (maximum diameter: mean 1.4 ± 0.4 cm, range 0.7-2.2 cm) received MPT-RFA. RESULTS Nineteen patients (90.5 %, 19/21) achieved complete ablation at the first RFA session. Two patients (9.5 %, 2/21) required a second RFA session but achieved complete ablation. Primary and secondary technical success rates were 90.5 and 100 %. There were no deaths related to the procedures performed. Grade 3 or 4 increases in the serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels were found in six patients (38.1 %, 8/21). There were no liver infarctions. During the median follow-up period of 24.1 months (mean ± SD 24.7 ± 6.9 months, range 13.8-38.9 months), the local tumor progression rate and overall survival rate at 2 years was 5.0 % (95 % confidence interval 0.3-20.6 %) and 86.7 % (95 % confidence interval 56.3-96.5 %), respectively.

Neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) are thought to help reduce the symptoms of influenza with several possible mechanisms proposed. NIs have been stockpiled with a view to their widespread use in the event of a pandemic. However, the evidence base for this class of agents remains a source of debate. In a previous review we have documented substantial risks of publication bias of trials of NIs for influenza (60% of patient data from phase III treatment trials of oseltamivir have never been published) and reporting bias in the published trials. Our confidence in the conclusions of previous versions of this review has been subsequently undermined. Since we have become aware of a large number of unpublished trials of NIs in the management of influenza, this review updates and merges existing reviews in this area. OBJECTIVES To review clinical study reports of placebo-controlled randomised trials, regulatory comments and reviews ('regulatory information') of the effects of the NIs oseltamivir and zanamivir for influenza in all age groups and appraise trial programmes, rather than single studies.Clinical study reports are very detailed, unpublished clinical trial data containing in-depth descriptions of protocol rationale, methods analysis plans, trial results and organisational documents (such as contracts). A series of clinical studies designed and conducted by one sponsor represents a trial programme of a drug indication (for example treatment of influenza). SEARCH METHODS We searched trial registries, cross-referencing published and unpublished sources and corresponded with manufacturers and regulators. We searched the archives of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European and Japanese regulators. The evidence in this review reflects searches to obtain relevant information up to 12 April 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA We included regulatory information based on assessments of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in people of any age who had either confirmed or suspected influenza, or who had been exposed to influenza in the local community or place of residence. We included information which had been made available by our deadline. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We indexed regulatory information in two purpose-built instruments and reconstructed trials using CONSORT statement-based templates. To progress to Stage 2 (full analysis) we sought manufacturer explanations of discrepancies in the data. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) offered us individual patient data and responded to our queries, but Roche did not provide us with complete clinical study reports. In Stage 2 we intended to analyse trials with validated data (i.e. assuming our validation questions aimed at clarifying omissions and discrepancies were resolved). No studies progressed to Stage 2. We carried out analyses of the effects of oseltamivir on time to first alleviation of symptoms and hospitalisations using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and tested five hypotheses generated post-protocol publication. MAIN RESULTS We included and analysed data from 25 studies (15 oseltamivir and 10 zanamivir studies). We could not use data from a further 42 studies due to insufficient information or unresolved discrepancies in their data. The included trials were predominantly conducted in adults during influenza seasons in both hemispheres. A small number of studies were conducted in older people residing in care homes and in people with underlying respiratory diseases. The studies had adequate randomisation and blinding procedures, but imbalances in the analysis populations available (ITT influenza-infected) left many of the studies at risk of attrition bias. All the studies were sponsored by manufacturers of NIs. Time to first alleviation of symptoms in people with influenza-like illness symptoms (i.e. ITT population) was a median of 160 hours (range 125 to 192 hours) in the placebo groups and oseltamivir shortened this by around 21 hours (95% confidence interval (CI) -29.5 to -12.9 hours, P < 0.001; five studies) but there was no evidence of effect on hospitalisations based on seven studies with a median placebo group event rate of 0.84% (range 0% to 11%): odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.61, P = 0.86). These results are based on the comprehensive ITT population data and are unlikely to be biased. A post-protocol analysis showed that participants randomised to oseltamivir in treatment trials had a reduced odds being diagnosed with influenza (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94, P = 0.003; eight studies), probably due to an altered antibody response. Zanamivir trials showed no evidence of this. Due to limitations in the design, conduct and reporting of the trial programme, the data available to us lacked sufficient detail to credibly assess a possible effect of oseltamivir on complications and viral transmission. We postponed analysis of zanamivir evidence because of the offer of individual patient data (IPD) from its manufacturer. The authors have been unable to obtain the full set of clinical study reports or obtain verification of data from the manufacturer of oseltamivir (Roche) despite five requests between June 2010 and February 2011. No substantial comments were made by Roche on the protocol of our Cochrane Review which has been publicly available since December 2010. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found a high risk of publication and reporting biases in the trial programme of oseltamivir. Sub-population analyses of the influenza infected population in the oseltamivir trial programme are not possible because the two arms are non-comparable due to oseltamivir's apparent interference with antibody production. The evidence supports a direct oseltamivir mechanism of action on symptoms but we are unable to draw conclusions about its effect on complications or transmission. We expect full clinical study reports containing study protocol, reporting analysis plan, statistical analysis plan and individual patient data to clarify outstanding issues. These full clinical study reports are at present unavailable to us.","Jefferson, Tom; Jones, Mark A; Doshi, Peter; Del Mar, Chris B; Heneghan, Carl J; Hama, Rokuro; Thompson, Matthew J",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,385,26

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the preventive measures taken in the HBO centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study evaluated the measures taken during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for multiplace hyperbaric chamber operated in department (Health Sciences University-Gulhane Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey) between March 16th, 2020 and December 31st, 2020. The medical records of patients who underwent HBO treatment during this period were evaluated retrospectively. Their demographic attributes, the presence of risk factors, HBO indications, HBO session data, and COVID-19 inquiry forms were analysed. RESULTS A total of 122 patients underwent HBO treatment, and 150 people were subjected to pressure tolerance test (PTT). No COVID-19 case was treated with HBO in our department. The hyperbaric chamber was operated 608 times in total. Of these, 9.7% (n = 59) procedures were carried out under emergency conditions, and 10% (n = 61) were PTTs. Accordingly, 59.8% (n = 73) of the HBO-treated patients were considered at risk for a severe clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5.7% (n = 7) of the HBO-treated patients during the HBO treatment period. Besides, two inside attendants (14.3%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. There were only two concurrent cases in the same session among SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. The records revealed that these patients were sitting three seats away from each other. Another patient was sitting in between the two infected patients but was not diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS There is no clear evidence that these two patients infected each other; on the contrary, since no other patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the same session, we may suspect that the infections were coincidental. The measures taken in our department seem to suffice in preventing in-session transmission of COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases in an HBO centre.","Ozgok-Kangal, Kubra; Zaman, Taylan; Koc, Bayram",International maritime health,385,16

Although reducing tumor size by preoperative aspiration or drainage of the contents of the cystic tumor is helpful for liver resection, such procedures have a risk of tumor dissemination. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE After the round ligament was dissected, a 12-Fr drainage catheter was inserted into the tumor via the round ligament under ultrasonography. At that time, close attention was paid to avoid having the catheter deviate outside the round ligament. Through the inserted catheter, fluid was drained from the cystic lesion, and the stump of the round ligament was clipped to avoid fluid leakage. The left Glissonian pedicle was then taped. Laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy was performed under a good operative field because of tumor shrinkage. DISCUSSION Three cases underwent these procedures without any spillage of the contents of the cystic tumor. This method is useful for the reduction of tumor size and has a low risk of intra-abdominal leakage of the contents, resulting in a secure and good operative field.","Monden, Kazuteru; Sadamori, Hiroshi; Hioki, Masayoshi; Ohno, Satoshi; Sasaki, Kyo; Saneto, Hiromi; Ueki, Toru; Yabushita, Kazuhisa; Sakaguchi, Kousaku; Takakura, Norihisa",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,385,1

We therefore sought to examine the effect of amiodarone use on post HT survival. METHODS We stratified adults who underwent HT between January 2000 and August 2018 in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients according to pre-transplant amiodarone use and used recipient and donor characteristics to calculate propensity scores. We then used overlap propensity score weighting to construct Cox proportional hazards regression models (adjusted for Index for Mortality Prediction After Cardiac Transplantation [IMPACT] score and donor/recipient predicted heart mass [PHM] ratio) for mortality outcomes. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds of primary graft failure and drug-treated rejection. RESULTS 25,394 adult HT recipients were included; median (inter-quartile range) age was 55 (46, 62) years and 75.5% were men. Compared with non-users, amiodarone users had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (46.7% vs. 50.2%; p<0.0001), left ventricular assist device (LVAD) use (24.5% vs. 31.3%; p<0.0001), and ventilator support (2.5% vs. 3.6%; p<0.0001), respectively. The 10-year post-HT mortality rate in the overall population was 32.0%. Amiodarone use was associated with higher post-transplant 30-day (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.41) and 1-year mortality (HR 1.13, 1.04-1.22), but similar 5-year (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96-1.07) and 10-year mortality (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.13). Amiodarone use increased primary graft failure risk (odds ratio (OR) 1.30, 95% CI 1.07-1.57) but decreased drug-treated rejection (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.93). CONCLUSIONS Although pre-transplant amiodarone was associated with higher short-term mortality, its use did not affect long-term survival. Whether the short-term outcomes are related to greater graft failure risk is unclear.","Jennings, Douglas L; Gadela, Naga Vaishnavi; Jaiswal, Abhishek; Touch, Amanda; Baker, William L",Pharmacotherapy,385,1

However, recent studies have suggested a more nuanced perspective in which alpha oscillations also facilitate processes of cognitive control and perceptual stability. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over occipitoparietal cortex at 10 Hz (alpha-tACS) can selectively enhance EEG alpha power. To assess the contribution of alpha oscillations to attention, we delivered alpha-tACS across 4 experiments while 178 participants performed sustained attention tasks. Poor performance on all visual tasks was previously associated with increased EEG alpha power. We therefore predicted initially that alpha-tACS would consistently impair visual task performance. However, alpha-tACS was instead found to prevent deteriorations in visual performance that otherwise occurred during sham- and 50 Hz-tACS. This finding was observed in 2 experiments, using different sustained attention tasks. In a separate experiment, we also found that alpha-tACS limited improvements on a visual task where learning was otherwise observed. Consequently, alpha-tACS appeared to exert a consistently stabilizing effect on visual attention. Such effects were not seen in an auditory control task, indicating specificity to the visual domain. We suggest that these results are most consistent with the view that alpha oscillations facilitate processes of top-down control and attentional stability.

For the etiologic agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), a receptor has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recently it has been suggested that plasma membrane integrins may be involved in the internalization and replication of clinically important coronaviruses. For example, integrin αvβ3 is involved in the cell uptake of a model porcine enteric α-coronavirus that causes human epidemics. ACE2 modulates the intracellular signaling generated by integrins. OBJECTIVE We propose that the cellular internalization of αvβ3 applies to uptake of coronaviruses bound to the integrin, and we evaluate the possibility that clinical host T4 may contribute to target cell uptake of coronavirus and to the consequence of cell uptake of the virus. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The viral binding domain of the integrin is near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-binding site and RGD molecules can affect virus binding. In this same locale on integrin αvβ3 is the receptor for thyroid hormone analogues, particularly, L-thyroxine (T4). By binding to the integrin, T4 has been shown to modulate the affinity of the integrin for other proteins, to control internalization of αvβ3 and to regulate the expression of a panel of cytokine genes, some of which are components of the 'cytokine storm' of viral infections. If T4 does influence coronavirus uptake by target cells, other thyroid hormone analogues, such as deaminated T4 and deaminated 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), are candidate agents to block the virus-relevant actions of T4 at integrin αvβ3 and possibly restrict virus uptake.","Davis, Paul J; Lin, Hung-Yun; Hercbergs, Aleck; Keating, Kelly A; Mousa, Shaker A",Endocrine research,385,12

These intervention-generated inequalities may occur at different stages, including intervention uptake, adherence and effectiveness. We will synthesise evidence on how different measures of inequality moderate the uptake, adherence and effectiveness of behavioural weight management interventions in adults. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will update a previous systematic literature review from the United States Preventive Services Taskforce to identify trials of behavioural weight management interventions in adults aged 18 years and over that were, or could feasibly be, conducted in or recruited from primary care. Medline, Cochrane database (CENTRAL) and PsycINFO will be searched. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs will be included. Two investigators will independently screen articles for eligibility and conduct risk of bias assessment. We will curate publication families for eligible trials. The PROGRESS-Plus acronym (place of residence, race/ethnicity, occupation, gender, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, plus other discriminating factors) will be used to consider a comprehensive range of health inequalities. Data on trial uptake, intervention adherence, weight change and PROGRESS-Plus-related data will be extracted. Data will be synthesised narratively.

Complete genomic sequence analysis and pairwise comparison of nucleotide sequences encoding the S1 subunit of the spike protein and other structural and accessory proteins revealed that Chinese Ark field isolates were genetically closely related to the Jilin vaccine and American ArkDPI11 strains, although extensive nucleotide changes were found across the genomes of Chinese Ark field isolates. This suggests that Chinese Ark-type isolates are derived from the Jilin vaccine, and have diverged and evolved independently by point mutations since introduction into China. It is also possible that the Chinese Ark viruses have arisen as a result of different introductions of American ArkDPI11-like strains from the United States; this hypothesis requires further investigation. Pathogenicity testing showed that Chinese Ark viruses had comparable virulence to that of the Massachusetts-type M41 strain, although they had lower affinity for the kidneys of chickens than the M41 strain had. Although Ark-type viruses are not widespread in China, surveillance and updating the currently applied vaccination strategy for sound protection against IBV disease are important because this type of virus has caused heavy economic losses in the United States.","Han, Zongxi; Jiang, Lei; Zhao, Wenjun; Chen, Yuqiu; Xu, Liwen; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang",Avian diseases,385,20

This was accomplished by measuring indicators of lumbar motor control, specifically lumbar spinal stiffness, activity of lumbar extensor and flexor muscles and lumbar curvature, in hypergravity and microgravity during parabolic flights. Three female and five male subjects participated in this study. The mean age was 35.5 years (standard deviation: 8.5 years). Spinal stiffness of the L3 vertebra was measured using impulse response; activity of the erector spinae, multifidi, transversus abdominis, and psoas muscles was recorded using surface electromyography; and lumbar curvature was measured using distance sensors mounted on the back-plate of a full-body harness. An effect of gravity condition on spinal stiffness, activity of all muscles assessed and lumbar curvature (p's < 0.007) was observed (Friedman tests). Post hoc analysis showed a significant reduction in stiffness during hypergravity (p < 0.001) and an increase in stiffness during microgravity (p < 0.001). Activity in all muscles significantly increased during hypergravity (p's < 0.001). During microgravity, the multifidi (p < 0.002) and transversus abdominis (p < 0.001) increased significantly in muscle activity while no significant difference was found for the psoas (p = 0.850) and erector spinae muscles (p = 0.813). Lumbar curvature flattened in hypergravity as well as microgravity, albeit in different ways: during hypergravity, the distance to the skin decreased for the upper (p = 0.016) and the lower sensor (p = 0.036). During microgravity, the upper sensor showed a significant increase (p = 0.016), and the lower showed a decrease (p = 0.005) in distance. This study emphasizes the role of spinal motor control adaptations in changing gravity conditions. Both hypergravity and microgravity lead to changes in spinal motor control. The decrease in spinal stiffness during hypergravity is interpreted as a shift of the axial load from the spine to the pelvis and thoracic cage. In microgravity, activity of the multifidi and of the psoas muscles seems to ensure the integrity of the spine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We recruited patients from a group of 2,000 consecutive patients who underwent RARP from December, 2005 to June, 2020 by a single surgeon. Patient characteristics included age, body mass index (BMI), PSA level, pathology Gleason score, and pathology TNM staging. The variants regarding the patients' incisional hernia included incisional hernia occurrence time after RARP, defect size, operation time, console time, blood loss, and follow-up time after the herniation occurrence. Furthermore, we established a defect size of 3x2 cm2 as the cutoff value for using mesh reinforcement or not. RESULTS The mean defect area was 27.7 cm2, and the average operative time was 114.8 min, with a mean console time of 87 min. Blood loss was 32.5 ml, and the hospital stay for all patients was 3 days without complications. The mean follow-up period was 29.5 months, with no recurrence. CONCLUSION RIHR is a feasible surgical method that is not inferior to the traditional open or laparoscopic repair. Furthermore, RIHR can possibly lessen the burden of both the surgeon and patient.","Ou, Hsien-Che; Huang, Li-Hua; Chang, Kuang-Hsi; Ou, Yen-Chuan; Tung, Min-Che; Weng, Wei-Chun; Hsu, Chao-Yu; Lin, Yi-Sheng; Lu, Chin-Heng; Tsao, Tang-Yi",In vivo,385,19

Diagnosing PE in these patients is challenging as signs and symptoms of PE and COVID-19 show wide overlap, D-dimer levels are often elevated in the absence of thrombosis and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) may be unfeasible in the case of severe renal impairment and/or hemodynamic instability.This narrative review discusses available literature and guidelines on current diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE in special patient populations, in particular COVID-19. A special focus is on reviewing the literature aimed at identifying symptoms with a high suspicion for PE and on the diagnostic performance of diagnostic algorithms for suspected PE in the setting of COVID-19.Based on available literature, the index of suspicion for PE should be high in the case of unexplained abrupt worsening of respiratory status, typical symptoms of deep-vein thrombosis and/or acute unexplained right ventricular dysfunction. Despite the lack of prospective diagnostic management studies, we propose to adhere to current diagnostic algorithms applying assessment of pre-test probability and D-dimer testing as available evidence suggests that these might be considered safe. Preferably, algorithms using adjusted D-dimer thresholds are recommended as it likely improves the yield of the clinical decision rule/D-dimer combination.","Stals, Milou Anne Maria; Kaptein, Fleur; Kroft, Lucia; Klok, F A; Huisman, Menno V",Postgraduate medicine,385,1

One hundred and eighty laying Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were fed a basal diet or basal diet supplemented with either 2.5 or 5 g of taurine per kg of diet, and reared at either 22 ± 2 °C for 24 h/d (thermoneutral, TN) or 34 ± 2 °C for 8 h/d (HS) for 12 weeks. The quails reared under HS consumed less feed, produced less egg, and had lower dry matter, organic matter and crude protein apparent digestibilities compared with the quails reared under the TN condition (P = 0.001). However, increasing taurine concentrations in the diet improved feed intake and egg production (P = 0.001), but also the apparent digestibilities (P ≤ 0.027) in quails reared under HS. The greater doses (5 g/kg) of taurine resulted in more responses. The quails reared under HS had greater serum and liver MDA concentrations (P = 0.0001) which decreased with dietary taurine supplementations, particularly greater doses. The gene expressions of ileal PEPT1, EAAT3, CAT1, CAT2, SGLT1, SGLT5, GLUT2, and GLUT5 decreased under HS conditions (P = 0.001). However, supplementing taurine, in a dose-dependent fashion, to the diet of quails reared under HS resulted in increases in the gene expressions of the transporters (P < 0.05) except for CAT1. The results of the present work showed that taurine supplementation, particularly with greater doses (5 g/kg), to the diet of laying quails kept under HS acts as alleviating negative effects of HS, resulting in improvements in productive performance and nutrient digestion, and also upregulation of ileal nutrient transporters.","Orhan, Cemal; Kucuk, Osman; Sahin, Nurhan; Tuzcu, Mehmet; Sahin, Kazim",Journal of thermal biology,385,1

This research involves a quasi-experimental study with one group pre-test and post-test design, and was carried out from April to May 2020 in Serang, Banten Province, Indonesia. The education program was developed in seven days providing information door-to-door and direct consultation via a social media group for studied participants. The topics consisted of 7 themes, namely: (1) general information of 2019-nCoV;(2) transmission of 2019-nCoV;(3) signs and symptoms of 2019-nCoV;(4) what should I do if they have symptoms of COVID-19 and when should they seek medical help;(5) self-isolation;(6) how to use a mask correctly;(7) prevention of 2019-nCoV. The study had a total of 140 respondents. Knowledge of transmission routes and prevention and control for clinical presentation was enhanced after seven days experiencing the educational program.

It investigates how studying in an FC affects conceptual understanding and motivation to study mathematics among Arab high school students. The study also explores the factors that contribute to effective learning in the FC environment. Participants were 75 Arab high school students in 10th and 11th grades who studied advanced mathematics. Each grade group was randomly divided into two subgroups: an FC group and a traditional classroom group (comparison group). Quantitative questionnaires given before and after the learning program served to measure students’ motivation and conceptual understanding of the derivative and integral topics. Additionally, a random sample of students who studied in the FC group and the teacher who taught all the groups were interviewed. The study describes the positive effect an FC environment has on students’ conceptual understanding, particularly for 11th graders. The participants mostly appreciated how the FC resulted in less lecturing in class. The study contributes to the literature about FC among minorities and contributes to national and international efforts being made to reduce the gap in mathematics achievements between minorities and other sectors.","Sharkia, Halima",Mathematics,385,16

High-value changes should be identified and retained to improve resilience of cancer care. Methods: Cancer Australia reviewed the literature and consulted with oncology health professionals, cancer control experts and consumers to examine elements of cancer care that changed during the pandemic. Strategies that support high-value care and improve cancer outcomes were identified. Results: The pandemic highlighted models of care which minimise risk of infection for cancer patients, whilst optimising outcomes. Of the numerous cancer care elements that we examined, this abstract focuses on key enhancements in digital health and treatment practices. Digital health helped maintain quality and continuity of cancer care during the pandemic. Use of telehealth (for clinical and supportive care), eprescribing, and e-ordering of investigations increased, supported by national health system funding. Shared care between care settings was facilitated by rapid uptake of telehealth, ehealth records, virtual multidisciplinary team meetings and secure messaging. Treatment modifications included hypofractionated radiotherapy, transitioning to oral chemotherapy where possible, and home-based palliative care. Lower thresholds adopted for use of G-CSF with chemotherapy to reduce risk of febrile neutropenia, aimed to decrease hospital admission rates. It is important to address barriers to uptake of these high value changes. For digital health, variations in patient access to telehealth and digital health literacy can be reduced through technical and coordination support (tailored to people with diverse needs and backgrounds), with telehealth consultations offered in safe, accessible clinical or community settings. Administrative and technical burdens in health service settings can be mitigated through sustainable IT infrastructure, standardised processes for appointments, and improving staff digital health capabilities. Patient anxiety regarding changes in care plans can be mitigated through transparent, accessible, and culturally appropriate communication, documentation and shared decision-making. Clinician uncertainty in calculating risks and benefits in treatment modifications can be addressed through evidence-based standardised care procedures and riskstratification protocols. Conclusions: Many modifications to cancer care made during the pandemic can have long-term benefits and should become standard care, including enhancements in digital health and treatment practices. Strategies have been identified which enable these changes and address barriers to uptake at the system-, service-, practitioner-, and patient-level. Efforts to embed high value changes are required across the cancer control sector.","Milch, V.; Der Vartanian, C.; Austen, M.; Wang, R.; Woods, C. B.; Liu, L.; Ackland, S.

The purpose of this paper is to examine initial tax measures that are aimed at helping taxpayers needing liquidity, solvency and income support.Design/methodology/approachThis study undertakes a review of key tax policy responses of six jurisdictions across the globe that have similar tax regimes and virus mitigation strategies (albeit with different outcomes). Key initiatives implemented from February to April 2020 by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and the UK are examined.FindingsThis study indicates that tax concessions are a crude and mostly ineffective way of assisting individuals and enterprises in difficulty. In the longer term, if the crisis prompts desirable reforms such as extending the recognition of tax losses, the income tax system will emerge fairer and more efficient.Practical implicationsAn investigation of the short-term reforms announced relating to asset write-offs, tax deferral, tax losses and goods and services tax/value-added tax rates in light of the liquidity, income support and stimulus objectives shows that in some cases the policies may have been misguided. The findings can be used by policymakers as the basis for designing better targeted alternative non-tax responses.Originality/valueJurisdictional responses to tax policy reforms during a modern period of significant economic dislocation have yet to be documented in the literature.

With the current COVID-19 outbreak, it has become clear that the ED design needs to be altered in order to be successful in containing the pandemic. The purpose of this study is to use a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation to evaluate the ventilation system design for an emergency department at a university hospital. The kinetic energy and velocity patterns of turbulence were analyzed to determine which areas of the ED were most susceptible to viral transmission. Additionally, the impact of pressure suction on COVID-19 dispersion has been investigated. Three critical areas of the ED, overnight patient beds, surgical rooms, and resuscitation rooms, all had much higher air velocity, dispersion, and mixing levels than the rest of the department’s spaces, according to the simulation findings. Air transmission from these sites to adjacent regions is a possibility in the scenario studied, increasing the likelihood of the virus spreading from these locations and infecting people in the surrounding areas. The results of these simulations may be utilized to provide recommendations to the hospital administration about the placement of inlets and outlets, the separation of areas, and the interior design of the spaces and corridors.","Obeidat, Bushra Alrebei Odi Fawwaz Abdallah Ibrahim Atef Darwish Eman F.; Amhamed, Abdulkarem",Applied Sciences,385,0

Once inhaled, SARS-CoV-2 particles gain entry into respiratory ciliated cells by interacting with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is known that ACE2 functions within the renin-angiotensin system to regulate blood pressure, fluid homeostasis and inflammation. However, it is largely unknown what roles ACE2 has in ciliated cells of the airway. Therefore, understanding the function and nature of ACE2 within airway tissue has become an essential element in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Airway mucociliary tissue was generated in-vitro using primary human nasal epithelial cells isolated from nasal turbinates of donors and the air-liquid interface (ALI) model of differentiation. Using ALI tissue we cloned transcripts for three distinct variants of ACE2, one of which encodes the full-length ACE2 protein, the other two transcripts are truncated isoforms that had only been predicted to exist via sequence analysis software. We demonstrate that all three isoforms have the capacity to be glycosylated, a known modification of full-length ACE2. Immunofluorescence microscopy of individual ACE2 isoform transfected cells reveals distinct localization of variant 1 relative to X1 and X2. Double staining immunohistochemistry of ALI tissue using antibodies to either the N-term or C-term region of ACE2 revealed distinct and overlapping signals in the apical cytosol of ciliated cells. Most notably only the ACE2 C-term antibody displayed plasma-membrane localization in ciliated cells. We also observed a decrease in the total amount of ACE2 in ALI tissue derived from a 33 year-old male donor when compared to a 34 year-old female donor, thus there may be variation in the abundance of ACE2 protein in the airway among the population. Together, our data begins to highlight the dynamic status of the ACE2 protein in airway mucociliary tissue and we propose multiple ACE2 parameters that may impact an individual’s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. These parameters include the balance of cytosolic versus membrane bound ACE2, isoform expression levels, maintenance of post-translational modifications and the impact of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors on these processes.","Manna, Vincent J.; Caradonna, Salvatore J.",bioRxiv,385,22

However, currently there are no public laryngeal image datasets, which hinders the development of automatic classification of laryngeal disease. In this work, we build a new laryngeal image dataset called Laryngoscope8, which comprises 3057 images of 1950 unique individuals, and the images have been labeled with one of eight labels (including seven pathological labels and one normal label) by professional otolaryngologists. We also propose a laryngeal disease classification method, which uses attention mechanism to obtain the critical area under the supervision of image labels for laryngeal disease classification. That is, we first train a CNN model to classify the laryngeal images. If the classification result is correct, the region with strong response is most likely a critical area. The regions with strong responses are used as training data to train an object localization model that can automatically locate the critical area. Given an image for classification, the trained object localization model is employed to locate the critical area. Then, the located critical area is employed for image classification. The entire process only requires image-level labels and does not require manual labeling of the critical area. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves promising performance in laryngeal disease classification. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Yin, L.; Liu, Y.; Pei, M. T.; Li, J.

Here we report on the in-depth genotypic and phenotypic characterization of clonally expanded PC antibody repertoires following protein immunization. We find that there is only a strong correlation with antigen-specificity among the most expanded clones (top ~ 10), whereas among the rest of the clonal repertoire antigen-specificity is stochastic. Furthermore, we report both on a polyclonal repertoire and clonal lineage level that antibody-antigen binding affinity does not correlate with clonal expansion or somatic hypermutation. Lastly, we provide evidence for convergence towards dominant epitopes despite clonal sequence diversity among the most expanded clones. Our results highlight the extent to which clonal expansion can be ascribed to antigen binding, affinity and epitope specificity and they have implications for the assessment of effective vaccines.

The model is developed using balances of mass, energy, and species conservation in the components of the absorption cooling system, taking into account the effect of external streams through temperature and pressure drop. The whole system, coupled with the solar energy harvesting arrangement, is modeled for 24 h of operation with changes on an hourly basis based on ambient temperature, cooling system load demand, and hourly solar irradiation, which is measured and recorded by national weather institutes sources. Test through simulations and validation procedures are carried out with acknowledged scientific articles. These show 2.65% of maximum relative error on the energy analysis with respect to cited authors. The environmental conditions used in the study were evaluated in Barranquilla, Colombia, with datasets of the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM), considering multiannual average hourly basis solar irradiation. This allowed the authors to obtain the behavior of the surface temperature of the water in the tank, COP, and exergy efficiency of the system. The simulations also stated the generator as the biggest source of irreversibility with around 45.53% of total exergy destruction in the inner cycle without considering the solar array, in which case the solar array would present the most exergy destruction.","José Cabrera, César Ortiz Jean Caratt Guillermo Valencia Ochoa Rafael Ramírez Restrepo Nuñez Alvarez José R.",Lubricants,385,20

Low public health funding was a barrier to accessing sexual healthcare before the pandemic and intensified during restrictions. Surveillance of the sexual healthcare landscape can inform program development to improve sexual health. Methods We collected information from clinics offering STI testing in the St. Louis region, Missouri, USA twice during 2020: in the spring during the first pandemic lockdown and in the fall as restrictions eased. Clinics were interviewed about sexual health services and categorized into three categories: open fully with no changes;modified if hours open and/or the ability to accept walk-ins were reduced;or fully closed. We also collected chlamydia rates by zip code and categorized zip codes as low (0-174 cases per 100,000);medium (175- 653);or high (654-1291) prevalence. Results Of the 112 clinics, 47 are federally qualified health centers (serve the un-and underinsured);16 were local public health authorities;and the remaining 49 include community, school, and private settings. In the fall, 29% of clinics were open, 55% modified, 5% closed compared with spring when 7% of clinics were open, 63% were modified, 17% were closed. There was a 450% and 200% increase in the number of clinics that were open in high and medium prevalence zip codes respectively in the fall compared to the spring. Fortynine clinics remain modified or closed in medium and high prevalence zip codes. Discussion The COVID pandemic has a significant effect on sexual health care in a metropolitan region of the US;that effect is lasting, especially in areas of medium and high chlamydia rates. Health systems must consider how the pandemic has impacted care provided for all major public health problems, including STIs/HIV or risk worsening sexual health..","Trolard, A.; Weingarten, L.; Cherabie, J.; Reno, H.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,385,16

So, we aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among the healthcare workers by characterizing the breakthrough infections which occurred 14 days after the second dose of the vaccine. Methods: We prospectively evaluated the Institutional Covid Vaccination Database to categorize the SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers into 2 cohorts: infected vaccinated and infected unvaccinated cohort. Along with comparing the descriptive statistics of the cohorts, the relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the vaccine effectiveness were calculated. The study population was compared for the significant difference by using the parametric model (binary logistic regression) for the Odds ratio and the non-parametric model (cox proportionality model) for the Hazard ratio. Results: Out of the 324 healthcare workers employed in our institution 243 (75%) were vaccinated. When 6.58% (16) of the vaccinated healthcare workers were tested positive, 43.75% (35) were infected in the unvaccinated cohort and the median time of infection in the vaccinated cohort was 65 days (range 20 - 91 days). While the cox proportionality model reveals that the age, sex, and the contact exposure status of the cohort are not significant factors for getting infected after being vaccinated, binary logistic regression proves that a significant relationship exists between the incidence of infection and the unvaccinated status (p = 0.001, OR = 4.278). Completing the two-dose of vaccination decreased the hazard of testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 by 84.96 % when compared with the unvaccinated individuals, which is the effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in the upcoming months. So, primary infection control measures should be followed even if vaccinated, to prevent the risk of breakthrough infections.","Issac, A.; Kochuparambil, J. J.; Elizabeth, L.",,385,1

Settings: Anesthesia practitioners are at inherent risk for percutaneous injuries by blood-contaminated needles and sharp objects that may result in transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses. Percutaneous injuries are underreported, and data is limited and decades old. Participants: After institutional research board approval, an email to participate in an online survey was sent to 217 members of the anesthesia department at the University of Miami. Responses were collected in March 2020. Results: The overall response rate was 51% (110/217). 59% (95% CI, 50 68) of participants reported having one or more CPI (42% residents, 50% fellows, 77% attendings). 29% (95% CI, 17 41) of attendings reported sustaining a CPI within the last 5 years.

Our previous work confirmed that the association of a group of predictors differed across different types of RNA viruses, yet there have been no previous comparisons of the specific predictors for RNA virus discovery in different regions. The aim of the current study was to close the gap by investigating whether predictors of discovery rates within three regions—the United States, China and Africa—differ from one another and from those at the global level. Methods Based on a comprehensive list of human-infective RNA viruses, we collated published data on first discovery of each species in each region. We used a Poisson boosted regression tree (BRT) model to examine the relationship between virus discovery and 33 predictors representing climate, socio-economics, land use, and biodiversity across each region separately. The discovery probability in three regions in 2010–2019 was mapped using the fitted models and historical predictors. Results The numbers of human-infective virus species discovered in the United States, China and Africa up to 2019 were 95, 80 and 107 respectively, with China lagging behind the other two regions. In each region, discoveries were clustered in hotspots. BRT modelling suggested that in all three regions RNA virus discovery was best predicted by land use and socio- economic variables, followed by climatic variables and biodiversity, though the relative importance of these predictors varied by region. Map of virus discovery probability in 2010– 2019 indicated several new hotspots outside historical high-risk areas. Most new virus species since 2010 in each region (6/6 in the United States, 19/19 in China, 12/19 in Africa) were discovered in high risk areas as predicted by our model. Conclusions The drivers of spatiotemporal variation in virus discovery rates vary in different regions of the world. Within regions virus discovery is driven mainly by land-use and socio- economic variables; climate and biodiversity variables are consistently less important predictors than at a global scale. Potential new discovery hotspots in 2010–2019 are identified. Results from the study could guide active surveillance for new human-infective viruses in local high risk areas.

The distribution of the disease among the territories is heterogeneous. Long-range inter-hospital transport of critically ill COVID-19 patients as a way to mitigate the localised pressure from overloaded intensive care units at a national or international level has not been reported yet. The aim of this article was to provide descriptive data about the six collective aeromedical evacuation of COVID-19 patients performed within Europe and French national territory on March 18, 21, 24, 27, 31 and April 3, 2020. Thirty-six patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were transported aboard six aeromedical evacuation missions. ARDS was moderate (PaO2/FiO2 ratio > 100 and ≤ 200) in 24 patients and mild (PaO2/FiO2 ratio > 200 and ≤ 300) in 12 patients. The median duration of mechanical ventilation in ICU before transportation was 4 days [Interquartile (IQ): 3-5]. The median PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 180 mmHg (IQ: 156-202). The median norepinephrine infusion rate was 0.08 μg/kg/min. No life-threatening event was reported. Collective aeromedical evacuation of COVID-19 critically ill patients could provide a reliable solution to help control the burden of the disease at a national or international level. Future works may evaluate the global safety and effectiveness of aeromedical evacuations in this context.","Beaussac, M.; Distinguin, B.; Turc, J.; Boutonnet, M.",Annales Francaises de Medecine d'Urgence,385,5

Here, we describe the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 using near-full genomes sampled from 27 Brazilian states and an adjacent country - Paraguay. We show that the early stage of the pandemic in Brazil was characterised by the co-circulation of multiple viral lineages, linked to multiple importations predominantly from Europe, and subsequently characterized by large local transmission clusters. As the epidemic progressed, the absence of effective restriction measures led to the local emergence and international spread of Variants of Concern (VOC) and under monitoring (VUM), including the Gamma (P.1) and Zeta (P.2) variants. In addition, we provide a preliminary genomic overview of the epidemic in Paraguay, showing evidence of importation from Brazil. These data reinforce the need for the implementation of widespread genomic surveillance in South America as a toolkit for pandemic monitoring and providing a means to follow the real-time spread of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants with possible implications for public health and immunization strategies.","Giovanetti, M.; Nanev Slavov, S.; Fonseca, V.; Wilkinson, E.; Tegally, H.; Patane, J.; Viala, V.

The aim of this study was to present how gastrointestinal system surgery operations are managed without delay and how employee safety is ensured, together with the results of the last five months. For this purpose, a preclinical and clinical screening system was created. Material and Methods: Data of the patients who presented to our outpatient clinic between April 1st 2020 and August 31st 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: During the last five months of the pandemic, a total of 387 patients were hospitalized and 309 of these patients underwent surgical procedures. 165 of the patients who underwent surgery were newly diagnosed malignancy patients. All patients who were hospitalized were subjected to a screening for COVID-19 during the preclinical, clinical and surgical period. In the preclinical period, five patients were found positive and were directed to COVID-19 treatment without hospitalization. In the clinical period, six patients were isolated by showing symptoms during the hospitalization period. Only one of these patients received surgical treatment. The remaining five patients underwent endoscopic and interventional procedures. In this process, COVID-19 positivity was detected in a total of five healthcare workers.

To investigate whether pAPN was a receptor for PEDV, we transfected MDCK cells with porcine aminopeptidase (pAPN) cDNA and this enabled non-susceptible cells to support PEDV replication and serial viral propagation. Moreover, the infection was blocked by antibodies against pAPN, implying the critical role of pAPN during virus entry. In addition, immunofluorescence assays for detection of pAPN and PEDV antigens, together with neutralization assays using antibodies against pAPN, further confirmed the correlation between pAPN expression and viral replication in pAPN-transfected MDCK cells. These results indicated that pAPN is a functional receptor for PEDV.","Li, Bao-xian; Ma, Guang-peng; Ge, Jun-wei; Li, Yi-jing",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,385,1

These tumors can cause symptoms including abdominal pain, obstruction, intussusception, volvulus, GI bleeding, or amass and should be resected if symptomatic. Open surgical resection is considered the standard for removing these tumors. However, recent improvements in endoscopic and laparoscopic equipment have made it possible to utilize minimally invasive techniques of tumor removal including complete endoscopic resection or endoscopic-assisted laparoscopic resection. We present the case of an adolescent female with a large mass located at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) causing GI bleeding. Given the location of the mass near the GEJ and the morbidity associated with surgical resection, we performed laparoscopic-assisted complete endoscopic resection of tumor. In addition, this tumor had an unusual immunohistochemical-staining pattern, with focal expression of markers more often seen in GI stromal tumors, elucidating a gray area between these two tumor classes with potential implications for patient follow-up. Laparoscopic-assisted endoscopic resection of benign tumors is a useful technique that can be employed to facilitate resection of mucosal and subserosal masses near the GEJ with minimal morbidity.","Acker, Shannon; Dishop, Megan; Kobak, Gregory; Vue, Padade; Somme, Stig",European journal of pediatric surgery reports,385,24

The method is recyclable because majority (>88%) of [BMIm+Cl-], an ionic liquid (IL), used as the sole solvent, was recovered for reuse. Experimentally, it was confirmed that unique properties of each component remain intact in the composites, namely bactericide (from KER and CS) and anti-inflammatory property (from KER). Specifically, the composites were examined for their anti-inflammatory influence on macrophages. The cells were imaged and immunophenotyped to determine the quantity using the macrophage marker CD11b. The 75:25 [KER+CS] composite was found to have the least amount of CD11b macrophages compared to other composites. Bactericidal assays indicated that all composites, except the 25:75 [KER+CS], substantially reduce the growth of organisms such as vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and Eschericia coli.

Despite their high risk of stroke and clear indication for anticoagulation according to established risk scores, in practice geriatric AF patients often are withheld treatment because of comorbidities and comedications, concerns about low treatment adherence or fear of bleeding events, in particular due to falls. METHOD The present position paper summarises the outcomes of an expert panel discussion held by hospital-based and office-based physicians with ample experience in the treatment of geriatric patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The panel agreed that geriatric patients should receive oral anticoagulation as a rule, unless a comprehensive neurological and geriatric assessment (including clinical examination, gait tests and validated instruments such as Modified Rankin Scale, Mini-mental state examination or Timed Test of Money Counting) provides sound reasons for refraining from treatment AII patients with a history of falls should be thoroughly evaluated for further evaluation of the causes. Patients with CHADS2 score ≥ 2 should receive anticoagulation even if at high risk for falls. The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) facilitate management in the geriatric population with AF (no INR monitoring needed, easier bridging during interventions) and have an improved benefit-risk ratio compared to vitamin K antagonists.

We present our technique of the resection. METHOD Videos of patients having had left lateral sectionectomies were reviewed. Patients were placed in supine with reverse Trendelenburg position. Three ports were used: one 12 mm at the umbilicus for the camera, one 12 mm placed 5 cm above and to the right of the umbilicus and one 5 mm port to the left. A Ligasure® 5 mm (Covidien®) was used to take down the falciform ligament initially staying close to the abdominal wall and then stopping at the bifurcation of the two layers of peritoneum. The triangular ligament was incised to create a window between diaphragm and liver. Unlike open surgery the entire ligament was not mobilised at this stage. A line was scored on the left of the falciform ligament. Transection of the parenchyma was achieved with Ligasure®. Once the liver parenchyma was thinned, an endostapler - EndoGIA® Gold (Covidien®) - was be used to complete the transection. It was also possible to dissect out individual vessels and ligate with Hem-o-lok® (Teleflex®) clips in one case. The cut surface was examined for bleeding or bile leaks. A small pencil drain was placed. RESULTS Three patients had laparoscopic resections. All were female. Two cases were haemangioma with one diagnosed preoperatively and the other not having typical features on imaging. The third case was a large adenoma in a patient with hepatic adenomatosis. No bile leaks were noted. No patient required blood transfusion. Average length of stay was 1 day. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy is a stepping stone to more complex laparoscopic liver resections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Power analysis calculated a minimum sample size of 150 participants at 99% confidence level with a 5% margin of error. To homogenize responses elicited by different preventive measures by various national governments, only Italian dentists were included in the survey: overall 500 responses were collected. RESULTS Of the 500 analyzed respondents, there were 266 females and 234 males; 379 practitioners were allocated in the more experienced groups, and the remaining 121 in the less experienced group based on less or more than 5 years of practice. The 70% of the dentists consider the dental practice more dangerous for the diffusion of COVID-19 than other social activities. The 5% consider dental practice more dangerous only for the patients. Aerosol contamination was perceived as a risk from the most dentist (70%), but there was agreement on the most dangerous way of cross infection in dental settings. Most of the dentists (55%) believed implementations in their protocols were needed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infections. No significant differences were found within the groups: both women and men, as well as practitioners with different experience levels (younger or older than 35 years) perceived very similarly the problems related to COVID-19 in dentistry (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION The survey demonstrated that COVID-19 had a great impact on dental practitioners; it increased not only fear of aerosol contamination during dental treatments but also influenced the fear of close contacts. SIGNIFICANCE Airborne and waterborne infections are related with dental treatments and considered the preferred ways of diffusion for COVID-19. The risk of aerosol-related infections could interfere with the clinical practice of the dentist, during the COVID-19 pandemic; the limitations that provided changes to everyday behavior could affect the perception of the safety of the operators, staff, and patient and this could also affect economically the dental office.","Gambarini, Gianluca; Galli, Massimo; Gambarini, Elisa; Di Nardo, Dario; Seracchiani, Marco; Obino, Federico Valenti; Patil, Shankargouda; Bhandi, Shilpa; Miccoli, Gabriele; Testarelli, Luca",The journal of contemporary dental practice,385,17

AIM To obtain national estimates on clinically suspected Covid-19 mortality in general practice and on intensive and palliative covid-19 care provided by general practitioners (GPs) outside hospital, including palliative medication, availability of personal protective equipment, and reasons for not referring to hospital of vulnerable patients during the first three months of the Covid-19 pandemic in The Netherlands. DESIGN Nationwide registration study, in which 2.331 GP practices in The Netherlands participated from March-June 2020. METHOD Registration system initiated by General Practice Research Consortium Netherlands (GPRC-NL) through existing digital referral platform ZorgDomein, in which GPs could report PCR-proven and clinically suspected Covid-19 deceased patients to estimate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in primary care. RESULTS GPs reported 1,566 Covid-19 deceased patients, of which 61% (949/1,566) were clinically suspected but not PCR-tested, with large regional differences, and most deaths being reported in the provinces of Brabant and Limburg. Patients had a median duration from onset of symptoms to death of 8 days and a median age of 87 years. GPs reported 1,030 patients for which they delivered intensive or palliative care, of which 56% had a Clinical Frailty Score higher or equal to six. Most mentioned reason for GPs and patients in the decision not going to hospital were the explicit wish of the patient (59%) and somatic vulnerability (52%). CONCLUSION GPs provided palliative care to a large number of clinically suspected Covid-19 vulnerable patients with large regional differences across The Netherlands. Reported GPs' and patients' considerations to refrain from hospital care can be used to guide future primary care for vulnerable Covid-19 patients.","Cals, J W L; Derckx, R; Blanker, M H",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,385,12

The main patient selection criterion for RT is the size of the mismatch between the potentially salvageable tissue (penumbra) and the irreversibly damaged tissue (core). The goal of revascularization RT is to ""freeze"" the core and prevent it from extending to the penumbral tissue. Penumbral imaging selection of AIS patients for RT, using magnetic resonance or CT-based studies, may provide more clinical benefit to the appropriate patients, although direct evidence is pending. Not all penumbra-core mismatches beyond 3 hours are equal and need treatment, and defining which mismatches to target for RT is the current goal of ongoing clinical trials. In addition to ""penumbral""-based imaging, large vessel occlusion and clot length estimation based on CT angiography and noncontrasted ultrathin CT scan has been used to identify patients who are refractory to systemic thrombolysis and may be eligible for endovascular therapy. The application of various imaging modalities in selecting and triaging AIS patients for RT is discussed in this review. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed to better understand the role of various imaging modalities in selecting AIS patients for RT and to understand its influence on clinical outcome.","Shang, Tiesong; Yavagal, Dileep R",Neurology,385,8

And is it possible?,20.526745,3.4282186,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is highly pathogenic in humans, with a death rate near 10%. This high pathogenicity suggests that SARS-CoV has developed mechanisms to overcome the host innate immune response. It has now been determined that SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) 3b, ORF 6, and N proteins antagonize interferon, a key component of the innate immune response. All three proteins inhibit the expression of beta interferon (IFN-beta), and further examination revealed that these SARS-CoV proteins inhibit a key protein necessary for the expression of IFN-beta, IRF-3. N protein dramatically inhibited expression from an NF-kappaB-responsive promoter. All three proteins were able to inhibit expression from an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter after infection with Sendai virus, while only ORF 3b and ORF 6 proteins were able to inhibit expression from the ISRE promoter after treatment with interferon. This indicates that N protein inhibits only the synthesis of interferon, while ORF 3b and ORF 6 proteins inhibit both interferon synthesis and signaling. ORF 6 protein, but not ORF 3b or N protein, inhibited nuclear translocation but not phosphorylation of STAT1. Thus, it appears that these three interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV inhibit the interferon response by different mechanisms.","Kopecky-Bromberg, Sarah A; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Frieman, Matthew; Baric, Ralph A; Palese, Peter",Journal of virology,385,26

OBJECTIVES To compare the characteristics of patients with a hip fracture following a fall during the COVID-19 pandemic year and during the preceding year. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of older patients who had undergone surgery for hip fracture repair in a major 495-bed hospital located in northern central Israel following a fall. Characteristics of patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 (pandemic year, n=136) and in 2019 (non-pandemic year, n=151) were compared. RESULTS During the pandemic year, patients were less likely to have fallen in a nursing facility, to have had muscle or balance problems, and to have had a history of falls and fractures following a fall. Moreover, the average length of stay (LOS) in the hospital was shorter; however, the average time from the injury to hospitalization was longer. Patients were less likely to have acquired a postoperative infection or to have died. During the pandemic year, postoperative infection was only associated with prolonged LOS. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic may have had a positive impact on the behavior of older adults as well as on the management of hip fracture patients. However, healthcare providers should be aware of the possible reluctance to seek care during a pandemic. Moreover, further research on the impact of the change in management during COVID-19 on hip fracture survival is warranted.","Steinfeld, Yaniv; Ben Natan, Merav; Yonai, Yaniv; Berkovich, Yaron",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,385,11

General anesthesia and spinal blockage are the most common forms of anesthesia. We consider that this surgery can be managed with intra-articular local anesthesia, thus avoiding prolonged stays in recovery, with effective pain management and optimization of presurgical, intrasurgical and post-surgical times. MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective, quasi-experimental, longitudinal study to compare two anesthetic procedures: intraarticular anesthesia (lidocaine with epinephrine, bupivacaine and fentanyl) without the use of ischemia (group A); spinal blockage and use of ischemia (group B) by assessing age, surgery time, pain during surgery and 24 hour post-op VA scale, time spent in recovery, need to administer general anesthesia or anesthetic rescue doses, 24-hour range of motion. Student t-test, significance level was used: p 0.05 for nonparametric variables and 2 parametric variables. RESULTS 38 patients were included per group. The surgical time (45 min vs 39 min, p = 0.03), recovery time (1.9 vs 3 hours, p = 0.0004) were lower in group A, while pain during surgery was greater (17 vs 3%, p = 0.09), without requiring general anesthesia. CONCLUSION The advantages in favor of intraarticular anesthesia were: shortened hospital stays, less pain at 24 hours, safety in its application. Its disadvantage is the possibility of pain during surgery and sedation is sufficient as adjuvant.","Martínez-Navarro, J L; Espinoza-Castolo, M; Vargas-Vargas, S F",Acta ortopedica mexicana,385,28

Also, there are described gastrointestinal manifestations: anorexia 27%, diarrhea 12%, nausea/vomiting 10%, and abdominal pain 9%. In Chile, diarrhea has been described in 7.3%, and abdominal pain 3.7%. The primary mechanism proposed is the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the enterocytes binding the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely distributed among the gastrointestinal tract. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can cause elevated liver enzymes in up to 40% of cases. This alteration could also be caused by the binding to the ACE2 receptor in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes are more frequent in severe cases. Viral RNA has been detected in stools, which may suggest a possible fecal-oral transmission. It is essential to pay attention to gastrointestinal manifestations because they are frequent and more prevalent in severe cases.

Methods: The TCMSP database was employed to collect and screen the active ingredients of the Chinese herb contained in the XBJ injection. The GeneCards database and STRING database were applied to collect and expand the targets of COVID-19 and compare and screen the related targets of COVID-19 by XBJ injection. Cytoscape was employed to build a network connecting Chinese medicine, compounds, targets, disease, and topology analysis was performed via the Network Analyzer to screen the key ingredients and targets. The software of Schrödinger molecular docking was used to verify the binding activity of the key ingredients of XBJ injection and the key targets of COVID-19. Metascape platform and DAVID database were utilized to conduct Gene Ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis on the key targets of COVID-19 treated by XBJ injection. Results: Eight key compounds and 15 key targets were screened and verified by molecular docking; these key compounds included luteolin, quercetin, baicalein, and kaempferol. The key targets included DPP4, AR, ESR1, CALM1, and protein kinase 1. Gene Ontology analysis involved an apoptosis and hypoxia reaction and the changes in blood vessel morphology. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis involved signaling pathways of hypoxia inducible factor-1, VEGF, and PI3K/AKT/NF-κB. Conclusion: The mechanism of XBJ injection when used to treat COVID-19 should be further investigated as the key compounds in XBJ regulated the expression of key targets such as protein kinase 1, VEGF-A, B-cell lymphoma-2, and TNF, which affected the COVID-19 receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and signaling pathways like hypoxia inducible factor-1, PI3K-Akt, and NF-κB, which alleviated the inflammation, respiratory distress, and hypoxia caused by COVID-19 infection.","Zhang, Yu-Liang; Cui, Qian; Zhang, Dou; Ma, Xin; Zhang, Guo-Wei",Traditional Med.Res.,385,16

Until now, there is no specific drug therapy or vaccine available for the treatment of COVID-19. However, some potential antimalarial drugs like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, antifilarial drug ivermectin and antiviral drugs have been tested by many research groups worldwide for their possible effect against the COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin have been identified to act by creating the acidic condition in cells and inhibiting the importin (IMP&#945;/ß1) mediated viral import. There is a possibility that some other antimalarial drugs/antibiotics in combination with immunomodulators may help in combatting this pandemic disease. Therefore, this review focuses on the current use of various drugs as single agents (hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, azithromycin, favipiravir, remdesivir, umifenovir, teicoplanin, nitazoxanide, doxycycline, and dexamethasone) or in combinations with immunomodulators additionally.

Siblings often play a crucial support role for their brothers and sisters with IDD. As such, this study aimed to describe the experiences of adult siblings of people with IDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Sibling Collaborative worked with researchers to codesign an online survey, completed by 91 people, exploring sibling supports and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey also aimed to identify helpful resources for siblings during this time. RESULTS: The results showed that the majority of siblings are supporting their brother or sister with IDD during the COVID-19 pandemic and are concerned about the health and well-being of their brother/sister. The most common concern related to disruption of their brother's or sister's routine and activities. Although responses of older and younger siblings did not differ from each other, siblings whose brother or sister with IDD lived with family had some unique concerns relative to those whose siblings no longer lived with family. Siblings described how their own self-care and relationships with others, as well as support for their brother/sister, were particularly helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Siblings are providing key support to their brother or sister with IDD during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they too must be supported. Siblings should be included in efforts to disseminate resources targeting people with IDD and their feedback and input must be obtained. It is also important to include sibling mental wellness as caregiver supports are created and implemented. More research is needed to further understand how to support sibling caregivers.","Redquest, B K; Tint, A; Ries, H; Lunsky, Y",J Intellect Disabil Res,385,16

We describe the development of a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) into framework regions of a human germline immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) allele. Panning this library against SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1 subunit identified fully human single-domain antibodies targeting five distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of these antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by targeting a cryptic epitope located in the spike trimeric interface.

Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance have been the main targets for machine learning applications. However, this paper focuses on the identification of precursors, which is a relatively newer application. Precursors are events correlated with adverse events that happen prior to the adverse event itself. Therefore, precursor mining provides many benefits including understanding the reasons behind a safety incident and the ability to identify signatures, which can be tracked throughout a flight to alert the operators of the potential for an adverse event in the future. This work proposes using the multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework, a weakly supervised learning task, combined with carefully designed binary classifier leveraging a Multi-Head Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (MHCNN-RNN) architecture. Multi-class classifiers are then created and compared, enabling the prediction of different adverse events for any given flight by combining binary classifiers, and by modifying the MHCNN-RNN to handle multiple outputs. Results obtained showed that the multiple binary classifiers perform better and are able to accurately forecast high speed and high path angle events during the approach phase. Multiple binary classifiers are also capable of determining the aircraft's parameters that are correlated to these events. The identified parameters can be considered precursors to the events and may be studied/tracked further to prevent these events in the future.","Bleu-Laine, Marc-Henri; Puranik, Tejas G.; Mavris, Dimitri N.; Matthews, Bryan",,385,20

These data highlight the need for accelerating and improving MDR-TB screening, diagnostic, treatment and patient follow-up services. The last decade has seen three new TB drugs being licensed; bedaquiline, delamanid and pretomanid, and combinations these new, existing and repurposed drugs are leading to improved cure rates. The all oral six month WHO regimen for MDR-TB is more tolerable, has higher treatment success rates and lower mortality. However, the unprecedented ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having major direct and indirect negative impacts on health services overall, including national TB programs and TB services. This adds further to longstanding challenges for tackling MDR-TB such as cost, rollout of diagnostics and drugs, and implementation of latest WHO guidelines for MDR-TB. In light of COVID-19 disruption of TB services, it is anticipated the numbers of MDR-TB cases will rise in 2021 and 2022 and will affect treatment outcomes further. Investing more in development of new TB drugs and shorter MDR-TB treatment regimens is required in anticipation of emerging drug resistance to new TB drug regimens. There is an urgent need for protecting current investments in TB services, sustaining gains being made in TB control and accelerating roll out of TB diagnostic and treatment services.","Tiberi, Simon; Vjecha, Michael J; Zumla, Adam; Galvin, Jessica; Migliori, Giovanni Battista; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int. j. infect. dis,385,21

OBJECTIVES: We investigated a multinational database of patients with COVID-19 with real-world data containing outcomes and their relationship to HCQ use. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of follow-up. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving HCQ within 48 hours of hospital admission. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Among patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 in our propensity-matched cohort, the mean ages ± SD were 62.3 ± 15.9 years (53.7% male) and 61.9 ± 16.0 years (53.0% male) in the HCQ and no-HCQ groups, respectively. There was no difference in overall 30-day mortality between the HCQ and no-HCQ groups (HCQ 13.1%, n=367; no HCQ 13.6%, n=367; odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.46) after propensity matching. Although statistically insignificant, the HCQ-azithromycin (AZ) group had an overall mortality rate of 14.6% (n=199) compared with propensity-matched no-HCQ-AZ cohort's rate of 12.1% (n=199, OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.70-2.22). Importantly, however, there was no trend in this cohort's overall mortality/arrhythmogenesis outcome (HCQ-AZ 17.1%, no HCQ-no AZ 17.1%; OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: We report from a large retrospective multinational database analysis of COVID-19 outcomes with HCQ and overall mortality in hospitalized patients.

Methods: This paper presents the interim results of a longitudinal study being carried out in Hubei province. As of 1 April 2020, 24 mothers confirmed with COVID-19, 19 mothers suspected with COVID-19 but Polymerase chain reaction negative, and 21 mothers without COVID-19 and their neonates have been recruited. Telephone follow-up was conducted to collect information on breastfeeding practices. Forty-four breast milk samples were collected from 16 of the 24 mothers with confirmed COVID-19 for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) ribonucleic acid (RNA) and antibodies (IgM and IgG) testing. Findings: The average mother-child separation time was 36*7 +/- 21*1 days among mothers confirmed with COVID-19, significantly longer than that of the suspected group (16*6 +/- 13*1 days) and control group (10*5 +/- 8*2 days). Both the COVID-19 confirmed (58*3%) and suspected (52*6%) groups presented significantly lower rates of breastfeeding as compared with the control group (95*2%). All 44 breast milk samples tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Thirty-eight breast milk samples underwent antibody testing and all tested negative for IgG. Twenty-one breast milk samples from 8 women tested positive for IgM, while the remaining samples from 11 women tested negative. Interpretation: Considering the lack of evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk, breastfeeding counselling along with appropriate hand hygiene precautions and facemasks should be provided to all pregnant women.

Its major clinical presentation is characterized by respiratory symptoms ranging from mild cough to serve pneumonia with fever and potentially even death. Until today, there is no known medication to improve clinical symptoms or even prevent or fight the infection. The search for a useful vaccination is ongoing and it will probably not be available before the end of 2020. In this review, we highlight hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a potential agent to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reduce as well as shorten clinical symptoms. Moreover, it might serve as a potential post-exposition prophylaxis. Although it has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid or systemic lupus erythematosus, and malaria prophylaxis and therapy for decades, knowledge on HCQ as a potential treatment for COVID-19 is limited and multiple clinical trials have just emerged. Especially, rare HCQ side effects which were of minor importance for use in selected indications might gain major relevance with population-wide application. These rare side effects include retinopathy and-even more important-QT prolongation leading to sudden cardiac death by malignant arrhythmias.","Stremmel, Christopher; Kellnar, Antonia; Massberg, Steffen; Kääb, Stefan",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol Ther,385,30

Case rates increased again in early June 2021 in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals. To determine whether the surge was due to the emergence of Delta or another variant, or vaccine failure, a rapid, opportunistic investigation was conducted that comprised virus sequence analysis of nasal swab samples from breakthrough cases and antibody assays of plasma from healthy vaccinees. More than 90% of breakthrough infections during the second case surge were due to the Alpha variant.

Restrictions imposed during the pandemic, social isolation, and the cancellation of medical appointments likely resulted in stress that may have affected pregnant women adversely. AIMS: To determine the psychometric validity of the Italian version of the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) in assessing COVID-19-related stress in pregnant women and to examine correlations between PREPS scales and symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: 232 pregnant women attending the Obstetric-Gynecologic Clinic of an Academic Hospital were assessed with the PREPS, the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). We analyzed the internal consistency and factor structure of the PREPS. Convergent validity was examined by comparison with the NuPDQ. PHQ-2 and GAD-7 were used to measure the association with depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Acceptable-to-good internal consistency was found for the three PREPS scales: Preparedness Stress (PS, &#945;=0.760), Prenatal Infection Stress (PIS, &#945;=0.857), and Positive Appraisal (PA, &#945;=0.747). Correlations of the NuPDQ with both PREPS stress scale scores (PS and PIS) were statistically significant, but on multiple regression analysis only the PS scale was correlated with the NuPDQ. Prenatal infection stress predicted GAD-7 score, while Preparedness stress predicted PHQ-2 score. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations were the small sample size and the cross-sectional design of the study. CONCLUSION: The Italian PREPS exhibited good psychometric properties and associations with clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Penengo, Chiara; Colli, Chiara; Garzitto, Marco; Driul, Lorenza; Sala, Alessia; Degano, Matilde; Preis, Heidi; Lobel, Marci; Balestrieri, Matteo",J Affect Disord,385,24

This study was done to estimate the prevalence of OSA in patients with COVID-19 using various screening questionnaires and to assess effect of OSA on outcome of disease. Methodology: In this prospective observational study, consecutive patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 were screened for OSA by different questionnaires (STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire, NoSAS, and Epworth Scale). Association between OSA, outcome (mortality) and requirement for respiratory support was assessed. Results: In study of 213 patients; screening questionnaires for OSA [STOPBANG, Berlin Questionnaire (BQ), NoSAS] were more likely to be positive in patients who died compared to patients who survived. On binary logistic regression analysis, age &#8805; 55 and STOPBANG score &#8805; 5 were found to have small positive but independent effect on mortality even after adjusting for other variables. Proportion of patients who were classified as high risk for OSA by various OSA screening tools significantly increased with increasing respiratory support (p < 0.001 for STOPBANG, BQ, ESS and p = 0.004 for NoSAS). Conclusion: This is one of the first prospective studies of sequentially hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 status who were screened for possible OSA could be an independent risk factor for poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Kar, Avishek; Saxena, Khushboo; Goyal, Abhishek; Pakhare, Abhijit; Khurana, Alkesh; Saigal, Saurabh; Bhagtana, Parneet Kaur; Chinta, Sridevi S K R; Niwariya, Yogesh",Sleep Vigil,385,16

Schools and colleges are transitioning online to provide more resources to their students. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided students more opportunities to learn and improve themselves at their own pace. Online proctoring services (part of assessment) are also on the rise, and AI-based proctoring systems (henceforth called as AIPS) have taken the market by storm. Online proctoring systems (henceforth called as OPS), in general, makes use of online tools to maintain the sanctity of the examination. While most of this software uses various modules, the sensitive information they collect raises concerns among the student community. There are various psychological, cultural and technological parameters need to be considered while developing AIPS. This paper systematically reviews existing AI and non-AI-based proctoring systems. Through the systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science and ERIC repositories, 43 paper were listed out from the year 2015 to 2021. We addressed 4 primary research questions which were focusing on existing architecture of AIPS, Parameters to be considered for AIPS, trends and Issues in AIPS and Future of AIPS. Our 360-degree analysis on OPS and AIPS reveals that security issues associated with AIPS are multiplying and are a cause of legitimate concern. Major issues include Security and Privacy concerns, ethical concerns, Trust in AI-based technology, lack of training among usage of technology, cost and many more. It is difficult to know whether the benefits of these Online Proctoring technologies outweigh their risks. The most reasonable conclusion we can reach in the present is that the ethical justification of these technologies and their various capabilities requires us to rigorously ensure that a balance is struck between the concerns with the possible benefits to the best of our abilities. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such analysis on AIPS and OPS. Our work further addresses the issues in AIPS in human and technological aspect. It also lists out key points and new technologies that have only recently been introduced but could significantly impact online education and OPS in the years to come.","Nigam, Aditya; Pasricha, Rhitvik; Singh, Tarishi; Churi, Prathamesh",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),385,1

Serological tests can assess the extent of exposure and herd immunity to COVID-19 in general populations. This study aimed to estimate the nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to age, sex and clinical status in South Korea. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study randomly selected health examinees who underwent health check-up at 16 health promotion centres in 13 Korean cities across the country between late September and early December 2020. Residual serum samples were obtained from 4085 subjects (2014 men and 2071 women). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were measured by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Elecsys, Mannheim, Germany). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Fisher's exact test was used to compare the seroprevalence according to sex, age group and region. The relative risks of being seropositive according to the characteristics of the study subjects were analysed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 was 0.39% (95% CI=0.20% to 0.58%): 0.30% (95% CI=0.06% to 0.54%) for men and 0.48% (95% CI=0.18% to 0.78%) for women. The rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity varied significantly between different regions of Korea (p=0.003), but not with age group, sex, or the statuses of obesity, diabetes, hypertension or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the Korean population is still immunologically vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, but the seroprevalence has increased relative to that found in studies performed prior to September 2020 in Korea.","Nah, Eun-Hee; Cho, Seon; Park, Hyeran; Hwang, Inhwan; Cho, Han-Ik",BMJ Open,385,16

We sought to examine informatics and digital health strategies that supported the primary care response to COVID-19 in Australia. Specifically, the review aims to answer: how Australian primary health care responded and adapted to COVID-19, the facilitators and inhibitors of the Primary care informatics and digital health enabled COVID-19 response and virtual models of care observed in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a rapid scoping review complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search, data extraction, and synthesis of the included studies. Any disagreement in the eligibility screening, data extraction or synthesis was resolved through consensus meeting and if required. was referred to a third reviewer. Evidence was synthesised, summarised, and mapped to several themes that answer the research question s of this review. RESULTS: We identified 377 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase. Following title, abstract and full-text screening, 29 eligible papers were included. The majority were ""perspectives"" papers. The dearth of original research into digital health and COVID-19 in primary care meant limited evidence on effectiveness, access, equity, utility, safety, and quality. Data extraction and evidence synthesis identified 14 themes corresponding to 3 research questions. Telehealth was the key digital health response in primary care, together with mobile applications and national hotlines, to enable the delivery of virtual primary care and support public health. Enablers and barriers such as workforce training, digital resources, patient experience and ethical issues, and business model and management issues were identified as important in the evolution of virtual primary care. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has transformed Australian primary care with the rapid adaptation of digital technologies to complement ""in-person"" primary care with telehealth and virtual models of care. The pandemic has also highlighted several literacy, maturity/readiness, and micro, meso and macro-organisational challenges with adopting and adapting telehealth to support integrated person-centred health care. There is a need for more research into how telehealth and virtual models of care can improve the access, integration, safety, and quality of virtual primary care.","Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Godinho, Myron Anthony; Liaw, Siaw-Teng",Int J Med Inform,385,32

This article reports on a small study which attempted to identify the types and sources of COVID-19 misinformation. The authors identified and analysed 1225 pieces of COVID-19 fake news stories taken from fact-checkers, myth-busters and COVID-19 dashboards. The study is significant given the concern raised by the WHO Director-General that 'we are not just fighting the pandemic, we are also fighting infodemic'. The study concludes that the COVID-19 infodemic is full of false claims, half backed conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific therapies, regarding the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, origin and spread of the virus. Fake news is pervasive in social media, putting public health at risk. The scale of the crisis and ubiquity of the misleading information require that scientists, health information professionals and journalists exercise their professional responsibility to help the general public identify fake news stories.

Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been evident that adequate testing is an essential step in limiting and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present an accurate, inexpensive, scalable, portable, and rapid detection kit to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in biological samples that could even be translated for population testing. We have demonstrated that our method can reliably identify viral load and could be used to reach those fractions of the population with limited access to more sophisticated and expensive tests. PROCEDURES: The proposed SARS-CoV-2 detection kit is based on the combination of a SARS-CoV-2-targeted antibody (CR3022) that targets spike protein S1 domain on the viral surface. This antibody was radiolabeled with a long-lived isotope (Iodine-125) to allow us to detect bound antibody in samples with SARS-CoV-2. We used a series of in vitro assays to determine sensitivity and specificity and facilitate automation of the testing kit. Bound antibody was extracted from saliva samples via a centrifugation step and a semi-permeable membrane. Our kit was further validated using SARS-CoV-2 virions. RESULTS: We were able to accomplish radiosynthesis of [125I]I-CR3022 reliably without loss of binding. The SARS-CoV-2-sensing antibody was shown to maintain its spike S1 affinity and to bind to as low as 2.5-5 ng of spike protein. We then used beads-bound spike S1 to develop a separation kit which proved to be both easy to use and inexpensive. The kit made it possible to extract bound antibody from the saliva-like sample. We were able to validate the separation kit using intact SARS-CoV-2 virions and showed that our kit can detect a viral concentration as low as 19,700 PFU/mL (~ 9.22%TBF) and as high as 1,970,000 PFU/mL (45.04%TBF). CONCLUSION: Here we report the development and validation of a SARS-CoV-2 detection system based on the combination of a specific radiolabeled antibody and a separation membrane. We demonstrate our system to be comparable to other SARS-CoV-2 detection kits already approved by the FDA and believe this technology could be easily deployed to countries with limited resources for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Furthermore, workflows could be easily adapted to target other antigens and therefore other types of diseases.","Pirovano, Giacomo; Ordonez, Alvaro A; Jain, Sanjay K; Reiner, Thomas; Carroll, Laurence S; Pillarsetty, Naga Vara Kishore",Nucl Med Biol,385,24

The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal helminths was 57.2% (95% confidence interval 41.3-71.9%) and observed helminths of the gastrointestinal tract were recorded: Ancylostoma caninum (33%), Toxocara canis (29%), Dipylidium caninum (6%), Capillaria spp. (3%), Trichuris vulpis (1.66%). It is important to point out that young dogs were significantly infected more frequently (p &#8804; 0.1) than non-sterilized females and the higher occurrence of nematode infection occurred at the new arrival of stray dogs, in the third collection. With impact on public health, the higher prevalence (p &#8804; 0.1) of T. canis in young dogs suggests the existence of real risk for human infection and demonstrate the necessity for a parasite control programme reinforcement at the municipal dog shelter.","Silva, Vanessa; Silva, Joana; Gonçalves, Margarida; Brandão, Carlos; Vieira E Brito, Nuno",J Parasit Dis,385,20

As various measures have been taken successfully to combat the epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, a growing number of fully recovered patients have been discharged from hospitals. However, some of them have relapsed. Little is known about the causes that triggered the relapse. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 40 years old man who suffered from recurrent pulmonary infection with progression of lesions on chest computed tomography (CT), elevated levels of ferritin and IL2R, reduced lymphocyte count and positive oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 again after 5 days discharge from hospital. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level of this patient was very low at the time of relapse, suggesting a weak humoral immune response to the virus. Total exon sequencing revealed mutations in TRNT1 gene, which may be responsible for B cell immunodeficiency. Therefore, uncleared SARS-CoV-2 at his first discharge was likely to lead to his recurrence. However, viral superinfection and non-infectious organizing pneumonia could not be completely excluded. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 relapse may occur in a part of discharged patients with low titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These patients should be maintained in isolation for longer time even after discharge. A more sensitive method to detect SARS-CoV-2 needs to be established and serological testing for specific antibodies may be used as a reference to determine the duration of isolation.","Zhou, Xiaoxi; Zhou, Jianfeng; Zhao, Jianping",BMC Infect Dis,385,26

This phenomenon could be explained by the overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on epithelial cell surfaces of the respiratory tract. Indeed, ACE-2 is a receptor for coronaviruses including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV), and ACE-2 is overexpressed under chronic exposure to air pollution such as NO2 and PM2.5. In this review, we explain that ACE-2 acts as the sole receptor for the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 via its spike protein. The fact that respiratory and vascular epithelial cells express ACE-2 has been previously observed during the 2003 epidemic of the SARS-CoV-1 in China, and during the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia. High ACE-2 expression in respiratory epithelial cells under air pollution explains the positive correlation between the severity in COVID-19 patients and elevated air pollution, notably high NO2 and PM2.5 levels. Specific areas in India, China, Italy, Russia, Chile and Qatar that experience heavy air pollution also show high rates of COVID-19 infection and severity. Overall, we demonstrate a link between NO2 emissions, PM2.5 levels, ACE-2 expression and COVID-19 infection severity. Therefore, air pollution should be reduced in places where confirmed cases of COVID-19 are unexpectedly high.","Paital, Biswaranjan; Agrawal, Pawan Kumar",Environ Chem Lett,385,29

Many cases with new-onset focal seizures, serial seizures, and status epilepticus have been reported in the literature. EEG studies have been significantly ignored and underused globally. CONCLUSION: Many PWE perceived significant disruption in the quality of care to them, and some people reported increase in their seizure frequency since the onset of the pandemic. Telemedicine is a helpful technology that may improve access to the needed care for PWE in these difficult times. De novo seizures may occur in people with COVID-19 and they may happen in a variety of forms. In addition to prolonged EEG monitoring, performing a through metabolic investigation, electrocardiogram, brain imaging, and a careful review of all medications are necessary steps. The susceptibility of PWE to contracting COVID-19 should be investigated further.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Simani, Leila; Shahisavandi, Mina; Barzegar, Zohreh",Neurol. sci,385,10

Existing studies mainly focused on the linear impact of the pandemic on the pollutants without considering the impact of other factors. To fill the research gap, the nonlinear relationship between pandemic and pollutants with considering the temperature factor was explored by developing panel threshold regression approach. In the proposed approach, the number of confirmed cases was set as explanatory variable, concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 were set as explained variables, temperature was used as threshold variable, and other air pollution indicators were used as control variables. The results showed that there is a threshold effect between the changes in confirmed COVID-19 cases and the concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2, confirming the impact of the pandemic on pollutions was nonlinear. The results also show that the negative impact of pandemic on pollution increased when the temperature was rising. This work had theoretical and practical significance. The nonlinear research perspective of this article provided a methodological reference for exploring the relationship between epidemic and pollutant-related variables. Furthermore, this study expanded the scope of application of the threshold panel regression model and enriched the quantitative analysis of epidemics and pollutants.","Wang, Qiang; Wang, Xiaowei",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Genome comparisons have shown that previous isolates, the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), including the SARS-CoV are closely related, yet different in disease manifestation. Several explanations were suggested for the undetermined origin of SARS-CoV-2, in particular, bats, avian and Malayan pangolins as reservoir hosts, owing to the high genetic similarity. The general morphology and structure of all these viral isolates overlap with analogous disease symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and headache, very similar to the current SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT scans for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reveal pulmonary lesions, bilateral ground-glass opacities, and segmental consolidation in the lungs, a common pathological trait. With greatly overlapping similarities among the previous coronavirus, the SARS-CoV, it becomes interesting to observe marked differences in disease severity of the SARS-CoV-2 thereby imparting it the ability to rapidly transmit, exhibit greater stability, bypass innate host defences, and increasingly adapt to their new host thereby resulting in the current pandemic. The most recent B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2, highlight the fact that changes in amino acids in the Spike protein can contribute to enhanced infection and transmission efficiency. This review covers a comparative analysis of previous coronavirus outbreaks and highlights the differences and similarities among different coronaviruses, including the most recent isolates that have evolved to become easily transmissible with higher replication efficiency in humans.","Low, Zheng Yao; Yip, Ashley Jia Wen; Sharma, Anshika; Lal, Sunil K",Virus Genes,385,7

Case Report: A fifty-year-old female patient, who is a businesswoman, presented with chief complaints of ""fever for one week, diarrhea, anorexia, and asthenia."" Initially, she was given Tamiflu. The influenza A virus serology was negative. Three days later, levofloxacin was started because the patient's symptoms did not improve. The novel coronavirus nucleic acid test was negative. It was noted that before the onset of the disease, the patient went to Wuhan on a business trip. Despite the given treatment, her body temperature rose to 39.2°C and she was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Then, chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground glass opacities with consolidation which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis, and the subsequent 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia nucleic acid test was positive.

Although a growing number of studies have examined the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth, few empirical studies have analyzed its effect on the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy actually affect the probability of a banking crisis? Do other macroeconomic policies matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy? To answer these questions, this paper empirically investigates the effect of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis and its relationship with other macroeconomic policies. Specifically, using data on 65 countries from 2000 to 2016, we employ a probit model to analyze the effect of changes in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on crisis probability. Our results show that macroprudential policy is effective in changing the probability of a banking crisis via a credit channel and that its effectiveness depends on other macroeconomic policies. Changes in the LTV ratio are found to be effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting frameworks, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis.","Nakatani, Ryota",Journal of policy modeling,385,29

Objective: To determine whether discontinuation compared with continuation of ACEIs or ARBs changed the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial of 659 patients hospitalized in Brazil with mild to moderate COVID-19 who were taking ACEIs or ARBs prior to hospitalization (enrolled: April 9-June 26, 2020; final follow-up: July 26, 2020). Interventions: Discontinuation (n = 334) or continuation (n = 325) of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital through 30 days. Secondary outcomes included death, cardiovascular death, and COVID-19 progression. Results: Among 659 patients, the median age was 55.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46.1-65.0 years), 14.7% were aged 70 years or older, 40.4% were women, and 100% completed the trial. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6 days (IQR, 4-9 days) and 27.2% of patients had an oxygen saturation of less than 94% of room air at baseline. In terms of clinical severity, 57.1% of patients were considered mild at hospital admission and 42.9% were considered moderate. There was no significant difference in the number of days alive and out of the hospital in patients in the discontinuation group (mean, 21.9 days [SD, 8 days]) vs patients in the continuation group (mean, 22.9 days [SD, 7.1 days]) and the mean ratio was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.01). There also was no statistically significant difference in death (2.7% for the discontinuation group vs 2.8% for the continuation group; odds ratio [OR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.38-2.52]), cardiovascular death (0.6% vs 0.3%, respectively; OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 0.19-42.12]), or COVID-19 progression (38.3% vs 32.3%; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.95-1.80]). The most common adverse events were respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (9.6% in the discontinuation group vs 7.7% in the continuation group), shock requiring vasopressors (8.4% vs 7.1%, respectively), acute myocardial infarction (7.5% vs 4.6%), new or worsening heart failure (4.2% vs 4.9%), and acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis (3.3% vs 2.8%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 and who were taking ACEIs or ARBs before hospital admission, there was no significant difference in the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital for those assigned to discontinue vs continue these medications. These findings do not support routinely discontinuing ACEIs or ARBs among patients hospitalized with mild to moderate COVID-19 if there is an indication for treatment.

Potential targets related to matrine, COVID-19 and liver injury were identified from several databases. We constructed PPI network and screened the core targets according to the degree value. Then, GO and KEGG enrichment were carried out. Molecular docking technology was used to verify the affinity between matrine and the crystal structure of core target protein. Finally, real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the effects of matrine on hub gene expression in liver tissue of liver injury mice and lung tissue of lung injury mice to further confirm the results of network pharmacological analysis. The results show that six core targets including AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6, BCL2L1 and ATM were identified. The potential therapeutic mechanism of matrine on COVID-19 combined with liver injury is closely related to regulate antiviral process, improve immune system and regulate the level of inflammatory factors. Molecular docking showed that matrine could spontaneously bind to the receptor protein and had strong binding force. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that matrine could significantly reduce the expression of AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6 and ATM in mice with liver injury or lung injury (P < 0.05), and increase the expression of BCL2L1 to a certain extent (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that matrine can achieve simultaneous intervention of COVID-19 combined with liver injury by multi-dimensional pharmacological mechanism.","Liu, Fangzhou; Li, Yuanbai; Yang, Yang; Li, Meng; Du, Yu; Zhang, Yiying; Wang, Jing; Shi, Yujing",Drug Deliv,385,1

Our mixed effects model consists of country-varying coefficients, as well as ?fixed? (pooled) coefficients. This allows us to fully explore variation between countries. The model provides estimates for losses in total employment and women's employment, from which we infer income losses. We find that roughly half of estimated SADC countries have total employment losses below or approaching 25% of all jobs, while the other half have total losses exceeding 25%. Around one-third of all jobs for women risk being lost during 2020 for Madagascar, Comoros, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. Our model implies that most SADC countries will experience an equivalent loss of wage income in excess of 10% of GDP (whether through pure job losses and/or reductions in wages and working hours).

BCBSLA noted a strong association between members who were predicted as “high risk” in their ROH AI Predictive Model and members who actually had a COVID-19 admission. As a result, BCBSLA was asked to create a simplified model that could extend to the entire state of Louisiana knowing that detailed member data would not be available to score Louisiana’s entire population. Methods: The current ROH model employed by BCBSLA for its members was simplified for State use by focusing on available health factors that could be easily assessed. The simplified model was tested using 2019 BCBSLA membership to predict all future hospitalizations between Jan-Jun 2020. Results: The factors chosen for the new simplified model were age, comorbid conditions (diseases of the circulatory system, Hypertension, etc.) and particular events such as hospital or skilled nursing home facility admission within the past 12 months. The simplified model was shown to be highly predictive of future all-cause hospitalizations. The top 20% of predicted high risk members accounted for 70% of all admissions;AUC was very good at 0.89. The model was also predictive of COVID-19 admissions on a naïve population. The top 20% of members captured nearly 50% of COVID-19 admissions, AUC 0.74. The model performance was good considering early COVID-19 admissions were likely misclassified in claims data. Conclusions: Using simplified rules, BCBSLA was able to modify their current ROH model so that Louisiana’s health department could identify patients who would be at the highest risk for hospitalized if they contracted COVID-19.","Holloway, J.; Cong, M.; Ouyang, J.; Vicidomina, B.; Nigam, S.",Value in Health,385,13

The push for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the face-to-face rounding paradigm and creates an opportunity for reflection on the benefits of telemedicine, especially for balancing competing corporate and clinical demands. METHODS: The 117-month video-based inpatient telerounding experience of a colorectal surgeon in an academic medical system was recorded, including patient characteristics, diagnoses, technology, content of telerounding encounters, and logistical considerations. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 163 patients were seen in 201 telerounding encounters, primarily for routine postoperative care (90.5%). Most were admitted for inflammatory bowel disease (63.2%). Changes were made to plans of care during 28.9% of encounters, and discharge planning was part of 26.4%. Encounters were conducted primarily from the surgeon's administrative office (68.7%) or other work-related locations (10.9%), while 6.5% originated from the surgeon's home. Technologic issues occurred in 5.5% of encounters. 89.1% of patient feedback was positive and none was negative. CONCLUSION: Telerounding is technologically feasible and has clinical value, including for patients with complex surgical problems. Technologic problems are rare and patient satisfaction is high.

METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of all consecutive patients admitted for &#8805;48 hours to the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona for COVID-19 (28 February to 22 April 2020) who were discharged or dead. We describe demographic, epidemiologic, laboratory and microbiologic results, as well as outcome data retrieved from electronic health records. RESULTS: Of a total of 989 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 72 (7.2%) had 88 other microbiologically confirmed infections: 74 were bacterial, seven fungal and seven viral. Community-acquired co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis was uncommon (31/989, 3.1%) and mainly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 51 hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections, mostly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, were diagnosed in 43 patients (4.7%), with a mean (SD) time from hospital admission to superinfection diagnosis of 10.6 (6.6) days. Overall mortality was 9.8% (97/989). Patients with community-acquired co-infections and hospital-acquired superinfections had worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Co-infection at COVID-19 diagnosis is uncommon. Few patients developed superinfections during hospitalization. These findings are different compared to those of other viral pandemics. As it relates to hospitalized patients with COVID-19, such findings could prove essential in defining the role of empiric antimicrobial therapy or stewardship strategies.","Garcia-Vidal, Carolina; Sanjuan, Gemma; Moreno-García, Estela; Puerta-Alcalde, Pedro; Garcia-Pouton, Nicole; Chumbita, Mariana; Fernandez-Pittol, Mariana; Pitart, Cristina; Inciarte, Alexy; Bodro, Marta; Morata, Laura; Ambrosioni, Juan; Grafia, Ignacio; Meira, Fernanda; Macaya, Irene; Cardozo, Celia; Casals, Climent; Tellez, Adrian; Castro, Pedro; Marco, Francesc; García, Felipe; Mensa, Josep; Martínez, José Antonio; Soriano, Alex",Clin. microbiol. infect,385,16

The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 profiles has been addressed by researchers globally with the aim of resolving this disruptive crisis. This investigation process is indispensable to understand how SARS-CoV-2 behaves in human host cells. However, little is known about the systematic molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human host cells. Here, we present gene-to-gene regulatory networks in response to SARS-CoV-2 using a Bayesian network. We examined the dynamic changes in the SARS-CoV-2-purturbated networks established by our proposed framework for gene network analysis, thus revealing that interferon signaling gradually switched to the subsequent inflammatory cytokine signaling cascades. Furthermore, we succeeded in capturing a COVID-19 patient-specific network in which transduction of these signals was concurrently induced. This enabled us to explore the local regulatory systems influenced by SARS-CoV-2 in host cells more precisely at an individual level. Our panel of network analyses has provided new insights into SARS-CoV-2 research from the perspective of cellular systems.","Tanaka, Yoshihisa; Higashihara, Kako; Nakazawa, Mai Adachi; Yamashita, Fumiyoshi; Tamada, Yoshinori; Okuno, Yasushi",Sci Rep,385,20

Each agent independently minimizes a cost function which represents their motives. A conditionally expected integral cost function has been considered under an agent's opinion filtration. The dynamic cost functional is minimized subject to a stochastic differential opinion dynamics. As opinion dynamics represents an agent's differences of opinion from the others as well as from their previous opinions, random influences and stubbornness make it more volatile. An agent uses their rate of change of opinion at certain time point as a control input. This turns out to be a non-cooperative stochastic differential game which have a feedback Nash equilibrium. A Feynman-type path integral approach has been used to determine an optimal feedback opinion and control. This is a new approach in this literature. Later in this paper an explicit solution of a feedback Nash equilibrium opinion is determined.","Pramanik, Paramahansa",,385,20

METHODS: A total of 222 (of 1,375, 16.2%) physician trainees from an academic medical center responded to a Web-based survey. We compared the physician trainees who reported that their EHR use increased versus those whose EHR use stayed the same or decreased on outcomes related to depression, anxiety, stress, PTSD, and burnout using univariable and multivariable models. We examined whether self-reported exposure to COVID-19 patients moderated these relationships. RESULTS: Physician trainees who reported increased use of EHR had higher burnout (adjusted mean, 1.48 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 1.71] vs. 1.05 [95% CI 0.93, 1.17]; p = 0.001) and were more likely to exhibit symptoms of PTSD (adjusted mean = 15.09 [95% CI 9.12, 21.05] vs. 9.36 [95% CI 7.38, 11.28]; p = 0.035). Physician trainees reporting increased EHR use outside of work were more likely to experience depression (adjusted mean, 8.37 [95% CI 5.68, 11.05] vs. 5.50 [95% CI 4.28, 6.72]; p = 0.035). Among physician trainees with increased EHR use, those exposed to COVID-19 patients had significantly higher burnout (2.04, p < 0.001) and depression scores (14.13, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Increased EHR use was associated with higher burnout, depression, and PTSD outcomes among physician trainees. Although preliminary, these findings have implications for creating systemic changes to manage the wellness and well-being of trainees.","Holzer, Katherine J; Lou, Sunny S; Goss, Charles W; Strickland, Jaime; Evanoff, Bradley A; Duncan, Jennifer G; Kannampallil, Thomas",Appl Clin Inform,385,23

The theme of his accumulated work was advancing child development as social action for children and families. Besides early childhood intervention and policy, for which he devoted most of his time, Dr. Zigler did pioneering work in education and school reform, social policy, prevention, child maltreatment, family support, developmental disabilities, and in service to government. In this article, I reflect on four of Dr. Zigler's major contributions to science and society that are underrated and, in many respects, under-appreciated in the larger context of the field. These are (a) historical analysis of Head Start, (b) conceptualization and analysis of motivation as a key component of early childhood program impacts, (c) development of preschool-to-third-grade programs and school reforms, and (d) critical analysis of theory, research, policy, and practice.

We proposed, implemented, and evaluated a wearable proximity sensing system based on an oscillating magnetic field that overcomes many of the weaknesses of the current state of the art Bluetooth based proximity detection. In this paper, we first described the underlying physical principle, proposed a protocol for the identification and coordination of the transmitter (which is compatible with the current smartphone-based exposure tracing protocols). Subsequently, the system architecture and implementation were described, finally an elaborate characterization and evaluation of the performance (both in systematic lab experiments and in real-world settings) were performed. Our work demonstrated that the proposed system is much more reliable than the widely-used Bluetooth-based approach, particularly when it comes to distinguishing between distances above and below the 2.0 m threshold due to the magnetic field's physical properties.","Bian, Sizhen; Zhou, Bo; Lukowicz, Paul",,385,23

Such problems occur, for example, when observing shapes with several components that move independently. Mathematically, if the parameter space of each continuous independent motion is a manifold, then their combination is known as a product manifold. In this paper, we present a new paradigm for non-linear independent component analysis called manifold factorization. Our factorization algorithm is based on spectral graph methods for manifold learning and the separability of the Laplacian operator on product spaces. Recovering the factors of a manifold yields meaningful lower-dimensional representations and provides a new way to focus on particular aspects of the data space while ignoring others. We demonstrate the potential use of our method for an important and challenging problem in structural biology: mapping the motions of proteins and other large molecules using cryo-electron microscopy datasets.","Zhang, Sharon; Moscovich, Amit; Singer, Amit",,385,9

Mental health and examining factors that may influence distress have been outlined as key research priorities to inform interventions. This research sought to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and coping responses influence the degree of distress experienced by the U.K. general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (N = 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early ""lockdown"" phase of the pandemic. Around a quarter of participants demonstrated significantly elevated anxiety and depression, with 14.8% reaching clinical cutoff for health anxiety. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated those in ""vulnerable"" groups were significantly more anxious (p < .001), and also more anxious in relation to their health (p < .001). Mediation modeling demonstrated maladaptive coping responses partially mediated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress. Mental health difficulties have become significantly raised during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, particularly for the vulnerable. Findings support emerging research suggesting the general public is struggling with uncertainty, more so than normal. Vulnerable groups are more anxious about their health, but not more intolerant of uncertainty than the nonvulnerable. Finally, this study indicated two modifiable factors that could act as treatment targets when adapting interventions for mental health during the COVID-19 global health crisis.

However, till now no standard treatment has been developed in treating the disease. On the other hand, it becomes important to prevent the acute respiratory tract infection due to COVID-19 which is the most dangerous phase leading to increased mortality. Hence this systematic review has been framed by pooling the available data of the use of stem cells in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and ARDS. METHODS: 6 literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Clinical trial registry of India) were searched for relevant studies till 10th August 2020 using keywords stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, cell therapy, SARS CoV-2, SARS Coronavirus, Coronavirus 2, COVID-19, nCoV-19, Novel Coronavirus, MERS CoV, ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome. RESULTS: The observations of this systematic review suggest capability of MSCs in reducing the systemic inflammation and protecting against SARS-CoV-2 as evidenced by the available clinical data. CONCLUSION: MSCs can overcome the clinical challenges currently faced by SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, specifically who are seriously ill and not responding to conventional therapies. Though the available clinical data is motivating, still predicting the therapeutic potential of MSCs will be too early in COVID-19. Hence, further studies in a larger cohort of patients becomes a prerequisite to validate their potential efficacy.","Mahendiratta, Saniya; Bansal, Seema; Sarma, Phulen; Kumar, Harish; Choudhary, Gajendra; Kumar, Subodh; Prakash, Ajay; Sehgal, Rakesh; Medhi, Bikash",Biomed Pharmacother,385,10

There is a need to understand service response to share good practice and prepare for future care. AIM: To map and understand specialist palliative care services innovations and practice changes in response to COVID-19. DESIGN: Online survey of specialist palliative care providers (CovPall), disseminated via key stakeholders. Data collected on service characteristics, innovations and changes in response to COVID-19. Statistical analysis included frequencies, proportions and means, and free-text comments were analysed using a qualitative framework approach. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Inpatient palliative care units, home nursing services, hospital and home palliative care teams from any country. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-eight respondents: 277 UK, 85 Europe (except UK), 95 World (except UK and Europe), 1 missing country. 54.8% provided care across 2+ settings; 47.4% hospital palliative care teams, 57% in-patient palliative care units and 57% home palliative care teams. The crisis context meant services implemented rapid changes. Changes involved streamlining, extending and increasing outreach of services, using technology to facilitate communication, and implementing staff wellbeing innovations. Barriers included; fear and anxiety, duplication of effort, information overload and funding. Enablers included; collaborative teamwork, staff flexibility, a pre-existing IT infrastructure and strong leadership. CONCLUSIONS: Specialist palliative care services have been flexible, highly adaptive and have adopted low-cost solutions, also called 'frugal innovations', in response to COVID-19. In addition to financial support, greater collaboration is essential to minimise duplication of effort and optimise resource use.ISRCTN16561225 https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN16561225.","Dunleavy, Lesley; Preston, Nancy; Bajwah, Sabrina; Bradshaw, Andy; Cripps, Rachel; Fraser, Lorna K; Maddocks, Matthew; Hocaoglu, Mevhibe; Murtagh, Fliss Em; Oluyase, Adejoke O; Sleeman, Katherine E; Higginson, Irene J; Walshe, Catherine",Palliat Med,385,1

Objective. To assess the association between drinking behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine, anxiety symptoms, and sociodemographic characteristics in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Method. Data was collected through a cross‐sectional online survey (non-probabilistic sample) conducted by the Pan American Health Organization between May 22 and June 30, 2020, in 33 countries and two territories of LAC. Participants were 18 years of age or older and must not have traveled outside of their country since March 15, 2020 (n= 12 328, M age= 38.1 years, 65% female). Four drinking behaviors (online socializing drinking [OSD], drinking with child present [DCP], drinking before 5 p.m. [DB5]), heavy episodic drinking [HED]) were response variables, and quarantining, anxiety symptoms and sociodemographic covariables were explanatory variables. Results. Quarantine was positively associated with a higher frequency of OSD and with DCP, but negatively associated with a higher frequency of HED. Anxiety symptoms were associated with a higher frequency of HED, more OSD, and DB5. Higher incomes seemed to be more associated with all the studied drinking behaviors. Women tended to report less DB5 and less HED during the pandemic. Conclusions. Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to affect drinking behavior and mental health indicators like anxiety symptoms. This study is the first effort to measure the consequences of the quarantine on alcohol consumption and mental health in LAC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the associations found, screenings and brief interventions targeting alcohol consumption and mental health are recommended.","Garcia-Cerde, Rodrigo; Valente, Juliana Y.; Sohi, Ivneet; Falade, Rachael; Sanchez, Zila M.; Monteiro, Maristela G.",Rev. panam. salud pública,385,21

The total number of genomic sequences that are publicly available on platforms such as GISAID is currently several million, and is increasing with every day. The availability of such \textit{Big Data} creates a new opportunity for researchers to study this virus in detail. This is particularly important with all of the dynamics of the COVID-19 variants which emerge and circulate. This rich data source will give us insights on the best ways to perform genomic surveillance for this and future pandemic threats, with the ultimate goal of mitigating or eliminating such threats. Analyzing and processing the several million genomic sequences is a challenging task. Although traditional methods for sequence classification are proven to be effective, they are not designed to deal with these specific types of genomic sequences. Moreover, most of the existing methods also face the issue of scalability. Previous studies which were tailored to coronavirus genomic data proposed to use spike sequences (corresponding to a subsequence of the genome), rather than using the complete genomic sequence, to perform different machine learning (ML) tasks such as classification and clustering. However, those methods suffer from scalability issues. In this paper, we propose an approach called Spike2Vec, an efficient and scalable feature vector representation for each spike sequence that can be used for downstream ML tasks. Through experiments, we show that Spike2Vec is not only scalable on several million spike sequences, but also outperforms the baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy, F1-score, etc.","Ali, Sarwan; Patterson, Murray",,385,16

In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using theWorld Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination (R2), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China.

We also explored the impact of participants' interaction with non-companion animals during this phase. A cross-sectional online survey of U.K. residents aged over 18 was conducted between April and June 2020. The final item of the survey invited open-ended free-text responses, allowing participants to describe any experiences and/or perceptions of their human-animal relationships during the COVID-19 lockdown phase. A qualitative thematic analysis of responses was undertaken. Four main themes related to the following aspects of human-animal interactions during the COVID-19 lockdown phase were identified: the positive impact of animal ownership during the COVID-19 lockdown (e.g., amelioration of wellbeing and mental health), concerns relating to animal ownership during the COVID-19 lockdown (e.g., concerns over animals carrying the COVID-19 virus), grief and loss of an animal during the COVID-19 lockdown and the impact of engaging with non-companion animals during the COVID-19 lockdown. The findings complement and extend previous insights into the impact of human-animal interaction with both companion and non-companion animals.

Methods: We analyzed the quality data registry for clinical characteristics and outcomes of all COVID-19-confirmed ICU admissions. Differences in outcomes from other health care systems and published cohorts from other parts of the world were delineated. Results: Across our health care system, 495 COVID-19 patients were admitted from March 15 to June 1, 2020. Mean patient age was 67.3 years, 206 (41.6%) were females, and 289 (58.4%) were males. Mean Acute Physiology Score was 45.3, and mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score was 60.5. In total, 215 patients (43.3%) were intubated for a mean duration of 9.2 days.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The mortality rate, hospital disorders and incalculable economic and social damages, besides the unproven efficacy of the treatments evaluated against COVID-19, raised the need for immediate control of this disease. Therefore, the current study employed in silico tools to rationally identify new possible SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors. That is an enzyme conserved among the coronavirus species; hence, the identification of an Mpro inhibitor is to make it a broad-spectrum drug. Molecular docking studies described the binding sites and the interaction energies of 74 Mpro-ligand complexes deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A structural similarity screening was carried out in order to identify possible Mpro ligands that show additional pharmacological properties against COVID-19. We identified 59 hit compounds and among them, melatonin stood out due to its prominent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities; it can reduce oxidative stress, defence cell mobility and efficiently combat the cytokine storm and sepsis. In addition, melatonin is an inhibitor of calmodulin, an essential intracellular component to maintain angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) on the cell surface. Interestingly, one of the most promising hits in our docking study was melatonin. It revealed better interaction energy with Mpro compared to ligands in complexes from PDB.

In order to determine the relationship between COVID-19 and seizure disorders, a review of case series from 1 December 2019 to 7 July 2020 from seven hospitals in Thailand, which adequately detailed seizure occurrence or neurological manifestations, was carried out. Focus was placed on relationship of seizure/epilepsy and risk of COVID-19 infection, possible epileptogenic effects of the viral infection and management plans for control of seizures. Prevalence of acute symptomatic seizures among COVID-19 patients was 0.57%, indicating epilepsy patients in general were not more susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Issues on adverse interactions between antiepileptic drugs and antivirals, limited access to investigative diagnostic procedures, eg electroencephalography, CSF fluid and neuroimaging were of concern. In conclusion, prevalence of seizure in individuals with COVID-19 is low, but suitable plans for seizure management, antiepileptic medication-withdrawal seizures in patients with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic and implementation of appropriate telemedicine systems should be addressed.","Sithinamsuwan, P.; Apiwattanakul, M.; Wongsinin, T.; Sukajintanakarn, D.; Luangdilok, P.; Suttha, P.; Treepong, C.; Suwanrit, S.; Udommongkol, C.; Boonyapisit, K.; Visudtibhan, A.",Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health,385,18

One of the primary initiatives in this direction was to ascertain the number of cases through testing. Testing for the diagnosis of the COVID-19 is a crucial factor to know the prevalence, spread and transmissible nature of the disease. Moreover, how effective the testing strategy is prerequisite for knowing the exact number of infected cases by COVID-19. In India, 1,58,49,068 samples have been tested, out of which 13,36,861 samples have been found to be positive up to 24th July 2020.

COVID-19 disease comprises symptoms such as cold, cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. COVID-19 has affected many countries and their spread in the world has put humanity at risk. Due to the increasing number of cases and their stress on administration as well as health professionals, different prediction techniques were introduced to predict the coronavirus disease existence in patients. However, the accuracy was not improved, and time consumption was not minimized during the disease prediction. To address these problems, least square regressive Gaussian neuro-fuzzy multi-layered data classification (LSRGNFM-LDC) technique is introduced in this article. LSRGNFM-LDC technique performs efficient COVID prediction with better accuracy and lesser time consumption through feature selection and classification. The preprocessing is used to eliminate the unwanted data in input features. Preprocessing is applied to reduce the time complexity. Next, Deming Least Square Regressive Feature Selection process is carried out for selecting the most relevant features through identifying the line of best fit. After the feature selection process, Gaussian neuro-fuzzy classifier in LSRGNFM-LDC technique performs the data classification process with help of fuzzy if-then rules for performing prediction process. Finally, the fuzzy if-then rule classifies the patient data as lower risk level, medium risk level and higher risk level with higher accuracy and lesser time consumption. Experimental evaluation is performed by Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset using different metrics like prediction accuracy, prediction time, and error rate. The result shows that LSRGNFM-LDC technique improves the accuracy and minimizes the time consumption as well as error rate than existing works during COVID prediction.","Mydukuri, Rathnamma V; Kallam, Suresh; Patan, Rizwan; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Ramachandran, Manikandan",Expert Syst,385,16

It was recognized as a global health hazard. METHODS: 234 inpatients with COVID-19 were included. Detailed clinical data, chest HRCT basic performances and certain signs were recorded Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping were quantified. Both clinical types and CT stages were evaluated. RESULTS: Most patients (approximately 90%) were classified as common type and with epidemiologic history. Fever and cough were main symptoms. Chest CT showed abnormal attenuation in bilateral multiple lung lobes, distributed in the lower and/or periphery of the lungs (94.98%), with multiple shapes. GGO and vascular enhancement sign were most frequent seen, followed by interlobular septal thickening and air bronchus sign as well as consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping. There were significant differences in most of CT signs between different stage groups. The SpO2 and OI were decreased in stage IV, and the CT score of consolidation, fibrosis and air trapping was significantly lower in stage I (P<0.05). A weak relevance was between the fibrosis score and the value of PaO2 and SpO2 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical performances of patients with COVID-19, mostly with epidemiologic history and typical symptoms, were critical valuable in the diagnosis of the COVID-19. While chest HRCT provided the distribution, shape, attenuation and extent of lung lesions, as well as some typical CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dai, Hui; Zhang, Xin; Xia, Jianguo; Zhang, Tao; Shang, Yalei; Huang, Renjun; Liu, Rongrong; Wang, Dan; Li, Min; Wu, Jinping; Xu, Qiuzhen; Li, Yonggang",Int J Infect Dis,385,31

METHOD: Ecological study that used epidemiological, demographic, environmental and variables on the structure of health services as explanatory variables. The analysis period was from March 15th (the start of the alarm state) until April 22nd, 2020. Incidence and mortality rates were the main response variables. The magnitude of the associations has been estimated using the Spearman correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Incidence and mortality rates at the time of decree of alarm status are associated with current incidence, mortality and hospital demand rates. Higher mean temperatures are significantly associated with a lower current incidence of COVID-19 in the autonomous communities. Likewise, a higher proportion of older people in nursing homes is significantly associated with a higher current mortality in the autonomous communities. CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict the evolution of the epidemic through the analysis of incidence and mortality. Lower temperatures and the proportion of older people in residences are factors associated with a worse prognosis. These parameters must be considered in decisions about the timing and intensity of the implementation of containment measures. In this sense, strengthening epidemiological surveillance is essential to improve predictions.","Medeiros Figueiredo, Alexandre; Daponte-Codina, Antonio; Moreira Marculino Figueiredo, Daniela Cristina; Toledo Vianna, Rodrigo Pinheiro; Costa de Lima, Kenio; Gil-García, Eugenia","Gac. sanit.

The breaking of contagion chains relies on two main alternative strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews or a digital (app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing protocol. We compare in the same framework the effectiveness of the two strategies within the activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network dynamics. Using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion, we show that even when the probability for a contact to be traced is the same, manual contact tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol in increasing the epidemic threshold, limiting the height of the epidemic peaks and reducing the number of isolated individuals. This remains true even taking into account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure. This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts of infected individuals, contrasted with the intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision to adopt the app or not of each individual. The better performance of manual tracing is enhanced by the heterogeneous features of agent behavior: a superspreader not adopting the app is completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while she can be traced manually, due to her multiple contacts. Our results indicate a careful integration of the two intrinsically different protocols as key to optimal mitigation strategies.","Mancastroppa, Marco; Castellano, Claudio; Vezzani, Alessandro; Burioni, Raffaella",,385,26

The study comprised the people covered by the Health Service of Navarre, Spain. Sociodemographic variables and chronic conditions were obtained from electronic healthcare databases. Confirmed infections, hospitalizations, and deaths from SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from the enhanced epidemiological surveillance during the second SARS-CoV-2 epidemic surge (July–December 2020), in which diagnostic tests were widely available. Among 643,757 people, 5497 confirmed infections, 323 hospitalizations, 38 intensive care unit admissions, and 72 deaths from SARS-CoV-2 per 100,000 inhabitants were observed. A higher incidence of confirmed infection was associated with people aged 15–29 years, nursing home residents, healthcare workers, people born in Latin America or Africa, as well as in those diagnosed with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, dementia, severe obesity, hypertension and functional dependence. The risk of hospitalization in the population was associated with males, higher age, nursing home residents, Latin American or African origin, and those diagnosed with immunodeficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, asthma, kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, cirrhosis, dementia, severe obesity, hypertension and functional dependence. The risk of death was associated with males, higher age, nursing home residents, Latin American origin, low income level, immunodeficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, COPD, kidney disease, dementia, and functional dependence. This study supports the prioritization of the older population, nursing home residents, and people with chronic conditions and functional dependence for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and vaccination, and highlights the need for additional preventive support for immigrants.","Castilla, Jesús Guevara Marcela Miqueleiz Ana Baigorria Fernando Ibero-Esparza Carlos Navascués Ana Trobajo-Sanmartín Camino Martínez-Baz Iván Casado Itziar Burgui Cristina Ezpeleta Carmen Navarra The Working Group for the Study of COVID-19 in",Journal of Clinical Medicine,385,1

World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress.

Sudden onset loss of smell and/or taste has been increasingly reported as a symptom of COVID-19. However, prevalence of these symptoms, and its severity varies widely between studies, with little data on its duration and recovery rate. Since this significantly impacts the quality of life of patients, there is a need for a study to provide insight into the loss of smell or taste in terms of its correlation with other upper respiratory tract symptoms, natural history and resolution rates. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 718 mild to moderately symptomatic adult patients (&#8805; 18 years), admitted consecutively to Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Odisha, India between June 25 and July 24, 2020, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs. Prevalence, severity, duration and factors associated with altered smell or taste sensation, and their follow-up were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 718 patients included in the study at baseline [563 (78%) men; median age 34 years], 101 (14%) patients experienced either altered smell or taste, with 52 (7%) experiencing both altered smell and taste. Seventy-seven (10.7%) patients had altered smell and 76 patients had altered taste (10.5%). Of these, 71 (92%) and 73 (96%) regained their sense of smell and taste, respectively, by 14 days after their swab tested positive. Presence of fever (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.7-10.6, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.2-4.2, p = 0.009) and nasal obstruction (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.4-6.7, p = 0.006) were independently associated with increased likelihood of experiencing both altered taste and smell in multivariable models. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of altered smell and taste in Indians was much lower compared to Europeans and similar to East Asians. Majority regained these senses by 2 weeks.

While chest computed tomography (CT) plays an indispensable role in its diagnosis, the quantification and localization of lesions cannot be accurately assessed manually. We employed deep learning-based software to aid in detection, localization and quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 2460 RT-PCR tested SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (1250 men and 1210 women; mean age, 57.7 ± 14.0 years (age range, 11-93 years) were retrospectively identified from Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 11 to March 16, 2020. Basic clinical characteristics were reviewed. The uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System was used to assess the CT scans. RESULTS: CT scans of 2215 patients (90%) showed multiple lesions of which 36 (1%) and 50 patients (2%) had left and right lung infections, respectively (> 50% of each affected lung's volume), while 27 (1%) had total lung infection (> 50% of the total volume of both lungs). Overall, 298 (12%), 778 (32%) and 1300 (53%) patients exhibited pure ground glass opacities (GGOs), GGOs with sub-solid lesions and GGOs with both sub-solid and solid lesions, respectively. Moreover, 2305 (94%) and 71 (3%) patients presented primarily with GGOs and sub-solid lesions, respectively. Elderly patients (&#8805; 60 years) were more likely to exhibit sub-solid lesions. The generalized linear mixed model showed that the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe was the favoured site of COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Chest CT combined with analysis by the uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System can accurately evaluate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Hai-Tao; Zhang, Jin-Song; Zhang, Hai-Hua; Nan, Yan-Dong; Zhao, Ying; Fu, En-Qing; Xie, Yong-Hong; Liu, Wei; Li, Wang-Ping; Zhang, Hong-Jun; Jiang, Hua; Li, Chun-Mei; Li, Yan-Yan; Ma, Rui-Na; Dang, Shao-Kang; Gao, Bo-Bo; Zhang, Xi-Jing; Zhang, Tao",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,385,24

We aimed to compare the prognostic value of resting CSBF and CFR for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent vasodilator stress CMR. METHODS: We studied 693 patients with known CAD and 519 patients with suspected CAD admitted to our hospital between 2009 and 2019. The CFR was calculated as the CSBF during adenosine triphosphate infusion divided by CSBF at rest. MACE was defined as composite of cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure hospitalization, and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 4.6 years, 92 patients (8%) experienced MACE. The resting CSBF was significantly higher in patients with MACE than in patients without MACE (114.7 ± 44.9 mL/min vs. 84.7 ± 30.9 mL/min, p < 0.001 for known CAD; 122.2 ± 33.3 mL/min vs. 86.6 ± 36.7 mL/min, p < 0.001 for suspected CAD). The resting CSBF remained a significant predictor for MACE after adjusting clinical and CMR variables (hazard ratio [HR] of resting CSBF higher than the median: 3.18, p = 0.0083 for known CAD; HR: 23.3, p < 0.001 for suspected CAD). The area under the curve for predicting MACE was 0.73 for resting CSBF, 0.72 for CFR (p = 0.78) in patients with known CAD, and 0.82 for resting CSBF, 0.83 (p = 0.58) for CFR in patients with suspected CAD. CONCLUSIONS: The resting CSBF may be a useful non-invasive method for the risk stratification of patients with known or suspected CAD without any radiation exposure, contrast media, or pharmacological vasodilator agents.","Kato, Shingo; Fukui, Kazuki; Kodama, Sho; Azuma, Mai; Nakayama, Naoki; Iwasawa, Tae; Kimura, Kazuo; Tamura, Kouichi; Utsunomiya, Daisuke",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,385,3

Background The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in New Jersey on March 2, 2020. Eight days later the first death from the virus occurred. With cases rapidly increasing, the statewide stay at home order came shortly after on March 21, 2020, closing down all non-essential businesses and non-urgent travel. Hospitals became COVID only and the majority of non-emergent medical cases were discharged home. MCS patients, who were used to being seen in clinic on a monthly basis, were suddenly required to adapt to a new care model. The team of MCS coordinators collaborated and were able to provide continuous, safe, medical care remotely to this complex population by utilizing telemedicine and home diagnostic services;a novel change in practice. Methods • Initiation of telemedicine platform for routine ""visits"" • Referral of all patients to mobile lab services for blood work and/or administration of home INR monitoring equipment • Utilization of mobile radiology for remote x-rays, CT scans, and ultrasounds • Patients given Doppler and blood pressure cuff with instructions for home use Results The team completed a total of 81 telemedicine visits in 4 months, averaging 20 visits/month. There was 100% compliance with visits. Providers worked around the patients' schedules, completing visits outside of regular business hours. Our average monthly visits prior to COVID were around 30 visits/month, with 25% no show/cancellation rate. The MCS team was able to increase our compliance with weekly lab reporting from April (60%) to July (93%). Patients stated that they like the option of telemedicine and are more comfortable in their home setting during visits. The coordinators also like the ability to see patients in their home environment and the ability to observe return demonstration of dressing change at follow up intervals via video conferencing. Conclusion Telemedicine and home monitoring have come a long way in the past few months, and can most definitely be used effectively in the MCS population. We observed an increase in adherence with treatment and an overall satisfaction in care received when patients were able to take an active role in their care, in their home, and at their preferred time of day. This study supports a change in practice to incorporate telemedicine into the routine care of the MCS population. We hope this will continue to increase patient satisfaction and decrease time patients spend in the hospital, which will increase quality of life.","Dinicola, Beth",Heart &amp; Lung,385,1

Using an in-situ simulation model, we evaluated laryngoscopist exposure of airborne particles sized 0.3 - 5.0 microns using five aerosol containment devices (aerosol box; sealed box with and without suction; vertical drape; and horizontal drape) compared with no aerosol containment device. Nebulised saline was used as the aerosol-generating model for 300 s, at which point, the devices were removed to assess particle spread. Primary outcome was the quantity and size of airborne particles measured at the level of the laryngoscopist's head at 30, 60, 120 and 300 s, as well as 360 s (60 s after device removal). Airborne particles sizes of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 microns were quantified using an electronic airborne particle counter. Compared with no device use, the sealed intubation box with suction resulted in a decrease in 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.5 micron, but not 5.0 micron, particle exposure over all time-periods (p = 0.003 for all time periods). Compared with no device use, the aerosol box showed an increase in 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 micron airborne particle exposure at 300 s (p = 0.002, 0.008, 0.002, respectively). Compared with no device use, neither horizontal nor vertical drapes showed any difference in any particle size exposure at any time. Finally, when the patient coughed, use of the aerosol box resulted in a marked increase in airborne particle exposure compared with other devices or no device use. In conclusion, novel devices intended to protect the laryngoscopist require objective testing to ensure they are fit for purpose and do not result in increased airborne particle exposure.","Simpson, J P; Wong, D N; Verco, L; Carter, R; Dzidowski, M; Chan, P Y",Anaesthesia,385,29

In the current study, we propose a framework that incorporates these three factors into a vicious circle that leads to deconditioning, a condition frequently experienced by this vulnerable population. Viewing aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia, and sarcopenia, along with their interrelationships through the lens of this vicious circle, illuminates the critical role that oral health plays in deconditioning. Moreover, this framework highlights oral care as a key nursing intervention for reducing deconditioning in hospitalized older adults. Supporting this view, several studies have shown that oral care can improve health outcomes for hospitalized older adults. However, despite oral care being an essential nursing intervention that restores oral function and promotes patient wellness, it is one of the most neglected nursing interventions. Missed oral care occurs due to staff's limited awareness of its significance for care-dependent older adults in hospital settings. We hope that this vicious circle paradigm helps raise awareness of the significance of oral care to prevent deconditioning in hospitalized older adults.

Objective: We aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ivermectin mucoadhesive nanosuspension intranasal spray in treatment of patients with mild COVID-19. Methods: This clinical trial included 114 patients diagnosed as mild COVID-19. Patients were divided randomly into two age and sex-matched groups; group A comprising 57 patients received ivermectin nanosuspension nasal spray twice daily plus the Egyptian protocol of treatment for mild COVID-19 and group B comprising 57 patients received the Egyptian protocol for mild COVID-19 only. Evaluation of the patients was performed depending on improvement of presenting manifestations, negativity of two consecutive pharyngeal swabs for the COVID-19 nucleic acid via rRT-PCR and assessments of hematological and biochemical parameters in the form of complete blood counts, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin and d-dimer which were performed at presentation and 7 days later. Results: Of the included patients confirmed with mild COVID-19, 82 were males (71.9%) and 32 females (28.1%) with mean age 45.1 ± 18.9. In group A, 54 patients (94.7%) achieved 2 consecutive negative PCR nasopharyngeal swabs in comparison to 43 patients (75.4%) in group B with P = 0.004. The durations of fever, cough, dyspnea and anosmia were significantly shorter in group A than group B, without significant difference regarding the duration of gastrointestinal symptoms. Duration taken for nasopharyngeal swab to be negative was significantly shorter in group A than in group B (8.3± 2.8 days versus 12.9 ± 4.3 days; P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Local use of ivermectin mucoadhesive nanosuspension nasal spray is safe and effective in treatment of patients with mild COVID-19 with rapid viral clearance and shortening the anosmia duration.

Static and dynamic analysis of the average treatment effects on the treated is conducted for the air quality index (AQI) and six criteria pollutants. The results indicate that, first, on average, the AQI decreased by about 7%. However, it was still over the threshold set by the World Health Organization. Second, we detect heterogeneous changes in the level of different pollutants, which suggests heterogeneous impacts of the lockdown on human activities: carbon monoxide (CO) had the biggest drop, about 30%, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) had the second-biggest drop, 20%. In contrast, ozone (O3) increased by 3.74% due to the changes in the NOx/VOCs caused by the decrease in NOx, the decrease of O3 titration, and particulate matter concentration. Third, air pollution levels rebounded immediately after the number of infections dropped, which indicates a swift recovery of human activities.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the social and professional effects of confinement on patients with MS in 2 very different populations, from Spain and China. METHODS: Questionnaires were administered to a group of patients with MS who consulted at the MS unit of Vithas hospital (DINAC Foundation) in Seville, and patients with MS attended in several provinces of China in April 2020, with the aim of analysing the differences and similarities between populations in the social and professional effects of confinement. To this end, a database was created and subsequently analysed. RESULTS: The Chinese population includes a higher proportion of younger patients and no differences were identified regarding sex. Most of the variables studied behaved in the same way in both patient populations. Spanish patients presented a lesser impact (30.7%) on their socio-economic situation than Chinese patients (44%) (P < .05). There were no significant differences between populations in the remaining variables. Social networks were widely used in the majority of patients from both populations.

Most of them required mechanical ventilation and someone in prone position (PP) too, because of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During PP, trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is not always easy, mainly due to the forced position of the neck of the patient. Moreover, during a pandemic, given the great number of patients needing treatment, TEE probes and monitoring devices are not widely available. Then, trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) plays a crucial role as it is non-invasive, repeatable, and available every time it is needed. Moreover, it can be safely performed also in prone position (TTEp). According to in-hospital protocol, TTEp was performed using the apical-four-chamber (A-4-C) view in 8 patients. We temporarily deflated the lower thoracic section of the air-mattress to place the probe between the mattress surface and the thorax of the patient. We collected both TEE and hemodynamics data. The main result of our retrospective analysis is that TTE can be performed in patients in prone positioning and is reliable and repeatable; the single apical-four-chamber view provides sufficient data to evaluate the cardiac performance in case of scarce availability of hemodynamic monitoring devices, like in a pandemic setting. TTE may be a helpful tool for cardiac performance evaluation and diagnosis not only in supine or anterolateral positioning like in echocardiographic lab, but also in subjects admitted to ICU due to ARDS needing of mechanical ventilation in prone positioning.","Giustiniano, Enrico; Fazzari, Fabio; Bragato, Renato Maria; Curzi, Mirko; Cecconi, Maurizio",SN Compr Clin Med,385,24

High-fidelity simulation (HFS) provides students with real-life clinical experiences that they would rarely confront in clinical training, especially complex case scenarios (such as a patient needing MV). PURPOSE: This study assessed students' clinical knowledge and judgment after including HFS involving MV in an undergraduate nursing program. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental design with a convenience sample of 151 nursing students using the Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the intervention and control groups in knowledge (t = 20.42; P = .001) and total clinical judgment scores (t = 19.55; P < .001) post-HFS. CONCLUSIONS: Including a complex case study using MV and HFS significantly improved students' clinical decision-making, clinical knowledge, and self-confidence and enhanced their critical thinking, noticing, interpreting, reflecting, and responding capabilities.","Salameh, Basma; Ayed, Ahmad; Kassabry, MaysaÊ¼; Lasater, Kathie",Nurse educ,385,16

METHODS: Orthopaedic surgery programs participating in the Electronic Residency Application Service were identified. One hundred seventy-five (175) programs were presented with a seven-item questionnaire addressing whether each program is using telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of the 175 Electronic Residency Application Service participant orthopaedic programs, 168 responded for a total response rate of 96%. Of the 106 institutions using telehealth services, 88 (83%) cited the COVID-19 pandemic as the impetus for implementation of telehealth services. Institutions located in the Northeast and South regions were markedly more likely to offer telehealth services. Heat map analysis demonstrates an associative overlap of regional ""hot spots"" with direct comparison of COVID-19 cases in the United States and orthopaedic departments providing telehealth services.

Among these, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) system is the most effective. However, the precise mechanism of GAD induction is unknown. We previously reported that a tolC mutant lacking the TolC outer membrane channel was defective in GAD induction. Here, we show that indole, a substrate of TolC-dependent efflux pumps and produced by the tryptophanase encoded by the tnaA gene, negatively regulates GAD expression. GAD expression was restored by deleting tnaA in the tolC mutant; in wild-type E. coli, it was suppressed by adding indole to the growth medium. RNA-sequencing revealed that tnaA mRNA levels drastically decreased upon exposure to moderately acidic conditions (pH 5.5). This decrease was suppressed by RNase E deficiency. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA is accelerated upon acid exposure, which decreases intracellular indole concentrations and triggers GAD induction.","Kanda, Takeshi; Abiko, Genta; Kanesaki, Yu; Yoshikawa, Hirofumi; Iwai, Noritaka; Wachi, Masaaki",Sci Rep,385,24

However, little is known about the socio-emotional impact of these closures on young children. This paper draws upon a study of 506 parents of children aged 1-10 years in Ireland who completed the online Play and Learning in the Early Years (PLEY) Survey during lockdown in May and June 2020. Parents responded to a series of questions about their child's play, learning and development during lockdown, and described the impact of the restrictions on their children's lives. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Findings indicate that most children missed their friends, playing with other children, and the routine and structure of ECEC and school settings. Parents described the negative impact of the closure of these settings on their children's social and emotional well-being, which they suggested, resulted in tantrums, anxiety, clinginess, boredom, and under-stimulation. However, some parents did report positive aspects of lockdown for their children and the family, including more time to play with siblings and a break from the usual routine. While the findings of the PLEY study indicate that children's socio-emotional development was severely disrupted during lockdown, with a variety of negative impacts, this experience was not universal. Moreover, the findings suggest that families missed the nurturing environment provided by ECEC programs that supported their children's socio-emotional development, as well as the structure and routine afforded by their children's participation in early childhood programs.","Egan, Suzanne M; Pope, Jennifer; Moloney, Mary; Hoyne, Clara; Beatty, Chloé",Early Child Educ J,385,14

A thorough understanding of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Australia plus the strategies that successfully 'flatten the curve' are vitally important to contain this pandemic. AIM: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in the Sutherland Shire, and the management model adopted to manage these patients. METHODS: A retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients monitored in the Sutherland Shire between 19 March and 15 May 2020 was performed. Demographic, clinical and outcome data of COVID-19 inpatients at the Sutherland Hospital and demographic data of COVID-19 patients in the Sutherland Shire community were obtained. The Sutherland Hospital COVID-19 Management Model involved close collaboration among the Sutherland Fever Clinic, Sutherland COVID-19 community telemonitoring team (CTAC) and Sutherland COVID-19 inpatient team. RESULTS: Ninety-nine COVID-19 cases (median age, 49 years, 50 (51%) male) were monitored in Sutherland Shire, with 19 cases (median age, 54 years, 10 (53%) male) requiring inpatient management. Common comorbidities included obesity, asthma, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Six (32%) patients required supplemental oxygen and three (16%) patients required intensive care admission. There was one mortality. The CTAC team identified five (5%) patients requiring admission, and three (3%) patients requiring re-admission. The majority of COVID-19 source was from overseas travel (67%), with nine (9%) cases having unknown source. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive COVID-19 management model is needed to successfully manage COVID-19 patients in both outpatient and inpatient settings in order to 'squash the curve'.","Louie, Teresa; Kwan, Ben; Susanto, Clarissa; Ng, Andrew",Intern Med J,385,24

In this work, we analyzed and compared the otolaryngology surgical activity performed during the pandemic in two large public hospitals located in different Italian regions. In northern Italy, otolaryngologists were mainly involved in performing surgical tracheotomies in COVID-19 positive patients and contributed to the management of these patients in intensive care units. In central Italy, where the burden of the infection was significantly lower, otolaryngologists focused on diagnosis and treatment of emergency and oncology patients.

By applying the principles of small-area estimation to existing models formulations for excess mortality, this study develops a method for assessing excess mortality across small populations and assesses the pattern of COVID excess mortality by province, year, week, age group, and sex in Italy from March through May 2020. We estimate that 53,200 excess deaths occurred across Italy during this time period, compared to just 35,500 deaths where COVID-19 was registered as the underlying cause of death. Out of the total excess mortality burden, 97% of excess deaths occurred among adults over age 60, and 68% of excess deaths were concentrated among adults over age 80. The burden of excess mortality was unevenly distributed across the country, with just three of Italys 107 provinces accounting for 32% of all excess mortality.

Although some institutions have maintained their traditional requirements, others have accelerated their programs to rush nearly graduated trainees to the front lines. One interpretation of the unplanned shortening of the duration of training programs during a crisis is that standards have been lowered. But it is also possible that these trainees were examined according to the same standards as usual and were judged to have already met them. This paper discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current workforce, provides an analysis of how competency-based medical education (CBME) in the context of the pandemic might have mitigated wide-scale disruption, and identifies structural barriers to achieving an ideal state. The paper further calls upon universities, health centres, governments, certifying bodies, regulatory authorities, and health care professionals to work collectively on a truly time-variable model of CBME. The pandemic has made clear that time variability in medical education already exists and should be adopted widely and formally. If our systems today had used a framework of outcome competencies, sequenced progression, tailored learning, focused instruction, and programmatic assessment, we may have been even more nimble in changing our systems to care for our patients with COVID-19.","Caretta-Weyer, Holly A; Chan, Teresa; Bigham, Blair L; Kinnear, Benjamin; Huwendiek, Sören; Schumacher, Daniel J",Med Teach,385,33

In addition, journals and authors published a mass of academic articles at a speed that suggests a non-existent or a non-rigorous peer review process. Such lapses can promote false information and adoption of health policies based on misleading data. Reliable information is vital for designing and implementing preventive measures and promoting health awareness in the fight against COVID-19. In the age of social media, information travels wide and fast, emphasizing a need for accurate data to be corroborated swiftly and for preventing misleading information from wide dissemination. Here, we discuss the implications of the COVID-19 infodemic and explore practical ways to leverage health communication strategies to overcome it.

This is seemingly related to a better replication of most respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, at lower-than-core body temperatures (i.e., 33 °C vs 37 °C). Also, intrinsic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 make it a heat-susceptible pathogen. Thermotherapy has successfully been used to combat viral infections in plants which could otherwise result in great economic losses; 90% of viruses causing infections in plants are positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid (+ssRNA) viruses, a characteristic shared by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is possible to envision the use of heat-based interventions (thermotherapy or mild-temperature hyperthermia) in patients with COVID-19 for which moderate cycles (every 8-12 h) of mild-temperature hyperthermia (1-2 h) have been proposed. However, there are potential safety and mechanistic concerns which could limit the use of thermotherapy only to patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to prevent disease progression rather than to treat patients who have already progressed to severe-to-critical COVID-19. Here, we review the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 which make it a heat-susceptible virus, potential host mechanisms which could be enhanced at higher temperatures to aid viral clearance, and how thermotherapy could be investigated as a modality of treatment in patients with COVID-19 while taking into consideration potential risks.","Mancilla-Galindo, Javier; Galindo-Sevilla, Norma",Int J Hyperthermia,385,16

In particular, academic institutions have been and continue to be plagued with the uncertainty of how COVID-19 will impact higher education. In the spring of 2020 all institutions were faced with the reality that remote learning would take place until the end of semester. During the fall semester of 2020 some institutions moved forward with face to face learning. However, they were quickly forced to return to remote learning as the case positivity rate increased. Higher education has offered online and distance education for decades. COVID-19 has now forced all institutions to pivot and offer the majority if not all classes online in a distance learning environment. During this pivot my university instituted The Mastering Online Teaching Course (MOT). The main goal was to introduce instructors new to teaching hybrid or full online courses the basics and best practices for online teaching during the pandemic. The course was a four week self-paced course that consisted of four learning modules. The objectives of the course were to 1) create a deconstructed syllabus, 2) incorporate backward design, alignment, and Transparency in Learning and Teaching (TILT) principles into online course design and delivery, 3) develop an assessment strategy that includes formative assessment, peer feedback, and authentic summative assessment, 4) create a variety of assessments in the learning management system, 5) curate and develop accessible content, all of which aligns to learner-centered outcomes and assessments, 6) add content to the learning management system and organize it so that everything is easy for students to navigate, 7) connect assessments to the gradebook, 8) implement strategies to foster a supportive online learning community and to 9) schedule announcements and set up intelligent agents to keep students organized, up-to-date, and on track. During the fall of 2020 several of the objectives from the MOT were incorporated into the Determinants of Health course. This is a required course for all public health majors. The main focus of the course is to describe the major biological and physiological processes that cause ill-health, with special focus on inflammation, infection, degeneration, neoplasm, and metabolic dysfunction. In particular, a deconstructed syllabus was created and several assessments were developed for the course per the objectives of the MOT. Moreover, a TILT assignment was developed using the Health is a Human Right Exhibit. End of the semester evaluations revealed the incorporated strategies were well received by the students. In conclusion, these are best practice strategies that are being used in a post-COVID-19 teaching environment to ensure students remain engaging in a remote learning environment.","King, Adrienne",The FASEB Journal,385,2

The quantitative and qualitative data on urban forest visits from that study were supplemented with new census data supported by selected expert interviews. We found that visitor numbers since the inception of COVID-19 measures in March 2020 have more than doubled. Visitor patterns have drastically shifted, from an even distribution throughout the day with small peaks before and after office hours to a culmination in the late afternoon. Lastly, the interviewed forestry professionals have noted that a new set of visitors, i.e. young people, families with children and non-locals, has arrived to the forest. This influx of more and novice visitors poses challenges for forest managers and urban forest policy. It is, however, also a unique opportunity for a substantial engagement of forestry with society at large, that has implications for forest policy, especially in urban areas, possibly beyond the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Derks, Jakob; Giessen, Lukas; Winkel, Georg",For.

Estimates of global vaccine acceptance among pregnant women and mothers of young children are yet unknown. An understanding of the challenges and correlates to vaccine acceptance will aid the acceleration of vaccine administration within these populations. Acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 18-years-old, as well as potential predictors, were assessed through an online survey, administered by Pregistry between October 28 and November 18, 2020. 17,871 total survey responses from 16 countries were obtained. Given a 90% COVID-19 vaccine efficacy, 52.0% of pregnant women (n = 2747/5282) and 73.4% of non-pregnant women (n = 9214/12,562) indicated an intention to receive the vaccine. 69.2% of women (n = 11,800/17,054), both pregnant and non-pregnant, indicated an intention to vaccinate their children. Vaccine acceptance was generally highest in India, the Philippines, and all sampled countries in Latin America; it was lowest in Russia, the United States and Australia. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance included confidence in vaccine safety or effectiveness, worrying about COVID-19, belief in the importance of vaccines to their own country, compliance to mask guidelines, trust of public health agencies/health science, as well as attitudes towards routine vaccines. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its predictors among women vary globally.

It is particularly useful when the target domain has very few or no labeled data, due to annotation expense, privacy concerns, etc. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of TL is not always guaranteed. Negative transfer (NT), i.e., leveraging source domain data/knowledge undesirably reduces the learning performance in the target domain, has been a long-standing and challenging problem in TL. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature to handle it. However, there does not exist a systematic survey on the formulation of NT, the factors leading to NT, and the algorithms that mitigate NT. This paper fills this gap, by first introducing the definition of NT and its factors, then reviewing about fifty representative approaches for overcoming NT, according to four categories: secure transfer, domain similarity estimation, distant transfer, and NT mitigation.

After the initial wave, although cardiac-related calls remained lower (-17.2 percent), out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence remained elevated (+24.8 percent) despite fewer COVID-19 infections and relaxed public health advisories. Throughout Boston's fourteen neighborhoods, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence was significantly associated with decreased cardiac-related calls, but not with COVID-19 infection rates. These findings suggest that patients were reluctant to obtain emergency care. Efforts are needed to ensure that patients seek timely care both during and after the pandemic to reduce potentially avoidable excess cardiovascular disease deaths.","Sun, Christopher; Dyer, Sophia; Salvia, James; Segal, Laura; Levi, Retsef",Health Aff (Millwood),385,30

Finally, we evaluated outcomes stratified by age. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and preprint websites was conducted between January 1, 2020, and December 10, 2020. Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews identification: CRD42020203369. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting on consecutive in-hospital cardiac arrest with a resuscitation attempt among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were synthesized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews guidelines. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus or through an independent third reviewer. DATA SYNTHESIS: Eight studies reporting on 847 in-hospital cardiac arrest were included. In-hospital cardiac arrest incidence varied between 1.5% and 5.8% among hospitalized patients and 8.0-11.4% among patients in ICU. In-hospital cardiac arrest occurred more commonly in older male patients. Most initial rhythms were nonshockable (83.9%, [asystole = 36.4% and pulseless electrical activity = 47.6%]). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 33.3%, with a 91.7% in-hospital mortality. In-hospital cardiac arrest events in ICU had higher incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (36.6% vs 18.7%; p < 0.001) and relatively lower mortality (88.7% vs 98.1%; p < 0.001) compared with in-hospital cardiac arrest in non-ICU locations. Patients greater than or equal to 60 years old had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than those less than 60 years (93.1% vs 87.9%; p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately, one in 20 patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 received resuscitation for an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Hospital survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest within the ICU was higher than non-ICU locations and seems comparable with prepandemic survival for nonshockable rhythms. Although the data provide guidance surrounding prognosis after in-hospital cardiac arrest, it should be interpreted cautiously given the paucity of information surrounding treatment limitations and resource constraints during the pandemic. Further research is into actual causative mechanisms is needed.","Lim, Zheng Jie; Ponnapa Reddy, Mallikarjuna; Curtis, J Randall; Afroz, Afsana; Billah, Baki; Sheth, Vishad; Hayek, Salim S; Leaf, David E; Miles, Jeremy A; Shah, Priyank; Yuriditsky, Eugene; Jones, Daryl; Shekar, Kiran; Subramaniam, Ashwin",Crit. care med,385,16

Two extensions are offered to compare the performance of the linear specification of the market model (LMM), which allows for the measurement of the cryptocurrency price beta risk. The first is the generalized additive model, which permits flexibility in the rigid shape of the linearity of the LMM. The second is the time-varying linearity specification of the LMM (Tv-LMM), which is based on the state space model form via the Kalman filter, allowing for the measurement of the time-varying beta risk of the cryptocurrency price. The analysis is performed using daily data from both time periods on the top 10 cryptocurrencies by adjusted market capitalization, using the Crypto Currency Index 30 (CCI30) as a market proxy and 1-day and 7-day forward predictions. Such a comparison of cryptocurrency prices has yet to be undertaken in the literature. The empirical findings favor the Tv-LMM, which outperforms the others in terms of modeling and forecasting performance. This result suggests that the relationship between each cryptocurrency price and the CCI30 index should be locally instead of globally linear, especially during the COVID-19 period.","Neslihanoglu, Serdar",Financial Innovation,385,33

Far from being neutral technical measures, indicators such as the Impact Factor and the h-index are deeply transforming the social and epistemic structures of contemporary science. At the same time, scholars have highlighted how bibliometric indicators are endowed with social meanings that go beyond their purely technical definitions. These social representations of bibliometric indicators are constructed and negotiated between different groups of actors within several arenas. This study aims to investigate how bibliometric indicators are used in a context, which, so far, has not yet been covered by researchers, that of daily newspapers. By a content analysis of a corpus of 583 articles that appeared in four major Italian newspapers between 1990 and 2020, we chronicle the main functions that bibliometrics and bibliometric indicators played in the Italian press. Our material shows, among other things, that the public discourse developed in newspapers creates a favorable environment for bibliometrics-centered science policies, that bibliometric indicators contribute to the social construction of scientific facts in the press, especially in science news related to medicine, and that professional bibliometric expertise struggles to be represented in newspapers and hence reach the general public.","Petrovich, Eugenio",,385,2

Early reports suggest that COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all COVID-19, positive with polymerase chain reaction confirmation, patients who had surgery between February 17, 2020 and April 26, 2020 at a major New York City hospital. Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 y, and there were more men than women in the cohort (56.4% versus 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test preoperatively, and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Postoperatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 d. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA class 3 or 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date, that objectively analyzes the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery. Overall, ICU admission rates and mortality are similar to reported rates in the literature for nonsurgical COVID-19 patients. Notably, in COVID-19 patients with ASA 1 or 2, there was a 0% mortality rate in the postoperative period.","Vranis, Neil M; Bekisz, Jonathan M; Daar, David A; Chiu, Ernest S; Wilson, Stelios C",J Surg Res,385,7

Unfortunately, the effects of such substances are still poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of the active neonicotinoid substance thiacloprid (TH) and the commercial product Calypso 480 SC (CA) (active compound 40.4% TH) on Mytilus galloprovincialis after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations. Mussels were tested for seven days to 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 TH and 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg L-1 CA. For this purpose, several parameters, such as cell viability of haemocytes and digestive cells, biochemical haemolymph features, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity of gills and digestive gland, as well as histology of such tissues were analysed. The sublethal concentrations of both substances lead to abatement or completely stopping the byssal fibres creation. Biochemical analysis of haemolymph showed significant changes (P < 0.01) in electrolytes ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, S-phosphor), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity and glucose concentration following exposure to both substances. The TH-exposed mussels showed significant imbalance (P < 0.05) in CAT activity in digestive gland and gills. CA caused significant decrease (P < 0.05) in SOD activity in gills and in CAT activity in both tissues. Results of histological analyses showed severe damage in both digestive gland and gills in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This study provides useful information about the acute toxicity of a neonicotinoid compound and a commercial insecticide on mussels. Nevertheless, considering that neonicotinoids are still widely used and that mussels are very important species for marine environment and human consumption, further researches are needed to better comprehend the potential risk posed by such compounds to aquatic non-target species.","Stara, Alzbeta; Pagano, Maria; Capillo, Gioele; Fabrello, Jacopo; Sandova, Marie; Albano, Marco; Zuskova, Eliska; Velisek, Josef; Matozzo, Valerio; Faggio, Caterina",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,385,26

The index case was diagnosed with pulmonary mucormycosis 21 days following admission for severe COVID-19.

We also performed a systematic review of the literature and identified seven additional cases of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM). Of the eight cases included in our review, diabetes mellitus was the most common risk factor. Three subjects had no risk factor other than glucocorticoids for COVID-19. Mucormycosis usually developed 10-14 days after hospitalization. All except the index case died. In two subjects, CAM was diagnosed postmortem. Mucormycosis is an uncommon but serious infection that complicates the course of severe COVID-19.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 186 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1st-April 15th, 2020 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The cohort included 62 patients with autoimmune disease and 124 age- and sex-matched controls. The primary outcome was a composite of intensive care unit admission, intubation, and death, with secondary outcome assessing time to in-hospital death. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, and laboratory values were collected. Conditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the association between autoimmune disease and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with autoimmune disease were more likely to have at least one comorbidity (25.8% vs. 12.9%, p=0.03), take chronic immunosuppressive medications (66.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.01), and have had a solid organ transplant (16.1% vs. 1.6%, p<0.01). There were no significant differences in intensive care unit admission (14.2% vs. 19.4%, p=0.44), intubation (14.2% vs. 17.7%, p=0.62) or death (17.5% vs. 14.5%, p=0.77). On multivariable analysis, patients with autoimmune disease were not at an increased risk for a composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death (adjOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.37-1.67). On Cox regression, autoimmune disease was not associated with in-hospital mortality (adjHR 0.73, 95%CI 0.33-1.63). CONCLUSION: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, individuals with autoimmune disease did not have an increased risk of a composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, intubation, or death.","Faye, Adam S; Lee, Kate E; Laszkowska, Monika; Kim, Judith; Blackett, John William; McKenney, Anna S; Krigel, Anna; Giles, Jon T; Wang, Runsheng; Bernstein, Elana J; Green, Peter H R; Krishnareddy, Suneeta; Hur, Chin; Lebwohl, Benjamin",J. rheumatol,385,26

On March 29, 2020, a staff member in a correctional and detention facility in Louisiana developed symptoms and later had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. During April 2-May 7, two additional cases were detected among staff members, and 36 cases were detected among incarcerated and detained persons at the facility; these persons were removed from dormitories and isolated, and the five dormitories that they had resided in before diagnosis were quarantined. On May 7, CDC and the Louisiana Department of Health initiated an investigation to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among incarcerated and detained persons residing in quarantined dormitories. Goals of this investigation included evaluating COVID-19 symptoms in this setting and assessing the effectiveness of serial testing to identify additional persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of efforts to mitigate transmission. During May 7-21, testing of 98 incarcerated and detained persons residing in the five quarantined dormitories (A-E) identified an additional 71 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 32 (45%) were among persons who reported no symptoms at the time of testing, including three who were presymptomatic. Eighteen cases (25%) were identified in persons who had received negative test results during previous testing rounds. Serial testing of contacts from shared living quarters identified persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who would not have been detected by symptom screening alone or by testing at a single time point. Prompt identification and isolation of infected persons is important to reduce further transmission in congregate settings such as correctional and detention facilities and the communities to which persons return when released.","Njuguna, Henry; Wallace, Megan; Simonson, Sean; Tobolowsky, Farrell A; James, Allison E; Bordelon, Keith; Fukunaga, Rena; Gold, Jeremy A W; Wortham, Jonathan; Sokol, Theresa; Haydel, Danielle; Tran, Ha; Kim, Kaylee; Fisher, Kiva A; Marlow, Mariel; Tate, Jacqueline E; Doshi, Reena H; Curran, Kathryn G",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,385,20

HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 infection may result in cardiovascular manifestations leading to worse clinical outcome. METHODS: Fifty four severe and critical patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Risk factors predicting the severity of COVID-19 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients (56.1 ± 13.5 years old, 66.7% male) with COVID-19, 39 were diagnosed as severe and 15 as critical cases. The occurrence of diabetes, the level of D-dimer, inflammatory and cardiac markers in critical cases were significantly higher. Troponin I (TnI) elevation occurred in 42.6% of all the severe and critical patients. Three patients experienced hypotension at admission and were all diagnosed as critical cases consequently. Hypotension was found in one severe case and seven critical cases during hospitalization. Sinus tachycardia is the most common type of arrythmia and was observed in 23 severe patients and all the critical patients. Atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia were observed in critical patients at end stage while bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were less common. Mild pericardial effusion was observed in one severe case and five critical cases. Three critical cases suffered new onset of heart failure. Hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury and pericardial effusion were independent risk factors predicting the critical status of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: This study has systemically observed the impact of COVID-19 on cardiovascular system, including myocardial injury, blood pressure, arrythmia and cardiac function in severe and critical cases. Monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function of COVID-19 patients and applying potential interventions especially for those with hypotension during treatment, severe myocardial injury or pericardial effusion, is of vital importance.","Chen, Qingxing; Xu, Lili; Dai, Yongbin; Ling, Yunlong; Mao, Jiahao; Qian, Juying; Zhu, Wenqing; Di, Wencheng; Ge, Junbo",Clin Cardiol,385,16

However, some patients additionally present with neurological symptoms. Recent studies also show a broad range of neuroimaging features. The purpose of this study was to perform a snapshot analysis to approximate the frequency and types of neuroimaging findings on CT and MRI scans in a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in a level I COVID-19 center, both in general and in critically ill patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed brain CT and MRI scans of 34 hospitalized COVID-19 patients at our level I COVID-19 center between March 15 and April 24 with regard to pathological neuroimaging findings. In addition, clinical parameters such as neurological symptoms, comorbidities, and type of ventilation therapy were also documented. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Pathological findings were detected in 38.2â% of patients in the study cohort. Based on the weekly institutional SARS-CoV-2 report of all positively tested patients in our clinic at the time of data collection, neuroimaging findings could be found in 6â% of all patients (34/565). The most common findings were microbleeds (20.6â%) and signs of hypoxic brain injury (11.8â%). Furthermore, cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage, typical and atypical cerebral hematomas, ischemic strokes, and generalized brain edema were documented. All neuroimaging findings occurred in patients who were either intubated or treated by ECMO. CONCLUSION: Based on the analysis of this large cohort of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, pathological neuroimaging findings seem to be relatively rare in general but do occur in a substantial proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 disease needing intubation or ECMO. KEY POINTS: · Neuroimaging findings appear to be relatively rare in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.. · Pathological findings occur mainly in critically ill COVID-19 patients.. · Frequent findings include hemorrhagic, ischemic and hypoxic changes.. · Critically ill COVID-19 patients should receive neuroimaging with a low threshold..

As of February 1, 2021, 38 states and the District of Columbia had universal masking mandates. Mask wearing has also been mandated by executive order for federal property* as well as on domestic and international transportation conveyances. Masks substantially reduce exhaled respiratory droplets and aerosols from infected wearers and reduce exposure of uninfected wearers to these particles. Cloth masks§ and medical procedure masks¶ fit more loosely than do respirators (e.g., N95 facepieces). The effectiveness of cloth and medical procedure masks can be improved by ensuring that they are well fitted to the contours of the face to prevent leakage of air around the masks' edges. During January 2021, CDC conducted experimental simulations using pliable elastomeric source and receiver headforms to assess the extent to which two modifications to medical procedure masks, 1) wearing a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask (double masking) and 2) knotting the ear loops of a medical procedure mask where they attach to the mask's edges and then tucking in and flattening the extra material close to the face (knotted and tucked masks), could improve the fit of these masks and reduce the receiver's exposure to an aerosol of simulated respiratory droplet particles of the size considered most important for transmitting SARS-CoV-2. The receiver's exposure was maximally reduced (>95%) when the source and receiver were fitted with modified medical procedure masks. These laboratory-based experiments highlight the importance of good fit to optimize mask performance. Until vaccine-induced population immunity is achieved, universal masking is a highly effective means to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2** when combined with other protective measures, such as physical distancing, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces, and good hand hygiene. Innovative efforts to improve the fit of cloth and medical procedure masks to enhance their performance merit attention.","Brooks, John T; Beezhold, Donald H; Noti, John D; Coyle, Jayme P; Derk, Raymond C; Blachere, Francoise M; Lindsley, William G",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,385,16

The objective of the current study was to characterize exhaled breath from mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we used real-time, online, proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry to perform a metabolomic analysis of expired air from adults undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit due to severe COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). FINDINGS: Between March 25th and June 25th, 2020, we included 40 patients with ARDS, of whom 28 had proven COVID-19. In a multivariate analysis, we identified a characteristic breathprint for COVID-19. We could differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS with accuracy of 93% (sensitivity: 90%, specificity: 94%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0â¢94-0â¢98, after cross-validation).

Therefore, understanding their clinical evolution beyond hospital discharge is essential not only from an individual standpoint, but from a populational level. OBJECTIVES: Our primary aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 3 months after hospital discharge. Additionally, we screened for anxiety and depression and assessed important clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a single-center cohort study performed in Sao Paulo (Brazil), in which participants were contacted by telephone to answer a short survey. EQ-5D-3L was used to assess HRQoL and clinical data from patients' index admission were retrieved from medical records. RESULTS: We contacted 251 participants (59.8% males, mean age 53 years old), 69.7% of which had presented with severe COVID-19. At 3 months of follow-up, 6 patients had died, 51 (20.3%) had visited the emergency department again and 17 (6.8%) had been readmitted to hospital. Seventy patients (27.9%) persisted with increased dyspnoea and 81 had a positive screening for anxiety/depression. Similarly, patients reported an overall worsening of EQ-5D-3L single summary index at 3 months compared to before the onset of COVID-19 symptoms (0.8012 (0.7368 - 1.0) vs. 1.0(0.7368 - 1.0), p < 0.001). This affected all 5 domains, but especially pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Only female sex and intensive care requirement were independently associated with worsening of HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 frequently face persistent clinical and mental health problems up to 3 months following hospital discharge, with significant impact on patients' HRQoL.","Todt, Beatriz Costa; Szlejf, Claudia; Duim, Etienne; Linhares, Alana O M; Kogiso, Diogo; Varela, Gabriela; Campos, Bruna A; Baghelli Fonseca, Cristina Mara; Polesso, Leonardo E; Bordon, Ingra N S; Cabral, Bruno T; Amorim, Victor L P; Piza, Felipe M T; Degani-Costa, Luiza Helena",Respir Med,385,25

The present research aimed to assess the level of misconceptions and the factors associated with it among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: A selected Rohingya camp situated in Cox's Bazar, a southeastern district of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: Information was collected from 416 conveniently selected FDMNs who were aged 60 years and above. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was misconceptions related to the spread, prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Information on 14 different locally relevant misconceptions was gathered, each was scored as one, and obtained a cumulative score, ranging from 0 to 14, with a higher score indicating a higher level of misconceptions. A multiple linear regression model explored the factors associated with misconceptions. RESULTS: The participants had an average of five misconceptions. The most prevalent misconceptions were: everyone should wear personal protective equipment when outside (84.6%) and its prevention by nutritious food (62.5%) and drinking water (59.3%). Other notable misconceptions included the spread of COVID-19 through mosquito bites (42%) and its transmissions only to the non/less religious person (31.4%). In regression analyses, memory or concentration problems, communication frequency with social networks, pre-existing conditions and receiving information from health workers were significantly associated with higher COVID-19 misconceptions. These misconceptions were less likely among those overwhelmed by COVID-19, having COVID-19 diagnosed friends or family members and receiving information from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found that misconceptions were prevalent among the older FDMNs in Bangladesh. The associations have important implications for programmes to prevent and manage COVID-19 in these settings. Health workers need to be adequately trained to provide clear communication and counter misconceptions.","Mistry, Sabuj Kanti; Ali, A R M Mehrab; Yadav, Uday Narayan; Ghimire, Saruna; Hossain, Md Belal; Saha, Manika; Reza, Sompa; Bakshi, Progati; Bhuiyan, Abu Toha M R H; Harris, Mark",BMJ Open,385,6

In this study, Au@Ag nanorods (Au@AgNRs) were successfully synthesized by coating AuNRs with silver and were shown for the first time to have activity against the replication of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Viral titer analysis demonstrated that Au@AgNRs could inhibit PEDV infection by 4 orders of magnitude at 12 h post-infection, which was verified by viral protein expression analysis. The potential mechanism of action showed that Au@AgNRs could inhibit the entry of PEDV and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activity. Additionally, we demonstrated that a large amount of virus proliferation can cause the generation of reactive oxygen species in cells, and the released Ag+ and exposed AuNRs by Au@AgNRs after the stimulation of reactive oxygen species has superior antiviral activity to ensure long-term inhibition of the PEDV replication cycle. The integrated results support that Au@AgNRs can serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the replication of coronavirus.","Du, Ting; Zhang, Jinyu; Li, Chunqiao; Song, Tao; Li, Ping; Liu, Jifeng; Du, Xinjun; Wang, Shuo",Bioconjug Chem,385,1

The results of these studies, as well as global trends in the digitalization and globalization of the economy, made the authors aware of the need to distinguish this field of research in an independent, focused direction with their own subject and object area, metatology and methodological tools, like production and music, innovation, investment and other areas in management. To identify this direction, the authors propose to name it “Transformation Management.” At the same time, the authors formulate and submit to the general discussion of the scientific community the content of the subject and object area of this area, as well as the methodological foundations of transformational management developed by them, including the fundamental principles, forms and methods of business transformation. Design/methodology/approach: systems and situational approaches, strategic and effective management methodology. Findings: conceptual foundations of a new scientific direction in the economy, organization and management of entrepreneurship, called “Transformation Management,” have been developed.

Considering the lack of appropriate therapy for COVID-19, it is crucial to develop effective treatments instead of supportive approaches. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as multipotent stromal cells have been shown to possess treating potency through inhibiting or modulating the pathological events in COVID-19. MSCs and their exosomes participate in immunomodulation by controlling cell-mediated immunity and cytokine release. Furthermore, they repair the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) malfunction, increase alveolar fluid clearance, and reduce the chance of hypercoagulation. Besides the lung, which is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, the heart, kidney, nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract are also affected by COVID-19. Thus, the efficacy of targeting these organs via different delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes should be evaluated to ensure safe and effective MSCs administration in COVID-19. This review focuses on the proposed therapeutic mechanisms and delivery routes of MSCs and their exosomes to the damaged organs. It also discusses the possible application of primed and genetically modified MSCs as a promising drug delivery system in COVID-19. Moreover, the recent advances in the clinical trials of MSCs and MSCs-derived exosomes as one of the promising therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 have been reviewed.","Jamshidi, Elham; Babajani, Amirhesam; Soltani, Pegah; Niknejad, Hassan",Stem Cell Rev Rep,385,16

Early diagnosis of these cases is a powerful tool to control the pandemic. Our objective was to characterise patients with AC status and identify associated sociodemographic factors. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design and the national database of daily occurrence of COVID-19, we characterised both socially and demographically all ACs. Additional correspondence analysis and logistic regression model were performed to identify characteristics associated with AC state (OR, 95% CI). RESULTS: 76.162 ACs (12.1%; 95% CI 12.0% to 12.2%) were identified, mainly before epidemiological week 35. Age&#8804;26 years (1.18; 1.09 to 1.28), male sex (1.51; 1.40 to 1.62), cases imported from Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Puerto Rico, Spain, USA or Mexico (12.6; 3.03 to 52.5) and autochthonous cases (22.6; 5.62 to 91.4) increased the risk of identifying ACs.

However, the impact on vascular surgery (VS) trainees has not yet been determined. The goals of our study were to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on VS trainees' personal and professional life and to assess stressors, coping, and support structures involved in these trainees' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was an anonymous online survey administered in April 12-24, 2020 during the surge phase of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It is a subset analysis of the cross-sectional Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Committee Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey. The cohort surveyed was VS trainees, integrated residents and fellows, in the United States of America. Assessment of the personal impact of the pandemic on VS trainees and the coping strategies used by them was based on the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale and the validated 28-time Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory. RESULTS: A total of 145 VS trainees responded to the survey, with a 23% response rate (145/638). Significant changes were made to the clinical responsibilities of VS trainees, with 111 (91%) reporting cancellation of elective procedures, 101 (82%) with call schedule changes, 34 (24%) with duties other than related to VS, and 29 (24%) participation in outpatient care delivery. Over one-third (52/144) reported they had performed a procedure on a patient with confirmed COVID-19; 37 (25.7%) reported they were unaware of the COVID-19 status at the time. The majority continued to work after exposure (29/34, 78%). Major stressors included concerns about professional development, infection risk to family/friends, and impact of care delay on patients. The median score for GAD-7 was 4 (interquartile range 1-8), which corresponds to no or low self-reported anxiety levels. VS trainees employed mostly active coping and rarely avoidant coping mechanisms, and the majority were aware and used social media and online support systems. No significant difference was observed between integrated residents and fellows, or by gender. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has had significant impact on VS trainees. Trainees reported significant changes to clinical responsibilities, exposure to COVID-19, and pandemic-related stressors but demonstrated healthy coping mechanisms with low self-reported anxiety levels. The VS community should maintain awareness of the impact of the pandemic on the professional and personal development of surgeons in training. We recommend adaptive evolution in training to accommodate the changing learning environment for trainees.","Johnson, Adam P; Wohlauer, Max V; Mouawad, Nicolas J; Malgor, Rafael D; Coogan, Sheila M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Singh, Niten; Cuff, Robert F; Woo, Karen; Coleman, Dawn M; Shalhub, Sherene",Ann. vasc. surg,385,29

The measures included domestic quarantine (not leaving home) for infected or potentially infected people. Due to the need for social distancing, online activity increased in spring 2020. This could foster the risk for addictive social media use (SMU). The present study investigated tendencies of addictive SMU and their relationship with depression, anxiety and stress symptoms specifically among individuals who stayed in domestic quarantine due to COVID-19 in Germany and Lithuania. Methods In Germany (N=529;quarantine group: n=157, non-quarantine group: n=372) and in Lithuania (N=325;quarantine group: n=54, non-quarantine group: n=271), data were assessed via online surveys in spring 2020. Results In both countries, persons in quarantine had higher levels of addictive SMU, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than individuals who were not in quarantine. The difference was significant only for addictive SMU in the German sample. The significant positive correlations between addictive SMU and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were stronger in the quarantine groups than in the non-quarantine groups. Limitations The mostly female, young and well-educated composition of both investigated samples limits generalizability of current findings. Conclusions Results reveal first evidence that the use of social media during domestic COVID-19 quarantine might contribute to the increase of addictive tendencies and negatively impact well-being. Alternative ways of daily routine during the quarantine are discussed.","Brailovskaia, Julia Truskauskaite-Kuneviciene Inga Margraf Jürgen Kazlauskas Evaldas",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,385,16

In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where people may have limited access to affordable quality care, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to have a particularly adverse impact on the health and healthcare of individuals with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). A World Health Organization survey found that disruption of delivery of healthcare for NCDs was more significant in LMICs than in high-income countries. However, the study did not elicit insights into the day-to-day impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare by front-line healthcare workers (FLHCWs). AIM: To gain insights directly from FLHCWs working in countries with a high NCD burden, and thereby identify opportunities to improve the provision of healthcare during the current pandemic and in future healthcare emergencies. METHODS: We recruited selected frontline healthcare workers (general practitioners, pharmacists, and other medical specialists) from nine countries to complete an online survey (n = 1347). Survey questions focused on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice and NCDs; barriers to clinical care during the pandemic; and innovative responses to the many challenges presented by the pandemic. FINDINGS: The majority of FLHCWs responding to our survey reported that their care of patients had been impacted both adversely and positively by the public health measures imposed. Most FLHCs (95%) reported a deterioration in the mental health of their patients. CONCLUSIONS: Continuity of care for NCDs as part of pandemic preparedness is needed so that chronic conditions are not exacerbated by public health measures and the direct impacts of the pandemic.","Bullen, Chris; McCormack, Jessica; Calder, Amanda; Parag, Varsha; Subramaniam, Kannan; Majumdar, Anurita; Huang, Pai-Hui; Devi, Ratna; El Bizri, Luna; Goodyear-Smith, Felicity",Prim Health Care Res Dev,385,16

Due to fear and social stigma linked with COVID-19, many individuals in the community hide their disease and do not access healthcare facilities in a timely manner. In addition, with the widespread use of social media, rumours, myths and inaccurate information about the virus are spreading rapidly, leading to intensified irritability, fearfulness, insomnia, oppositional behaviours and somatic complaints. Considering the relevance of all these factors, we aim to explore the perceptions and attitudes of community members towards COVID-19 and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This formative research will employ an exploratory qualitative research design using semistructured interviews and a purposive sampling approach. The data collection methods for this formative research will include indepth interviews with community members. The study will be conducted in the Karimabad Federal B Area and in the Garden (East and West) community settings in Karachi, Pakistan. The community members of these areas have been selected purposively for the interview. Study data will be analysed thematically using NVivo V.12 Plus software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Aga Khan University Ethical Review Committee (2020-4825-10599). The results of the study will be disseminated to the scientific community and to the research subjects participating in the study. The findings will help us explore the perceptions and attitudes of different community members towards the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being.","Shahil Feroz, Anam; Akber Ali, Naureen; Akber Ali, Noshaba; Feroz, Ridah; Nazim Meghani, Salima; Saleem, Sarah",BMJ Open,385,16

In recent decades, biotechnological advances have led to the development of numerous innovative therapeutic molecules and vaccine immunogens. However, we still lack effective treatments and vaccines against many respiratory pathogens. More than ever, there is a need for a fast, predictive, preclinical pipeline, to keep pace with emerging diseases. Animal models are key for the preclinical development of disease management strategies. The predictive value of these models depends on their ability to reproduce the features of the human disease, the mode of transmission of the infectious agent and the availability of technologies for monitoring infection. This review focuses on the use of non-human primates as relevant preclinical models for the development of prevention and treatment for human respiratory infections.","Lemaitre, Julien; Naninck, Thibaut; Delache, Benoît; Creppy, Justina; Huber, Philippe; Holzapfel, Marion; Bouillier, Camille; Contreras, Vanessa; Martinon, Frédéric; Kahlaoui, Nidhal; Pascal, Quentin; Tricot, Sabine; Ducancel, Frédéric; Vecellio, Laurent; Le Grand, Roger; Maisonnasse, Pauline",Mol Immunol,385,1

METHODS: A multi-ethnic, multinational Latin American SLE cohort was studied. Familial lupus was defined as patients with a first-degree SLE relative; these relatives were interviewed in person or by telephone. Clinical variables, disease activity, damage, and mortality were compared. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard adjusted for potential confounders for time to damage and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 66 (5.6%) patients had familial lupus, and 1110 (94.4%) had sporadic lupus. Both groups were predominantly female, of comparable age, and of similar ethnic distribution. Discoid lupus (OR = 1.97; 95% CI 1.08-3.60) and neurologic disorder (OR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.00-2.73) were significantly associated with familial SLE; pericarditis was negatively associated (OR = 0.35; 95% CI 0.14-0.87). The SLE Disease Activity Index and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) were similar in both groups, although the neuropsychiatric (45.4% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.04) and musculoskeletal (6.1% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.02) domains of the SDI were more frequent in familial lupus. They were not retained in the Cox models (by domains). Familial lupus was not significantly associated with damage accrual (HR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.30-1.55) or mortality (HR = 1.23; 95% CI 0.26-4.81). CONCLUSION: Familial SLE is not characterized by a more severe form of disease than sporadic lupus. We also observed that familial SLE has a higher frequency of discoid lupus and neurologic manifestations and a lower frequency of pericarditis.","Quintana, Rosana; Pons-Estel, Guillermo J; Roberts, Karen; Sacnún, Mónica; Serrano, Rosa; Nieto, Romina; Conti, Silvana; Gervasoni, Viviana; Catoggio, Luis J; Soriano, Enrique R; Scolnik, Marina; García, Mercedes A; Alvarellos, Alejandro; Saurit, Verónica; Berbotto, Guillermo A; Sato, Emilia I; Costallat, Lilian T Lavras; Neto, Eduardo Ferreira Borba; Bonfa, Eloisa; Xavier, Ricardo M; de Oliveira E Silva Montandon, Ana Carolina; Molina-Restrepo, José Fernando; Iglesias-Gamarra, Antonio; Guibert-Toledano, Marlene; Reyes-Llerena, Gil Alberto; Massardo, Loreto; Neira, Oscar J; Cardiel, Mario H; Barile-Fabris, Leonor A; Amigo, Mary-Carmen; Silveira, Luis H; Torre, Ignacio García De La; Acevedo-Vásquez, Eduardo M; Ugarte-Gil, Manuel F; Alfaro-Lozano, José Luis; Segami, María Inés; Chacón-Díaz, Rosa; Esteva-Spinetti, María H; Gomez-Puerta, José A; Alarcón, Graciela S; Pons-Estel, Bernardo A",Lupus,385,20

However, they are under incredible unknown psychological pressures with a considerable risk of infection. In this study, a self-administered questionnaire was used to survey 593 frontline nurses in Wuhan City and non-Hubei provinces for psychological responses from March 1 to March 10, 2020. Compared with nurses outside Hubei Province, those working in Wuhan were more likely to feel physically and mentally exhausted. Their probable depression and anxiety were significantly higher than those of nurses outside Hubei province (31.2%, 18.3% vs. 13.8%, 5.9%). Correspondingly, the depressive symptoms were more often reported in the Wuhan group (70.8% vs. 41.4%). Although Wuhan received wishes, concerns, and abundant psychological and material resources from all of the world, the survey-based study found that frontline nurses in Wuhan still had higher depression and anxiety with less social support compared with nurses from non-Hubei provinces. Unexpectedly, only 4.0% of nurses have sought psychological assistance. These findings suggested that the short-term psychological impact of frontline nurses in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak was extremely high compared with nurses outside Hubei Province.

This study further explores factors that may affect this adaptive behavior, namely, the intention to adapt behavior, religiosity, social influence and trust in the government.Design/methodology/approachData were collected through an online survey to purposively sample the respondents, resulting in 368 responses that were valid for structural analysis using partial least squares structual equation modeling (SEM).FindingsThis study found that PMT, and not religiosity, directly predicts an individual’s intention to adapt his/her behavior to at-home worship during the pandemic. Religiosity, however, has a role in evoking a coping appraisal that leads to the intention to enact the adaptive behavior. Further, this study found that intention, social influence and trust in the government predict an individual’s adaptive behavior for at-home worship.Practical implicationsThis study may guide the government to create a policy that could enhance people’s adherence to adaptive behavior during the pandemic, particularly regarding their communication strategy by focusing on the cognitive and psychological aspects. In particular, framing based on this study’s result may serve as an insight for better prevention of virus transmission through a focused communications strategy.Originality/valueFirst, the utilization of PMT to explain adaptive behavior in the context of at-home worship during the pandemic was extended. Second, the research of religiosity in the context of a pandemic was advanced and how it influences adaptive behavior was investigated. Finally, the utilization of partial least squares-SEM techniques to investigate individual adaptive behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic was extended.","Rostiani, Rokhima Toyib Jein Sriana Khoiriyah Siti",Journal of Islamic Marketing,385,24

SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain has shown a heterogeneous geographical pattern This study aimed to assess the influence of several climatic factors on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 among the Spanish Autonomous Communities (AA.CC.). METHODS: Data on coronavirus infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease, as well as the climatic variables were obtained from official sources (Ministry of Health and Spanish Meteorological Agency, respectively). To assess the possible influence of climate on the development of the disease, data on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) were collected during the months before the start of the pandemic. To analyze its influence on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, data on UVR, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the months of highest contagiousness to the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: From October 2019 to January 2020, mean UVR was significantly related not only to SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence -previous 14 days- × 105 habitants, rho = - 0.0,666; p = 0.009), but also with COVID-19 severity, assessed as hospital admissions (rho = - 0.626; p = 0.017) and ICU admissions (rho = - 0.565; p = 0.035). Besides, temperature (February: rho = - 0.832; p < 0.001 and March: rho = - 0.904; p < 0.001), was the main climatic factor responsible for the infectivity of the coronavirus and directly contributed to a different spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the Spanish regions. CONCLUSIONS: Climatic factors may partially explain the differences in COVID-19 incidence and severity across the different Spanish regions. The knowledge of these factors could help to develop preventive and public health actions against upcoming outbreaks of the disease.","Cacho, Pedro Muñoz; Hernández, José L; López-Hoyos, Marcos; Martínez-Taboada, Víctor M",Environ Health,385,16

To date, no drug has been clinically approved for treatment of COVID-19. Nanotechnology has a great potential in contributing significantly to the fight against COVID-19 by developing effective therapies that can selectively eradicate the respiratory virus load. We propose a novel COVID-19 management approach that is efficient in eliminating the virus load from the airways and protecting the lungs from the fatal effects of the virus. This approach relies on targeting the virus using ACE-2-functionalized gold nanorods (AuNRs) followed by irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light for the selective eradication of SARS-CoV-2 without off-target effects, i.e., targeted plasmonic photothermal therapy. Using discrete dipole approximation (DDA), we quantitatively determined the efficiency of AuNRs (31 nm × 8 nm) in absorbing NIR when present at different orientations relative to one another on the surface of the virus. The safety and the local administration of AuNRs using a well-tolerated flexible bronchoscopy technique, commonly used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ensure feasibility and clinical translation. While requiring further research, we anticipate this approach to result in a first-line treatment for hospitalized COVID-19 patients that are experiencing severe respiratory conditions or belong to a high-risk population, e.g., seniors and diabetic patients.","Labouta, Hagar I; Hooshmand, Nasrin; Upreti, Tushar; El-Sayed, Mostafa A",Plasmonics,385,1

Recently, researchers have proposed various methods for feature extraction and classification based on MI signals. The decoding model based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has attracted significant attention in the field of MI signal processing. Due to the strict requirements for subjects and experimental environments, it is difficult to collect large-scale and high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, the performance of a deep learning model depends directly on the size of the datasets. Therefore, the decoding of MI-EEG signals based on a DNN has proven highly challenging in practice. Based on this, we investigated the performance of different data augmentation (DA) methods for the classification of MI data using a DNN. First, we transformed the time series signals into spectrogram images using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Then, we evaluated and compared the performance of different DA methods for this spectrogram data. Next, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the MI signals and compared the classification performance of after DA. The Fréchet inception distance (FID) was used to evaluate the quality of the generated data (GD) and the classification accuracy, and mean kappa values were used to explore the best CNN-DA method. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-tests were used to assess the significance of the results. The results showed that the deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) provided better augmentation performance than traditional DA methods: geometric transformation (GT), autoencoder (AE), and variational autoencoder (VAE) (p < 0.01). Public datasets of the BCI competition IV (datasets 1 and 2b) were used to verify the classification performance. Improvements in the classification accuracies of 17% and 21% (p < 0.01) were observed after DA for the two datasets. In addition, the hybrid network CNN-DCGAN outperformed the other classification methods, with average kappa values of 0.564 and 0.677 for the two datasets.","Zhang, Kai; Xu, Guanghua; Han, Zezhen; Ma, Kaiquan; Zheng, Xiaowei; Chen, Longting; Duan, Nan; Zhang, Sicong",,385,26

Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States, we explore correlates of transmission across US states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modeling. We find that policy intervention (""lockdown"") and reductions in individuals' mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but, in their absence, lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioral changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of COVID-19, reveal its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","Smith, Thomas P; Flaxman, Seth; Gallinat, Amanda S; Kinosian, Sylvia P; Stemkovski, Michael; Unwin, H Juliette T; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Tristem, Michael; Pearse, William D",Proc.

Factors influencing dietary intake among the diverse African populations are not well understood. Our objective was to characterize the dietary intake and their determinants in the two main ethnic groups experiencing nutrition transition in Cameroon, the Bamiléké and the Béti. We sampled Bamiléké (381) and Béti (347) adults living in both rural and urban, collected sociodemographic variables, assessed dietary patterns by using a food portion photographs book to administrate a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 24-hour dietary recall technique, and derived their Body Mass Index (BMI) from measured weight and height. The dietary patterns of Bamiléké people were comprised of more energy-dense foods than the Béti people, regardless of the living area. The energy intake (13·8 (SD 4·6)-15·4 (SD 4·8) MJ vs 9·7 (SD 3·5)-11·2 (SD 3·9 MJ) and the obesity (15-29 % vs 5-8 %) were therefore higher in Bamiléké than in Béti respectively. Multivariable linear regression analyses showed strong associations of both ethnicities (4·02 MJ; P <0·001), living area (0·21 MJ; P <0·001), and education (0·59 MJ; P <0·048) with energy intake (EI), independently of each other and other sociodemographic factors. The ethnicity factor has been characterized as the more important determinant of diet. Our findings provide new insights and perspectives highlighting the importance of anthropological factors when building prevention campaigns against obesity in Central Africa.","Amougou, Norbert; Pasquet, Patrick; Bernard, Jonathan Y; Ponty, Amandine; Fotso, Martin; Said-Mohamed, Rihlat; Cohen, Emmanuel",Br J Nutr,385,24

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate associations between public knowledge about COVID-19, adherence to social distancing, and public trust in government information sources (eg, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), private sources (eg, FOX and CNN), and social networks (eg, Facebook and Twitter) to inform future policies related to critical information distribution. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (N=1243) between April 10 and 14, 2020. Data collection was stratified by US region and other demographics to ensure representativeness of the sample. RESULTS: Government information sources were the most trusted among the public. However, we observed trends in the data that suggested variations in trust by age and gender. White and older populations generally expressed higher trust in government sources, while non-White and younger populations expressed higher trust in private sources (eg, CNN) and social networks (eg, Twitter). Trust in government sources was positively associated with accurate knowledge about COVID-19 and adherence to social distancing. However, trust in private sources (eg, FOX and CNN) was negatively associated with knowledge about COVID-19. Similarly, trust in social networks (eg, Facebook and Twitter) was negatively associated with both knowledge and adherence to social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: During pandemics such as the COVID-19 outbreak, policy makers should carefully consider the quality of information disseminated through private sources and social networks. Furthermore, when disseminating urgent health information, a variety of information sources should be used to ensure that diverse populations have timely access to critical knowledge.","Fridman, Ilona; Lucas, Nicole; Henke, Debra; Zigler, Christina K",JMIR Public Health Surveill,385,15

In the last decade, the field has seen significant advances in the understanding and use of this new technology. This review aims to describe the large, randomized controlled studies leading to the modern use of rTMS for MDD. It also includes a special section briefly discussing the use of these technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent findings: Several new approaches and technologies are emerging in this field, including novel approaches to reduce treatment time and potentially yield new approaches to optimize and maximize clinical outcomes. Of these, theta burst TMS now has evidence indicating it is non-inferior to standard TMS and provides significant advantages in administration. Recent studies also indicate that neuroimaging and related approaches may be able to improve TMS targeting methods and potentially identify those patients most likely to respond to stimulation. Summary: While new data is promising, significant research remains to be done to individualize and optimize TMS procedures. Emerging new approaches, such as accelerated TMS and advanced targeting methods, require additional replication and demonstration of real-world clinical utility. Cautious administration of TMS during the pandemic is possible with careful attention to safety procedures.","Cosmo, Camila; Zandvakili, Amin; Petrosino, Nicholas J; Berlow, Yosef A; Philip, Noah S",Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,385,20

METHODS: A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020. Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included. RESULTS: Six clinical trials were included. No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections. Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms, but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections. In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalisation in patients with pneumonia caused by influenza. CONCLUSION: Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence. Naproxen may be a good choice for future clinical trials.","Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Zali, Alireza; Zarghi, Afshin; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Hosseini, Mostafa; Safari, Saeed",Int J Clin Pract,385,24

Previous research suggested the existence of three attentional networks: alerting, orienting and executive. However, one important topic is how to enhance the efficiency of attentional networks. In this context, understanding how this system behaves under two different modulatory conditions, namely transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS), will provide important insights towards the understanding of the attention network system. Twenty-seven healthy students took part on a randomized single-blinded crossover study, testing the effects that involved three modalities of unilateral stimulation (tRNS, anodal tDCS, and sham) over the DLPFC, during the performance of the attention network test (ANT) in three different conditions: standard, speed and accuracy. Results showed that tRNS was able to increase attention during more complex situations, namely by increasing alerting and decreasing conflict effect in the executive network. Under the Speed condition, tRNS increased efficiency of the alerting network, as well as under the more demanding conflict network, tRNS overall increased the performance when comparing to sham. No statistical significant effects of tDCS were observed. These results are compatible with the attention requiring the synchronization of pre-existing networks, rather the reinforcement or creation of new pathways.","Lema, Alberto; Carvalho, Sandra; Fregni, Felipe; Gonçalves, Óscar F; Leite, Jorge",Sci Rep,385,24

OBJECTIVE: The scientific community, citizens, politicians, and mass media are expressing concerns regarding data suggesting that the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Italy is significantly higher than in the rest of the world. Moreover, Italian citizens have misleading perceptions related to the number of swab tests that have actually been performed. Citizens and mass media are denouncing the coverage of COVID-19 swab testing in Italy, claiming that it is not in line with that in other countries worldwide. METHODS: In this paper, we attempt to clarify the aspects of COVID-19 fatalities and testing in Italy by performing a set of statistical analyses that highlight the actual numbers in Italy and compare them with official worldwide data. RESULTS: The analysis clearly shows that the Italian COVID-19 fatality and mortality rates are in line with the official world scenario, as are the numbers of COVID-19 tests performed in Italy and in the Lombardy region.

The ""cytokine storm"" is considered as the main cause of pathogenesis for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related respiratory failure, hemoperfusion may be a modality for treatment of disease. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven an patients with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARStions2 in an upper respiratory tract sample or typical chest computed tomography lesion were eligible for this case-control study. Patients meeting the criteria for hemoperfusion including clinical and laboratory indices, were evaluated for outcomes such as hospitalization length and mortality. Patients were divided into three groups, i.e., patients who received hemoperfusion without a need for mechanical ventilation (MV), patients who received hemoperfusion before MV, and patients who received hemoperfusion after MV. Results: Among 37 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure, 32% were female with a mean age of 55.54 (standard deviation 14.1) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups in terms of length of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (P-tayns: 0.593 and 0.243, respectively, confidence interval [CI]: 95%).

Hospital-based surveillance is paramount to monitor the severity of a disease in the population. METHODS: Two separate surveillance systems, a Surge Capacity survey and a Clinical survey, were set up to collect complementary data on COVID-19 from Belgium's hospitals. The Surge Capacity survey collects aggregated data to monitor the hospital capacity through occupancy rates of beds and medical devices, and to follow a set of key epidemiological indicators over time. Participation is mandatory and the daily data collection includes prevalence and incidence figures on the number of COVID-19 patients in the hospital. The Clinical survey is strongly recommended by health authorities, focusses on specific patient characteristics and relies on individual patient data provided by the hospitals at admission and discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This national double-level hospital surveillance was implemented very rapidly after the first COVID-19 patients were hospitalized and revealed to be crucial to monitor hospital capacity over time and to better understand the disease in terms of risk groups and outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to describe the presenting symptoms, inpatient stay trajectory, and survival outcomes, for cancer patients infected with COVID-19; who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a single center during the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of all cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution for demographic information, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment intervention and outcomes. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. We determined their survival outcomes as of August 5, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-eight cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 16 (57%) presented to the ED during the study period. The median age of patients who presented to the ED was 61 years, 69% were women, and the median length of hospitalization was 11 days.

In this study, we explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding COVID-19 within the Chadian population, to determine whether there are more vulnerable groups of the population that require greater attention from authorities. This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey conducted in N'Djamena, Chad, using a convenience sampling technique that included 2269 participants. The study was conducted in May and August 2020. Questions regarding technical concepts were answered incorrectly by most participants (83.65%). The population had better knowledge about concrete aspects of the pandemics, such as prevention measures and contagion. Regarding attitudes, 34.55% participants were very concerned about the possibility of being infected, 81.27% were unsatisfied/very unsatisfied with their social relationships after the pandemic began, and 68.44% thought that the pandemic was a disturbing/very disturbing issue. As for practices, 49.41% of men followed all preventive measures compared to 32.07% of women, and 3.04% of people with vulnerable jobs did not respect any of preventive measures compared to 1.19% of people without this condition.

We assessed whether delayed surgery improves hip joint function and reduces major complications better than nonoperative therapy. Patients and methods - In this retrospective observational study, we collected data from 24 different hospitals from January 1, 2020, to July 20, 2020. 145 patients with hip fractures aged 65 years or older were eligible. Clinical data was extracted from electronic medical records. The primary outcomes were visual analogue scale (VAS) score and Harris Hip Score. Major complications, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pneumonia within 1 month and 3 months, were collected for further analysis. Results - Of the 145 hip fracture patients 108 (median age 72; 70 females) received delayed surgery and 37 (median age 74; 20 females) received nonoperative therapy. The median time from hip fracture injury to surgery was 33 days (IQR 24-48) in the delayed surgery group. Hypertension, in about half of the patients in both groups, and cerebral infarction, in around a quarter of patients in both groups, were the most common comorbidities. Both VAS score and Harris Hip Score were superior in the delayed surgery group. At the 3-month follow-up, the median VAS score was 1 in the delayed surgery group and 2.5 in the nonoperative group (p < 0.001). Also, the percentage of complications was higher in the nonoperative group (p = 0.004 for DVT, p < 0.001 for pulmonary infection). Interpretation - In hip fracture patients, delayed surgery compared with nonoperative therapy significantly improved hip function and reduced various major complications.","Mi, Bobin; Chen, Lang; Tong, Dake; Panayi, Adriana C; Ji, Fang; Guo, Junfei; Ou, Zhiyong; Zhang, Yingze; Xiong, Yuan; Liu, Guohui",Acta Orthop,385,11

This type of sampling is uncomfortable for the patient, dangerous for health workers, and its high demand has led to a global shortage of swabs. One of the alternative specimens is saliva. However, the optimal conditions for the test have not been established. Methods: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the viral genome in saliva samples kept at room temperature, in the fridge or frozen for 2 days. In addition, the influence of brushing teeth and feeding on the detection of the virus in saliva was addressed. Finally, the efficiency of saliva in revealing the presence of the virus during the hospitalization period was determined in children. Results: The viral genome was consistently detected regardless of the storage conditions of saliva samples. Brushing teeth and feeding did not influence the sensitivity of the test. In hospitalized children, positive results were obtained only during the early days. Conclusions: These results support the idea of the use of saliva as an alternative specimen for diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The viral genome is stable and endures perturbations in the oral cavity. However, clearance of the virus from the mouth during the infection may limit the use of the test only to the early stages of the disease.","López-Martínez, Briceida; Guzmán-Ortiz, Ana L; Nevárez-Ramírez, Abraham J; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Olivar-López, Víctor B; Ángeles-Floriano, Tania; Vilchis-Ordoñez, Armando; Quezada, Héctor",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,385,1

DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between July 17 and September 10, 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to assess maternal mental disorders. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: Ceará, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 577 mother-child pairs who completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15.5% higher (95% CI: (5.9 - 25.1), p-value < 0.001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared to November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40.2% higher during the pandemic (95% CI: 32.6 - 47.8, p-value < 0.001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of food insecurity and MMD in Ceará increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the need for policies and interventions to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child health, nutrition, and well-being in Brazil.","Rocha, Hermano A L; Sudfeld, Christopher R; Leite, Álvaro J M; Rocha, Sabrina Gabrielle Maia Oliveira; Machado, Márcia M T; Campos, Jocileide S; Silva, Anamaria C E; Correia, Luciano L",Public Health Nutr,385,16

The neural mechanism by which this performance enhancement occurs remains unclear. We investigated this phenomenon by offering monetary reward to human participants, contingent on successful performance in a sequence production task. We found that people performed actions more quickly and accurately when they were offered large rewards. Increasing reward magnitude was associated with elevated activity throughout the brain prior to movement. Multivariate patterns of activity in these reward-responsive regions encoded information about the upcoming action. Follow-up analyses provided evidence that action decoding in pre-SMA and other motor planning areas was improved for large reward trials and successful action decoding was associated with improved performance. These results suggest that reward may enhance performance by enhancing neural representations of action used in motor planning.","Adkins, Tyler J; Lee, Taraz G",Neuroimage,385,0

In temperate geographies, HCoV activity peaks between December and March. The epidemiology and manifestations of HCoV infections have not been previously reported from Ecuador. METHODS: Children <5 years who presented with &#8805;2 symptoms consistent with an acute respiratory tract infection were eligible for enrollment. After obtaining informed consent, demographic data and details regarding the acute illness were recorded. Secretions collected with a nasopharyngeal swab underwent diagnostic testing using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 850 subjects were enrolled. A total of 677 (80%) tested positive for at least 1 pathogen, including 49 (7.2%) who tested positive for &#8805;1 HCoV type. HCoV-NL63 was the most frequent type detected (39%), followed by HCoV-OC43 (27%), 229E (22%) and HKU1 (12%). Nearly all subjects who tested positive for HCoV had nasal congestion or secretions (47/49; 96%). The most frequent syndromic diagnosis was common cold (41%), followed by bronchiolitis (27%).

How to objectively and quantitatively differentiate pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 virus remains clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To formulate standardized scoring criteria and an objective quantization standard to guide decision making in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus induced pneumonia in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective dataset includes computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 43 pneumonia patients with COVID-19 virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 49 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 virus. All patients were treated during the same time period in two hospitals. Key indicators of differential diagnosis were identified in relevant literature and the scores were quantified namely, patients with more than 8 points were identified as high risk, those with 6-8 points as moderate risk, and those with fewer than 6 points as low risk for COVID-19 virus. In the study, 3 radiologists determined the scores for all patients. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were determined as high risk, among which 42 were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR tests. Next, 9 were identified as moderate risk, one of whom was COVID-19 positive. Last, 22 were classified into the low-risk group, all of them are COVID-19 negative. Based on these results, the sensitivity of detection COVID-19 positive cases between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was 0.98 with 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.61 [0.46, 0.75]. The detection sensitivity between the moderate-/high-risk group and the low-risk group was 1.00 [0.92, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.45 [0.31, 0.60]. CONCLUSION: The proposed quantitative scoring criteria showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity in detecting COVID-19 using CT images, which indicates that these criteria may be beneficial for screening in real-world practice and helpful for long-term disease control.","Li, Zicong; Zeng, Bingliang; Lei, Pinggui; Liu, Jiaqi; Fan, Bing; Shen, Qinglin; Pang, Peipei; Xu, Rongchun",J Xray Sci Technol,385,16

Although the majority of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may not be infected with COVID-19, the quarantine and public health emergency measures may have affected this particular high risk group. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACS admissions and clinical course in a tertiary care hospital in Portugal's most affected region. METHODS: This retrospective, case-control study included patients admitted with a diagnosis of ACS during March and April 2020 (pandemic group) and in the same period in 2019 (control group). Clinical course and complications were also assessed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, there were fewer ACS admissions but presentation was more severe, with a larger proportion of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (54.9% vs. 38.8%, p=0.047), higher maximum troponin levels and greater prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at discharge (58.0% vs. 35.0%, p=0.01). In this population, although not statistically significant, it was observed a delay between the onset of symptoms and percutaneous coronary intervention, which may traduce a deferred search for urgent medical care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The lockdown phase of COVID-19 pandemic was associated with fewer and more severe ACS in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Portugal's most affected region by the pandemic.","Calvão, João; Amador, Ana Filipa; Costa, Catarina Martins da; Araújo, Paulo Maia; Pinho, Teresa; Freitas, João; Amorim, Sandra; Macedo, Filipe",Rev. port. cardiol,385,16

Furthermore, different neurotropic viruses will affect the CNS at distinct developmental stages, from early prenatal brain development to the aged brain. With the unique flexibility and scalability of human pluripotent stem cell technology, it is now possible to examine the molecular mechanisms underlying acute infection and latency, determine which CNS subpopulations are specifically infected, study temporal aspects of viral susceptibility, perform high-throughput chemical or genetic screens for viral restriction factors and explore complex cell-non-autonomous disease mechanisms.

PBCNST incidence rates in Kentucky are significantly higher than in the United States as a whole, and are even higher among Kentucky's Appalachian children. To understand and eventually eliminate such disparities, population-based research is needed to gain a thorough understanding of the epidemiology and etiology of the disease. This multi-institutional population-based retrospective cohort study is designed to identify factors associated with the high incidence of PBCNST in Kentucky, leveraging the infrastructure provided by the Kentucky Cancer Registry, its Virtual Tissue Repository (VTR), and the National Institutes of Health Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center (DRC). Spatiotemporal scan statistics have been used to explore geographic patterns of risk measured by standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals. The VTR is being used to collect biospecimens for the population-based cohort of PBCNST tissues that are being sequenced by Center for Data Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3b) at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with support from the Kids First DRC. After adjusting for demographic factors, we assess their potential relationship to environmental factors. We have identified regions in north-central and eastern Appalachian Kentucky where children experienced a significant increased risk of developing PBCNST from 1995-2017 (SIR, 1.48;95% CI, 1.34-1.62). The VTR has been successful in the collection of a population-based cohort of 215 PBCNST specimens. Timely establishment of legal agreements for data sharing and tissue acquisition proved to be challenging which has been somewhat mitigated by the adoption of national agreement templates. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely limited the generation of sequencing results due to laboratory shutdowns. However, tissue specimens processed before the shutdown indicated that punches were inferior to scrolls for generating enough quality material for DNA and RNA extraction. Informatics infrastructures that were developed have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach to generate and retrieve molecular results.

As the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the US it elicited a wide spectrum of responses, both online and offline, across the population. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major COVID-19 related topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. In this study, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied. We also find that this online geolocalized emotion is significantly impacted by key COVID-19 policy events. However, there is significant variation in the emotional responses to these policies across the cities studied. Online emotional responses are also found to be a good indicator for predicting offline local mobility, while the correlations between these emotional responses and local cases and deaths are relatively weak. Our findings point to a feedback loop between policy development, public emotional responses, and local mobility, as well as provide new insights for integrating online and offline data for crisis management.","Feng, Shihui; Kirkley, Alec",Sci Rep,385,3

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CircRNA expression profiles were obtained by circRNA microarray of four matched pairs of pericystic tissues affected by CE and adjacent normal liver tissues. qRT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of some circRNAs identified by the microarray analysis. The potential functions of the differentially expressed circRNAs in the CE pericystic tissues were predicted by bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the adjacent normal liver tissues, 177 circRNAs were upregulated and 166 circRNAs were downregulated in CE pericystic tissues based on a &#8805;2.0-fold change. The top 10 upregulated circRNAs were hsa_circRNA_001654,hsa_circRNA_103361,hsa_circRNA_001490,hsa_circRNA_104310,hsa_circRNA_100395,hsa_circRNA_102485,hsa_circRNA_001459,hsa_circRNA_104193,hsa_circRNA_400043, and hsa_circRNA_006773; The top 10 downregulated circRNAs were hsa_circRNA_400633,hsa_circRNA_404974,hsa_circRNA_068482 ,hsa_circRNA_100974,hsa_circRNA_049637,hsa_circRNA_404798,hsa_circRNA_400064,hsa_circRNA_004045,hsa_circRNA_101379, and hsa_circRNA_016771;The circRNA-seq results for 15 selected differentially expressed circRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that hsa_circRNA_006773, hsa_circRNA_049637, hsa_circRNA_104349, and hsa_circRNA_406281 were differentially expressed in CE pericystic tissues when compared with their expression in the adjacent normal liver tissues. Interestingly, 319 miRNAs and 52 mRNAs were predicted to be adsorbed by these four differentially expressed circRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that these circRNAs may be involved in the response to organic cyclic compounds and endogenous stimuli and in cellular organismal processes. CONCLUSION: Differential expression of circRNAs may be associated with the development and progression of CE, and these circRNAs might be useful as biomarkers for prognosis prediction and as treatment targets.","Kalifu, Baheti; Maitiseyiti, Abulaihaiti; Ge, Xiaohu; Chen, Xiong; Meng, Yuan",J Clin Lab Anal,385,16

They possess anthropogenic compounds which are hazardous, result in poor soil quality, poor crop nutrition and pollutes the water table. Currently, food crops that lack in micro-nutrients (Zn, silicates and Se) can be enriched with micronutrients by use of fertilizers. Eco-friendly bio-fertilizers have been proved to provide a known population of microorganisms that create a mutual benefit to the plants & the rhizosphere soil. Nanomaterials are often used in plant fertilizer formulation, allowing for controlled release and targeted delivery of beneficial nanoscale components, as well as to boost plant production and reduce environmental pollutants. In the present study we identified a multipotent micronutrient solubilizing bacterium (MSB) - Pseudomonas gessardi and Pseudomonas azotoformans as a bio-fertiliser. Comparative study of the formulated MSB, with nanocomposite prepared with the soya chunks as natural carrier material and chemically synthesized cerium oxide was performed on the growth of fenugreek for its effectiveness. The SEM images of nanocomposite showed the non-uniform distribution of CeO2 in bio-inoculant with an average size of 25.24 nm. The current study deals with increase in the shoot and root length of the fenugreek plant with only 75 ppm of CeO2 in nanocomposite, thereby preventing bioaccumulation of Ce in soil. This work gives a potential use of CeO2 nanocomposite with MSB bio-inoculants which could be applied to soil deficient with the micronutrients that can enhance the crop yield.","Mary Isabella Sonali, J; Kavitha, R; Kumar, P Senthil; Rajagopal, Revathy; Gayathri, K Veena; Ghfar, Ayman A; Govindaraju, Saravanan",Chemosphere,385,16

These metal binding sites are essential for replication and for interaction with the viral helicase. Oxidation of the clusters by the stable nitroxide TEMPOL caused their disassembly, potently inhibited the RdRp, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture.

The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. RESULTS: Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown. Interventions that promote psychological flexibility may mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Gloster, Andrew T; Lamnisos, Demetris; Lubenko, Jelena; Presti, Giovambattista; Squatrito, Valeria; Constantinou, Marios; Nicolaou, Christiana; Papacostas, Savvas; Aydin, Gökçen; Chong, Yuen Yu; Chien, Wai Tong; Cheng, Ho Yu; Ruiz, Francisco J; Garcia-Martin, Maria B; Obando-Posada, Diana P; Segura-Vargas, Miguel A; Vasiliou, Vasilis S; McHugh, Louise; Höfer, Stefan; Baban, Adriana; Dias Neto, David; Nunes da Silva, Ana; Monestès, Jean-Louis; Alvarez-Galvez, Javier; Paez-Blarrina, Marisa; Montesinos, Francisco; Valdivia-Salas, Sonsoles; Ori, Dorottya; Kleszcz, Bartosz; Lappalainen, Raimo; Ivanovic, Iva; Gosar, David; Dionne, Frederick; Merwin, Rhonda M; Kassianos, Angelos P; Karekla, Maria",PLoS One,385,15

Although an extensive know-how has been built to interpret these sounds and identify diseases associated with certain patterns, its effective use is limited to individual experience of practitioners. This user-dependency manifests itself as a factor impeding the digital transformation of this valuable diagnostic tool, which can improve patient outcomes by continuous long-term respiratory monitoring under real-life conditions. Particularly patients suffering from respiratory diseases with progressive nature, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, are expected to benefit from long-term monitoring. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has also shown the lack of respiratory monitoring systems which are ready to deploy in operational conditions while requiring minimal patient education. To address particularly the latter subject, in this article, we present a sound acquisition module which can be integrated into a dedicated garment; thus, minimizing the role of the patient for positioning the stethoscope and applying the appropriate pressure. We have implemented a diaphragm-less acousto-electric transducer by stacking a silicone rubber and a piezoelectric film to capture thoracic sounds with minimum attenuation.

Purpose To examine whether metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses during exercise were altered over a period of three months in young adults who previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A longitudinal analysis (n=7, 4M) was performed on young adults that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the three-to-four weeks prior to data collection (BL), as well as once a month following baseline for two additional months (1M and 2M). Participants completed an incremental peak aerobic capacity test on a cycle ergometer. Metabolic and cardiorespiratory measurements were collected every minute using a metabolic cart. Measured variables included the following: ventilation (V?E), tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency (fB), absolute and relative oxygen consumption (V?O2,), carbon dioxide production (V?CO2), ventilatory efficiency (V?E/V?CO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and heart rate (HR). Data were compared across visits at rest and during exercise at 60 W, 120 W, and peak exercise. Values are expressed as mean±SD. Results No differences were observed between visits in metabolic or cardiorespiratory variables at rest (p&gt;0.05). There were no observed differences in most metabolic and cardiorespiratory variables during exercise at 60 W (p&gt;0.05). However, VT during exercise at 60 W differed across visits (BL: 1.08 ± 0.19 L;1M: 1.27 ± 0.27 L;2M: 1.21 ± 0.25;p=0.007). No differences in any measure during exercise at 120 W were observed between visits. At peak exercise, VT was significantly different between visits (BL: 2.29 ± 0.42 L;1M: 2.49 ± 0.54 L;2M: 2.37 ± 0.51 L;p=0.033). Absolute and relative V?O2 between visits approached significance (p=0.055 and p=0.069, respectively), with lower peak oxygen consumption at baseline (2.60 ± 0.43 L·min-1, 35.7 ± 5.5 mL·kg-1·min-1) compared with follow up visits (1M: 2.84 ± 0.59 L·min-1, 38.8 ± 7.1 mL·kg-1·min-1;2M: 2.72 ± 0.54 L·min-1, 37.3 ± 6.9 mL·kg-1·min-1). Ratings of perceived exertion were not different between visits at any exercise intensity (p&gt;0.05). Conclusion: These data suggest that metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses at peak, but not submaximal, exercise may be limited acutely but that the decrement is recovered within two months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We suspect that the changes observed in tidal volume between visits is related to the trend of greater peak metabolic work rates with time, despite no observed differences in minute ventilation.","Augenreich, Marc Province Valesha Stute Nina Stickford Abigail Ratchford Stephen Stickford Jonathon",The FASEB Journal,385,20

In this paper, we determine the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates across 35 states using direct age standardization. We then explore the relationship between structural racism and differences in the magnitude of this disparity across states. METHODS: Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we calculated both crude and age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates for the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level structural racism index and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across states. We explored the potential mediating effects of disparities in exposure based on occupation, underlying medical conditions, and health care access. RESULTS: Relying upon crude death rate ratios resulted in a substantial underestimation of the true magnitude of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates. The structural racism index was a robust predictor of the observed racial disparities. Each standard deviation increase in the racism index was associated with an increase of 0.26 in the ratio of COVID-19 mortality rates among the Black compared to the White population. CONCLUSIONS: Structural racism should be considered a root cause of the Black-White disparity in COVID-19 mortality. Dismantling the long-standing systems of racial oppression is critical to adequately address both the downstream and upstream causes of racial inequities in the disease burden of COVID-19.","Siegel, Michael; Critchfield-Jain, Isabella; Boykin, Matthew; Owens, Alicia",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),385,24

We develop a compartmentalized power-law model, with power-law connections between the vulnerable and the general population, considering these connections as well as the connections among the vulnerable as parameters that we vary in our tests. We use the model to study a number of vaccination strategies under two hypotheses: first, we assume a limited availability of vaccine but an infinite vaccination capacity, so that all the available doses can be administered in a short time (negligible with respect to the evolution of the epidemic). Then we assume a limited vaccination capacity, so that the doses are administered in a time non-negligible with respect to the evolution of the epidemic. We develop optimal strategies for the various social parameters, where a strategy consists of (1) the fraction of vaccine that is administered to the vulnerable population and (2) the criterion that is used to administer it to the general population. In the case of a limited vaccination capacity, the fraction (1) is a function of time, and we study how to optimize it to obtain a maximal reduction in the number of victims.","Santini, Simone",,385,24

This study aimed to estimate the effects of five restart strategies after the disruption on required screening capacity and cancer burden. METHODS: Microsimulation models simulated five restart strategies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The models estimated required screening capacity, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific mortality after a disruption of 6 months. The restart strategies varied in whether screens were caught up or not and, if so, immediately or delayed, and whether the upper age limit was increased. RESULTS: The disruption in screening programmes without catch-up of missed screens led to an increase of 2.0, 0.3, and 2.5 cancer deaths per 100 000 individuals in 10 years in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Immediately catching-up missed screens minimised the impact of the disruption but required a surge in screening capacity. Delaying screening, but still offering all screening rounds gave the best balance between required capacity, incidence, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies with the smallest loss in health effects were also the most burdensome for the screening organisations. Which strategy is preferred depends on the organisation and available capacity in a country.","Kregting, Lindy M; Kaljouw, Sylvia; de Jonge, Lucie; Jansen, Erik E L; Peterse, Elisabeth F P; Heijnsdijk, Eveline A M; van Ravesteyn, Nicolien T; Lansdorp-Vogelaar, Iris; de Kok, Inge M C M",Br J Cancer,385,12

However, compared to other vaccines used across the globe, the real-world data on the effectiveness of Gam-COVID-Vac, especially against the disease caused by Delta variant of concern, was not available. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of vaccination mainly conducted with Gam-COVID-Vac in St. Petersburg, Russia. MethodsWe designed a case-control study to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against lung injury and referral to hospital. Self-reported vaccination status was collected for individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were referred for initial low-dose computed tomography triage in two outpatient centres in July 3 - August 9, 2021 in St. Petersburg, Russia. We used logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted (for age, sex, and triage centre) VE for complete (>14 days after the second dose) and partial vaccination (>14 days after the first dose). We estimated the VE against referral for hospital admission, COVID-19-related lung injury assessed with LDCT, and decline in oxygen saturation. ResultsIn the final analysis, 13,893 patients were included, 1,291 (9.3%) of patients met our criteria for complete vaccination status, and 495 (3.6%) were referred to hospital. In the primary analysis, the adjusted VE against referral to hospital was 81% (95% CI: 68-88) for complete vaccination. The effect of the partial vaccination was not statistically significant. The VE against referral to hospital was more pronounced in women (84%, 95% CI: 66-92) compared to men (76%, 95% CI: 51-88). Vaccine protective effect increased with increasing lung injury categories, from 54% (95% CI: 48-60) against any sign of lung injury to 76% (95% CI: 59-86) against more than 50% lung involvement. A sharp increase was observed in the probability of hospital admission with age for non-vaccinated patients in relation to an almost flat relationship for the completely vaccinated group. ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination was effective against referral to hospital in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in St. Petersburg, Russia. This protection is probably mediated through VE against lung injury associated with COVID-19.","Barchuk, Anton; Cherkashin, Mikhail; Bulina, Anna; Berezina, Natalia; Rakova, Tatyana; Kuplevatskaya, Darya; Stanevich, Oksana; Skougarevskiy, Dmitriy; Okhotin, Artemy",,385,26

Several vulnerability factors may play a role in individuals' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such factors include pathological personality traits which have been shown to contribute to the development of anxiety-related conditions. Consequently, the present study investigated the relationships between DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms. Using an online data portal, the relationships between DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety symptoms among a mixed university student and community sample (N = 612) were studied. The results showed that there was a positive and significant relationship between all DSM-5 pathological personality domains and COVID-19-related anxiety. The results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that DSM-5 pathological personality domains explained 21% of COVID-19-related anxiety variance. Based on standardized coefficients, the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) negative affect domain had the main role in COVID-19-related anxiety. The findings suggest that pathological personality domains can be predictors in the symptoms of anxiety in a viral outbreak. The novel findings add to the literature on individual differences in domains of personality in response to pandemic situations.

Measures such as social distancing and travel restrictions, have disrupted production and supply chains, reinforcing a demand shock. In the midst of this pandemic, however, there are leaders of resilient firms that are effectively responding to these changing times. Using a multiple-case inductive enquiry, the paper analyses how leaders activate resilience in small businesses. Employing a process framework, which focuses on sequences of activities and their interrelations which we analyse to uncover how these leaders activated this resilience and explicitly integrated the literature of resilience with that of sensemaking. Resilience emerges when cognition and behaviour work in conjunction, with businesses adapting to combat the crisis. When it comes to global disruptive crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, extant literature provides us with little guidance. The study not only makes a number of contributions to extant literatures but also provides valuable insights and tools to help leaders effectively navigate and respond to this crisis. By doing fast research in real time the paper provides novel and original insights MAD statement The impact of the corona virus, COVID-19, was swift and sudden on organizational life. For the majority of people, leaders and employees, the impact has been challenging and not in a good way. For a few leaders, however, the contagion proved to be a business opportunity rather than a disaster. In this paper we discuss how a handful of firms turned the crisis into good business, proving to be resilient and resourceful by bricolaging rapid responses to a radically changed situation from which good things flowed as positive responses, producing products that helped to deal with the virus. For example, production shifted from alcohol to hand sanitiser. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Sarkar, Soumodip Clegg Stewart R.",Journal of Change Management,385,26

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-induced home confinement on stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours and the correlations between them. Methods: Participants included 144 students (aged 18-22 years, 62.5% female, 89.5% single). Stress, attention, and lifestyle behaviours were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), d2 test, and the Simple Lifestyle Indicator Questionnaire adapted and modified (SLIQ), respectively. Total PSS score, concentration performance (CP), errors (E), and lifestyle behaviours (e.g., diet, exercise/activity, alcohol, and smoking) before and during confinement were calculated. Results: The data showed a significant difference between before and during confinement in total PSS, CP, E, and all lifestyle behaviours (all, p < 0.05). Significant correlations existed between total PSS score, CP, E, and lifestyle behaviours (r= -87-98, all, p < 0.05).

Chinese students accounted for over a third of all international students in the United States prior to COVID-19, but the pandemic paused most global mobility in 2020. We argue that this international mobility to the United States will not fully recover if larger stressors are left unaddressed. First, relations between the United States and China have deteriorated in recent years, especially under the Trump administration, with growing suspicion against Chinese researchers and scholars. Second, viral acts of violence and anti-Asian incidents have painted the United States as unsafe for Chinese students. Finally, given the mismanaged response to the pandemic, it may take years before trust returns from abroad. While the Biden administration has promised to curb some of these issues, the perceptions of the United States may have been permanently altered, especially as China has improved its domestic higher education sector in recent years. © Journal of International Students.","Allen, R.

In China, patients with two negative respiratory viral RNA tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine required. Currently, PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed. METHODS: We present a patient with COVID-19, whose respiratory swabs became negative but fecal sample remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Stool sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic, we recommend that fecal RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2 should be incorporated into the discharge criteria to minimize the risk of transmission from the gastrointestinal tract.","Yang, Zhiwei; Yu, Mingxue; Li, Ganwen; Dai, Xiaoling; Liu, Guirong; Xie, Jinjun; Li, Gang; Jie, Yusheng",Clin. lab,385,26

The spectrum of disease seen in patients with COVID-19 infection ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and even acute respiratory distress syndrome, which often requires invasive ventilation and intensive care. COVID-19-associated infection can be catastrophic, leading to both arterial and venous occlusion, microinfarcts, and multiorgan failure, although retinal vein occlusion has not yet been reported. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 40-year-old man who presented with a 3-day history of shortness of breath, cough, and fever. He also reported right calf pain and blurring of vision in both eyes. His medical history included hypertension and morbid obesity. The patient was found to have severe COVID-19 pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, right leg deep venous thrombosis on Doppler ultrasonography, and bilateral central retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on fundal examination. He was started on full-dose anticoagulation and discharged on rivaroxaban for 3 months. After 2 weeks of therapy, he had fully recovered from his COVID-19 symptoms and had near-normal vision. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 infection can cause RVO. Early full-dose anticoagulation should be considered in high-risk patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Ophthalmologists and other clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for RVO in patients with COVID-19 infection who presenting with blurred vision and severe pneumonia.","Gaba, Waqar Haider; Ahmed, Deena; Al Nuaimi, Rawdha Khaleefa; Dhanhani, Aishah Ali; Eatamadi, Habibullah",Am J Case Rep,385,21

Such tools are available but can be difficult to use. This study aimed to develop a robust observational assessment tool for use on cancer multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) by health care professionals in everyday practice. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the United Kingdom from September 2015 to July 2016. Three tumor boards from three teaching hospitals were recruited, with 44 members overall. Six weekly meetings involving 146 consecutive cases were video-recorded and scored using the validated MODe tool. Data were subjected to reliability and validity analysis in the current study to develop a shorter version of the MODe. RESULTS: Phase 1, a reduction of the original items in the MODe, was achieved through two focus group meetings with expert assessors based on previous research. The 12 original items were reduced to 6 domains, receiving full agreement by the assessors. In phase 2, the six domains were subjected to item reliability, convergent validation, and internal consistency testing against the MODe-Lite global score, the MODe global score, and the items of the MODe. Significant positive correlations were evident across all domains (p < 0.01), indicating good reliability and validity. In phase 3, feasibility and high inter-assessor reliability were achieved by two clinical assessors. Six domains measuring clinical input, holistic input, clinical collaboration, pathology, radiology, and management plan were integrated into MODe-Lite. CONCLUSIONS: As an evidence-based tool for health care professionals in everyday practice, MODe-Lite gives cancer MTBs insight into the way they work and facilitates improvements in practice.","Lamb, B W; Miah, S; Skolarus, T A; Stewart, G D; Green, J S A; Sevdalis, N; Soukup, T",Ann. surg. oncol,385,1

Analisou-se, para 2007, a distribuição de rebanhos nas propriedades, a movimentação por ecossistema de origem e destino, por finalidade (engorda, abate ou reprodução), e por época do ano. Observou-se que 81,54% do rebanho está concentrados em 20% das propriedades, indicando a existência de poucas propriedades com intensa comercialização para abate, engorda ou reprodução e muitas propriedades com pouca comercialização. Das 72.149 propriedades (de um total de 112.924) que realizaram algum tipo de movimentação, 65.773 movimentaram bovinos. A maioria das movimentações ocorreu internamente em cada ecossistema (Pantanal, Cerrado e Amazônia). O Pantanal recebeu o menor número de bovinos (4,98% dos animais recebidos, incluindo movimentação interna) e o Cerrado foi o que mais recebeu bovinos provenientes dos outros ecossistemas e o que enviou o menor número de bovinos (318.253, 25,79% do total de bovinos enviados a outro ecossistema). Observou-se uma redução do movimento em maio e novembro (vacinação contra febre aftosa), janeiro e fevereiro (férias dos frigoríficos e estação chuvosa) e setembro (manejo de natalidade, ausência da safra do boi gordo e desmama de bezerros). O percentual de movimentação interestadual foi de 2,65% dos animais movimentados, predominando as movimentações intraestaduais. Na análise de 539.526 documentos em 76.277 estabelecimentos calculou-se o grau de comercialização entre os estabelecimentos, para o semigrau interior a média e mediana foram (1 e 3) e para o semigrau exterior(2 e 3) respectivamente. As distâncias médias para movimentação de bovinos provenientes das propriedades da fronteira internacional e daquelas sabidamente positivas para brucelose foram 73,75 e 60,43 km respectivamente. Distâncias médias para movimentos destinados a frigoríficos, propriedades e eventos agropecuários foram inferiores a 116,70 km mostrando movimentação proveniente do próprio Estado. Em redes com características livre de escala supõe-se que a distribuição de grau P(k) pode ser ajustada pela lei de potência, no entanto observou-se que alguns estabelecimentos não seguiram o previsto para redes livre de escala. O ajuste de P(kin) mostrou que estabelecimentos que compraram maior quantidade de bovinos ultrapassaram o esperado pela lei de potência, o que pode estar relacionado ao comportamento de compra por frigoríficos e confinamentos. Para o ajuste de P(kout), a proporção de propriedades que venderam para muitos estabelecimentos (por exemplo, próximo a 100 estabelecimentos) está abaixo do previsto pela lei de potência, como também aquelas que venderam para menos de 10 outros estabelecimentos. As propriedades de subsistência, que movimentam poucos animais, influenciaram os valores de P(kin) e de P(kout) para valores baixos de kin e kout, respectivamente. Observou-se uma correção negativa (r= -0,54) entre o grau médio dos primeiros vizinhos e o grau do estabelecimento mostrando que estabelecimentos com grau elevado (volume elevado de compra e/ou venda) comercializam com estabelecimentos cujo grau é em média baixo (volume baixo de compra e/ou venda) e vice-versa.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data obtained from adult patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection having at least one SARS-CoV-2 pair of specific IgM/IgG tests, admitted in The University Hospital of Infectious Diseases Cluj-Napoca, Romania (28 February to 31 August 2020). The database also included: demographic, clinical, chest X-ray and/or CT scan results, RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2, and dexamethasone treatment. A total of 469 patients were evaluated as ""asymptomatic/mild"" and ""moderate/severe/critical"" cases. RESULTS: The median time since confirmation to SARS-CoV-2 PCR negativity was 15 days [95% CI: 13-18] in asymptomatic/mild cases and 17 days [95% CI: 16-21] in moderate/severe ones. The median time to seroconversion for both IgM and IgG was 13 days [95% CI: 13-14] in asymptomatic/mild cases and 11 days [95% CI: 10-13] in moderate/severe ones.

It remained to be determined why diabetic individuals with uncontrolled glucose levels are more prone to develop the severe form of COVID-19. The molecular mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection and what determines the onset of the cytokine storm found in severe COVID-19 patients are unknown. Monocytes and macrophages are the most enriched immune cell types in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and appear to have a central role in the pathogenicity of the disease. These cells adapt their metabolism upon infection and become highly glycolytic, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication.

486807,486807,486807,COVID-19 and Mental Health-What Do We Know So Far?,20.633028,3.5524347,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite severe outbreaks of COVID-19 among colleges and universities across the USA during the Fall 2020 semester, the majority of institutions did not routinely test students. While high-frequency repeated testing is considered the most effective strategy for disease mitigation, most institutions do not have the necessary infrastructure or funding for implementation. Therefore, alternative strategies for testing the student population are needed. Our study detailed the implementation and results of testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread on a university campus, and we aimed to assess the relative effectiveness of the different testing strategies. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we included 6273 on-campus students arriving to a large public university in the rural USA (Clemson, SC, USA) for in-person instruction in the Fall 2020 semester (Sept 21 to Nov 25). Individuals arriving after Sept 23, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before Aug 19, and student athletes and band members were not included in this study. We implemented two testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread during this period: a novel surveillance-based informative testing (SBIT) strategy, consisting of random surveillance testing to identify outbreaks in residence hall buildings or floors and target them for follow-up testing (Sept 23 to Oct 5); followed by a repeated weekly surveillance testing (Oct 6 to Nov 22). Relative changes in estimated weekly prevalence were examined. We developed SARS-CoV-2 transmission models to compare the relative effectiveness of weekly testing (900 daily surveillance tests), SBIT (450 daily surveillance tests), random surveillance testing (450 daily surveillance tests), and voluntary testing (0 daily surveillance tests) on disease mitigation. Model parameters were based on our empirical surveillance data in conjunction with published sources. FINDINGS: SBIT was implemented from Sept 23 to Oct 5, and identified outbreaks in eight residence hall buildings and 45 residence hall floors. Targeted testing of residence halls was 2·03 times more likely to detect a positive case than random testing (95% CI 1·67-2·46). Weekly prevalence was reduced from a peak of 8·7% to 5·6% during this 2-week period, a relative reduction of 36% (95% CI 27-44). Prevalence continued to decrease after implementation of weekly testing, reaching 0·8% at the end of in-person instruction (week 9). SARS-CoV-2 transmission models concluded that, in the absence of SBIT (ie, voluntary testing only), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have increased by 154% throughout the semester. Compared with SBIT, random surveillance testing alone would have resulted in a 24% increase in COVID-19 cases. Implementation of weekly testing at the start of the semester would have resulted in 36% fewer COVID-19 cases throughout the semester compared with SBIT, but it would require twice the number of daily tests. INTERPRETATION: It is imperative that institutions rigorously test students during the 2021 academic year. When high-frequency testing (eg, weekly) is not possible, SBIT is an effective strategy to mitigate disease spread among the student population that can be feasibly implemented across colleges and universities.

A comparison between Portugal and Spain,20.807175,3.4318376,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Review recent literature on the role of indirect calorimetry in critical care nutrition management. RECENT FINDINGS: Critical illness demands objective, targeted nutritional therapy to prevent adverse effects of underfeeding/over feeding. Thus, all recent societal guidelines recommend indirect calorimetry use to determine energy needs. Very recently, indirect calorimetry technology has finally evolved to allow for accurate, simple, and routine utilization in a wider range of ICU patients. Recent data continues to confirm poor correlation between measured and equation-predicted energy expenditure emphasizing need for indirect calorimetry to be standard of care. This may be particularly true in COVID-19, where significant progressive hypermetabolism and variability in energy expenditure has been shown. Metabolic physiology can change frequently during ICU stay in response to changes in clinical condition or care. Thus, repeated longitudinal indirect calorimetry measures are needed throughout ICU stay to optimize care, with initial data showing improved clinical outcomes when indirect calorimetry targets are utilized. SUMMARY: Personalized ICU care demands objective data to guide therapy. This includes use of indirect calorimetry to determine energy expenditure and guide ICU nutrition therapy. Long-awaited new innovations in indirect calorimetry technology should finally lead to indirect calorimetry to becoming a fundamental component of modern ICU standard of care and clinical research moving forward.","De Waele, Elisabeth; Jonckheer, Joop; Wischmeyer, Paul",Curr. opin. crit. care,385,26

In this study, we assess the demand for on-demand mobility services in urban areas, using a stated preference survey, to understand the potential impact of introducing on-demand services on the current modal split. The survey was carried out in the Netherlands and offered respondents a choice between bike, car, public transport and on-demand services. 1,063 valid responses are analysed with a multinomial logit and a latent class choice model. By means of the latter, we uncover four distinctive groups of travellers based on the observed choice behaviour. The majority of the sample (55%) are avid cyclists and do not see on-demand mobility as an alternative for making urban trips. Two classes (27% and 9% of the sample) would potentially use on-demand services: the former is fairly time-sensitive and would thus use on-demand service if they were sufficiently fast. The latter class however is highly cost-sensitive, and would therefore use on-demand mobility primarily if it is cheap. The fourth class (9%) shows very limited potential for using on-demand services.","Gervzinivc, N.; Oort, N. van; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, S.; Cats, O.; Hoogendoorn, S.",,385,16

They recommend that the first step should be to assess how many patch tests each clinic can handle and review the waiting list to prioritize cases according to disease severity and urgency. Digital technologies can, where possible, be used to send and receive the documentation necessary for the patch test (information, instructions, informed consent, etc.). If the necessary infrastructure is available, patients can be offered the option of a remote initial consultation. Likewise, in selected cases, the patch test results can be read in a virtual visit using photographs taken by the patient or a video visit can be scheduled to allow the physician to evaluate the site of application remotely. These measures will reduce the number of face-to-face visits required, but will not affect the time spent on each case, which must be scheduled in the normal manner.

What would ensue has become a largely unprecedented sequence of alarming events since the FDA began reporting public recalls, withdrawals and safety alerts on their website in 2016. Since then, the United States has been significantly impacted by drug recalls affecting angiotensin receptor blockers. This report arms clinicians with additional guidance and provides a framework for responding appropriately to future similar incidents and includes an overview of the angiotensin receptor blockers, and their effects and safety profiles. METHODS: This report includes a review of data from all pertinent clinical and scientific sources including information from the FDA's inspection documents and recall website. Additional information is provided on the specific bottles including all lot numbers, expiration dates, etc. RESULTS: The recalls/withdrawals are attributable to the presence of cancer-causing contaminants identified during the manufacturing process from drug manufacturers abroad. The root causes behind the recalls and subsequent shortage appear multifactorial, and stem to a certain extent from the outsourcing of medication manufacturing overseas and lack of quality checks and appropriate oversight. CONCLUSIONS: This inherent issue is not likely to resolve soon and has eroded the public trust of/in the healthcare system and the pharmaceutical industry. Patients and healthcare providers are significantly affected and should have a full understanding of the matter in order to guide appropriate response and actions.","Gillette, Michael; Taylor, Addison; Butulija, Djenita; Kadiyala, Himabindu; Jneid, Hani",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,385,20

Initially, patients were redistributed regionally by ground transport. When transport over longer distances became necessary, we initiated a new Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) operation. We hypothesize that the transport of contagious COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe for patients and HEMS personnel. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre observational study, flight and monitor data were used to calculate the exposure time of the retrieval team to COVID-19 patients. All the crew members (n = 18) were instructed on the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), dressing and undressing routine using buddy check supervision and cleaning procedures. All the team members were monitored for possible COVID-19 symptoms, as advised by our National Institute for Health and Environment. One month after completing the aeromedical transport all crew members were asked to donate a blood sample which was examined for the presence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: From March 24 to May 25, 2020 the HEMS team transported 67 ventilated critical care COVID-19 patients. The exposure time was 7451 min (124 h and 11 min). One HEMS member reported pneumonia 6 weeks before the start of the patient transport. He tested positive for IgG SARS-CoV-2 by serology testing. We speculate that he was infected before the start of the operation; irrefutable evidence is lacking to support this claim because we did not perform serology testing before this operation started. CONCLUSION: Occupational COVID-19 exposure during helicopter transport of ventilated critical care COVID-19 patients can be performed safely when proper PPE is applied.","Spoelder, Ed J; Tacken, Marijn C T; van Geffen, Geert-Jan; Slagt, Cor",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,385,1

PURPOSE: Alvimopan is a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist indicated to accelerate gastrointestinal (GI) recovery following surgery, but its benefits past GI recovery are unknown and evidence suggests that it may increase risk for myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a pilot alvimopan stewardship program aimed at intervening to discontinue alvimopan use following GI recovery. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study examining the first 5 months of the alvimopan stewardship pilot program. During this initial period, a pharmacy resident assessed whether each patient met criteria for GI recovery, defined as solid food toleration and first bowel movement or flatus. If a patient met the criteria for GI recovery, the resident intervened and recommended that the primary team discontinue alvimopan. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with alvimopan continued past GI recovery and the percentage of patients for whom alvimopan ordered past GI recovery was discontinued following intervention by stewardship. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of accepted recommendations to discontinue alvimopan following GI recovery and the number of alvimopan doses ordered following GI recovery. RESULTS: In total, 73 patients were included in the study analysis, all of whom underwent abdominal and/or urologic surgery. Alvimopan was ordered to be administered in 35.6% (26/73) of patients after GI recovery. The stewardship program intervened and recommended discontinuation on 50% (13/26) of the alvimopan doses ordered past GI recovery. Recommendations were accepted by the primary team for 92.3% (12/13) of the patients. A total of 51 doses of alvimopan were ordered for administration past GI recovery, with an average of 2 doses per patient. CONCLUSION: A pilot pharmacy-driven alvimopan stewardship program was able to identify and intervene on alvimopan orders continued past GI recovery. Interventions decreasing alvimopan use past GI recovery could be of benefit by minimizing potential risk and decreasing potential costs without a negative impact on patient outcomes.","Shtoyko, Ashley N; Cwikla, Gregory M; Feldman, Elizabeth A; Darko, William; Miller, Christopher D; Seabury, Robert W",Am. j. health system pharm,385,16

The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a major world public-health crisis. The major disease manifestation occurs in the respiratory tract. However further studies documented other systemic involvement. This study investigate histopathologic eye changes in post-mortem material of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded eyes from 5 patients (10 eyes) who died of COVID-19 at the University Hospital in Basel were included. Gross examination and histological evaluation were performed by three independent ophthalmopathologists. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against fibrin, cleaved caspase 3 and ACE-2. Five enucleated eyes of patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2 served as control group. All cases have been studied for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization. The choroidal vessels of one case were analyzed with electron microscope. Results Ophthalmopathologically, eight eyes from four patients displayed swollen endothelial cells in congested choroidal vessels. No further evidence of specific eye involvement of SARS-CoV-2 was found in any of the patients. In the eight eyes with evidence of changes due to SARS-CoV-2, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated fibrin microthrombi, apoptotic changes of endothelial and inflammatory cells. In control eyes, ACE-2 was detectable in the conjunctiva, cornea, retina and in the choroidea, and displayed significantly lower amounts of stained cells as in COVID-19 eyes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in both bulbi of 2/5 patients, yet in situ hybridization failed to visualize viruses. Electron microscopy showed no significant results due to the artifacts. Discussion/Conclusion As already described in other organs of COVID-19 patients, the ophthalmological examination revealed-microthrombi, i.e. hypercoagulation and vasculopathy most probably due to endothelial damage. A possible viral spread to the endothelial cells via ACE-2 provides one pathophysiological explanation. The expression of ACE-2 receptors in the conjunctiva hints towards its susceptibility to infection. To what extend eyes function are disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 is subject to further studies, especially in the clinic.","Reinhold, Aja; Tzankov, Alexandar; Matter, Matthias; Mihic-Probst, Daniela; Scholl, Hendrik P N; Meyer, Peter",Ophthalmic res,385,16

Many advances have already been made, but there is still a long way to go to solve the molecular mechanisms related to the process of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the particularities of the disease, its course and the complex host-pathogen relationships. However, a lot has been theorized and associated with COVID-19, like the worst prognosis of the disease among individuals with some comorbidities, like diabetes mellitus. In this perspective, diabetic patients are repeatedly associated with more severe cases of COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic patients. Even though ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) was recognized as the host cell receptor for both binding and entering of SARS-CoV-2 particles, it was also pointed out that this enzyme plays an important protective role against pulmonary damage. Therefore, paradoxically as it may seem, the low baseline level of this receptor in people with diabetes is directly linked to a more expressive loss of ACE2 protective effect, which could be one of the possible factors for the worst prognosis of COVID-19. Still, COVID-19 may also have a diabetogenic effect. From this point of view, the main topics that will be highlighted are (i) the mechanism of the viral entry, with special attention to the cellular receptor (ACE2) and the viral binding protein (spike), (ii) the relationship among the renin-angiotensin system, the infection process and the patients' prognosis, (iii) the glucose control and the medicines used in this event, and (iv) a brief analysis on diabetes triggered by COVID-19.","da Silva, Pedro Henrique Abreu; Garcia, Andressa Santos; Alves, Fábio Aguiar; Dos Santos, André Luis Souza; Sodré, Cátia Lacerda",Curr. top. med. chem,385,13

Therefore, we designed this study to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and the effectiveness and attitudes towards online education among Chinese children aged 7-15 years. METHODS: A detailed questionnaire, comprising of 62 questions was designed and parents or caretakers of 7 to 15 years old children were invited to participate via WeChat, a multi-purpose messaging, social media and mobile payment app, which is widely used by the Chinese population. A total of 668 parents across different regions of China were included. RESULTS: During COVID-19 pandemic, 20.7 and 7.2% children report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD and SMFQ-P scores are significantly higher in middle school and boarding school students compared to primary and day school students. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that school system and province of origin are factors significantly associated with developing PSTD symptoms. 44.3% respondents feel online education is effective in gaining knowledge and improving practical and communications skills. 78.0% believe the online education system is efficient. Overall 79.8% respondents are satisfied and children can adapt to this new education system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we found 1 in five children have PTSD and 1 in 14 children have depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In summary, COVID-19 epidemic has caused PTSD and depression symptoms among Chinese children aged 7 to 15 years. In general, a large proportion of respondents are satisfied with online education, but still a substantial proportion of students are not comfortable with this new form of learning. Authorities should optimize online education systems and implement effective interventions to cope with the psychological effects of COVID-19 on children, as it is affecting the global population and remains uncertain when it will end.","Ma, Zhongren; Idris, Sakinah; Zhang, Yinxia; Zewen, Liu; Wali, Amaad; Ji, Yunpeng; Pan, Qiuwei; Baloch, Zulqarnain",BMC Pediatr,385,25

In this paper, we proposed Mixture-of-Partitions (MoP), an infusion approach that can handle a very large knowledge graph (KG) by partitioning it into smaller sub-graphs and infusing their specific knowledge into various BERT models using lightweight adapters. To leverage the overall factual knowledge for a target task, these sub-graph adapters are further fine-tuned along with the underlying BERT through a mixture layer. We evaluate our MoP with three biomedical BERTs (SciBERT, BioBERT, PubmedBERT) on six downstream tasks (inc.

The orthopaedic and trauma units have rescheduled their activities to help SARS-CoV-2 units, but trauma patients require also treatment, and no standardized protocols have been established. METHODS: A single-centre cross-sectional study was performed in a tertiary hospital. Two different periods of time were analyzed: a two week period of time in March 2019 (pre-SARS-CoV-2) and the same period in March 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 pandemic time). Outpatient's data, emergency activity, surgical procedures, and admissions were evaluated. Surgeons' and patient's opinion was also evaluated using a survey. RESULTS: A total of ~ 16k (15,953) patients were evaluated. Scheduled clinical appointments decreased by ~ 22%. Urgent consultations and discharge from clinics also descended (~ 37% and ~ 20% respectively). Telemedicine was used in 90% of outpatient clinical evaluations. No elective surgical procedures during SARS-CoV-2 time were scheduled, and subtracting the effect of elective surgeries, there was a reduction of inpatient surgeries, from ~ 85% to ~ 59%. Patients delayed trauma assistance more than 48 hours in 13 cases (35%). Pre-operative admission for hip fractures decreased in ten hours on average. Finally, surveys stated that patients were more in favour than surgeons were to this new way to evaluate orthopaedic and trauma patients based strongly on telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Detailed protocols should be standardized for surgical departments during the pandemic. This paper offers a general view in how this virus affects an orthopaedic unit and could serve as a protocol and example for orthopaedic and trauma units. Even in the worst scenario, an orthopaedic and trauma unit could offer an effective, efficient, and quality service. SARS-CoV-2 will set up a new paradigm for health care in orthopaedics and trauma.","Luengo-Alonso, Gonzalo; Pérez-Tabernero, Fernando García-Seisdedos; Tovar-Bazaga, Miguel; Arguello-Cuenca, José Manuel; Calvo, Emilio",Int Orthop,385,26

The differences in viral infectivity, replication efficiency, and genome sequences between TW2575/98w and TW2575/98vac were determined and compared. TW2575/98vac caused earlier death of chicken embryos and had higher viral replication efficiency. Thirty amino acid substitutions resulting from 44 mutated nucleotides in the viral genome were found in TW2575/98vac. All of the molecular variations lead to attenuation, found in TW2575/98, were not observed consistently in the other IBVs (TW2296/95, Ark/Ark-DPI/81, the Massachusetts strain, GA98/CWL0470/98, and CK/CH/LDL/97I) and vice versa. After further comparisons and evaluations from three aspects: (1) longitudinal analysis on the timing of variations appeared in specific homologous strain passages, (2) horizontal evaluations with the amino acid changes between wild and vaccine strains among the other 5 IBVs, and (3) inspection on alterations in the chemical characteristics of substituted amino acid residues in viral proteins, four amino acid substitutions [V342D in p87, S1493P and P2025S in HD1, as well as F2308Y in HD1(P41)] were selected as highly possible candidates for successful TW2575/98w attenuation. Our findings imply that molecular variations, which contribute to the successful attenuation of different IBVs, are diverse and not restricted to a fixed pattern or specific amino acid substitutions in viral proteins. In addition, four amino acid changes within the replicase gene-encoded proteins might be associated with TW2575/98 virus virulence.","Tsai, Cheng-Ta; Wu, Hung-Yi; Wang, Ching-Ho",Virus Genes,385,33

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19 infection, two recent studies demonstrate that kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common, and that kidney involvement is associated with high risk of in-hospital death. Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. We hypothesize that low sodium status makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections, and that low sodium intake be corrected early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.","Post, Adrian; Dullaart, Robin P F; Bakker, Stephan J L",Virus Res,385,23

However, the treatment of head and neck cancer patients is not deferrable, and an integrated strategy is required. The aim of the current article is to present the experience in the management of head and neck patients during the COVID-19 pandemic at the research hospital ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"". This review contains replicable and widely usable instructions on how to avoid delays in the diagnosis and treatment of head and neck tumors and to ensure a gradual return to elective procedures. MAIN TEXT: The Head and Neck Department of the research hospital ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"" includes an Otolaryngology and a Maxillofacial Surgery Unit, both of which deal with the diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant pathologies of the head and neck, as well as urgent/emergent consultations and surgical procedures that necessitate time sensitive operative management, such as cochlear implantation (CI). Given these premises and the complexity of the Department, the ""COVID-19 organizing protocol"" of the research hospital ""Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"" was divided into two phases in accordance with the different stages of the pandemic and the priority of treatment. Special attention was given to the medical surveillance of health care workers and hospitalized patients, to the organization of the outpatient clinic and the operating setting as well as to the implementation of telehealth systems. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is going to be a long-term situation with lasting effects on the public health and the entire society. Therefore, an efficient health care system has to adopt a double strategy: always being ready for a ""new wave"" of the pandemic and not forgetting non-COVID-19 patients, among whom head and neck cancer patients represent a priority.

Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome in infected cells may represent a powerful tool to identify cellular proteins hijacked by viruses for their life cycle and develop host-oriented antiviral therapeutics. Here we report the proteomic characterization of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein in infected Vero E6 cells. We identified 24 high-confidence proteins mainly playing a role in RNA metabolism and translation, including RNA helicases and scaffold proteins involved in the formation of stress granules, cytoplasmic aggregates of messenger ribonucleoproteins that accumulate as a result of stress-induced translation arrest. Analysis of stress granules upon SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that these structures are not induced in infected cells, neither eIF2&#945; phosphorylation, an upstream event leading to stress-induced translation inhibition. Notably, we found that G3BP1, a stress granule component that associates with the Nucleoprotein, is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication. Moreover, we showed that the Nucleoprotein-interacting RNA helicase DDX3X colocalizes with viral RNA foci and its inhibition by small molecules or small interfering RNAs significantly reduces viral replication. Altogether, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 subverts the stress granule machinery and exploits G3BP1 and DDX3X for its replication cycle, offering groundwork for future development of host-directed therapies.","Ciccosanti, Fabiola; Di Rienzo, Martina; Romagnoli, Alessandra; Colavita, Francesca; Refolo, Giulia; Castilletti, Concetta; Agrati, Chiara; Brai, Annalaura; Manetti, Fabrizio; Botta, Lorenzo; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Piacentini, Mauro; Fimia, Gian Maria",Antiviral Res,385,1

Various pathogens have been found on the stethoscopes of health care workers. METHOD: A correlational descriptive design was used to compare stethoscopes from 117 nursing students. Sterile swab samples were obtained from four separate areas of each stethoscope. Samples were plated and incubated for 24 to 48 hours. RESULTS: Bacteria were found on all parts of the stethoscopes from both undergraduate and graduate nursing students, with the earpiece having the highest percentage of contamination. Staphylococcus was the most prevalent microbe found on all four swab sites. CONCLUSION: Educating students about stethoscope hygiene and consistently reinforcing it in practice are essential to reduce the transmission of pathogens in the health care environment. Nurses can model best practice with students and other disciplines to increase the likelihood of adherence.

Many Asian countries are starting to vaccinate frontline workers; however, expedited vaccine development has led to hesitancy among the general population. We evaluated the willingness of healthcare workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: From 12 to 21 December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: More than 95% of the healthcare workers surveyed were willing to vaccinate. These respondents were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, consider the vaccine safe, have less financial concerns, less stigmatization regarding the vaccine, higher pro-socialness mindset and trust in health authorities. A high perceived pandemic risk index, low vaccine harm index and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of healthcare workers in Asia are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, low potential risk of vaccine harm and pro-socialness are the main drivers. These findings may help formulate vaccination strategies in other countries.","Chew, Nicholas W S; Cheong, Clare; Kong, Gwyneth; Phua, Kailun; Ngiam, Jinghao Nicholas; Tan, Benjamin Y Q; Wang, Bokun; Hao, Fengyi; Tan, Wanqiu; Han, Xiaofan; Tran, Bach X; Hoang, Men Thi; Pham, Hai Q; Vu, Giang T; Chen, Yang; Danuaji, Rivan; Rn, Komalkumar; Pv, Meenakshi; Talati, Kalpesh; Ho, Cyrus S; Sharma, Arvind K; Ho, Roger C; Sharma, Vijay K",Int J Infect Dis,385,24

STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center, randomized control pilot study of 60 infants <29 weeks' gestation with a high PDAsc (&#8805;5.0) at 36-48 hours of age receiving either Ibuprofen or Placebo intravenously. The study protocol did not allow for additional PDA therapy within the first two weeks. We reported the rate of consent, open label treatment and PDA closure rates. The primary outcome was chronic lung disease/Death. RESULTS: 83 families were approached for enrollment with 73 (88%) providing consent; 13 infants had a PDAsc < 5; of the remaining infants, 30 were assigned Ibuprofen and 30 received placebo. Eight infants received open label treatment in the first two weeks (12%). The overall PDA closure rate after treatment was 57% in the Intervention Group and 17% in the Control Group (p<0.01). There was no difference in the primary clinical outcome (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.3-2.1). CONCLUSION: Using a PDA severity score for infant recruitment to a PDA treatment RCT is feasible. There is a high rate of consent and relatively low rate of open label PDA treatment. The overall PDA closure rate in the intervention arm was low placing the emphasis on devising more effective PDA closure strategies in future RCTs.

The intended effect of these NPIs has been to reduce mobility. A strong reduction in mobility is believed to have a positive effect on the reduction of COVID-19 transmission by limiting the opportunity for the virus to spread in the population. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using global mobility data, released by Apple and Google, and ACAPS NPI data, we investigate the proportional contribution of NPIs on i) size of the change (magnitude) of transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) rate (gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best fit model we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to impact the magnitude of the change in mobility were: Lockdown measures (Apple, Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS)), declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS), closure of businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using cluster analysis and chi square tests we found that closure of businesses and public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings as well as border closures and international flight suspensions were closely related. The implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings had the greatest effect on the rate of mobility change. In conclusion, we were able to quantitatively assess the efficacy of NPIs in reducing mobility, which enables us to understand their fine grained effects in a timely manner and therefore facilitate well-informed and cost-effective interventions.","Snoeijer, Berber T; Burger, Mariska; Sun, Shaoxiong; Dobson, Richard JB; Folarin, Amos A",,385,7

However, due to the unknown characteristics of this disease, as well as the geographical and political factors, building efficient models of the dynamics for many countries is difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a transmission dynamics predictor that takes advantage of the time differences among many countries with respect to transmission of this disease, in that some countries experienced earlier outbreaks than others. The primary novelty of the proposed method is that, unlike many existing transmission predictors that require parameters based on prior knowledge of the epidemiology of past viruses, the proposed method only requires the transmission similarities between countries in the publicly available data for this current disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the variables attributable to the fear of contracting COVID-19. DESIGN: This is a quantitative study based on an online cross-sectional self-administered survey in Chile between 10 July 2020 and 10 August 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 531, comprising over 18-year-old participants from middle- and high-income levels, was selected. OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimations were obtained using a probit regression model with marginal effects. RESULTS: Fear prevailed mainly in women. It has a positive relationship with variables such as chronic illnesses, infectious family or relatives, reduction in economic activity and perception of bad government response to a pandemic. Fear has a negative relationship with knowledge about COVID-19, education level and ageing. Moreover, those who consider socioeconomic impact less important than health care do not fear a COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSION: The socioeconomic and health aspects help predict fears. Thus, the government should prioritize these variables in implementing policies. The government's credibility and communication systems can also reduce fears of contracting COVID-19.

Several solutions have been employed to address this problem depending on the airplane detection process. The most effective solutions are through the use of satellite images with deep learning techniques. Such solutions, however, are significantly costly and require satellites and modern complicated technology which may not be available in most countries worldwide. This paper provides a universal, low cost and fast solution for airplane detection in airports. This paper recommends the use of drones instead of satellites to feed the system with drone images using a proposed deep learning model. Drone images are employed as the dataset to train and evaluate a mask region convolution neural network (RCNN) model. The Mask RCNN model applies faster RCNN as its base configuration with critical modifications on its head neural network constructions. The model detects whether or not an airplane is present and includes mask estimations to approximate surface area and length, which will help future works identify the airplane type. This solution can be easily implemented globally as it is a low-cost and fast solution for airplane detection at airports.

A virus with a high capacity for mutation, SARS-CoV-2 poses unique challenges both in the current form of disease control and management, while also leaving the door open for future novel diseases and pandemics. An understanding of the virion structure and genomic organisation will help us in understanding their origins and likely course of future evolution. Moreover, novel cost-effective methodologies for genetic surveillance may help in mitigating the emergence of these viral infections in future. In this manuscript, the authors have detailed the unique aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome and its clinical implications.","Thomas, Vineeth; Audsley, Jennifer; Kapoor, Nitin",J Pak Med Assoc,385,29

In this paper we investigate non-response error, using data collected at the turn of the pandemic on a known sample of 5,605 individuals first involved in the Italian Lives panel (ITA.LI) and then invited to join an ad hoc survey on the health crisis (ITA.LI Covid-19). We compare respondents and non-respondents to ITA.LI Covid-19, using the multivariate logistic regression technique to estimate variations in the probability of taking part in the survey attributable to specific characteristics of the sample members. Our results highlight that highly-educated people, those who live alone, and people living in municipalities experiencing a higher growth of mortality rates after the pandemic outbreak are more likely to take part in the survey, while full-time workers are still less likely to participate. Based on these results, we formulate general recommendations on how to minimise non-response error when sampling frame data are available, both at the survey design stage and at the data management stage. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

With mandated social distancing in a controlled laboratory environment, many researchers are searching for alternative options to conduct research, such as online experimentation. However, online experimentation comes at a cost; learning online tools for building and publishing psychophysics experiments can be complicated and time-consuming. This learning cost is unfortunate because researchers typically only need to use a small percentage of these tools' capabilities, but they still have to deal with these systems' complexities (e.g., complex graphical user interfaces or difficult programming languages). Furthermore, after the experiment is built, researchers often have to find an online platform compatible with the tool they used to program the experiment. To simplify and streamline the online process of programming and hosting an experiment, I have created SimplePhy. SimplePhy can save researchers' time and energy by allowing them to create a study in just a few clicks. All researchers have to do is select among a few experiment settings and upload the stimuli. SimplePhy is able to run most psychophysical perception experiments that require mouse clicks and button presses. In addition to collecting online behavioral data, SimplePhy can also collect information regarding the estimated viewing distance between the participant and the monitor, the screen size, and the experimental trial's timing-features not always offered in other online platforms. Overall, SimplePhy is a simple, free, open-source tool (code can be found here: https://gitlab.com/malago/simplephy ) aimed to help labs conduct their experiments online.","Lago, Miguel A",Behav. res. meth,385,0

We present the unique opportunity we had to monitor the liver, IL-6 and immune cell course before, during and after COVID-19 in a boy with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). CD4 and CD8 T cells frequencies decreased because of prednisolone, followed by a plateauing increase whereas CD19CD20 B cell increased strongly and was unaffected by COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the percentage of activated CD8 T cells expressing HLA-DR (CD8HLA-DR) increased during COVID-19 and subsided after its clearance. Total regulatory T cells (Tregs: CD4CD25CD127FOXP3) remained stable. Although activated Tregs (CD4CD45RAFOXP3) strongly increased upon prednisolone, it decreased afterwards. Furthermore, regulatory B cells (Bregs: CD19CD20CD24CD38) declined sharply owing to prednisolone. Serum IL-6 remained undetectable at all times. We demonstrated for the first time immune monitoring in a child with AIH and T1D before, during and after COVID-19. We hypothesize that continuing with low level of prednisolone without azathioprine may have abrogated activated Tregs, Bregs and IL-6 production and therefore permitting the activation of CD8 T cells, clearing the virus.","Yuksel, Muhammed; Akturk, Hacer; Arikan, Cigdem",Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,385,9

If this condition does not hold true, the model has a connected set of endemic equilibrium states characterized by different proportion of infected and immune individuals. In this case, we show that every trajectory converges either to an endemic equilibrium or to a periodic orbit. Under additional natural assumptions, the periodic attractor is excluded, and we guarantee the convergence of each trajectory to an endemic equilibrium state.

METHODS: Literature was systematically searched in different databases. Results were limited to 2019+ and English, French and Spanish language. RESULTS: Children can exhibit mild and less severe COVID-19 disease than adults and also have asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2, while severe disease is more frequently noted during infancy (<1 year). SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor; age-, racial-, and gender-specific differences in ACE-2 expression need to be elucidated in order to explain the differential clinical profiles between children and adults. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is an important condition to recognise in children. The decision to use antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy in a child or adolescent should be individualised based on the clinical scenario.

However, little is known on what factors influence the risk of developing these symptoms. While some studies suggest that exposure to pollution is associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its role is unknown in the development of neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The response of the central nervous system (CNS) to a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be influenced by its inflammatory state. Interestingly, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter may have neuroinflammatory effects, providing a possible link between exposure to these pollutants and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS. This article explores the hypothesis that the neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 may be exacerbated through a neuroinflammatory mechanism that is promoted by environmental pollutant exposure.","Reyes, Michael Sigfrid S; Medina, Paul Mark B",Med Hypotheses,385,1

However, it is still unclear the actual extent of this situation. The aim of this manuscript is to assess the extent of mortality rates of older adults in LTCF during the pandemic across different regions of Italy, compared to the previous years and to older general population not resident in LTCF. Methods: We extracted and analyzed data collected by three Italian institutions (i.e., Italian Statistician Institute ISTAT, Italian N.I.H, Milan Health Unit) about the number of deaths among older people living in the community and among LTCF residents during the pandemic and the previous years. We also compared the observed mortality rate among LTCF residents in each Italian Region with the corresponding expected number of deaths of the general older adult population to obtain an observed/expected ratio (O/E ratio). Results: During the pandemic, about 8.5% (N = 6,797) of Italian older adults residents in LTCF died. Findings resulting from the O/E ratio suggest that LTCF residents (in particular in the Lombardy Region) show higher mortality rates when compared to expected values of mortality rates among the older general population living in the community. Furthermore, we found that the risk of death among LTCF residents increased about 4 times during the pandemic when compared to the previous years. Conclusions: Mortality rates in LTCF were high during the pandemic, especially in Lombardy. Possible causes of higher mortality rates in LTCF and suggestions for specific targeted interventions are discussed.","de Girolamo, Giovanni; Bellelli, Giuseppe; Bianchetti, Angelo; Starace, Fabrizio; Zanetti, Orazio; Zarbo, Cristina; Micciolo, Rocco",Front Psychiatry,385,16

Among drug classes that typically treat acute infections and chronic diseases, percentage changes were -51.3% and -17.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription dispensing to children declined by one-quarter in April to December 2020 compared with April to December 2019. Declines were greater for infection-related drugs than for chronic disease drugs. Decreased dispensing of the latter is potentially concerning and warrants further investigation. Whether reductions in dispensing of infection-related drugs are temporary or sustained will be important to monitor going forward.","Chua, Kao-Ping; Volerman, Anna; Conti, Rena M",Pediatrics,385,6

In addition, educational settings are considered as workplaces with biohazard risks. Every activity in a laboratory facility carries many potential hazards that can impact human health and the environment and may cause laboratory incidents, including Laboratory Acquired Infections (LAIs). In an effort to minimize the impact and occurrence of these incidents, it is necessary to evaluate the implementation of a bio-risk management system in every activity that involves handling biological agents. This study was conducted in an Indonesian higher-education institution, herein coded as University Y. This is a descriptive, semi-quantitative study aimed at analysing and evaluating the implementation of the bio-risk management systems used in laboratories by analysing the achievements obtained by each laboratory. The study used primary data that were collected using a checklist which referred to ISO 35001:2019 on Laboratory Bio-risk Management. The checklist consisted of 202 items forming seven main elements. In addition, secondary data obtained from literature and document review were also used. The results show that out of 11 laboratories examined, only 2 laboratories met 50% of the requirements, which were Laboratory A and B, achieving good performance. Regarding the clauses of standards, a gap analysis identified leadership, performance evaluation, and support as elements with the lowest achievement. Therefore, corrective action should be developed by enhancing the commitment from management as well as improving documentation, policy, education and training.","Bowolaksono, Anom; Lestari, Fatma; Satyawardhani, Saraswati Andani; Kadir, Abdul; Maharani, Cynthia Febrina; Paramitasari, Debby",Int J Environ Res Public Health,385,1

Emerging and reemerging pathologies are still considered to be dangerous to humanity because of the unique nature of these diseases: it is the encounter between two living organisms that have coexisted for millions of years within the people on the same planet without being previously recognized. These infectious agents, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, pose no threat to humans. In fact, only a few hundred are able to inflict damage to the human host. In addition, the spectrum of human disease caused by a particular pathogen varies considerably depending on the factors related to the ecological agent, the host, and the infectious agents. Several emerging or reemerging infectious agents are organisms that could be used in biological control. The differentiation of a natural epidemic from a bioterrorian event is based on several epidemiological indices as well as on the molecular characterization of the pathogen(s) involved. The role of pathologists is indeed very important. It is in this context that this chapter aims to discuss the various scientific advances, particularly molecular, in terms of diagnosis of these diseases; the new discoveries in the role of nanotechnologies and nanobiosensors; and also the implication of biomarkers, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), since it was reported that a single miRNA has the ultimate capacity to target multiple genes simultaneously. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen and occupy a major role in the host–parasite interaction and pathogenesis. It is in this context that various molecular and nanomethods for the detection of emerging viruses and experimental validation of miRNAs during quelling viruses target transcripts will be discussed in this chapter.","Hammou, Rahma Ait; Benhassou, Mustapha; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,385,20

Here, we comprehensively sampled 1,086 bats from two Puerto Rican caves and tested them for infection with herpesviruses. Using percent identity of nucleotides and a machine learning algorithm, we categorized herpesviruses into 41 OTUs, representing approximately 80% of all herpesviruses in the host community. Although 13 OTUs were detected in multiple host species, OTUs generally exhibited host specificity by infecting a core host species at a significantly higher prevalence than in all other species combined. Only two OTUs showed significantly different prevalence between host sexes.

Therefore, it is essential to have valid and reliable tests to evaluate physical capacities remotely and with their respective valuation tables. Objective To determine the validity and reliability of the Muscular Fitness Test (MFT) to evaluate the body strength-resistance with self-loading in healthy young adults. Secondly, to create qualitative scales to evaluate the different levels of this physical capacity. Material and methods 489 participants performed the MFT (test), and 77 performed it twice (re-test). The MFT included 60seconds (s) of sit-ups, push-ups, deep squats, and burpees, always in that order, with a micropause of 10s. The validity of the MFT was evaluated with the final heart rate (FHR), % of the reserve HR (%) and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE); the reliability included the Coefficient of Variation (CV), Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and the standard error of the mean (SEM) (p <0.05). The qualitative scales were constructed with the percentiles ≤25: poor, ≤50: fair, ≤75: good, ≤90: very good, and >90: excellent.

This opinion paper hence aims to discuss aspects related to the opportunity of monitoring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after COVID-19 vaccination, highlighting the pros and cons of this strategy. In summary, the advantages of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies’ testing in recipients of COVID-19 vaccination encompass an assessment of baseline seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-vaccinated individuals; early identification of low or non-responders to COVID-19 vaccination; and timely detection of faster decay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. In contrast, potential drawbacks to date include an unproven equivalence between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer, neutralizing activity, and vaccine efficiency; the lack of cost-effective analyses of different testing strategies; the enormous volume of blood drawings and increase of laboratory workload that would be needed to support universal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing. A potential solution entails the identification of cohorts to be prioritized for testing, including those at higher risk of being infected by variants of concern, those at higher risk of unfavorable disease progression, and subjects in whom vaccine immunogenicity may be expectedly lower and/or shorter.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Henry, Brandon Michael; Plebani, Mario",Diagnostics (Basel),385,16

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles in English on diabetes and infection. RESULTS: Diabetes predisposes to infections through alterations in innate and acquired immune defenses. Outcomes of infection are worse in people with uncontrolled diabetes, and infection can worsen hyperglycemia in hitherto well controlled diabetes (bidirectional relationship). Diabetes does not increase the risk of infection with COVID-19 per se, but predisposes to severe disease and poor outcomes. COVID-19 has also been linked to deterioration of glycemic control as well as new-onset diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians caring for people with diabetes should be aware of the increased risk of infections in this population, as well as the possibility of worsening hyperglycemia. A holistic approach with frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate titration of medications, along with close attention to nutritional status, is essential to ensure the best possible outcomes.","Unnikrishnan, Ranjit; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,385,3

Based on a prior version of an online patient care platform established in 2017, we developed a customized and improved online telemedicine program designed to specifically address the challenges emerging from the pandemic. This included an online, smart phone-based strategy for triage and medical care delivery and psychological support. We invited a total of 278 CKD patients to join the new platform during the pandemic. The subjects in group A were patients utilizing our old online CKD system and were historical users registered at least 3 months before the pandemic. A pilot survey interrogating medical and psychological conditions was conducted. Feedback on the program as well as a psychological assessment were collected after 1 month. In total, 181 patients showed active responses to the program, with 289 person-time medical consultations occurring during the study. The virtual care program provided a rapid triage for 17% (30 out of 181) patients, with timely referral to in-patient medical encounters for their worsening medical conditions or severe psychological problems.

The majority of diarrhea cases are treated with antimicrobials, which may not be warranted. There is increasing concern related to the use of antimicrobials in food animals due to the emanant development of antimicrobial resistance. Bovine colostrum is densely packed with hundreds of nutrients and bioactives specifically tailored to improve calf health and development. As such, colostrum may have potential to be used an alternative to antimicrobials for the treatment of diarrhea. The objective of this review is to outline the causation and implication of diarrhea in young dairy calves and to explore the benefits of colostrum and its potential use as a therapy and preventative for diarrhea in pre-weaned calves. ABSTRACT: Diarrhea is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pre-weaned dairy calves and, as such, represents a significant animal health and welfare concern. Furthermore, digestive disease early in life is associated with several long-term consequences such as reduced growth rate and decreased milk yield during the first lactation, thus generating severe economic losses. The majority of diarrheic cases in young calves are treated with antimicrobials; however, it is necessary to develop alternative treatments, as excessive antimicrobial usage can lead to antimicrobial resistance and can negatively impact the gut microflora of a calf. Bovine colostrum is abundant in immune and bioactive factors that improve immune function and development. This rich and natural combination of immunoglobulins, natural antimicrobial factors, growth factors, anti-inflammatories and nutrients may be an attractive alternative to antimicrobials in the treatment of diarrhea in young dairy calves. There is evidence that supports the use of colostrum as an early treatment for diarrhea in young calves. Future research should investigate its therapeutic and economic effectiveness.","Carter, Havelah S. M.; Renaud, David L.; Steele, Michael A.; Fischer-Tlustos, Amanda J.; Costa, Joao H.

We perform the analysis with 4 different models and we think that the best candidate to correctly described the italian situation is a generalized Logistic equation. We use two coupled differential equations that model the evolution of the severe infected and the dead. This choice is due to the fact that in Italy the pharyngeal swabs are made only to severe infected, therefore we have no information about asymptomatic people. Moreover, an important observation is that the virus spreads between Regions with some delay. Indeed, we suggest that a different analysis, region by region, would be more sensible than one on the whole Italy. In particular the region Lombardy has a behaviour very fast compared to the other ones. We show the fit and forecast of the dead and total severe infected for Italy and five regions: Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Tuscany.

Methods Articles related to mouthwash and COVID-19 in PubMed were electronically searched in July, 2021. After manually excluding articles lacking sufficient scientific evidence or validation processes, those with inaccessible online full text, those that did not test the effectiveness of mouthwash against SARS-CoV-2, and those not written in English, 17 original and 13 review articles were chosen for this review. Results The eligible articles revealed that the main virucidal mechanism of mouthwash was via interactions with the viral envelope. Povidone-iodine (PVP-I), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and essential oils with ethanol showed virucidal effects on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, potentially by interfering with the viral envelope. A few clinical studies demonstrated that PVP-I, CPC, hydrogen peroxide, and chlorhexidine reduced the oropharyngeal load of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Although the available evidence is limited, mouthwash containing PVP-I or CPC shows potential for reducing the oropharyngeal load of SARS-CoV-2 and thus may present a risk-mitigation strategy for COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Ming-Hsu; Chang, Po-Chun",J Formos Med Assoc,385,16

We aimed to assess the prevalence, clinical profile and outcome of BSIs in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Western India. All patients (age > 18 years) with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) were included. Hospital electronic records were searched for demographic data, time of bloodstream infection since admission, clinical profile, antimicrobial resistance pattern and clinical outcome of all patients who developed BSIs. RESULTS: Out of 750 patients admitted in COVID ICU, 8.5% developed secondary BSIs. All severe COVID-19 patients who developed BSIs succumbed to illness. A significant proportion of BSIs were Gram-negative pathogens (53/64, 82.8%). Acinetobacter baumannii was the commonest isolate, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.8% and 21.9%, respectively). Multidrug-resistance organisms (MDRO) were found in 57.8% of the cases. The majority of MDRO belonged to K. pneumoniae and Enterococcus groups. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria resistant to carbapenems was 47.2% (25/53). On multivariate analysis, raised total leukocyte counts, mechanical ventilation and presence of comorbidities were significantly associated with the incidence of BSIs. CONCLUSION: We found a significant prevalence of Acinetobacter baumannii in COVID-19 associated BSIs. The presence of comorbidities raised leukocyte counts and mechanical ventilation should alarm clinicians for possible BSIs. The timely initiation of empirical antibiotics and rapid de-escalation is vital to improve the outcome. At the same time, strict compliance of infection control practices should be accomplished to reduce the occurrence of MDRO.","Palanisamy, Naveenraj; Vihari, Nakka; Meena, Durga Shankar; Kumar, Deepak; Midha, Naresh; Tak, Vibhor; Sharma, Ankur; Bohra, Gopal Krishana; Kothari, Nikhil; Dutt, Naveen; Bhatia, Pradeep Kumar; Garg, Mahendra Kumar; Misra, Sanjeev",BMC Infect Dis,385,19

Unlike systemic administration, oral immunization can stimulate cellular and humoral immune responses at both systemic and mucosal levels to induce broad-spectrum and long-lasting immunity. Therefore, to design a successful vaccine, it is essential to stimulate the mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. Successful oral vaccines need to overcome the harsh gastrointestinal environment such as the extremely low pH, proteolytic enzymes, bile salts as well as low permeability and the low immunogenicity of vaccines. In recent years, several delivery systems and adjuvants have been developed for improving oral vaccine delivery and immunogenicity. Formulation of vaccines with nanoparticles and microparticles have been shown to improve antigen stability, availability and adjuvanticity as well as immunostimulatory capacity, target delivery and specific release. This review discusses how nanoparticles (NPs) and microparticles (MPs) as oral carriers with adjuvant characteristics can be beneficial in oral vaccine development.","Jazayeri, Seyed Davoud; Lim, Hui Xuan; Shameli, Kamyar; Yeap, Swee Keong; Poh, Chit Laa",Front Pharmacol,385,26

One of the key antiviral factors induced by IFNs, 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase (OAS), is a well-known molecule that regulates the early phase of viral infection by degrading viral RNA in combination with RNase L, resulting in the inhibition of viral replication. In this review, we describe OAS family proteins from a different point of view from that of previous reviews. We discuss not only RNase L-dependent (canonical) and -independent (noncanonical) pathways but also the possibility of the OAS family members as biomarkers for various diseases and clues to non-immunological functions based on recent studies. In particular, we focus on OASL, a member of the OAS family that is relatively less well understood than the other members. We will explain its anti- and pro-viral dual roles as well as the diseases related to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the corresponding gene.","Choi, Un Yung; Kang, Ji-Seon; Hwang, Yune Sahng; Kim, Young-Joon",Exp Mol Med,385,3

Most of the elective operations were discontinued with the fear of exacerbating the disease in patients and spreading it among healthcare professionals. Objective The objective of this study was to report postoperative rates of COVID-19 in patients who underwent emergency and urgent surgery during the pandemic and to determine a safe algorithm in order to propose an ideal approach for surgeries. Patients and methods A total of 162 patients being operated upon emergency or urgent causes between March 11 and May 31 2020 were included in the study. Safety measures advised by the World Health Organization were applied. The patients' operative data and postoperative COVID-19 status were recorded and statistically evaluated. Results Surgical interventions were required for skin cancer, upper extremity trauma, soft tissue infections, maxillofacial trauma, lower extremity trauma and other causes. Local anesthesia was used for 127 patients (78.4%). General anesthesia was used for 28 patients (17,3%). Two of 162 patients contracted COVID-19 postoperatively on days 15 and 21, respectively. No statistical significance was found between surgery and anesthesia types regarding COVID-19 risk. Conclusion It appears that emergency and urgent surgeries can be performed safely. However, this relies upon adequate safety measures being taken with regards to screening for COVID-19 antigen positivity in patients preoperatively. Further evidence is required to determine the safety of elective surgeries.","Demiroz, Anıl; Aydin, Servet; Yalcin, Can Ege; Arslan, Hakan",Cureus,385,1

We have used a weighted Euclidean distance average as the parameter to ensemble the transfer learning model viz. ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, and InceptionV3. Image augmentations have been carried out using generative adversarial network modelling. We took 784 training images, and 278 test images to validate our model accuracy, and the accuracy of our proposed model was around 98.67% for the training data set and 95.52% for the test data set. Along with that, we also propose a genetic algorithm optimized classification algorithm, to analyze the symptoms of COVID-19 for low, medium, and high-risk patients. The accuracy for the optimized set overshadowed the accuracy of un-optimized classification, and the optimized accuracy is as high as 88.96% for the optimized model. The novelty of this paper lies in the bi-sided model of the paper, i.e., we propose two major models, and one is the genetic algorithm optimized model to analyze the symptoms for a patient of varied risk and the other is to classify the X-ray image using an ensemble-based transfer learning model.","Chatterjee, Ahan; Roy, Swagatam; Das, Sunanda",SN Comput Sci,385,24

Therefore, we aim to describe the quality of life (QoL) and limitations experienced due to pandemic management-related measures (PanMan), as well as to assess the association of PanMan with QoL during the first lockdown after the coronavirus outbreak. We obtained data from 500 dentists (33.2% males, M/SD = 43.8) registered with the Slovak Chamber of Dentists using an online questionnaire. We categorized PanMan as the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the ability to implement anti-pandemic measures, information overload, pandemic-related limitations and QoL in terms of their impact on family life and activities, housekeeping, relationships with relatives, financial situation and mental well-being. PanMan mainly affected financial situation, mental well-being and housekeeping. Factors contributing most towards the worsening of QoL were information overload (odds ratio/95% confidence interval, OR/CI: 5.79/2.64–12.71) and several pandemic-related limitations. These consisted of (OR/CI): a lack of PPE (5.17/2.48–10.77), infection risks in the work environment (3.06/1.57–5.95), obligatory safety measures (3.02/1.47–6.21), lack of staff (2.85/1.30–6.25) and client concerns (3.56/1.70–7.49).

The infection induces mild or sometimes severe acute respiratory diseases. Nowadays, the appearance of a new, highly pathogenic and lethal coronavirus variant, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for a pandemic (COVID-19), represents a global problem for human health. Unfortunately, only limited approaches are available to treat coronavirus infections and a vaccine against this new coronavirus variant is not yet available. The plasma membrane microdomain lipid rafts have been found by researchers to be involved in the replication cycle of numerous viruses, including coronaviruses. Indeed, some pathogen recognition receptors for coronaviruses as for other viruses cluster into lipid rafts, and it is therefore conceivable that the first contact between virus and host cells occurs into these specialized regions, representing a port of cell entry for viruses. Recent data highlighted the peculiar pro-viral or anti-viral role played by autophagy in the host immune responses to viral infections. Coronaviruses, like other viruses, were reported to be able to exploit the autophagic machinery to increase their replication or to inhibit the degradation of viral products. Agents known to disrupt lipid rafts, such as metil-β-cyclodextrins or statins, as well as autophagy inhibitor agents, were shown to have an anti-viral role. In this review, we briefly describe the involvement of lipid rafts and autophagy in coronavirus infection and replication. We also hint how lipid rafts and autophagy may represent a potential therapeutic target to be investigated for the treatment of coronavirus infections.","Fecchi, Katia; Anticoli, Simona; Peruzzu, Daniela; Iessi, Elisabetta; Gagliardi, Maria Cristina; Matarrese, Paola; Ruggieri, Anna",Front Microbiol,385,16

To learn more about COVID-19 pathophysiology we performed secondary analyses of transcriptomic data from two in vitro (Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells) and one in vivo (Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice) models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found 1467 conserved differentially expressed host genes (differentially expressed in at least two of the three model system transcriptomes compared) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To find potential genetic factors associated with COVID-19, we analyzed these conserved differentially expressed genes using known human genotype-phenotype associations. Genome-wide association study enrichment analysis showed evidence of enrichment for GWA loci associated with platelet functions, blood pressure, body mass index, respiratory functions, and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, among others. Since human protein complexes are known to be directly related to viral infection, we combined and analyzed the conserved transcriptomic signature with SARS-CoV-2-host protein-protein interaction data and found more than 150 gene clusters. Of these, 29 clusters (with 5 or more genes in each cluster) had at least one gene encoding protein that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These clusters were enriched for different cell types in lung including epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell types suggesting their pathophysiological relevancy to COVID-19. Finally, pathway analysis on the conserved differentially expressed genes and gene clusters showed alterations in several pathways and biological processes that could enable in understanding or hypothesizing molecular signatures inducing pathophysiological changes, risks, or sequelae of COVID-19.","Ghandikota, Sudhir; Sharma, Mihika; Jegga, Anil G.",bioRxiv,385,15

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case–control series. METHODS: Sixty participants (36 women, 24 men, mean age 37.6 ± 19.4 years) were enrolled in this study; 36 were healthy controls and 24 were patients with olfactory dysfunction. Orthonasal olfactory function was assessed with the “Sniffin’ Sticks” test battery. Retronasal olfaction was assessed with oral odorant delivery using special containers for threshold function, and with oral tasteless powders for odor identification. RESULTS: Retronasal and orthonasal olfaction were significantly correlated for threshold scores, identification score, and the sum of threshold and identification score (TI score). Validity analyses showed that the retronasal TI score was able to discriminate between healthy controls and patients with olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Normosmic participants can be distinctly differentiated from patients with olfactory dysfunction using a valid test battery comprised of retronasal threshold and identification tests. Based on the current findings, we advocate a TI score of 16 as a cut-off between patients and controls. Therefore, TI scores of 17 and above would indicate retronasal normosmia.","Yoshino, Ayaho; Pellegrino, Robert; Luckett, Curtis R.; Hummel, Thomas",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,385,5

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-testing performance was evaluated using blood samples from asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 143 COVID-19 patients during an outbreak on a cruise ship 3 weeks after diagnosis. Simultaneously, a follow-up SARS-CoV-2 genetic test was performed. Samples stored before the COVID-19 pandemic were also used to evaluate the lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike proteins were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to confirm which antibodies were influenced on LFA- and ECLIA- false-negative result in crew-member samples. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive, and negative-predictive values of LFA-detected IgM antibodies were 0.231, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.613, respectively; those of LFA-detected IgG antibodies were 0.483, 0.989, 0.972, and 0.601, respectively; and those of ECLIA-detected total antibodies were 0.783, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.848, respectively. All antibody titers measured using ELISA were significantly lower in blood samples with negative results than in those with positive results in both LFA and ECLIA. In the patients with negative results from the follow-up genetic testing, IgM-, IgG-, and total-antibody positivity rates were 22.9%, 47.6%, and 72.4%, respectively.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, it has been shown that the activation of the NLRP3 (NACHT, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome is central in the pathophysiology of pericarditis. These findings derive from clinical data, an experimental animal model of acute pericarditis supporting a role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in pericarditis, and from indirect evidence of inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome in clinical trials. SUMMARY: Pericarditis is regarded as a stereotypical response to an acute damage of the mesothelial cells of the pericardial layers. NLRP3 inflammasome, a macromolecular structure sensing damage and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, is centrally involved as it releases interleukin (IL)-1β, whose auto-induction feeds an autoinflammatory disease, mostly responsible for recurrences. Colchicine, an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome formation, and IL-1-targeted therapies, such as anakinra and rilonacept, were found to effectively blunt the acute inflammation and reduce the risk for recurrences.","Vecchié, Alessandra; Del Buono, Marco Giuseppe; Chiabrando, Guido Juan; Dentali, Francesco; Abbate, Antonio; Bonaventura, Aldo",Curr Cardiol Rep,385,20

HPeV1 VP1 C terminus contains an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif and has been shown to depend on the host cell surface αV integrins (αV ITGs) and heparan sulfate (HS) for entry. HPeV3 lacks this motif and the receptors remain unknown. HPeVs can be detected in patient nasopharyngeal and stool samples, and infection is presumed to occur after respiratory or gastro-intestinal transmission. HPeV pathogenesis is poorly understood as there are no animal models and previous studies have been conducted in immortalized monolayer cell cultures which do not adequately represent the characteristics of human tissues. To bridge this gap, we determined the polarity of infection, replication kinetics, and cell tropism of HPeV1 and HPeV3 in the well-differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) model. We found the HAE cultures to be permissive for HPeVs. Both HPeV genotypes infected the HAE preferentially from the basolateral surface while the progeny virus was shed toward the apical side. Confocal microscopy revealed the target cell type to be the p63(+) basal cells for both viruses, αV ITG and HS blocking had no effect on the replication of either virus, and transcriptional profiling suggested that HPeV3 infection induced stronger immune activation than HPeV1. Genotype-specific host responses may contribute to the differences in pathogenesis and clinical outcomes associated with HPeV1 and HPeV3.","Karelehto, Eveliina; Cristella, Cosimo; Yu, Xiao; Sridhar, Adithya; Hulsdouw, Rens; de Haan, Karen; van Eijk, Hetty; Koekkoek, Sylvie; Pajkrt, Dasja; de Jong, Menno D.; Wolthers, Katja C.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,385,20

METHODS: The clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) and cohort studies on the treatment of COVID-19 with combination of Chinese traditional and Western medicine published on CNKI, Wanfang database, VIP database and PubMed were searched by computer from January 2020 to June 2020. Patients in the simple Western medicine treatment group were treated with routine treatment of Western medicine, and the patients in integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment group were treated with traditional Chinese medicine on the basis of routine treatment of Western medicine. The main outcome was the total effective rate of treatment. The secondary outcome were the antipyretic rate, chest CT recovery rate, lymphocyte count (LYM), C-reactive protein (CRP) level and safety. The Cochrane manual and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to evaluate the quality of the literature; the RevMan5.3 software was used to analyze the articles that meets the quality standards, and a funnel chart was drawn to evaluate the total effective publication bias. RESULTS: Thirteen articles were analyzed, including 1 039 COVID-19 patients, 559 in integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatment group and 480 in simple Western medicine treatment group. The results of Meta- analysis showed that compared with the simple Western medicine treatment group, the combination of routine treatment of Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine Qingfei Paidu decoction, Lianhua Qingwen granule, Shufeng jiedu capsule, Xuebijing injection or Reyanning mixture could significantly improve the total effective rate, antipyretic rate and chest CT recovery rate [total effective rate: odds ratio (OR) = 2.95, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 2.10-4.14, P < 0.000 01; antipyretic rate: OR =3.01, 95%CI was 1.64-5.53, P = 0.000 4; chest CT recovery rate: OR = 2.53, 95%CI was 1.83-3.51, P = 0.000 1], increase LYM levels [mean difference (MD) = 0.26, 95%CI was 0.02-0.50, P = 0.03], and reduce of CRP content (MD = -17.68, 95%CI was -33.14 to -2.22, P = 0.02). Based on the funnel chart analysis of 12 articles with total efficiency, the result showed that the funnel chart distribution was not completely symmetrical, indicating that there might be publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of routine treatment with Western medicine, combined with traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the total effective rate of COVID-19 and improve the laboratory results and clinical symptoms of patients. Compared with the routine treatment of Western medicine alone, the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine has better clinical efficacy and safety.","Wang, Qianfei; Mei, Jianqiang; Wang, Chenxi; Wu, Lijuan; Gao, Haiyun; Zhang, He; Chen, Fenqiao",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,385,33

HMM is combined with other statistical models and machine learning techniques for particular genetic tasks in a series of computer tools. In this article, we surveyed the mathematical structure, application characteristics, historical development, and benchmark analysis of the LAI method in detail, which will help researchers better understand and further develop LAI methods. Firstly, we extensively explore the mathematical structure of each model and its characteristic applications. Next, we use bibliometrics to show detailed model application fields and list articles to elaborate on the historical development. LAI publications had experienced a peak period during 2006–2016 and had kept on moving in the following years. The efficiency, accuracy, and stability of the existing models were evaluated by the benchmark. We find that phased data had higher accuracy in comparison with unphased data. We summarize these models with their distinct advantages and disadvantages. The Loter model uses dynamic programming to obtain a globally optimal solution with its parameter-free advantage.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number of COVID-19 swarmed in the scientific community and public media due to its simplicity in explaining an infectious disease dynamic. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 over time in Bangladesh and its districts using reported cases. Methods Adapted methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), which is a sequential Bayesian approach using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, have been used to estimate Rt. Findings As of July 21, the mean Rt is 1.32(0.98-1.70, 90% HDI), with a median of 1.16(0.99-1.34 90% HDI). The initial Rt of Bangladesh was 3, whereas the Rt on the day of imposing nation-wide lockdown was 1.47, at the end of lockdown phase 1 was 1.06, at the end of lockdown phase 2 was 1.33. Each phase of nation-wide lockdown has contributed to the decline of effective reproduction number (Rt) for Bangladesh by 28.44%, and 26.70%, respectively, implying moderate effectiveness of the epidemic response strategies. Interpretation and Conclusion The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. The Rt continued to fall below the threshold value one steadily from the beginning of July and sustained around 1. The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. As of July 21, the current estimate of Rt is 1.07(0.92-1.15: 90% HDI), meaning that an infected individual is spreading the virus to an average of one other, with 0.07 added chance of infecting a second individual. This whole research recommends two things- broader testing and careful calibration of measures to keep Rt a long way below the crucial threshold one.","Hridoy, A.-E. E.; Naim, M.; Alam, E.; Emon, N.

Among these antioxidant metabolites, flavonoids are abundantly present in primitive, wild, and cultivated citrus species and possess the highest antioxidant activity. We demonstrate that the primitive and wild citrus species (e.g., Atalantia buxifolia and C. latipes) have a high level of antioxidant metabolites and are tolerant to various abiotic and biotic stresses compared with cultivated citrus species (e.g., C. sinensis and C. reticulata). Additionally, we highlight the potential usage of citrus wastes (rag, seeds, fruit peels, etc.) and the health-promoting properties of citrus metabolites.

The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic disaster of 2019–2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions were the most important response strategy based on community interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good personal hygiene (hand-washing)—all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster. This paper presents the results of quantitative research regarding the level of citizen preparedness for disasters caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Serbia. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was requested and then collected online among 975 respondents during disaster in April 2020. The questionnaire examined citizens’ basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics, their knowledge, preparedness, risk perception and preventive measures taken individually and as a community to prevent the death and widespread transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Serbia. Based on the findings that there are major differences in the public’s perception of risks posed by communicable disease threats such as presented by COVID-19, emergency management agencies should use these differences to develop targeted strategies to enhance community and national preparedness by promoting behavioral change and improving risk management decision-making.","Cvetković, Vladimir M.; Nikolić, Neda; Radovanović Nenadić, Una; Öcal, Adem; K.

A fixed-effects analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study",20.631021,3.1168096,2021-09-04,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for end-of-life services and bereavement support, and in many areas of the world, in-person palliative care is struggling to meet these needs. Local infection control measures result in limited visitation rights in hospital and patients are often dying alone. For many years, virtual platforms have been used as a validated alternative to in-person consults for outpatient and home-based palliative care; however, the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual inpatient equivalent is less studied. Virtual inpatient palliative care may offer a unique opportunity for patients to have meaningful interactions with their care team and family while isolated in hospital or in hospice. This narrative review examines strategies employed during the COVID-19 pandemic to implement virtual palliative care services in the inpatient setting. Five key themes were identified in the literature between January 2020-March 2021 in the LitCovid NCBI database: 1) overall acceptability of virtual inpatient palliative care during the pandemic, 2) important logistical considerations when developing a virtual inpatient palliative care platform, 3) commonly used technologies for delivering virtual services, 4) strategies for harnessing human resources to meet increased patient volume, and 5) challenges of virtual inpatient palliative care implementation. Upon review, telepalliative care can meet the increased demand for safe and accessible inpatient palliative care during a pandemic; however, in some circumstances in-person services should still be considered. The decision for which patients receive what format of care-in-person or virtual-should be decided on a case-by-case basis.","Cherniwchan, Holly R",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,385,24

Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively. Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents. Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia. It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical-signaling. In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor-α converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes.","Mahmud-Al-Rafat, Abdullah; Majumder, Apurba; Taufiqur Rahman, K.M.; Mahedi Hasan, A.M.; Didarul Islam, K.M.; Taylor-Robinson, Andrew W.; Billah, Md Morsaline",Cytokine,385,9

The most globally accepted definitions of at-risk patients rely, primarily, on epidemiological characterization of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, such characterization overlooks, and fails to correct for, the prevalence of existing conditions in the wider SARS-CoV-2 positive population. Here, we use the complete medical records of 4,353 Israeli SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, of whom 173 experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, to identify the conditions that increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications, as previously reported. Interestingly, it also indicates that depression (e.g., odds ratio, OR, for males 65 years or older: 2.94, 95% confidence intervals [1.55, 5.58]; P-value = 0.014) as well cognitive and neurological disorder (e.g., OR for individuals [≥] 65 year old: 2.65 [1.69, 4.17]; P-value < 0.001) are significant risk factors; and that smoking and background of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment efforts.","Yanover, C.; Mizrahi, B.; Kalkstein, N.; Marcus, K.; Akiva, P.; Barer, Y.; Shalev, V.; Chodick, G.",,385,8

To investigate the antiviral activity of graphene oxide (GO) sheets and GO sheets with silver particles (GO-Ag) against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, feline coronavirus (FCoV) with an envelope and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) without an envelope were chosen. The morphology and sizes of GO and GO-Ag were characterized by transmission, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. A virus inhibition assay was used to identify the antiviral activity of GO and GO-Ag. Go-Ag inhibited 25% of infection by FCoV and 23% by IBDV, whereas GO only inhibited 16% of infection by FCoV but showed no antiviral activity against the infection by IBDV. Further application of GO and GO-Ag can be considered for personal protection equipment to decrease the transmission of viruses.","Chen, Yi-Ning; Hsueh, Yi-Huang; Hsieh, Chien-Te; Tzou, Dong-Ying; Chang, Pai-Ling",Int J Environ Res Public Health,385,16

The novel coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was a trending topic on the internet, using validated instruments and relating the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term “Wuhan Coronavirus” on the Google website (February 6, 2020). At the search time, the terms “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2” (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) did not exist. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark, the DISCERN instrument, and Google ranking. RESULTS: The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.8% (n=2) of the websites had the HONcode seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39.1% (n=43) of the websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool, and only 10.0% (11/110) of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70.0% (n=77) of the websites were evaluated as having a low score and none were rated as having a high score. CONCLUSIONS: Nonhealth personnel and the scientific community need to be aware about the quality of the information they read and produce, respectively. The Wuhan coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media, and the misinformation was obtained by users from the internet. The use of the internet has a risk to public health, and, in cases like this, the governments should be developing strategies to regulate health information on the internet without censuring the population. By February 6, 2020, no quality information was available on the internet about COVID-19.","Cuan-Baltazar, Jose Yunam; Muñoz-Perez, Maria José; Robledo-Vega, Carolina; Pérez-Zepeda, Maria Fernanda; Soto-Vega, Elena",JMIR Public Health Surveill,385,20

The literature shows that the poor quality of CPGs can form a barrier against adhering to them, resulting in a suboptimal level of healthcare. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the quality of CPGs in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II (AGREE II) Instrument. METHODS: The authors searched in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through the Ovid interface on May 25, 2019. Keywords relating to CPGs and MENA countries were combined using Boolean search operators. The search was not limited to specific diseases. The quality of guidelines was appraised by two reviewers independently using the AGREE II Instrument. Discrepancies within a group were resolved through the involvement of a principle investigator. RESULTS: A total of 61 CPGs were appraised. These guidelines were mainly from Saudi Arabia, and the most covered disease topic was cancer. Among the six domains of the AGREE II Instrument, CPGs scored the highest on clarity of presentation (mean 82%), while the lowest score was granted to the rigor of development domain (mean 28%). This indicates substantial deficiencies in reporting the developmental processes of CPGs and the resources used for the synthesis of evidence. CONCLUSION: From this review, it was found that the number of retrieved guidelines published in the MENA region is limited considering the large geographical area of the MENA region. The main domains that have higher quality scores were clarity of presentation and scope and purpose, whereas domains with the lowest scores were rigor of development and applicability. The authors’ findings will help policymakers identify areas for improvement in CPGs, which can lead them to implement strategies such as the training of individuals and recruitment of international experts to ultimately develop high-quality CPGs.","Almazrou, Saja H; Alsubki, Layan A; Alsaigh, Norah A; Aldhubaib, Wadha H; Ghazwani, Sharifah M",J Multidiscip Healthc,385,16

This paper provides evidence that information frictions and the “first-come, first-served” design of the PPP program skewed its resources towards larger firms and may have permanently reduced its effectiveness. Using new daily survey data on small businesses in the U.S., we show that the smallest businesses were less aware of the PPP and less likely to apply. If they did apply, the smallest businesses applied later, faced longer processing times, and were less likely to have their application approved. These frictions may have mattered, as businesses that received aid report fewer layoffs, higher employment, and improved expectations about the future.","Humphries, John Eric; Neilson, Christopher A.; Ulyssea, Gabriel",J Public Econ,385,16

Even with emergent fasciotomy, tissue necrosis developed in wide areas of the limb, with subsequent tibial osteomyelitis. After extensive debridement and tibial sequestrectomy, the soft tissue and bone defect were simultaneously reconstructed with free tissue transfer of the latissimus dorsi muscle and scapular tip composite flap.

Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of “immune enhancement”). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MHC Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway. Translational consequences of these findings are explored.","Lyons-Weiler, James",J Transl Autoimmun,385,33

There is currently no licensed antiviral treatment available to prevent human CoV infection. The widespread clinical use and existing knowledge on antiviral mechanisms of remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of previous epidemic diseases, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), may be helpful in the combat with novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recent clinical evidence didn’t confirm the beneficial role of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients and their use was reassessed. We provide an overview of the current evidence into the mechanisms of action of these available drugs which are repurposed for treatment of the new virus. Available data identifies remdesivir as an adenosine analogue that can target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and block viral RNA synthesis. It has been a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses. 3CLpro is a major CoV protease that cleaves the large replicase polyproteins during viral replication and can be targeted by the protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir but the clinical effects are controversial. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine could impair the replication of SARSCoV-2 by multiple mechanisms and their immunomodulatory properties could ameliorate clinical manifestations that are mediated by immune reactions of the host although its beneficial effects are under question and need to be proven at the clinical level. Existing in vitro and in vivo evidence delineate the molecular mechanisms of these drugs in CoV-infected cells. Numerous studies demonstrated the ability of remdesivir to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication but future research would be needed to understand the exact mode of action of lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and to use this knowledge in the treatment of the current COVID-19.","Uzunova, Katya; Filipova, Elena; Pavlova, Velichka; Vekov, Toni",Biomed Pharmacother,385,21

Specific staining was detected by immunohistochemistry within macrophages in the livers and kidneys, and undefined cell types in the brains. The highest viral RNA load was found in macrophage-rich tissues. The detection of viral RNA in the salivary gland, serum, kidney, bladder and urine is compatible with transmission via close physical contact during encounters such as fighting or grooming, or by contact with an environment that has been contaminated with saliva or urine. Levels of viral RNA remained high in all tissues tested throughout the study, suggesting that on-going virus replication and evasion of the immune responses may be important in the pathogenesis of disease.","Giles, Julia; Perrott, Matthew; Roe, Wendi; Shrestha, Kshitiz; Aberdein, Danielle; Morel, Patrick; Dunowska, Magdalena",Virology,385,1

We aimed to determine what factors are associated with COVID-19 testing and test positivity in an underrepresented, understudied, and underreported (U3) population of mothers. METHODS: This study included 2996 middle-aged mothers of the Boston Birth Cohort (a sample of predominantly urban, low-income, Black and Hispanic mothers) who were enrolled shortly after they gave birth and followed onward at the Boston Medical Center. COVID-19 testing and test positivity were defined by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. Two-probit Heckman selection models were performed to identify factors associated with test positivity while accounting for potential selection associated with COVID testing. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of study mothers was 41.9 (±7.7) years. In the sample, 1741 (58.1%) and 667 (22.3%) mothers were self-identified as Black and Hispanic, respectively.

We analysed the most used treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 and the phase in which they are supposed to be effective. In the viral phase, remdesivir has demonstrated reduction in recovery time but no mortality reduction. Other drugs proposed for viral phase such as convalescent plasma and lopinavir/ritonavir did not demonstrate to be effective.

RESULTS: The number of injections has increased nearly 11-fold from 2009 to 2019, with a total of 44,924 injections delivered in 2019. The majority of injections were given for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Aflibercept formed 87% of injections administered in 2019. The number of injections is predicted to continue to increase every year, with nearly 83,000 injections forecasted in the year 2029. CONCLUSION: The demand for intravitreal injections has increased substantially over the last decade and is predicted to further increase. Healthcare systems will need to adapt to accommodate the high demand. Other solutions may include longer-acting therapies to reduce the treatment burden.","Chopra, Reena; Preston, Gabriella C.; Keenan, Tiarnan D.

AIMS: The aim of the study is to improvise perioperative obstetric healthcare in a tertiary healthcare center. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This is a retrospective case series of parturients infected with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a case series of COVID-19–infected parturients. There is no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to become seriously affected by coronavirus, yet these groups of patients are vulnerable to infection. Hence, the objectives in the management of such patients which includes caring for the range of the asymptomatic to critically ill women in the peripartum period and protection of healthcare providers from exposure to the disease while treating them while treating them is of paramount importance. RESULTS: There is limited literature available about the effect of this disease and the risk of complications in pregnancy. The variables affect the respiratory system and exacerbate the susceptibility to infections. This complicates or delays the diagnosis in COVID-19–infected parturients, which affect their clinical outcome. Thus, there is a need on focused and optimal management in a tertiary healthcare center. Of the total 109 lower segment cesarean section patients in our hospital, there were only two maternal and neonatal deaths among the 12 emergency cases performed. CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative efforts are imperative among experts such as anesthesiologists and obstetricians to tackle the impact of this disease. There must be surveillance systems in place for reporting maternal and fetal data during this pandemic.","Panda, Amrita; Das, Saswati; Satapathy, G. C.",Anesth Essays Res,385,28

ACE2, the receptor for entry into the target cells by SARS-CoV-2, was found to abundantly express in testes, including spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells. However, there is no clinical evidence about whether SARS-CoV-2 infection can affect male gonadal function so far. In this study, we compared the sex-related hormones between 81 reproductive-aged men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 100 age-matched healthy men, and found that serum luteinizing hormone (LH) was significantly increased, but the ratio of testosterone (T) to LH and the ratio of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to LH were dramatically decreased in males with COVID-19. Besides, multivariable regression analysis indicated that c-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly associated with serum T:LH ratio in COVID-19 patients. This study provides the first direct evidence about the influence of medical condition of COVID-19 on male sex hormones, alerting more attention to gonadal function evaluation among patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially the reproductive-aged men.","Ma, L.; Xie, W.; Li, D.; Shi, L.; Mao, Y.; Xiong, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, M.",,385,16

The clinical presentation of this virus mainly manifests in the respiratory system but may also lead to severe complications in the cardiovascular system. The global burden of COVID‐19 has led to an unprecedented need to gain further insight into patient outcomes, management, and clinical practice. This review aims to provide an overview of the current literature on heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, management, and care pathways for supporting patients during and beyond this pandemic. A literature review of five areas of interest was conducted and included: (i) HF hospitalization; (ii) recognizing the needs and supporting HF patients during COVID‐19; (iii) supporting rehabilitation services; (iv) transitioning to a telehealth framework; and (v) the need for evidence. Patients with new‐onset or existing HF are particularly vulnerable, but a significant reduction in HF hospital admissions has been reported. During these periods of uncertainty, the current care pathways for acute and elective cardiac patients have had to change with the relocation of HF services to protect the vulnerable and reduce transmission of COVID‐19. Optimizing community HF services has the potential to reduce the pressures on secondary care during the recovery from this pandemic. Telemedicine and virtual health care are emerging technologies and overcome the risk of in‐person exposure. Successful remote delivery of cardiac rehabilitation services has been reported during the pandemic. Delivery of a robust telehealth framework for HF patients will improve communication between clinician and patient. The reduction in HF admissions is a concern for the future and may result in unintended mortality. New‐onset and current HF patients must understand their diagnosis and future prognosis and seek help and support using the appropriate platform when needed. Realigning HF services and the use of telemedicine and virtual health care has great potential but needs to be carefully understood to ensure engagement and approval in this population to overcome barriers and challenges.","Charman, Sarah J.; Velicki, Lazar; Okwose, Nduka C.; Harwood, Amy; McGregor, Gordon; Ristic, Arsen; Banerjee, Prithwish; Seferovic, Petar M.; MacGowan, Guy A.; Jakovljevic, Djordje G.",ESC Heart Fail,385,1

This unprecedented situation could be expected to influence teacher well-being and schools as organizations. This article reports a qualitative study that aims at understanding how changes in teachers’ professional lives that were related to school closure affected Swiss primary teachers’ professional well-being. In semi-structured online-interviews, 21 teachers from 15 schools sampled by snowball method reported their experiences during school closure and distance teaching and how this situation influenced their professional well-being. Results showed that medium to high levels of teacher well-being could accompany a general negative evaluation of the move to distance teaching. Factors such as high work-load, social distancing and feelings of lack of competence and self-efficacy were among the most aversive aspects of distance teaching and associated with deteriorating professional well-being. Among a plethora of factors that supported teachers in maintaining their well-being, contextual work-related aspects such as school resources, collegial support or leadership support along with individual aspects such as resilience, coping strategies, and clear work structures were important. Additionally, it was found that teacher well-being was nourished by positive experiences with the new forms of distance teaching and feelings of professional mastery. Despite methodological limitations (snowball sampling, retrospective interviews), the findings of this study could inform schools and authorities about what is needed to support teacher well-being and might help to develop organizational strategies that aim at preventing harmful declines in teacher well-being during challenging and difficult times such as a pandemic.","Hascher, Tina; Beltman, Susan; Mansfield, Caroline",Front Psychol,385,13

Primary prevention activities are essential in delaying young people’s substance use and reducing the harms associated with use. However, such prevention activities are generally lacking. The Icelandic Model (IM) has received increasing attention and has been associated with improvements in substance use in Iceland since the 1990s. There is interest in implementing the IM in Scotland but concerns regarding transferability. This research study aimed to address a gap in the evidence base by providing insight into stakeholders’ views of the IM in Dundee and more widely in Scotland. METHODS: Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured telephone interviews with 16 stakeholders. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis in NVivo, informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Participants were keen for more prevention activities to be delivered in Scotland and were generally supportive of the IM, given the high rates of substance use and related harm. A range of positive factors were identified, including the evidence base, the multi-component nature of the IM, and availability of current services that could be embedded into delivery. Several barriers were noted, relating to funding, the franchise model, support and buy-in and cultural differences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into the views of a range of stakeholders regarding the potential implementation of the IM in Scotland, and perceived barriers and facilitators. There is a desire for primary prevention activities in Scotland, driven by concerns about high rates of substance use and related harms, and a general lack of effective and evidence based prevention activities across the country. Several key barriers would need to be addressed in order for implementation to be successful, and participants were clear that initial piloting is required.

Therapy for RSV infections is limited to high risk infants and there are no safe and efficacious vaccines. Matrix (M) protein is a major RSV structural protein with a key role in virus assembly. Interestingly, M is localised to the nucleus early in infection and its export into the cytoplasm by the nuclear exporter, exportin-1 (XPO1) is essential for RSV assembly. We have shown previously that chemical inhibition of XPO1 function results in reduced RSV replication. In this study, we have investigated the anti-RSV efficacy of Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) compounds, KPT-335 and KPT-185. Our data shows that therapeutic administration of the SINE compounds results in reduced RSV titre in human respiratory epithelial cell culture. Within 24 h of treatment, RSV replication and XPO1 expression was reduced, M protein was partially retained in the nucleus, and cell cycle progression was delayed. Notably, the effect of SINE compounds was reversible within 24 h after their removal. Our data show that reversible inhibition of XPO1 can disrupt RSV replication by affecting downstream pathways regulated by the nuclear exporter.","Mathew, Cynthia; Tamir, Sharon; Tripp, Ralph A.; Ghildyal, Reena",Sci Rep,385,20

This anxiety was largely fueled by the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the disease, was so far unknown, and therefore an accurate prediction of the number of deaths was particularly difficult. However, this prediction is of the utmost importance for public health authorities to make the most reliable decisions and establish the necessary precautions to protect people’s lives. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19. This approach requires modeling the number of infected cases using a generalized logistic function and using this function for inferring the number of deaths. An estimate of the parameters of the proposed model is obtained using a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) that requires iteratively solving a quadratic programming problem. In addition to the total number of deaths and number of infected cases, the model enables the estimation of the infection fatality rate (IFR). Furthermore, using some mild assumptions, we derive estimates of the number of active cases. The proposed approach was empirically assessed on official data provided by the State of Qatar.

Establishment of a practice vaccination protocol with regards to the site of administration of rabies and distemper vaccines is paramount to document any future abnormal tissue reactions. Influenza is the most common zoonotic disease that is seen in ferrets. Although it generally is benign in most ferrets, veterinarians must take this condition seriously. The characteristic continuous antigenic variation of this virus may lead to more virulent strains; the recent emergence of avian influenza virus outbreaks; and the increased susceptibility of elderly, young, and immunosuppressed individuals.","Langlois, Isabelle",Vet Clin North Am Exot Anim Pract,385,1

However, the number of samples of speech-based PD is relatively small, and there exist discrepancies in the distribution between subjects. In order to solve the two problems, a novel unsupervised two-step sparse transfer learning is proposed in this paper to tackle with PD speech diagnosis. In the first step, convolution sparse coding with the coordinate selection of samples and features is designed to learn speech structure from the source domain to replenish sample information of the target domain. In the second step, joint local structure distribution alignment is designed to maintain the neighbor relationship between the respective samples of the training set and test set, and reduce the distribution difference between the two domains at the same time. Two representative public PD speech datasets and one real-world PD speech dataset were exploited to verify the proposed method on PD speech diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that each step of the proposed method has a positive effect on the PD speech classification results, and it also delivers superior performance over the existing relative methods.","Li, Yongming; Zhang, Xinyue; Wang, Pin; Zhang, Xiaoheng; Liu, Yuchuan",Neural Comput Appl,385,20

The effects will continue to grow and worsen if economies begin to open without the proper precautions, including expanded diagnostic capabilities. To address this need for increased testing, we have developed a sensitive reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay compatible with current reagents, which utilizes a colorimetric readout in as little as 30 min. A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was optimized to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample. This simple inactivation and purification pipeline is inexpensive and compatible with other downstream RNA detection platforms and uses readily available reagents. It should increase the availability of SARS-CoV-2 testing as well as expand the settings in which this testing can be performed.","Rabe, Brian A.; Cepko, Constance",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,385,1

These factors are in turn associated with morbidity and mortality. Thus far, a systematic review is lacking with regard to the association between obesity, social isolation and loneliness. Therefore, our aim was to fill this gap in knowledge. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three established electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, as well as CINAHL) were searched. Observational studies examining the link between obesity and loneliness or social isolation were included. Disease-specific samples were excluded. RESULTS: In sum, six studies have been included. While some studies point to an association between obesity and increased loneliness levels, it should be acknowledged that findings are mixed. Study quality was quite high. CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that the literature is inconclusive and incomplete. Further research is required to shed further light on these associations. Moreover, studies from countries outside Europe, based on longitudinal data and using objective assessments of obesity, are urgently required.

AIM: To compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics between sHLH and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in COVID-19. METHODS: A review of articles in the PubMed database was performed, using the following keywords ""HLH and COVID"", ""HScore in COVID"". Articles available until July 16, 2020 were included. RESULTS: A comparative table was prepared based on the diagnostic criteria of the HLH 2004 protocol, HScore and characteristics of the CRS-COVID-19. Eighteen variables are used for comparison. DISCUSSION: The CRS in COVID-19 presented similarity with the CRS of sHLH;however, it cannot be stated that they are the same entity. Case reports of sHLH in COVID-19 are small. HScore is a tool that could guide the diagnosis of sHLH in the context of CRS-COVID-19, in a more practical way than the classic criteria described in HLH-2004;however, its application in COVID-19 is limited due to the absence of key features of the hyperinflammatory state of COVID-19 that are included in HLH.

Amazonian States have a much higher contamination rate than the southern and southeastern States. So far, no explanation has been provided for this striking difference that can shed light on the airborne transmission of the virus. Minimizing airborne transmission, health authorities recommend two meters as a safe distance. However, recent experiments reveal that this can be the main form of contagion. There is a lack of theoretical explanation on how airborne transmission works. Methods To investigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 in different macro environments, we analyzed the daily official data on the evolution of COVID-19 in Brazil. We compared our epidemiologic results obtained in States with very different climatic characteristics, and that had adopted, almost simultaneously, similar social isolation measures. To understand the virus spread, it was necessary to calculate theoretically the movement and behavior in the air of saliva droplets. Findings The transmission of SARS-COV-2 is much faster in the Amazon rainforest region. Our theoretical calculations explain and support the empirical results observed in recent experiments that demonstrate the relevance of aerial transmission of the coronavirus. Interpretation An onset of collective immunity may have been achieved with a contamination rate of about 15% of the Amazonian population. If confirmed, this result will have an essential impact on the management of the pandemic across the planet. The airborne transmission played a decisive role in the striking difference in the evolution of the pandemic among Brazilian regions. Air humidity is the most important climatic factor in viral spreading, while usual ambient temperatures do not have strong influence. There is no safe indoor distance for the coronavirus transmission. So, mask and eye protection are essential.","Crema, E.",,385,29

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey sent to healthcare practitioners working in various hospitals and community pharmacies. Demographic, professional and psychological characteristics (distress using Kessler-6 questionnaire, anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep issues, exhaustion) were measured as were sources of fear. Descriptive and multivariable statistics were performed using level of distress as the outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 937 practitioners (56.1% females). Approximately 68%, 14%, and 18% were nurses/technicians, physicians, and pharmacists (respectively). 32% suffered from high distress while 20% suffered from severe distress. Exhaustion, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances were reported (in past seven days) by approximately 34%, 34%, 19%, and 29% of subjects (respectively). Being older or male, a positive perception of communications with peers, and being satisfied at work, were significantly associated with lower distress. Conversely, suffering burnout; reporting sleep-related functional problems; exhaustion; being a pharmacist (relative to a physician); working in a cancer center; harboring fear about virus spreading; fear that the virus threatened life; fear of alienation from family/friends; and fear of workload increases, were significantly associated with higher distress. CONCLUSION: Despite low caseloads, Jordanian practitioners still experienced high levels of distress. Identified demographic, professional and psychological factors influencing distress should inform interventions to improve medical professionals’ resilience and distress likelihood, regardless of the variable Covid-19 situation.","Hawari, Feras I.; Obeidat, Nour A.; Dodin, Yasmeen I.; Albtoosh, Asma S.; Manasrah, Rasha M.; Alaqeel, Ibrahim O.; Mansour, Asem H.",PLoS One,385,20

They severely compromise patient safety, are a significant burden on healthcare resources and have an adverse impact on patient quality of life. The incidence of SSIs can be as high as 10% after colorectal procedures. The laparoscopic approach is being increasingly used to undertake colorectal procedures. It provides advantages over the traditional open approach with smaller incisions, shorter hospital stay and equal oncological outcomes. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether the laparoscopic approach for colorectal procedures reduces the incidence of SSI compared to the open approach. METHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the two approaches published since 2000 were included in the review. Revman 5.3 software was used to carry out the review. Data were pooled and the results were shown as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals using the fixed effects model. RESULTS: Sixteen RCT’s were included in the analysis comprising 5797 patients. These covered a range of colorectal pathologies including colon cancer, rectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Analysis showed significantly lower wound infection rates (RR: 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.60–0.88, p = 0.001) and lower abdominal abscess rates (RR: 0.88, 95% CI 0.62–1.27, p = 0.51). The combined SSI rate was significantly lower in laparoscopic compared to open surgery (RR: 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.90, p = 0.001).

Genetic analysis of the complete M and ORF3 genes showed that each PEDV group had several unique characteristics, and this indicated that specific groups of PEDVs may be differentiated from the other PEDVs by specific nucleotide differences. Especially, ORF3 gene analysis can be used for discrimination between vaccine and wild-type PEDVs. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that recent, prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates have close relationships to Chinese field strains and differ genetically from European strains and vaccine strains used in Korea.

Yet disease resistance and immune-related adverse events persist as unmet needs. Sargramostim, a yeast-derived recombinant human GM-CSF, has shown clinical activity against diverse solid tumors, including metastatic melanoma. Here we review the use of sargramostim for treatment of advanced melanoma. Potential sargramostim applications in melanoma draw on the unique ability of GM-CSF to link innate and adaptive immune responses. We review preclinical and translational data describing the mechanism of action of sargramostim and synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance efficacy and reduce treatment-related toxicity.","Tarhini, Ahmad A; Joshi, Ila; Garner, Fiona",Immunotherapy,385,16

A Canadian perspective,20.468088,2.2082725,2020-11-19,"Background Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to a variety of clinical outcomes ranging from the absence of symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and ultimately death. A feature of patients with severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the abundance of inflammatory cytokines in the blood. Elevated levels of cytokine are predictive of infection severity and clinical outcome. In contrast, studies aimed at defining the driving forces behind the inflammation in lungs of severed COVID-19 subjects remain scarce. Objective To analyze and compare the plasma and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) of patients with severe COVID-19 (n=45) for the presence of cytokines and lipid mediators of inflammation (LMI). Methods Cytokines were measured using Luminex multiplex assay and LMI measured using LC-MS/MS. Results We reveal high concentrations of numerous cytokines/chemokines/LMI in BALs of patients with severe COVID-19. Among the 13 most abundant mediators in BALs, 11 were chemokines with CXCL1 and CXCL8 being 200 times more abundant than IL-6 and TNF-α. Eicosanoids were also elevated in lungs of severe COVID-19 subjects. Consistent with the presence chemotactic molecules, BALs were enriched for neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils. Inflammatory cytokines/LMI in plasma showed limited correlations with those present in BALs, arguing that circulating inflammatory molecules may not be a reliable proxy of the inflammation occurring in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions Our findings indicate that lungs hyperinflammation of severe COVID-19 patients is fueled by excessive production of chemokines and eicosanoids. Therapeutic strategies to dampen inflammation in COVID-19 patients should be tailored accordingly.","Zaid, Younes; Doré, Étienne; Dubuc, Isabelle; Archambault, Anne-Sophie; Flamand, Olivier; Laviolette, Michel; Flamand, Nicolas; Boilard, Éric; Flamand, Louis",J Allergy Clin Immunol,385,16

Further characterization of HCoV-EMC suggests that this virus is different from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) because it is able to replicate in multiple mammalian cell lines and it does not use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a receptor to achieve infection. Additional research is urgently needed to better understand the pathogenicity and tissue tropism of this virus in humans. In their recent study published in mBio, Kindler et al. shed some light on these important topics (E. Kindler, H. R. Jónsdóttir, M. Muth, O. J. Hamming, R. Hartmann, R. Rodriguez, R. Geffers, R. A.

We sought the necessary conditions for ozone to disinfect N95 respirators for reuse and the effects of multiple cycles of exposure. METHODS: Portions of 3M 1870 N95 respirators were exposed to ozone at 400 ppm with 80% humidity for 2 hours to determine effectiveness of ozone on killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Entire 3M 1870 N95 respirators were exposed to five cycles of 400 ppm with 80% or higher humidity for 2 hours then evaluated for ozone’s effects on airflow resistance, filtration efficiency, strap strength and quantitative fit. RESULTS: Ozone exposure disinfected 3M 1870 N95 respirators heavily inoculated with P. aeruginosa. Ozone exposure did not negatively affect the airflow resistance, filtration efficiency, strap strength or fit of the 3M 1870 N95 respirator. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that ozone is a feasible strategy to disinfect N95 respirators for reuse during this and future pandemics.","Manning, Edward P; Stephens, Matthew D; Dufresne, Sylvie; Silver, Bruce; Gerbarg, Patricia; Gerbarg, Zach; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Sharma, Lokesh",BMJ Open Respir Res,385,26

However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding some treatments including hydroxychloroquine where the initial hype and misinformation led to shortages, price rises and suicides. Price rises and shortages were also seen for PPE. Such activities can have catastrophic consequences especially in countries with high co-payment levels. Consequently, there is a need to investigate this further. Objective: Assess changes in utilisation, prices, and shortages of pertinent medicines and PPE among African and Asian countries since the start of pandemic. Our approach: Data gathering among community pharmacists to assess changes in patterns from the beginning of March until principally the end of May 2020. In addition, suggestions on ways to reduce misinformation. Results: One hundred and thirty one pharmacists took part building on the earlier studies across Asia. There were increases in the utilisation of principally antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine) and antibiotics (azithromycin) especially in Nigeria and Ghana. There were limited changes in Namibia and Vietnam reflecting current initiatives to reduce inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials. Encouragingly, there was increased use of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE across the countries where documented. In addition, generally limited change in the utilisation of herbal medicines. However, shortages have resulted in appreciable price increases in some countries although moderated in others through government initiatives. Suggestions in Namibia going forward included better planning and educating patients. Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in the utilisation of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE. However, concerns with increased utilisation of antimicrobials needs addressing alongside misinformation, unintended consequences from the pandemic and any appreciable price rises. Community pharmacists and patient organisations can play key roles in providing evidence-based advice, helping moderate prices through improved stock management, and helping address unintended consequences of the pandemic.","Sefah, Israel Abebrese; Ogunleye, Olayinka O.; Essah, Darius Obeng; Opanga, Sylvia A.; Butt, Nadia; Wamaitha, Annie; Guantai, Anastasia Nkatha; Chikowe, Ibrahim; Khuluza, Felix; Kibuule, Dan; Nambahu, Lahya; Abubakar, Abdullahi Rabiu; Sani, Ibrahim Haruna; Saleem, Zikria; Kalungia, Aubrey C.; Thi Phuong, Thuy Nguyen; Haque, Mainul; Islam, Salequl; Kumar, Santosh; Sneddon, Jacqueline; Wamboga, Joshua; Wale, Janney; Miljković, Nenad; Kurdi, Amanj; Martin, Antony P.; Godman, Brian",Front Pharmacol,385,20

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of government mandated school closures, stay at home orders and mask requirements. Cumulative incidence rates were calculated at 14 day intervals until the day of the first vaccine administration in the country. Rate ratios were calculated using negative binomial regression while investigating the effects of adjusting for several socio-demographic and medical factors. Faster implementation of mask mandates was consistently shown to be protective. States with mask mandates made at three to six months had a 1.61 times higher rate than those who implemented within 1 month (adjusted rate ratio=1.61, 95% CI: 1.23-2.10, p=0.001). States with mask mandates made after six months or with no mandate had a 2.16 times higher rate than those who implemented within one month (adjusted rate ratio = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.64-2.88, p<0.0001). In contrast, both stay at home orders and school closures had no significant influence on disease trajectory.

METHODS: This is a single-center prospective observational cohort study in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Immediately after intensive care unit (ICU) admission patients were allocated to CVP treatment following pre-specified criteria to rapidly identify those patients potentially susceptible for this treatment. A propensity score adjustment [inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) analysis] was implemented to account rigorously for imbalances in prognostic variables between the treatment groups. RESULTS: We included 120 patients of whom 48 received CVP. Thirty percent were female with a median age of 66 years [25th–75th percentile 54–75]. Eighty-eight percent of patients presented with severe acute respiratory failure as displayed by a median paO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (Horowitz Index) of 92 [77–150]. All patients required any kind of ventilatory support with more than half of them (52%) receiving invasive ventilation. Thirty-day ICU overall survival (OS) was 69% in the CVP group and 54% in the non-CVP group (log-rank p = 0.049), respectively. After weighing the time-to-event data for the IPTW, the favorable association between CVP and OS became even stronger (log-rank p = 0.035). Moreover, an exploratory analysis showed an overall survival benefit of CVP therapy for patients with non-invasive ventilation (Hazard ratio 0.12 95% CI 0.03–0.57, p = 0.007) CONCLUSION: Administration of CVP in patients with acute respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is associated with improved ICU survival rates.

Remdesivir and Dexamethasone are two treatments that have shown to be effective against the Sars-Cov-2 associated disease. However, a cost-effectiveness analysis of the two treatments is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: The cost-utility of Remdesivir, Dexamethasone and a simultaneous use of the two drugs with respect to standard of care for treatment Covid-19 hospitalized patients is evaluated, together with the effect of Remdesivir compared to the base model but based on alernative assumptions. METHODS: A decision tree for an hypothetical cohort of Covid-19 hospitalized patients, from an health care perspective and a one year horizon is specified. Efficacy data are retrieved from a literature review of clinical trials, whilst costs and utility are obtained from other published studies. RESULTS: Remdesivir, if health care costs are related to the days of hospitalization, is a cost saving strategy. Dexamethasone is cost effective with an ICER of <DOLLAR/>5208/QALY, and the concurrent use of Remdesivir and Dexamethasone is the most favorable strategy for higher level of willingness to pay thresholds. Moreover, if Remdesivir has a positive effect on mortality the utility is three times higher respect to base case. Whereas, if health care costs are not related to the length of patient hospitalization Remdesivir has an ICER respect to standard of care of <DOLLAR/>384412.8/QALY gained, which is not cost effective. We also find that Dexaamethasone is cost effective respect to standard care if we compute the cost for live saved with an ICER of <DOLLAR/>313.79 for life saved. The uncertainty of the model parameters is also tested through both a one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: We find that the use of Remdesivir and/or Dexamethasone is effective from an economic standpoint.","Carta, Andrea; Conversano, Claudio",BMC Health Serv Res,385,16

Data collection in the ascending phase is crucial to address a rapidly evolving crisis by helping us understand the uncertain relationship between risk communication and psychological responses. Data were collected from 26 January 26, 2020, until February 17, 2020, with a mean test–retest interval of 16 days. A total of 846 adults from four residential communities in high-risk areas (Wuhan city) and low-risk areas (Zhengzhou city) were invited to complete a set of Internet-based questionnaires measuring the adoption of preventive behaviors, appraisal of risk communication, anxiety level, and susceptibility to emotional contagion. At the baseline assessment (Wave 1), 58 withdrew from the study, and 788 (433 females) completed the questionnaires. At the Wave 2 survey, 318 (185 females) adults from Wave 1 were retained. The results from cross-lagged models demonstrated reciprocal negative associations between anxiety and risk communication and between the appraisal of risk communication and the adoption of preventive behaviors. In addition, a higher appraisal of risk communication in the initial period of the outbreak mitigated the respondents' susceptibility to emotional contagion later on. Susceptibility to emotional contagion was positively associated with preventive behaviors taken. Furthermore, multiple-group structural equation modeling suggested that risk communication was more likely to affect the susceptibility to emotional contagion of people on the frontline of the outbreak than people living in low-risk areas. This study demonstrated the importance of risk communication aimed at encouraging appropriate countermeasures against virus outbreaks.","Jin, Zheng; Zhao, Kai-bin; Xia, Yan-yu; Chen, Rui-jun; Yu, Huan; Tamunang Tamutana, Timothy; Yuan, Zheng; Shi, Yi-Ming; Adamseged, Hanna Yeshinegus; Kogay, Marina; Park, Gyun Yeol",Front Public Health,385,16

Differences in behaviour scale at various time points according to the sedation system used were established and compared using Mann–Whitney tests. RESULTS: This study showed that there is no difference in behaviour during dental care in YC after sedation. In PA, a significant difference in behaviour is only observed during local anaesthesia (p = 0.024).

Our framework takes advantage of the sparse vector technique (SVT), widely studied in the differential privacy literature. SVT incurs the privacy cost only when a condition (whether a quantity of interest is above/below a threshold) is met. If the condition is sparsely met during the repeated queries, SVT can drastically reduce the cumulative privacy loss, unlike the usual case where every query incurs the privacy loss. In ABC, the quantity of interest is the distance between observed and simulated data, and only when the distance is below a threshold can we take the corresponding prior sample as a posterior sample. Hence, applying SVT to ABC is an organic way to transform an ABC algorithm to a privacy-preserving variant with minimal modification, but yields the posterior samples with a high privacy level. We theoretically analyzed the interplay between the noise added for privacy and the accuracy of the posterior samples. We apply ABCDP to several data simulators and show the efficacy of the proposed framework.","Park, Mijung; Vinaroz, Margarita; Jitkrittum, Wittawat",Entropy (Basel),385,24

Both samples were obtained from necropsied wolves, with a prevalence rate of 4.9% (2/41). Sequence analysis of the full-length VP1 region showed that these strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) sequence identity (86.3-98.5%) to canine strains identified in the UK and Africa, and to kobuviruses that were previously detected in other African wild carnivores.

Planning for, and responses to, such events must include healthcare and other measures based on current evidence. An important area of infection prevention and control (IPC) is the optimal use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers (HCWs), including masks for protection against respiratory pathogens. Appropriate mask use during routine care is a forerunner to best practice in the event of an outbreak. However, little is known about the influences on decisions and behaviours of HCWs with respect to protective mask use when providing routine care. In this paper we argue that there is a need for more research to provide a better understanding of the decision-making and risk-taking behaviours of HCWs in respect of their use of masks for infectious disease prevention. Our argument is based on the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases; a need to strengthen workforce capability, capacity and education; the financial costs of healthcare and outbreaks; and the importance of social responsibility and supportive legislation in planning for global security.

Two new technologies – pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) and Big Data analytics – promise to improve our capacity to detect and control outbreaks earlier, saving lives and resources. However, routinely using these technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information could be perceived as intrusive and a threat to privacy. METHOD: making pathogen WGS and linked administrative data available for public health research; using this information in concert with data linkage and machine learning to enhance communicable disease surveillance systems. Fifty participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited by random-digit-dialling and topic-blinded social-media advertising. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence supporting different expert perspectives on the potential benefits and costs of technologically enhanced public health research and communicable disease surveillance and given the opportunity to question experts. RESULTS: Almost all jurors supported data linkage and WGS on routinely collected patient isolates for the purposes of public health research, provided standard de-identification practices were applied. However, allowing this information to be operationalised as a syndromic surveillance system was highly contentious with three juries voting in favour, and one against by narrow margins. For those in favour, support depended on several conditions related to system oversight and security being met. Those against were concerned about loss of privacy and did not trust Australian governments to run secure and effective systems. CONCLUSIONS: Participants across all four events strongly supported the introduction of data linkage and pathogenomics to public health research under current research governance structures. Combining pathogen WGS with event-based data surveillance systems, however, is likely to be controversial because of a lack of public trust, even when the potential public health benefits are clear. Any suggestion of private sector involvement or commercialisation of WGS or surveillance data was unanimously rejected.","Degeling, Chris; Carter, Stacy M.; van Oijen, Antoine M.; McAnulty, Jeremy; Sintchenko, Vitali; Braunack-Mayer, Annette; Yarwood, Trent; Johnson, Jane; Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.",BMC Med Ethics,385,24

This study aimed at observing whether the COVID-19 related lockdown influenced migraine frequency and disability in migraine patients on therapy with monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the CGRP pathway. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational cohort study, 147 consecutive patients receiving monthly administration of erenumab or galcanezumab were enrolled in four Italian headache centers. All patients filled a questionnaire concerning working and household settings, recent flu symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis, and family loss due to COVID-19 infection. Monthly migraine days (MMDs), monthly painkiller intake (MPI), and HIT-6 disability relative to the first month of lockdown imposition (T-lock) and the month before (T-free) were also collected. RESULTS: From T-free to T-lock, the cohort displayed a reduction in MMDs (from 10.5 ± 7.6 to 9.8 ± 7.6, p = .024) and HIT-6 scores (from 59.3 ± 8.3 men reduced MPI more frequently than women (p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Our study observed that the lockdown impact to 57.8 ± 8.8, p = .009), while MPI resulted unchanged (from 11.6 ± 11.5 to 11.1 ± 11.7; p = .114). MMDs, MPI, and HIT-6 variations from T-free to T-lock did not differ according to work settings or household. Patients beyond the first 3 months of therapy presented less often a reduction in MMDs (p = .006) and on everyday life did not affect the migraine load in patients receiving monoclonal antibodies inhibiting the CGRP pathway. Patients in the first months of therapy experienced a greater improvement according to drug pharmacokinetics, while women more frequently needed rescue medications, possibly indicating presenteeism or cephalalgophobia.","Altamura, Claudia; Cevoli, Sabina; Aurilia, Cinzia; Egeo, Gabriella; Fofi, Luisa; Torelli, Paola; Brunelli, Nicoletta; Pierangeli, Giulia; Favoni, Valentina; Fallacara, Adriana; Pensato, Umberto; Barbanti, Piero; Vernieri, Fabrizio",Neurol Sci,385,16

More than 40,000 matches before and during the pandemic, including more than 1,000 professional matches without spectators across the main European football leagues, have been analyzed. Results support the notion of a crowd-induced referee bias as the increased sanctioning of away teams disappears in the absence of spectators with regard to fouls (p < .001), yellow cards (p < .001), and red cards (p < .05). Moreover, the match dominance of home teams decreases significantly as indicated by shots (p < .001) and shots on target (p < .01). In terms of the home advantage itself, surprisingly, only a non-significant decrease is found. While the present paper supports prior research with regard to a crowd-induced referee bias, spectators thus do not seem to be the main driving factor of the home advantage. Results from amateur football, being naturally played in absence of a crowd, provide further evidence that the home advantage is predominantly caused by factors not directly or indirectly attributable to a noteworthy number of spectators.","Wunderlich, Fabian; Weigelt, Matthias; Rein, Robert; Memmert, Daniel",PLoS One,385,1

In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the key priority of infection control committees is to contain the dissemination of antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we aimed to timely recognize the emergence of CRAB in COVID-19 cases admitted to the wards of a tertiary referral hospital and to identify the genetic relatedness of the isolates. METHODS: From 30 March to 30 May 2020, a total of 242 clinical samples from COVID-19 cases were screened for CRAB isolates using standard microbiologic and antibiotic susceptibility tests. The PCRs targeting oxa23, oxa24, oxa58, bla(TEM) and bla(NDM-1) genes were performed. Two multiplex PCRs for identifying the global clones (GC) of A. baumannii were also performed. The sequence type of CRABs was determined using Institut Pasteur (IP) multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. RESULTS: Eighteen CRAB isolates were recovered from COVID-19 patients with the mean age of 63.94 ± 13.8 years. All but 4 COVID-19 patients co-infected with CRAB were suffering from an underlying disease. Death was recorded as the outcome in ICUs for 9 (50%) COVID-19 patients co-infected with CRAB. The CRAB isolates belong to GC2 and ST2(IP) and carried the oxa23 carbapenem resistance gene. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the co-infection of CRAB isolates and SARS-CoV-2 in the patients admitted to different ICUs at a referral hospital in Tehran. The CRAB isolates were found to belong to ST2(IP), share the oxa23 gene and to have caused several outbreaks in the wards admitting COVID-19 patients.","Abdollahi, Alireza; Aliramezani, Amir; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Norouzi Shadehi, Mahsa; Ghourchian, Sedighe; Douraghi, Masoumeh",BMC Infect Dis,385,26

Therefore, antibodies produced in COVID-19 and SARS patients should not be that dissimilar. We evaluated SARS-CoV test assays to detect for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and tried to determine the timing of appearance of these antibodies by testing serial sera from these patients. Methods: Tests were carried out using ELISA (total antibodies) and indirect immunofluorescence (IIFA) (IgM & IgG) methods on serial sera from patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results: Cross-reactivity was seen in these two test assays with sera from COVID-19 patients and was detected in 6 out of 7 patients from 7 days after onset of symptoms. Five of the patients had detectable antibodies by the 3rd week into their illness and there was evidence of seroconversion in 4 patients. The IIFA method was marginally more sensitive compared to the ELISA assay, however the IIFA IgM test was not useful in the early phase of the illness with poor sensitivity. Conclusions: Existing diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV can detect antibodies in patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. These assays maybe be utilized as an interim measure in epidemiological investigations for contact tracing and to determine the extent of community spread of this new emerging virus pending the availability of specific serology tests for SARS-CoV-2.","Wan, Wei Yee; Lim, Siew Hoon; Seng, Eng Hong",,385,13
