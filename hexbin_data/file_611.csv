11214,"Self-compassion as a Stress Moderator: A Cross-sectional Study of 1700 Doctors, Nurses, and Medical Students",2020-02-11,"OBJECTIVES: Health care professionals have elevated rates of burnout and compassion fatigue which are correlated with poorer quality of life and patient care, and inversely correlated with self-compassion. Primary studies have evaluated the extent to which mindfulness-based interventions increase self-compassion with contradictory findings. A meta-analytic review of the literature was conducted to quantitatively synthesize the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on self-compassion among health care professionals. METHODS: Twenty-eight treatment outcome studies were identified eligible for inclusion. Five cumulative effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models to evaluate differences of changes in self-compassion for treatment and control groups. Within and between group comparisons were evaluated. Sub-group and moderator analyses were conducted to explore potential moderating variables. RESULTS: Twenty-seven articles (k = 29, N = 1020) were utilized in the pre-post-treatment meta-analysis. Fifteen samples (52%) included health care professionals and fourteen (48%) professional health care students. Results showed a moderate effect size between pre-post-treatment comparisons (g = .61, 95% CI = .47 to .76) for self-compassion and a strong effect size for pre-treatment to follow-up (g = .76, 95% CI = .41 to 1.12). The effect size comparing post-treatment versus post-control was moderate. One exploratory moderator analysis was significant, with stronger effects for interventions with a retreat component. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest mindfulness-based interventions improve self-compassion in health care professionals. Additionally, a variety of mindfulness-based programs may be useful for employees and trainees. Future studies with rigorous methodology evaluating effects on self-compassion and patient care from mindfulness-based interventions are warranted to extend findings and explore moderators.

14119,Requirement of a prompt solution to address infection and mortality due to COVID-19 among Peruvian physicians,2020-10-14,"Affordable and effective antiviral therapies are needed worldwide, especially against agents such as dengue virus that are endemic in underserved regions. Many antiviral compounds have been studied in cultured cells but are unsuitable for clinical applications due to pharmacokinetic profiles, side effects, or inconsistent efficacy across dengue serotypes. Such tool compounds can, however, aid in identifying clinically useful treatments. Here, computational screening (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures) was used to identify entries in an in silico database of safe-in-human compounds (SWEETLEAD) that display high chemical similarities to known inhibitors of dengue virus. Inhibitors of the dengue proteinase NS2B/3, the dengue capsid, and the host autophagy pathway were used as query compounds. Three FDA-approved compounds that resemble the tool molecules structurally, cause little toxicity, and display strong antiviral activity in cultured cells were selected for further analysis. Pyrimethamine (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 1.2 μM), like the dengue proteinase inhibitor ARDP0006 to which it shows structural similarity, inhibited intramolecular NS2B/3 cleavage. Lack of toxicity early in infection allowed testing in mice, in which pyrimethamine also reduced viral loads. Niclosamide (IC(50) = 0.28 μM), like dengue core inhibitor ST-148, affected structural components of the virion and inhibited early processes during infection. Vandetanib (IC(50) = 1.6 μM), like cellular autophagy inhibitor spautin-1, blocked viral exit from cells and could be shown to extend survival in vivo. Thus, three FDA-approved compounds with promising utility for repurposing to treat dengue virus infections and their potential mechanisms were identified using computational tools and minimal phenotypic screening.","Moshiri, Jasmine; Constant, David A.; Liu, Bowen; Mateo, Roberto; Kearnes, Steven; Novick, Paul; Prasad, Ritika; Nagamine, Claude; Pande, Vijay; Kirkegaard, Karla",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667029/,611

15275,Retention Strategies for Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Adults: A Rapid Evidence Review,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND: Low-intensity self-guided mental health interventions that are delivered on the web may meet the needs and preferences of adults with mild to moderate symptoms. However, few clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of self-guided transdiagnostic interventions within a naturalistic setting. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) tests the effectiveness of the video-based transdiagnostic intervention FitMindKit in reducing depression symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety symptoms, disability, and suicidal ideation, relative to an attention-matched control condition called HealthWatch. METHODS: The RCT was conducted with adults living in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. Participants (n=1986) were recruited through the web using social media advertisements, screened for psychological distress, and then randomized to receive one of two 4-week programs: FitMindKit (12-module psychotherapy intervention) or HealthWatch (12-module program providing general health information). Participants were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks postbaseline. To maintain the ecological validity of the trial, participants completed brief assessments and interventions without direct researcher contact or incentives. RESULTS: Mixed model repeated-measures analyses of variance demonstrated that FitMindKit significantly improved depression symptoms (F(1,701.7)=3.97; P=.047), along with panic symptoms (F(1,706.5)=5.59; P=.02) and social anxiety symptoms (F(1,680.0)=12.37; P<.001), relative to the attention control condition. There were no significant effects on other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Self-guided transdiagnostic interventions can be beneficial when delivered directly to end users through the internet. Despite low adherence and small effect sizes, the availability of such interventions is likely to fill a critical gap in the accessibility of mental health services for the community.

16688,Evidence of the effect of primary care expansion on hospitalizations: Panel analysis of 143 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon,2021-04-08,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a course of action that enables a polarized epithelial cell to undertake numerous biochemical alterations that allow it to adopt features of mesenchymal cells such as high migratory ability, invasive properties, resistance to apoptosis, and importantly higher-order formation of extracellular matrix elements. EMT has important roles in implantation and gastrulation of the embryo, inflammatory reactions and fibrosis, and transformation of cancer cells, their invasiveness and metastatic ability. Regarding the importance of EMT in the invasive progression of cancer, this process has been well studies in in this context. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been shown to exert critical function in the regulation of cellular processes that are involved in the EMT. These processes include regulation of some transcription factors namely SNAI1 and SNAI2, ZEB1 and ZEB2, Twist, and E12/E47, modulation of chromatin configuration, alternative splicing, and protein stability and subcellular location of proteins. In the present paper, we describe the influence of ncRNAs including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs in the EMT process and their application as biomarkers for this process and cancer progression and their potential as therapeutic targets.","Hussen, Bashdar Mahmud; Shoorei, Hamed; Mohaqiq, Mahdi; Dinger, Marcel E.; Hidayat, Hazha Jamal; Taheri, Mohammad; Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8033041/,611
16872,Effects of illness perceptions on health-related quality of life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in China,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Enhancing medical students’ practice of patient-centered care is a goal of medical schools. In addition to exploring the demographic and academic factors of the students, it is necessary to identify other attitudes and perceptions that may influence the student’s patient-centered attitude and inclination toward communication skill learning. This study aimed to assess patient-centered attitudes among dental students in Korea and identify the association between the students’ characteristics and empathy, communication skill learning attitude, and patient-centered attitude. METHODS: Data were collected via a cross-sectional online survey, and 312 dental students were included in the analyses. The study participants completed the Patient–Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS), the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), and the Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS). Analyses were performed using independent samples’ t-tests, hierarchical multi-variable regression, and ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test. RESULTS: The students tend to be moderately patient-oriented toward the sharing subscale of PPOS score (M = 3.78, standard deviation [SD] = 0.54) and slightly more patient-centered toward the caring subscale of PPOS score (M = 4.41, SD = 0.52) of patient-centered attitudes. Being a female and a shorter academic period in dentistry were associated with attitudes toward patient-centered care. Empathy and positive attitude toward learning communication skills were also related to a patient-centered attitude, and among aspects of empathy, “empathic concern” had the greatest significant impact on patient-centered attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, academic period, empathy, and attitudes on learning communication skills were important influencing factors of patient-centered attitudes. Patient-centered attitude can and must be taught. Education programs should focus on enhancing empathy, emphasizing positive attitudes on learning communication skills, and conducting follow-up educational sessions to prevent students from becoming less patient-centered with an increase in duration of their academic period.

17153,Development and evaluation of the Good Grief program for young people bereaved by familial cancer,2021-04-29,"PURPOSE: Childhood malnutrition is a multifactorial disease, responsible for nearly half of all deaths in children under five. Lately, the probable association of a dysbiotic gut to malnutrition is also being eagerly investigated. The current study is an attempt to investigate this purported association through assessing the abundance of major gut bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria), probionts (Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus), butyrogens (Faecalibacterium and Roseburia) and pathogens (Escherichia and Klebsiella). METHODS: The study was conducted in the suburbs of Chandigarh, India in the year 2017. The children enrolled in the study were part of Anganwadis (Rural Child Care Centres) set up under Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) of Government of India where community-based management approach is being widely used for treatment of malnutrition. We used qPCR based absolute quantification as well as the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach for our study. The study population included 30 children in the age group of 2–5 years who were categorized into three groups Healthy, Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), with 10 children in each group. The selection of participants was made based on Z scores. Further, statistical tools like the One-way ANOVA, PCA and PLSDA were employed to analyze and compare the gut bacterial profile. RESULTS: Our investigation through the qPCR (Absolute quantification) approach revealed a significantly higher abundance of Actinobacteria in healthy, in comparison to children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). Consequently, the same trend was also reflected with respect to Bifidobacterium, a prominent member of the Actinobacteria phylum. Conversely, a significant higher abundance of Lactobacillus with the diminishing nutritional status was recorded. Escherichia showed a significant higher abundance in healthy subjects compared to the malnourished; however, no such difference in abundance of Klebsiella was observed. The other target phyla [Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria] and genera (Faecalibacterium and Roseburia) showed differences in abundance; however, these were non-significant. Similarly, the bacterial taxonomy analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data revealed the higher abundance of phylum Actinobacteria and its member Bifidobacterium with lower prevalence of Lactobacillus in healthy children. CONCLUSION: The pattern of gut microbiota profile in malnourished subjects suggests a dysbiotic gut depleted in Bifidobacteria, a core member of the consortia of beneficial anaerobes of the healthy child gut.

17160,Advancing a cascading train-the-trainer model of frontline HIV service providers in South Africa: protocol of an implementation trial,2021-04-30,"Currently, the Milwaukee protocol presents healing results in human beings affected by the rabies virus. However, there are many points to clarify on the action of drugs and the immune mechanism involved in the evolution of the disease. One of the drugs used is biopterin, which is an important cofactor for nitric oxide, important for preventing vasospasm. Thus, we describe the effect of biopterin on some inflammatory factors in a rabies virus infection developed in an animal model. The immunological mediators studied in animals infected with rabies virus submitted to doses of sapropterin were Anti-RABV, IL-6, IL-2, IL-17a, INF-gamma and Anti-iNOS. It is suggested that the medication in the context of a RABV infection already installed, had the effect of modulating the inflammatory mechanisms mainly linked to the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the migration of cytotoxic cells.","Brito, Caio Vinicius Botelho; Rodrigues, Érika Dayane Leal; Martins, Fernanda Monik Silva; Tavares, Lavinia Dias; Lima, André Luis de Sousa Nogueira; Ferreira, Lucas Carvalho; Santana, Carlos Junior Lopes; de Brito, João Augusto Gomes de Souza Monteiro; Casseb, Lívia Medeiros Neves; Diniz, José Antonio Picanço",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8046507/,611

The relationship between personality and death coping self-efficacy (DCS) has rarely been investigated in the palliative care setting. In this study, we explored the associations between different personality profiles and DCS in clinical nurses from general wards and ICU. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 572 Chinese nurses was conducted between August and September 2020, by way of a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Among the Big Five Personality Traits, in nurses the score was highest for conscientiousness and lowest for neuroticism. With regard to DCS, nurses scored highly on the intention of hospice care. The Big Five Personality Traits were found to explain 20.2% of the overall variation in DCS. Openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness were significantly associated with DCS in nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing managers should pay attention to differences in personality characteristics and provide personalized and targeted nursing education. This should improve nurses’ DCS, enrich their professional development and promote high quality palliative care for patients and their families.","Lin, Xi; Li, Xiaoqing; Liu, Qing; Shao, Shengwen; Xiang, Weilan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8158956/,611
18265,Health-related quality of life and its predictors among adults living with HIV/AIDS and receiving antiretroviral therapy in Pakistan,2021-02-13,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant progress with antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy, a substantial fraction of metastatic melanoma patients show upfront therapy resistance. Biomarkers for outcome are missing and the association of baseline immune function and clinical outcome remains to be determined. We assessed the in vitro nonspecific stimulation of immune response at baseline and during anti-PD-1 therapy for metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients received nivolumab and radiotherapy as part of the multicentric phase II trial NIRVANA (NCT02799901). The levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines on in vitro non-specific stimulation of innate and adaptive immune cells were measured in patient sera before treatment, and at week 2 and week 6 after the beginning of the treatment, and correlated with tumorous response, progression-free survival (PFS) and occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The results in melanoma patients were compared with those of a cohort of 9 sex and age-matched healthy donors. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were enrolled in this ancillary study. Median follow-up was 16 months (2.2–28.4). The 12-month PFS rate was 67.7%. The incidence of irAEs of any grade was 58.8%. Without in vitro stimulation no differences in cytokines levels were observed between responders and non-responders. On in vitro stimulation, metastatic patients had lower Th1 cytokine levels than healthy donors at baseline for tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (1136 pg/mL vs 5558 pg/mL, p<0.0001; and 3894 pg/mL vs 17 129 pg/mL, p=0.02, respectively). Responders exhibited increasing cytokine levels from baseline to week 6. Non-responders had lower interleukin 17A (IL-17A) levels at baseline than responders (7 pg/mL vs 32 pg/mL, p=0.03), and lower IFN-γ levels at week 6 (3.3 ng/mL vs 14.5 ng/mL, p=0.03). A lower level of IL-17A at week 2 and a lower level of IFN-γ at week 6 correlated with worse PFS (p=0.04 and p=0.04 respectively). At baseline, patients who developed irAEs had higher IL-6 levels (19.3 ng/mL vs 9.2 ng/mL, p=0.03) and higher IL-17A levels (52.5 pg/mL vs 2.5 pg/mL, p=0.009) than those without irAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that cytokine levels after in vitro non-specific stimulation could be a promising biomarker to predict the outcome of PD-1 inhibition therapy.","Gérard, Alexandre; Doyen, Jerome; Cremoni, Marion; Bailly, Laurent; Zorzi, Kevin; Ruetsch-Chelli, Caroline; Brglez, Vesna; Picard-Gauci, Alexandra; Troin, Laura; Esnault, Vincent L.M.; Passeron, Thierry; Montaudié, Henri; Seitz-Polski, Barbara",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183201/,611

In our previous work, we described the protein expression profiles of umbilical artery tissues from patients with preeclampsia. METHODS: To gain insights into the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in adult rats born to preeclamptic dams, we analyzed thoracic aorta tissues by using iTRAQ isobaric tags and 2D nano LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: By using the iTRAQ method, we analyzed 1825 proteins, of which 106 showed significantly different expression in the thoracic aortic. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were associated with cardiovascular function. Further analysis indicated that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is inhibited by miR-423-5p and activated by TP53, had the strongest effect on cardiovascular function. The expression of G6PD was upregulated in thoracic aorta tissues, as confirmed by Western blotting. The expression of two other vascular function-related proteins, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) and tubulin alpha-4 A (TUBA4A), was upregulated, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (MS).

First, the entrepreneurial ability of new entrepreneurial talents is analyzed, and the feasibility of improving the entrepreneurial ability of new entrepreneurial talents is verified. Second, the architecture is designed for improving the entrepreneurial ability of new entrepreneurial talents. About 350 employees in 20 ventures in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province are randomly selected as the subjects for a questionnaire survey (QS). Three-fifty questionnaires are distributed and 300 are collected. Descriptive statistics are used to analyze the 300 valid questionnaires. Then, the relationship between the psychological states of new entrepreneurial talents and their entrepreneurial ability is explored, and the influencing factors in the development of new entrepreneurial talents are analyzed. The results show that the number of employees in most ventures is between 250 and 400 and the age of the employees in the tested new ventures is between 35 and 40. More than one-third of employees are managers and over 86% of them have a degree of bachelor or above. The scores of the scale of the psychological state of new entrepreneurs are high. This shows that most of the new entrepreneurs have a high educational level, strong motivation for entrepreneurial success, and great self-confidence, which are essential in the process of innovative training.

The aim of this study is to identify clinically available predictors that distinguish between two phenotypes of fatal ARDS due to pneumonia. In total, 104 cases of Japanese patients with pneumonia-induced ARDS were extracted from our prospectively collected database. Fatal cases were divided into early (< 7 days after diagnosis) and late (≥ 7 days) death groups, and clinical variables and prognostic factors were statistically evaluated. Of the 50 patients who died within 180 days, 18 (36%) and 32 (64%) were in the early (median 2 days, IQR [1, 5]) and late (median 16 days, IQR [13, 29]) death groups, respectively. According to multivariate regression analyses, the APACHE II score (HR 1.25, 95%CI 1.12–1.39, p < 0.001) and the disseminated intravascular coagulation score (HR 1.54, 95%CI 1.15–2.04, p = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors for early death.

46466,Systematic evaluation of content and quality of English and German pain apps in European app stores,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Despite the various strategies undertaken in the clinical practice, the mortality rate due to antibiotic-resistant microbes has been markedly increasing worldwide. In addition to multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes, the “ESKAPE” bacteria are also emerging. Of course, the infection caused by ESKAPE cannot be treated even with lethal doses of antibiotics. Now, the drug resistance is also more prevalent in antiviral, anticancer, antimalarial and antifungal chemotherapies. MAIN BODY: To date, in the literature, the quantum of research reported on the discovery strategies for new antibiotics is remarkable but the milestone is still far away. Considering the need of the updated strategies and drug discovery approaches in the area of drug resistance among researchers, in this communication, we consolidated the insights pertaining to new drug development against drug-resistant microbes. It includes drug discovery void, gene paradox, transposon mutagenesis, vitamin biosynthesis inhibition, use of non-conventional media, host model, target through quorum sensing, genomic-chemical network, synthetic viability to targets, chemical versus biological space, combinational approach, photosensitization, antimicrobial peptides and transcriptome profiling. Furthermore, we optimally briefed about antievolution drugs, nanotheranostics and antimicrobial adjuvants and then followed by twelve selected new feasible drug targets for new drug design against drug resistance. Finally, we have also tabulated the chemical structures of potent molecules against antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSION: It is highly recommended to execute the anti-drug resistance research as integrated approach where both molecular and genetic research needs to be as integrative objective of drug discovery. This is time to accelerate new drug discovery research with advanced genetic approaches instead of conventional blind screening.","Peraman, Ramalingam; Sure, Sathish Kumar; Dusthackeer, V. N.

Knowledge graphs are powerful and flexible tools for information integration and supported by a set of standardized vocabularies and languages (the “Sematic Web” toolset). In this work, we discuss the application of knowledge graphs to develop and analyze an analytical computing infrastructure for a dynamic network monitoring system. As a typical dynamic network, a multiservice telecommunication network is considered. The presented system combines static models of a telecommunication network and dynamic monitoring data and makes it possible to obtain complex analytical reports using SPARQL queries over the knowledge graph. Those reports are of crucial importance to network stakeholders for improving the network services and performance. First, we analyze problems solved by traditional monitoring systems, and identify the classes of problems such systems cannot solve. Then we propose an analytical monitoring system architecture based on knowledge graphs to address these classes of problems. We present the system structure and detailed descriptions of the ontological and mathematical models of the resulting knowledge graph. In order to test the architecture discussed, we create an example task of the analytical monitoring system and analyze system performance depending on the size of the knowledge graph. The results of the analysis are presented using a number of SPARQL queries.","Kulikov, Igor; Wohlgenannt, Gerhard; Shichkina, Yulia; Zhukova, Nataly",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974954/,611

Pilot whales are social, intelligent, and communicative animals that demonstrate complex social behaviors. Therefore, this traditional whaling method should be considered as a procedure in which animals are exposed to high levels of distress. In the context of contemporary civilizational development and material welfare, the practice of whaling may appear to be an inadequate and cruel relic of the past. This text explores social and cultural issues caused by pilot whale hunts and presents an understanding of the term tradition and some perspectives of how traditions change. The specificity of pilot whales as a species is presented, setting a foundation for a discussion about hunting itself. The conclusion of the text discusses different social perceptions of grindadráp by presenting arguments for and against the hunting. This analysis includes a presentation of actions undertaken bywhale hunting opponents.","Mamzer, Hanna Maria",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062700/,611

METHODS We performed a nation-wide electronic survey asking nurses in the emergency departments in Denmark, Norway and Sweden about their experience treating children in pain. RESULTS Responses from 103 Danish, Norwegian and Swedish nurses were included (79% response rate). Physical restraint was reported used at 79% [70.0-85.9] (N = 78) of the surveyed departments (DK: 96%, NO: 67%, SE: 77%) with two participants reporting daily use of physical restraint. Paracetamol was available at all departments and used most frequently. Sedation was available at 88% [78.8-92.0] of the departments with midazolam as the most recurrent sedative (83%, [74.8-89.4]). Seventy-three percent of respondents reported a need for better treatments. Lack of education was the most frequently reported obstacle for providing both pain treatment (29%) and sedation (43%) followed by lack of guidelines. CONCLUSION Physical restraint of children during painful procedures is used in the majority of Scandinavian emergency departments (79%).

We aimed to analyse and compare plan quality and treatment time between flattened beam (FB) and flattening-filter-free (FFF) beam to assess the efficacy of FFF beam for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The search strategy was based around 3 concepts; radiation therapy, flattening-filter-free and treatment delivery. The years searched were restricted from 2010 to date of review (October 2015). All plan quality comparisons were between FFF and FB plans from the same data sets. We identified 210 potential studies based on the three searched concepts. All articles were screened by two authors for title and abstract and by three authors for full text. Ten studies met the eligibility criteria. Plan quality was evaluated using conformity index (CI), heterogeneity index (HI) and gradient index (GI). Dose to organs-at-risk (OAR) and healthy tissues were compared. Differences between beam-on-time (BOT) and treatment time (T × T) were also analysed. Normalized percentage ratios of CI and HI demonstrated no clinical differences among the studied articles. GI displayed small variations between the articles favouring FFF beam. The BOT with FFF is substantially reduced, and appears to impact the frequency of intra-fraction imaging which, in turn, affects total treatment time. Based on planning tumour volume (PTV) coverage, dose to OAR and healthy tissue sparing, FFF beam is clinically effective for the treatment of cancer patients using SBRT. We recommend the use of FFF beam for SBRT based on these factors and the reported overall treatment time reduction.","Dang, Thu M; Peters, Mitchell J; Hickey, Brigid; Semciw, Adam",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.12583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28116813/,611

The occurrence of ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a serious cardiac manifestation of COVID-19; the intrinsic mechanism of coronary thrombosis appears to still be unknown. Objective To determine the role of NETs in coronary thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain, who underwent primary coronary interventions for STEMI in which coronary aspirates were obtained in the catheterization laboratory using a thrombus aspiration device. Patients with COVID-19 who experienced a STEMI between March 23 and April 11, 2020, from whom coronary thrombus samples were aspirated during primary coronary intervention, were included in the analysis. These patients were compared with a series conducted from July 2015 to December 2015 of patients with STEMI. Main Outcomes and Measures The presence and quantity of NETs in coronary aspirates from patients with STEMI and COVID-19. The method for the analysis of NETs in paraffin-embedded coronary thrombi was based on the use of confocal microscopy technology and image analysis for the colocalization of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3. Immunohistochemical analysis of thrombi was also performed. Clinical and angiographic variables were prospectively collected. Results Five patients with COVID-19 were included (4 men [80%]; mean [SD] age, 62 [14] years); the comparison group included 50 patients (44 males [88%]; mean [SD] age, 58 [12] years). NETs were detected in the samples of all 5 patients with COVID-19, and the median density of NETs was 61% (95% CI, 43%-91%). In the historical series of patients with STEMI, NETs were found in 34 of 50 thrombi (68%), and the median NET density was 19% (95% CI, 13%-22%; P < .001). All thrombi from patients with COVID-19 were composed of fibrin and polymorphonuclear cells. None of them showed fragments of atherosclerotic plaque or iron deposits indicative of previous episodes of plaque rupture. Conclusions and Relevance In this small case series of patients with COVID-19 and myocardial infarction, NETs seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of STEMI in COVID-19 disease. Our findings support the idea that targeting intravascular NETs might be a relevant goal of treatment and a feasible way to prevent coronary thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Blasco, Ana; Coronado, María-José; Hernández-Terciado, Fernando; Martín, Paloma; Royuela, Ana; Ramil, Elvira; García, Diego; Goicolea, Javier; Del Trigo, María; Ortega, Javier; Escudier, Juan M; Silva, Lorenzo; Bellas, Carmen",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.7308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372956/,611

This work has been carried out to test for validity. METHODS A total of 746 patients who were identified from a prospective rectal cancer database underwent sphincter-preserving anterior resection of the rectum between October 2001 and January 2011. The incidence and severity of AL was determined using the criteria established by the ISREC. Patients with AL were categorized according to the ISREC scheme. The clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared between the groups. RESULTS The overall AL rate was 7.5% (56/746). The 56 patients with AL were distributed among the different groups as follows: Grade A, 16%; grade B, 23%; and grade C, 61%. Compared with the grade A patients, grades B and C patients had significantly elevated serum C-reactive protein levels (P < .01). None of the grade A patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Their further hospital stay was uneventful. The length of stay in the ICU was significantly longer for grade C patients compared with grade B patients (P < .001). The median hospital stay of grade C patients was significantly longer than that of grades A and B patients (P < .001). CONCLUSION The definition and severity grading of AL after anterior resection of the rectum proposed by the ISREC provides a simple, easily applicable, and valid classification. Using this classification system may facilitate comparison of results from different studies on AL after sphincter-preserving rectal surgery.","Kulu, Yakup; Ulrich, Alexis; Bruckner, Thomas; Contin, Pietro; Welsch, Thilo; Rahbari, Nuh N; Büchler, Markus W; Weitz, Jürgen",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2013.02.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23623834/,611

The purpose of this study was to analyze children's lower limb joint angles and impact force during single-leg landings (SLL) in different types of jumping sports using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). (2) Methods: Thirty children (53.33% girls, M = 10.16 years-old, standard deviation (SD) = 1.52) divided into three groups (gymnastics, volleyball and control) participated in the study. The participants were asked to do SLLs with the dominant lower limb (barefoot) on a force plate from a height of 25 cm. The vertical ground reaction force (GRF) and lower limb joint angles were assessed. SPM{F} one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and SPM{t} unpaired t-tests were performed during the landing and stability phases. (3) Results: A significant main effect was found in the landing phase of jumping sport practice in GRF and joint angles. During the stability phase, this effect was exhibited in ankle and knee joint angles. (4) Conclusions: Evidence was obtained of the influence of practicing a specific sport in childhood. Child volleyball players performed SLL with lower impact force and higher knee flexion than child gymnasts. Training in specific jumping sports (i.e., volleyball and gymnastics) could affect the individual capacity to adapt SLL execution.","Estevan, Isaac; Monfort-Torres, Gonzalo; Farana, Roman; Zahradnik, David; Jandacka, Daniel; García-Massó, Xavier",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899167/,611

The study is aimed at exploring the clinical significance of INHBB in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) by bioinformatics analysis. Methods Real-time PCR and analyses of Oncomine, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were utilized to evaluate the INHBB gene transcription level of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. We evaluated the INHBB methylation level and the relationship between expression and methylation levels of CpG islands in CRC tissue. The corresponding clinical data were obtained to further explore the association of INHBB with clinical and survival features. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the gene ontology and signaling pathways of INHBB involved. Results INHBB expression was elevated in CRC tissue. Although the promoter of INHBB was hypermethylated in CRC, methylation did not ultimately correlate with the expression of INHBB. Overexpression of INHBB was significantly and positively associated with invasion depth, distant metastasis, and TNM stage. Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that high expression of INHBB was correlated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). GSEA showed that INHBB was closely correlated with 5 cancer-promoting signaling pathways including the Hedgehog signaling pathway, ECM receptor interaction, TGF-β signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and pathway in cancer. INHBB expression significantly promoted macrophage infiltration and inhibited memory T cell, mast cell, and dendritic cell infiltration. INHBB expression was positively correlated with stromal and immune scores of CRC samples. Conclusion INHBB might be a potential prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for CRC.","Yuan, Jinpeng; Xie, Aosi; Cao, Qiangjian; Li, Xinxin; Chen, Juntian",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6909672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083477/,611

Much of the work that has been done on disaster risk analysis has focused primarily on preparedness and recovery strategies for disrupted infrastructure systems. The reliability of systems such as transportation, electric power, and telecommunications is crucial in sustaining business processes, supply chains, and regional livelihoods, as well as ensuring the availability of vital services in the aftermath of disasters. There has been a growing momentum in recognizing workforce criticality in the aftermath of disasters; nevertheless, significant gaps still remain in modeling, assessing, and managing workforce disruptions and their associated ripple effects to other interdependent systems. The workforce plays a pivotal role in ensuring that a disrupted region continues to function and subsequently recover from the adverse effects of disasters.

Substantial efforts have been made to develop innovative medical options for treating these gynecologic diseases. Elagolix and relugolix have been approved in some countries for treating endometriosis and uterine myomas, respectively; however, linzagolix (OBE 2109, KLH 2109) is a new oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist in phase II-III trials. Treatment options for women with contraindications for certain hormonal therapies or who refuse particular options, are the driving force behind the development of new drugs in this area. AREA COVERED This drug evaluation highlights definitive and preliminary results from previous and ongoing studies of linzagolix for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine myomas. EXPERT OPINION Linzagolix showed a dose-dependent and rapidly reversible action on the pituitary-gonadal axis. In a recent phase II trial (EDELWEISS), linzagolix significantly reduced pain related to endometriosis and improved quality of life at single daily doses of 75-200 mg. The preliminary results of international, double-blind phase III trials (PRIMROSE 1 and 2) reported its efficacy in treating heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine myomas with a good safety profile. Further studies will determine the necessity of add-back therapy during long-term use of linzagolix.","Dababou, Susan; Garzon, Simone; Laganà, Antonio Simone; Ferrero, Simone; Evangelisti, Giulio; Noventa, Marco; D'Alterio, Maurizio Nicola; Palomba, Stefano; Uccella, Stefano; Franchi, Massimo; Barra, Fabio",Expert opinion on investigational drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543784.2021.1957830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34278887/,611

However, the contribution of the innate immune response to allograft rejection in a model of viral-induced neurological disease has not been well defined. Herein, we demonstrate that the natural killer (NK) cell-expressing-activating receptor NKG2D participates in transplanted allogeneic NPC rejection in mice persistently infected with JHMV. Cultured NPCs derived from C57BL/6 (H-2(b) ) mice express the NKG2D ligand retinoic acid early precursor transcript (RAE)-1 but expression was dramatically reduced upon differentiation into either glia or neurons. RAE-1(+) NPCs were susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing whereas RAE-1(-) cells were resistant to lysis. Transplantation of C57BL/6-derived NPCs into JHMV-infected BALB/c (H-2(d) ) mice resulted in infiltration of NKG2D(+) CD49b(+) NK cells and treatment with blocking antibody specific for NKG2D increased survival of allogeneic NPCs. Furthermore, transplantation of differentiated RAE-1(-) allogeneic NPCs into JHMV-infected BALB/c mice resulted in enhanced survival, highlighting a role for the NKG2D/RAE-1 signaling axis in allograft rejection. We also demonstrate that transplantation of allogeneic NPCs into JHMV-infected mice resulted in infection of the transplanted cells suggesting that these cells may be targets for infection. Viral infection of cultured cells increased RAE-1 expression, resulting in enhanced NK cell-mediated killing through NKG2D recognition. Collectively, these results show that in a viral-induced demyelination model, NK cells contribute to rejection of allogeneic NPCs through an NKG2D signaling pathway.","Weinger, Jason G; Plaisted, Warren C; Maciejewski, Sonia M; Lanier, Lewis L; Walsh, Craig M; Lane, Thomas E",Stem cells,https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.1760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898518/,611
70044,"Access, Equity, and Neutral Space: Telehealth Beyond the Pandemic.",2021,"BACKGROUND The application of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) to splenectomy is still challenging with much room for technical improvement. The purpose of this study was to describe the tug-exposure technique, an innovative technique for performing safe single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy (SILS-Sp). METHODS We performed SILS-Sp in ten consecutive adult patients with a variety of pathology requiring total splenectomy. A SILS™ Port with three 5-mm trocars was placed in the umbilicus as a single-access site. A flexible 5-mm laparoscope and an articulating grasper were used in addition to standard laparoscopic equipment. A cloth tape was introduced intraperitoneally to encircle and tug the splenic hilum. Both ends of the tape were extracted through an extra needle hole in the skin. Pulling the tape in appropriate directions provided excellent exposure of the splenic hilum (the tug-exposure technique). Under sufficient tension and exposure by tugging the spleen, a linear stapler was introduced for stapling and dividing the splenic hilum and the splenic artery and vein. The spleen was extracted through the umbilical wound within a retrieval bag. The umbilical wound was closed with subcutaneous sutures. RESULTS The tug-exposure technique was successfully used in all patients and markedly improved the exposure of the splenic hilum during SILS-Sp. The median intraoperative blood loss was 15 (range 0-1,000) ml. Only one patient (10%) required conversion to open surgery. Median operative time was 230 (range, 150-378) min, the median extracted spleen weight was 260 (range, 100-580) g, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 (range, 4-9) days. All patients were discharged uneventfully. The umbilical incision was nearly invisible at the 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The tug-exposure technique is an innovative technique that enables easy and safe SILS splenectomy by experienced surgeons.","Misawa, Takeyuki; Sakamoto, Taro; Ito, Ryusuke; Shiba, Hiroaki; Gocho, Takeshi; Wakiyama, Shigeki; Ishida, Yuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1697-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21512877/,611
70523,A protocol for a scoping review of equity measurement in mental health care for children and youth.,2020-10-07,"CONTEXT Myocarditis is a known cause of death in athletes. As we consider clearance of athletes to participate in sports during the COVID-19 pandemic, we offer a brief review of the myocardial effects of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) through the lens of what is known about myocarditis and exercise. All athletes should be queried about any recent illness suspicious for COVID-19 prior to sports participation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The PubMed database was evaluated through 2020, with the following keywords: myocarditis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cardiac, and athletes. Selected articles identified through the primary search, along with position statements from around the world, and the relevant references from those articles, were reviewed for pertinent clinical information regarding the identification, evaluation, risk stratification, and management of myocarditis in patients, including athletes, with and without SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level 3. RESULTS Since myocarditis can present with a variety of symptoms, and can be asymptomatic, the sports medicine physician needs to have a heightened awareness of athletes who may have had COVID-19 and be at risk for myocarditis and should have a low threshold to obtain further cardiovascular testing. Symptomatic athletes with SARS-CoV-2 may require cardiac evaluation including an electrocardiogram and possibly an echocardiogram. Athletes with cardiomyopathy may benefit from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the recovery phase and, rarely, endocardial biopsy. CONCLUSION Myocarditis is a known cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes. The currently reported rates of cardiac involvement of COVID-19 makes myocarditis a risk, and physicians who clear athletes for participation in sport as well as sideline personnel should be versed with the diagnosis, management, and clearance of athletes with suspected myocarditis. Given the potentially increased risk of arrhythmias, sideline personnel should practice their emergency action plans and be comfortable using an automated external defibrillator.","Raukar, Neha P; Cooper, Leslie T",Sports health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941738120974747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201768/,611

Online questionnaires and telephone interviews were combined to investigate the physical activity (PA) participation and PARI occurrences every two weeks. Totally, 84 college students (men: 49; women: 35) with a mean age of 19.4 years completed the entire 1-year follow-up. Overall, 14250.3 PA exposure hours were collected and 36 PARI episodes were reported by 26 students, with an injury incidence density of 2.53 injuries per 1000 PA exposure hours and an injury risk of 0.43 injuries/student/year. July to September accounted for a highest proportion of injuries and half of the injuries happened in the evening. The majority of injuries occurred outdoors, happened in non-contact activities, were acute and involved the lower limbs, with sprains and strains being the primary injury types. Of all injuries, 80.6% resulted in PA withdrawal immediately and 58.3% led to absence from the next planned PA. No significant difference was found between men and women. This study reveals the problem of PARI among college students, which provides the direction for the prevention of PARI in this population.","Tang, Dongchun; Cai, Weicong; Gao, Yang; Chen, Shangmin; Li, Liping",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64317-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346048/,611
72187,COVID-19-Related Stigma Among Inpatients With COVID-19 Infection: A Cross-Sectional Study From India.,2021-01-07,"Importance More than 1 billion people worldwide have vision impairment or blindness from potentially preventable or correctable causes. Quality of life, an important measure of physical, emotional, and social well-being, appears to be negatively associated with vision impairment, and increasingly, ophthalmic interventions are being assessed for their association with quality of life. Objective To examine the association between vision impairment or eye disease and quality of life, and the outcome of ophthalmic interventions on quality of life globally and across the life span, through an umbrella review or systematic review of systematic reviews. Evidence Review The electronic databases MEDLINE, Ovid, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Proquest Dissertations, and Theses Global were searched from inception through June 29, 2020, using a comprehensive search strategy. Systematic reviews addressing vision impairment, eye disease, or ophthalmic interventions and quantitatively or qualitatively assessing health-related, vision-related, or disease-specific quality of life were included. Article screening, quality appraisal, and data extraction were performed by 4 reviewers working independently and in duplicate. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal and data extraction forms for umbrella reviews were used. Findings Nine systematic reviews evaluated the association between quality of life and vision impairment, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or mendelian eye conditions (including retinitis pigmentosa). Of these, 5 were reviews of quantitative observational studies, 3 were reviews of qualitative studies, and 1 was a review of qualitative and quantitative studies. All found an association between vision impairment and lower quality of life. Sixty systematic reviews addressed at least 1 ophthalmic intervention in association with quality of life. Overall, 33 unique interventions were investigated, of which 25 were found to improve quality of life compared with baseline measurements or a group receiving no intervention. These interventions included timely cataract surgery, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for age-related macular degeneration, and macular edema. Conclusions and Relevance There is a consistent association between vision impairment, eye diseases, and reduced quality of life. These findings support pursuing ophthalmic interventions, such as timely cataract surgery and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, for common retinal diseases, where indicated, to improve quality of life for millions of people globally each year.","Assi, Lama; Chamseddine, Fatimah; Ibrahim, Perla; Sabbagh, Hadi; Rosman, Lori; Congdon, Nathan; Evans, Jennifer; Ramke, Jacqueline; Kuper, Hannah; Burton, Matthew J; Ehrlich, Joshua R; Swenor, Bonnielin K",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.0146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576772/,611
73253,Adherence to iron and folic acid supplementation during pregnancy among postnatal mothers seeking maternal and child healthcare at Kakamega level 5 hospital in Kenya: a cross-sectional study.,2021,"RCL is an enzyme that catalyzes the N-glycosidic bond cleavage of purine 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates. Recently, the structures of both free wild type and GMP-bound mutant complex have been determined by multidimensional NMR, revealing a doubly wound α/β protein existing in a symmetric homodimer. In this work, we investigated the catalytic mechanism by rational site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics, ITC binding analysis, methanolysis, and NMR study. First, we provide kinetic evidence in support of the structural studies that RCL functions in a dimeric form, with an apparent dissociation constant around 0.5 μM in the presence of substrate dGMP. Second, among the eight residues under investigation, the highly conserved Glu93 is absolutely critical and Tyr13 is also important likely contributing to the chemical step, whereas Ser117 from the neighboring subunit and Ser87 could be the key residues for the phosphate group recognition. Lastly, we demonstrate by methanolysis study that the catalytic reaction proceeds via the formation of a reaction intermediate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed by solvent nucleophile resulting in the formation of normal product deoxyribose monophosphate (dR5P) or methoylated-dR5P. In conclusion, the current study provides mechanistic insights into a new class of nucleotide hydrolase, which resembles nucleoside 2'-deoxyribosyltransferases structurally and functionally but also possesses clear distinction.","Doddapaneni, Kiran; Zahurancik, Walter; Haushalter, Adam; Yuan, Chunhua; Jackman, Jane; Wu, Zhengrong",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi101742z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21510673/,611

74565,Physician Perspective and Key Satisfaction Indicators with Rapid Telehealth Adoption During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,2021-01-29,"INTRODUCTION Sintilimab, an anti-programmed death 1 antibody, plus pemetrexed and platinum had shown promising efficacy for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in a phase 1b study. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of sintilimab with placebo, both in combination with such chemotherapy. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03607539) METHODS: A total of 397 patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor or anaplastic lymphoma kinase genomic aberration were randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive either sintilimab 200 mg or placebo plus pemetrexed and platinum Q3W for 4 cycles, followed by sintilimab or placebo plus pemetrexed therapy. Crossover or treatment beyond disease progression was allowed. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent radiographic review committee. RESULTS As of Nov. 15, 2019, the median follow-up was 8.9 months. The median PFS was significantly longer in the sintilimab-combination group than that in the placebo-combination group (8.9 vs. 5.0 months; HR, 0.482, 95%CI, 0.362 to 0.643; p < 0.00001). The confirmed objective response rate was 51.9 % (95% CI, 45.7% to 58.0%) in sintilimab-combination group and 29.8% (95% CI, 22.1% to 38.4%) in placebo-combination group. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 61.7% in sintilimab-combination group and 58.8% in placebo-combination group. CONCLUSIONS In Chinese patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, the addition of sintilimab to chemotherapy of pemetrexed and platinum resulted in significantly longer PFS than that of chemotherapy alone with manageable safety profiles.","Yang, Yunpeng; Wang, Zhehai; Fang, Jian; Yu, Qitao; Han, Baohui; Cang, Shundong; Chen, Gongyan; Mei, Xiaodong; Yang, Zhixiong; Ma, Rui; Bi, Minghong; Ren, Xiubao; Zhou, Jianying; Li, Baolan; Song, Yong; Feng, Jifeng; Li, Juan; He, Zhiyong; Zhou, Rui; Li, Weimin; Lu, You; Wang, Yingyi; Wang, Lijun; Yang, Nong; Zhang, Yan; Yu, Zhuang; Zhao, Yanqiu; Xie, Conghua; Cheng, Ying; Zhou, Hui; Wang, Shuyan; Zhu, Donglei; Zhang, Wen; Zhang, Li",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32781263/,611
75147,"Awareness, Perception, Attitude Regarding CoViD -19 and Infection Control among Indian Pediatric Dentists: A Cross Sectional Study.",2020-08-01,"PURPOSE To analyze the central macular thickness (CMT), retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), ganglion cell layer thickness (GCLT), and choroidal thickness (ChT) measurements in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The study was conducted cross-sectionally 4 weeks after the completed treatment of COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the polymerase chain reaction test and/or clinical and radiological findings. The patients with treated COVID-19 were enrolled in the COVID-19 group; age- and sex-matched healthy participants served as the control group. All patients in the COVID-19 group were hospitalized and treated with favipiravir, moxifloxacin, and heparin without the requirement for intubation. The measurements of CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) were performed by swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). RESULTS Similar visual acuity (p = 0.582) and intraocular pressure (p = 0.766) values were observed between the COVID-19 and control groups. Regarding SS-OCT measurements, all mean CMT, RNFLT (in four quadrants), GCLT (in six sectors of two different boundaries), and ChT (in five locations) values were similar in the COVID-19 and control groups (p > 0.05 for all). In the COVID-19 group, a statistically significant negative correlation was noted between the mean ferritin level and temporal RNFLT (r = - 0.378, p = 0.014) and a positive correlation was observed between the mean ferritin level and nasal RNFLT (r = + 0.371, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION SS-OCT measurements showed no retinal neurodegenerative and choroidal thickness alterations in COVID-19 patients. Nonsignificant results might be due to the examination of the patients in the early period of the COVID-19 after the treatment. Therefore, late period OCT measurements should be reviewed with new studies in the future.","Cetinkaya, Tugba; Kurt, Muhammed M; Akpolat, Cetin",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1340-0066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853186/,611

SETTING RCTs comparing prompt closure versus gradual weaning of EVD in adult patients with hydrocephalus following aSAH were included. PARTICIPANTS Patients aged equal to or greater than 18 years with an EVD due to hydrocephalus following aSAH were eligible for inclusion. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, any serious adverse event, rate of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement and quality of life. Secondary outcomes were patients with shunt failure, hospital and neuro intensive care unit (NICU) length of stay (LOS) and complications related to treatment with an EVD. Data permitted report of rate of VP shunt placement, and hospital and NICU LOS. RESULTS Six studies were assessed in full text. One RCT with 81 patients was included. Rate of VP shunt placement was 63.4% in the rapid weaning group (ie, prompt closure of the EVD; 41 patients) and 62.5% in the gradual weaning group (40 patients; p=0.932). LOS in hospital and NICU was significantly shorter in the rapidly weaned group compared with the gradually weaned group (mean 19.1 vs 21.5 days in hospital (p=0.03); and mean 14.1 vs 16.9 days in NICU (p=0.0002)). Data were insufficient to conduct meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis or subgroup analysis of heterogeneity and sensitivity. One RCT is currently ongoing.

METHODS A cohort of patients who underwent cystectomy for infection, fistula, bleeding, incontinence, neurogenic bladder or pain between January 2004 and June 2012 was established. Data included baseline demographics, indications for cystectomy and prior treatments, and complications at 30 and 90 days. Primary outcome measures were 30-day and 30 to 90-day complications. RESULTS The study group comprised eight males and 18 females. The mean age was 57.8 years (95% CI 50.8-64.7). A total of 19 patients (73%) had resolution of their underlying urological pathology at 90 days. A total of 19 patients (73%) experienced a complication in the first 30 days, of which nine (47%) were Clavien grade III or higher. The most common 30-day complications were urinary tract infection (n = 6, 23%) and wound infection (n = 6, 23%). A total of 44% (4/9) of patients with neurogenic bladder experienced a complication within the first 30 days of cystectomy compared with 100% (8/8) of patients with radiation-induced fistula (P = 0.03) and 78% (7/9) of non-neurogenic, non-radiation-induced fistula patients (P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS Cystectomy with urinary diversion for benign disease might be successful, but is associated with a high rate of perioperative complications. Those with radiation-induced fistula are more likely to experience complications, whereas those with neurogenic bladder carry a lower risk. Patients should be counseled appropriately regarding expected postoperative outcomes.","Cohn, Joshua A; Large, Michael C; Richards, Kyle A; Steinberg, Gary D; Bales, Gregory T",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24118653/,611
79640,Implementing post diagnostic dementia care in primary care: a mixed-methods systematic review.,2020-09-10,"AIM To assess association between quetiapine treatment and risk of new onset hypothyroidism in schizophrenia patients. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital in China between January 2016 and December 2018. Schizophrenia patients with normal thyroid tests at admission were included. Hypothyroidism, which was defined as TSH>4.20 mU/L and free T4<12.00 pmol/L, or on L- thyroxine prescriptions, was the outcome measure, and quetiapine treatment between admission and subsequent thyroid test was the exposure measure of this study. Adjusted relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the independent association of quetiapine treatment with risk of new onset hypothyroidism. The dose-response association was further analyzed by three quetiapine doses: low (<=0.2 g/d), medium (0.2-0.6 g/d), and high (>0.6 g/d). RESULTS A total of 2,022 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. Sixty patients (15.0%) in the quetiapine group developed hypothyroidism, while 56 patients (3.5%) in non-quetiapine group developed hypothyroidism. Relative risk (95% confidence interval) of developing hypothyroidism for quetiapine use was 4.01 (2.86-5.64) after adjusting for a number of potential confounding factors. A strong dose-response association between quetiapine use and risk of developing hypothyroidism was observed: adjusted relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.00 (0.25-2.59), 4.22 (2.80-6.25), and 5.62 (3.66-8.38), respectively, for low-, medium-, and high-dose quetiapine, as compared with no quetiapine. CONCLUSION Acute phase quetiapine treatment for schizophrenia patients was strongly associated with increased risk of developing new onset hypothyroidism, with a clear dose-response association.","Zhao, Ying; Wen, Shi Wu; Li, Mengzhe; Sun, Zhongyu; Yuan, Xiang; Retnakaran, Ravi; Zhang, Ruiling; Zhai, Desheng",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046922/,611

80435,Preface.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND In patients with haematuria, a fast, noninvasive test with high sensitivity (SN) and negative predictive value (NPV), which is able to detect or exclude bladder cancer (BC), is needed. A newly developed urine assay, Xpert Bladder Cancer Detection (Xpert), measures five mRNA targets (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, UPK1B, and ANXA10) that are frequently overexpressed in BC. OBJECTIVE To validate the performance of Xpert in patients with haematuria. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Voided precystoscopy urine specimens were prospectively collected at 22 sites from patients without prior BC undergoing cystoscopy for haematuria. Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion procedures were performed. Technical validation was performed and specificity (SP) was determined in patients without BC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Test characteristics were calculated based on cystoscopy and histology results, and compared between Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS We included 828 patients (mean age 64.5 yr, 467 males, 401 never smoked). Xpert had an SN of 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66-87) overall and 90% (95% CI: 76-96) for high-grade (HG) tumours. The NPV was 98% (95% CI: 97-99) overall. The SP was 84% (95% CI: 81-86). In patients with microhaematuria, only one HG patient was missed (NPV 99%). Xpert had higher SN and NPV than cytology and UroVysion. Cytology had the highest SP (97%). In a separate SP study, Xpert had an SP of 89% in patients with benign prostate hypertrophy and 92% in prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS Xpert is an easy-to-use, noninvasive test with improved SN and NPV compared with cytology and UroVysion, representing a promising tool for identifying haematuric patients with a low likelihood of BC who might not need to undergo cystoscopy. PATIENT SUMMARY Xpert is an easy-to-perform urine test with good performance compared with standard urine tests. It should help identify (micro)haematuria patients with a very low likelihood to have bladder cancer.","Valenberg, Franciscus Johannes P van; Hiar, Andrew M; Wallace, Ellen; Bridge, Julia A; Mayne, Donna J; Beqaj, Safedin; Sexton, Wade J; Lotan, Yair; Weizer, Alon Z; Jansz, Godfrey K; Stenzl, Arnulf; Danella, John F; Cline, Kevin J; Williams, Michael B; Montgomery, Scott; David, Richard D; Harris, Richard; Klein, Eric W; Bradford, Timothy J; Wolk, Fred N; Westenfelder, Karl R; Trainer, Andrew F; Richardson, Timothy A; Egerdie, Russell B; Goldfarb, Bernard; Zadra, Joseph A; Lu, Xixi; Simon, Iris M; Campbell, Scott A; Bates, Michael P; Higuchi, Russell G; Witjes, J Alfred",European urology oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004290/,611
81346,"Primary Care in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Essential, and Inspiring.",2021-02-01,"Different from Visual Question Answering task that requires to answer only one question about an image, Visual Dialogue task involves multiple rounds of dialogues which cover a broad range of visual content that could be related to any objects, relationships or high-level semantics. Thus one of the key challenges in Visual Dialogue task is to learn a more comprehensive and semantic-rich image representation that can adaptively attend to the visual content referred by variant questions. In this paper, we first propose a novel scheme to depict an image from both visual and semantic views. Specifically, the visual view aims to capture the appearance-level information in an image, including objects and their visual relationships, while the semantic view enables the agent to understand high-level visual semantics from the whole image to the local regions. Furthermore, on top of such dual-view image representations, we propose a Dual Encoding Visual Dialogue (DualVD) module, which is able to adaptively select question-relevant information from the visual and semantic views in a hierarchical mode. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DualVD, we propose two novel visual dialogue models by applying it to the Late Fusion framework and Memory Network framework. The proposed models achieve state-of-theart results on three benchmark datasets. A critical advantage of the DualVD module lies in its interpretability. We can analyze which modality (visual or semantic) has more contribution in answering the current question by explicitly visualizing the gate values. It gives us insights in understanding of information selection mode in the Visual Dialogue task.

The study objective was to model resource requirements to deliver virtual urgent medical care in LTC facilities. METHODS We used data from all general medicine inpatient admissions at 7 hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, over a 7.5-year period (Apr. 1, 2010, to Oct. 31, 2017) to estimate historical patterns of hospital resource use by LTC residents. We estimated an upper bound of potentially avoidable transfers by combining data on short admissions (≤ 72 h) with historical data on the proportion of transfers from LTC facilities for which patients were discharged from the emergency department without admission. Regression models were used to extrapolate future resource requirements, and queuing models were used to estimate physician staffing requirements to perform virtual assessments. RESULTS There were 235 375 admissions to general medicine wards, and residents of LTC facilities (age 16 yr or older) accounted for 9.3% (n = 21 948) of these admissions. Among the admissions of residents of LTC facilities, short admissions constituted 24.1% (n = 5297), and for 99.8% (n = 5284) of these admissions, the patient received laboratory testing, for 86.9% (n = 4604) the patient received plain radiography, for 41.5% (n = 2197) the patient received computed tomography and for 81.2% (n = 4300) the patient received intravenous medications. If all patients who have short admissions and are transferred from the emergency department were diverted to outpatient care, the average weekly demand for outpatient imaging per hospital would be 2.6 ultrasounds, 11.9 computed tomographic scans and 23.9 radiographs per week. The average daily volume of urgent medical virtual assessments would range from 2.0 to 5.8 per hospital. A single centralized virtual assessment centre staffed by 2 or 3 physicians would provide services similar in efficiency (measured by waiting time for physician assessment) to 7 separate centres staffed by 1 physician each. INTERPRETATION The provision of acute medical care to LTC residents at their facility would probably require rapid access to outpatient diagnostic imaging, within-facility access to laboratory services and intravenous medication and virtual consultations with physicians. The results of this study can inform efforts to deliver urgent medical care in LTC facilities in light of a potential surge in COVID-19 cases.","Razak, Fahad; Shin, Saeha; Pogacar, Frances; Jung, Hae Young; Pus, Laura; Moser, Andrea; Lapointe-Shaw, Lauren; Tang, Terence; Kwan, Janice L; Weinerman, Adina; Rawal, Shail; Kushnir, Vladyslav; Mak, Denise; Martin, Danielle; Shojania, Kaveh G; Bhatia, Sacha; Agarwal, Payal; Mukerji, Geetha; Fralick, Michael; Kapral, Moira K; Morgan, Matthew; Wong, Brian; Chan, Timothy C Y; Verma, Amol A",CMAJ open,https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20200098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819964/,611

The associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a high number of death worldwide. Observational studies and case reports have provided insights that older age and the presence of chronic diseases is frequently associated with a higher COVID-19 severity. These individuals also seem to have a higher risk of mortality due to COVID-19. In this review we provide insights into the impact chronic diseases associated with the cardiovascular system, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease might have on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

Although the effects on future fertility were not studied in the initial trials, at present, there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine has any effect of future fertility. It is well known that pregnant women are at a higher risk of complications associated with COVID-19 such as ICU admission and death, and there is a rare but tragic increase in placentitis and stillbirth, highlighting the importance for those planning a pregnancy any time in the future to be vaccinated. Here we summarise international consensus from multiple organisations advising on fertility and the COVID-19 vaccine. Preliminary studies all suggest that there is neither link, nor indeed any theoretical reason why any of the COVID-19 vaccines might affect fertility. Dissemination of misinformation regarding the impact of the vaccine on future fertility needs to be controlled in order to avoid any hesitancy amongst young women attending for vaccination. It is also vital that the medical profession counteract this information, and, in order to do that, healthcare providers must be well informed on the latest recommendations and research.","Schaler, Laurentina; Wingfield, Mary",Irish journal of medical science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02807-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651258/,611

METHODS This was a single-center prospective cohort pilot study. Male trauma patients received up to 4 units of cold-stored low anti-A, anti-B group O whole blood (LTOWB) as initial resuscitation followed by CT as needed (LTOWB + CT). A control group consisting of females, and males who presented when LTOWB was unavailable, received component therapy only (CT group). Exclusion criteria included antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication and death within 24 hours. The primary outcome was total transfusion volume at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes were mortality, morbidity, and ICU- and hospital-free days. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients received LTOWB, with a median of 2.0 [IQR 1.0, 3.0] units of LTOWB transfused. Thirty-two patients received CT only. At 24 hours after presentation, the LTOWB +CT group had received a median of 2138 mL [IQR 1275-3325] of all blood products. The median for the CT group was 4225 mL [IQR 1900-5425], p = 0.06 in unadjusted analysis. When adjusted for Injury Severity Score, sex, and positive Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST), LTOWB +CT group patients received 3307 mL of blood products and CT group patients received 3260 mL in the first 24 hours (p = 0.95). The adjusted median ratio of plasma to red cells transfused was higher in the LTOWB + CT group (0.85 vs 0.63 at 24 hours after admission, p = 0.043. Adjusted mortality was 4.4% in the LTOWB + CT group, and 11.7% in the CT group (p = 0.19), with similar complications, ICU-, and hospital-free days in both groups.

88080,Trends in visits to substance use disorder treatment facilities in 2020.,2021-08-01,"PURPOSE To explore the possible challenges and difficulties of using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in ophthalmic practice during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS This is a multicenter, international survey among practicing ophthalmologists across different countries. The survey was conducted from September 9th to October 24th, 2020. It included a total of 23 questions that navigated through the currently adopted recommendations in different clinical situations. The survey also assessed the convenience of using various PPE in ophthalmic practice and addressed the clarity of the examination field while using various PPE during clinical or surgical procedures. RESULTS One hundred and seventy-two ophthalmologists completed the survey (101 from Egypt, 50 from the USA, and 21 from four other countries). The analysis of the responses showed that most ophthalmologists use face masks without significant problems during their examinations, while face shields followed by protective goggles were the most inconvenient PPE in the current ophthalmic practice. Moreover, most of the participants (133, 77.3%) noticed an increase in their examination time when using PPE. Furthermore, a considerable percentage of the respondents (70, 40.7%) stopped using one or more of the PPE due to inconvenience or discomfort. CONCLUSIONS Due to the unique nature of the ophthalmic examination, certain PPE are not ophthalmologist-friendly. Innovative PPE should be tailored for prompt, more convenient, and clearer ophthalmological practice.","Ashour, Doaa Maamoun; Serag Elkitkat, Rania; Gabr, Hesham; Yosef, Mostafa; Singh Grewal, Dilraj; Saleh, Mohamed Ibrahim",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/11206721211028037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180262/,611
88553,Vitamin D Status and Gastric Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study in Koreans.,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND Neonatal hypothermia is a significant risk factor for preterm and low birth weight (LBW) newborns, especially in India. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is one recommended method of thermal control. A wearable device, TempWatch, has been developed to monitor for and detect hypothermia and to promote KMC for preterm and LBW infants. PURPOSE This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate TempWatch's impact on weight gain, amount of KMC received, and length of hospital stay for LBW infants as compared to standard care. METHODS Otherwise healthy LBW infants (with birthweights 1500-2300 g) admitted to a KMC ward of a government hospital in New Delhi, India were randomly allocated to a TempWatch group or a control group and wore the device until their time of discharge. 50 infants were enrolled in each group. All participants received standard-of-care temperature monitoring, and those in the control group were monitored using the hand-touch method. Each group also received sixth-hourly temperature monitoring. Infants' daily weight and the number of hypothermia episodes they experienced per day were recorded, and mothers of infants in both groups completed daily KMC diaries. RESULTS The TempWatch group experienced statistically significant weight gain as compared to the control group (0.06 vs. 0.02 kg, p = .024). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the number of hypothermia events detected, the amount of KMC received. CONCLUSION TempWatch promotes statistically significant weight gain for LBW infants as compared to standard care.","Azad, Mohammad; Bisht, Surender Singh; Tyagi, Amita; Jaipal, M L","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1814244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962461/,611

88907,Dyspepsia-challenge in primary care gastroenterology.,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND Mesh implantation during abdominal wall reconstruction decreases rates of ventral hernia recurrence and has become the dominant method of repair. The authors provide a comprehensive comparison of surgical outcomes and complications by location of mesh placement following ventral hernia repair with onlay, interposition, retrorectus, or underlay mesh. METHODS A systematic search of the English literature published from 1996 to 2012 in the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane library databases was conducted to identify patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction using either prosthetic or biological mesh for ventral hernia repair. Demographic information was obtained from each study. RESULTS Sixty-two relevant articles were included with 5824 patients treated with mesh repair of a ventral hernia between 1996 and 2012. Mesh position included onlay (19.6 percent), underlay (60.7 percent), interposition (6.4 percent), and retrorectus (12.4 percent). Prosthetic mesh was used in 80 percent of repairs and biological mesh in 20 percent. The weighted mean incidences of early events were as follows: wound complications, 19 percent; wound infections, 8 percent; seroma or hematoma formation, 11 percent; and reoperation, 10 percent. The weighted mean incidences of late complications included 8 percent for hernia recurrence and 2 percent for mesh explantation. Recurrence rates were highest for onlay (17 percent) or interposition (17 percent) reinforcement. The infection rate was also highest in the interposition cohort (25 percent). Seroma rates were lowest following a retrorectus repair (4 percent). CONCLUSIONS Mesh reinforcement of a ventral hernia repair is safe and efficacious, but the location of the reinforcement appears to influence outcomes. Underlay or retrorectus mesh placement is associated with lower recurrence rates.","Albino, Frank P; Patel, Ketan M; Nahabedian, Maurice Y; Sosin, Michael; Attinger, Christopher E; Bhanot, Parag",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e3182a4c393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24165612/,611

The increased incidence of cancer recurrence associated with this approach, has been attributed to the inability of monitoring the extent of ablated liver tissue. METHODS The feasibility of assessing liver ablation with probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) was studied in a porcine model of laparoscopic microwave liver ablation. Following the intravenous injection of the fluorophores fluorescein and indocyanine green, CLE images were recorded at 488 nm and 660 nm wavelength and compared to liver histology. Statistical analysis was performed to assess if fluorescence intensity change can predict the presence of ablated liver tissue. RESULTS CLE imaging of fluorescein at 488 nm provided good visualization of the hepatic microvasculature; whereas, CLE imaging of indocyanine green at 660 nm enabled detailed visualization of hepatic sinusoid architecture and interlobular septations. Fluorescence intensity as measured in relative fluorescence units was found to be 75-100% lower in ablated compared to healthy liver regions. General linear mixed modeling and ROC analysis found the decrease in fluorescence to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic, dual wavelength CLE imaging using two different fluorophores enables clinically useful visualization of multiple liver tissue compartments, in greater detail than is possible at a single wavelength. CLE imaging may provide valuable intraoperative information on the extent of laparoscopic liver ablation.","Schneider, Crispin; Johnson, Sean P; Walker-Samuel, Simon; Gurusamy, Kurinchi; Clarkson, Matthew J; Thompson, Stephen; Song, Yi; Totz, Johannes; Cook, Richard J; Desjardins, Adrien E; Hawkes, David J; Davidson, Brian R",Lasers in surgery and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/lsm.22464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26718623/,611
89322,Post-stroke health-related quality of life at 3 and 12 months and predictors of change in a Danish and Arctic Norwegian Region.,2020-07-30,"Background: Teleconsultations have been an indispensable part of the public health armamentarium during the COVID-19 crisis. Many physicians replaced face-to-face consultations with teleconsultations for the very first time. This study aimed to understand telemedicine uses by physicians during the lockdown period and explain the changes in their teleconsultation practices after the reopening of an outpatient department. Methods: A mixed-method analysis was used. First, a quantitative study was conducted with a retrospective analysis of the ratio of all teleconsultations and physical consultations between January 1 and July 31, 2020. Second, semidirective interviews were undertaken with physicians to better understand the dynamics of teleconsultation use. Results: In total, 28 physicians practiced 603 teleconsultations over the study period. The rate of teleconsultations was 0.2% before the lockdown (January 1 to March 15, 2020), reaching 19.5% during the lockdown (April 2020), and decreasing to 8.4% at the reopening of the physical outpatient facilities. Based on the dynamics of their teleconsultation uses, four medical departments were selected for the qualitative study component (neurology, urology, pneumology, and anesthesiology). From the semistructured interviews, the main uses of telemedicine were for patients living with ""chronic but under control"" conditions that received follow-ups. Physicians also identified practices to improve patient empowerment and nurse autonomy. The results of the anesthesiology department showed that teleconsultations must be more codified to meet the same standards of quality as face-to-face consultations. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown period triggered a wider use of teleconsultations and have allowed physicians to think about new uses and opportunities.","Cormi, Clément; Ohannessian, Robin; Sanchez, Stéphane",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560152/,611

90010,Rapid Scaling Up of Telehealth Treatment for Tobacco-Dependent Cancer Patients During the COVID-19 Outbreak in New York City.,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND Multiple industries and organisations are afflicted by and respond to institutional crises daily. As surgeons, we respond to crisis frequently and individually such as with critically unwell patients or in mass casualty scenarios; but rarely, do we encounter institutional or multi-institutional crisis with multiple actors as we have seen with the COVID-19 pan-demic. Businesses, private industry and the financial sector have been in a more precar-ious position regarding crisis and consequently have developed rapid response strate-gies employing foresight to reduce risk to assets and financial liquidity. Moreover, large nationalised governmental organisations such as the military have strategies in place ow-ing to a rapidly evolving geopolitical climate with the expectation of immediate new chal-lenges either in the negotiating room or indeed the field of conflict. Despite both nation-alised and privatised healthcare systems existing, both appeared ill-prepared for the COVID-19 global crisis. METHODS A narrative review of the literature was undertaken exploring the approach to crisis man-agement and models used in organisations exposed to institutional crises outside the field of medicine. RESULTS There are many parallels between the organisational management of private business institutions, large military organisations and surgical organisational management in healthcare. Models from management consultancies and the armed forces were ex-plored discussed and adapted for the surgical leader providing a framework through which the surgical leader can bring about an successful response to an institutional crisis and ensure future resilience. CONCLUSION We believe that healthcare, and surgeons (as leaders) in particular, can learn from these other organisations and industries to engage appropriate generic operational plans and contingencies in preparation for whatever further crises may arise in the future, both near and distant. As such, following a review of the literature, we have explored a number of models we believe are adaptable for the surgical community to ensure we remain a dy-namically responsive and ever prepared profession.","Pring, Edward T; Malietzis, George; Kendall, Simon W H; Jenkins, John T; Athanasiou, Thanos",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2021.105987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091086/,611

METHODS Study records and an investigator survey were examined for physician and site related factors, including: number of Wingspan and aneurysm stents submitted for credentialing, number of study procedures performed in SAMMPRIS, years in practice after training, primary specialty, and site enrollment. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine if these factors were associated with the 30 day rate of cerebrovascular events after angioplasty and stenting. RESULTS 213 patients underwent angioplasty alone (n=5) or angioplasty and stenting (n=208) with study devices by 63 interventionists at 48 sites. For credentialing, the median number of Wingspan and similar aneurysm stent cases submitted by study interventionists were 10 and 6, respectively. Interventionists with higher numbers (>10) of Wingspan cases submitted for credentialing tended to have higher rates of 30 day events (19.0% vs 9.9%) than those with <10 cases. High enrolling sites in the trial tended to have lower rates of hemorrhagic stroke (9.8% at sites enrolling <12 patients vs 2.7% at sites enrolling >12 patients). CONCLUSIONS Interventionists credentialed with less Wingspan experience were not responsible for the high rate of periprocedural stroke in SAMMPRIS. Hemorrhagic stroke may be related to low enrollment in the trial but not previous Wingspan experience.","Derdeyn, Colin P; Fiorella, David; Lynn, Michael J; Barnwell, Stanley L; Zaidat, Osama O; Meyers, Philip M; Gobin, Y Pierre; Dion, Jacques; Lane, Bethany F; Turan, Tanya N; Janis, L Scott; Chimowitz, Marc I",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22977278/,611

In this environment, self-direction of home and community-based services, where the participant can hire their own staff and manage a budget that can be used for a broad range of goods and services including home modifications and assistive devices, is seen as a promising intervention. Using self-direction participants can minimize the number of people who enter their homes and pay close family and friends who were already providing many hours of informal care, and now may be unemployed. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is encouraging this approach. This commentary presents information on how states have responded using the new CMS Toolkit by expanding who can be a paid caregiver, increasing budgets and broadening the kinds of items that can be purchased with budgets to include items like personal protective equipment and supports for telehealth.

The socioeconomic implications alone have significantly impacted children in various aspects and some of these effects will be long-lasting. This is especially true for the children in underdeveloped countries, vulnerable communities, and neighborhoods where they are more susceptible to the ill effects of the pandemic such as health and survival issues, malnutrition, child labor and abuse. Moreover, the children have also had limited opportunities for interaction with their friends and due to the varying social distancing and lockdown conditions, have been prevented from physical activity and creative play which is crucial for their development as well as learning at this age. Consequently, the various implications of the pandemic may collectively affect the children's cognitive, emotional, and social development. A positive take from this situation is the importance of collaboration among governmental & non-governmental organizations at individual well as community levels.

This study aimed to understand how social marketing interventions have addressed neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). It examined the characteristics, breadth of coverage, and outcomes of social marketing interventions focused on the prevention and control of these diseases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Studies published in any language between January 1971 and April 2017, targeting at least one of the 17 NTDs prioritized in the World Health Organization (WHO) NTD Roadmap were considered. Included studies had interventions that applied both, at least one core social marketing concept, ""social behavioral influence"", and one social marketing technique, ""integrated intervention mix"", described in the Hierarchical Model of Social Marketing. This review is registered with PROSPERO CRD42017063858. Twenty interventions, addressing eight NTDs, met the inclusion criteria. They focused on behaviors related to four of the five WHO public health strategies for NTDs. Most interventions incorporated the concepts ""relationship building"" and ""public / people orientation focus"", and the technique ""insight-driven segmentation"". All the interventions reported changing behavioral determinants such as knowledge, 19 reported behavior change, and four influenced health outcomes. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE Evidence from this study shows that social marketing has been successfully used to address behaviors related to most of the five public health strategic interventions for NTDs recommended by the WHO. It is suggested that social marketing interventions for the prevention and control of NTDs be grounded on an understanding of the audience and adapted to the contexts intervened. Building stakeholder relationships as early as possible, and involving the publics could help in reaching NTD outcomes. Elements of the intervention mix should be integrated and mutually supportive. Incorporating health education and capacity building, as well as being culturally appropriate, is also relevant. It is recommended that ongoing discussions to formulate the targets and milestones of the new global Roadmap for NTDs integrate social marketing as an approach to overcome these diseases.","Aya Pastrana, Nathaly; Lazo-Porras, Maria; Miranda, J Jaime; Beran, David; Suggs, L Suzanne",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32555705/,611

Recently, there has been growing interest in the use of acupuncture for various pain conditions. Acupuncture's efficacy in five pain conditions-low back pain (LBP), migraines, fibromyalgia, neck pain, and abdominal pain-was evaluated in this evidence-based, comprehensive review. Based on the most recent evidence, migraine and fibromyalgia are two conditions with the most favorable outcomes after acupuncture. At the same time, abdominal pain has the least evidence for the use of acupuncture. Acupuncture is efficacious for reducing pain in patients with LBP, and for short-term pain relief for those with neck pain. Further research needs to be done to evaluate acupuncture's efficacy in these conditions, especially for abdominal pain, as many of the current studies have a risk of bias due to lack of blinding and small sample size.","Patel, Megha; Urits, Ivan; Kaye, Alan D; Viswanath, Omar",Best practice & research.

From February 2014 to September 2018, 46 male patients with small PPNs underwent VATS, of whom 41 underwent unilateral VATS, and five underwent bilateral VATS. All procedures were successfully performed. Patients received 1 year of outpatient follow-up postoperatively. The data indicated that the average operation times were 32.7 min (unilateral) and 58.6 min (bilateral). The mean length of the incision was 2.7 ± 0.3 cm, with a mean cosmetic score of 3.2 ± 0.7 at the time of discharge. All patients rapidly recovered consciousness postoperatively. The length of postoperative hospitalization (LOH) was 3.4 ± 1.4 days. There was no obvious surgical scarring on the chest wall, and no patients complained of postoperative pain at 6 months postoperatively. No recurrence or metastasis was found during the 1-year follow-up. Transareolar uniportal VATS for peripheral pulmonary nodules resulted in good cosmetic outcomes and high patient satisfaction.

With this sudden shift, workers and the media began discussing videoconference fatigue, a potentially new phenomenon of feeling tired and exhausted attributed to a videoconference. In the present study, we examine the nature of videoconference fatigue, when this phenomenon occurs, and what videoconference characteristics are associated with fatigue using a mixed-methods approach. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses indicates that videoconference fatigue exists, often in near temporal proximity to the videoconference, and is affected by various videoconference characteristics. Quantitative data were collected each hour during five workdays from 55 employees who were working remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Latent growth modeling results suggest that videoconferences at different times of the day are related to deviations in employee fatigue beyond what is expected based on typical fatigue trajectories. Results from multilevel modeling of 279 videoconference meetings indicate that turning off the microphone and having higher feelings of group belongingness are related to lower postvideoconference fatigue. Additional analyses suggest that higher levels of group belongingness are the most consistent protective factor against videoconference fatigue. Such findings have immediate practical implications for workers and organizations as they continue to navigate the still relatively new terrain of remote work.

We show that individual transporters can function at rates varying by at least two orders of magnitude that persist for multiple turnovers. A gain-of-function mutant shows increased population of the fast-acting transporters, leading to a 10-fold increase in the mean transport rate.

The COVID-19 pandemic may also impose difficulties in managing AIS patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), as well as concerns for the safety of health care providers. This international global survey aims to gather and summarize information from tertiary care stroke centers on periprocedural pathways and endovascular management of AIS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional survey-based research questionnaire was sent to 259 tertiary care stroke centers with neurointerventional facilities worldwide. RESULTS We received 114 responses (response rate: 44%) from 25 different countries across all 5 continents. The number of AIS patients and EVT cases were reported to have decreased during the pandemic. Most participants reported conducting COVID-19 testing before (49%) or after the procedure (31%); 20% of centers did not test at all. Only 16% of participating centers reported using a negative pressure room for the thrombectomy procedure. Strikingly, 50% of participating centers reported no changes in the anesthetic management of AIS patients undergoing EVT during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS This global survey provides information on the challenges in managing AIS patients undergoing EVT during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its findings can be used to improve patient outcomes and the safety of the health care team worldwide.","Chowdhury, Tumul; Rizk, Abanoub A; Daniels, Abigail H; Al Azazi, Emad; Sharma, Deepak; Venkatraghavan, Lashmi",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048865/,611

METHODS The BGA and CG48 data were analyzed in 614 patients with AIS who received endovascular therapy at 7 US centers between 2006 and 2009. Data reviewed included demographics, stroke risk factors, diabetic status, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation, recanalization grade, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rate, and 90-day outcomes (mortality rate and modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 [defined as poor outcome]). Variables with p values < 0.2 in univariate analysis were included in a binary logistic regression model for independent predictors of 90-day outcomes. RESULTS The mean patient age was 67.3 years, the median NIHSS score was 16, and 27% of patients had diabetes. In nondiabetic patients, BGA ≥ 116 mg/dl (≥ 6.4 mmol/L) and failure of glucose level to drop > 30 mg/dl (> 1.7 mmol/L) from the admission value were both significant predictors of 90-day poor outcome and death (p < 0.001). In patients with diabetes, BGA ≥ 116 mg/dl (≥ 6.4 mmol/L) was an independent predictor of poor outcome (p = 0.001). The CG48 was not a predictor of outcome in diabetic patients. A simplified 6-point scale including BGA, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Grade 2-3 Reperfusion, Age, presentation NIHSS score, CG48, and symptomatic ICH (BRANCH) corresponded with poor outcomes at 90 days; the area under the curve value was > 0.79. CONCLUSIONS Failure of blood glucose values to decrease in the first 48 hours after AIS intervention correlated with poor 90-day outcomes in nondiabetic patients. The BRANCH scale shows promise as a simple prognostication tool after endovascular therapy for AIS, and it merits prospective validation.","Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Dandona, Paresh; Karmon, Yuval; Yoo, Albert J; Kalia, Junaid S; Hao, Qing; Hsu, Daniel P; Hopkins, L Nelson; Fiorella, David J; Bendok, Bernard R; Nguyen, Thanh N; Rymer, Marilyn M; Nanda, Ashish; Liebeskind, David S; Zaidat, Osama O; Nogueira, Raul G; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2011.1.jns10884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21351835/,611

The study aim was to retrospectively assess the safety and efficacy of Onyx embolization with the intention to cure AVMs in a pediatric population. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients (<18 years) who underwent endovascular embolization using Onyx at our institution was conducted. The primary endpoint was the composite complete angiographic occlusion of AVM immediately after the last embolization session that had no procedure-related complication requiring emergency surgery. Secondary endpoints were angiographic occlusion rates, procedure-related complications, and clinical outcomes after treatment and at the 6-month follow-up RESULTS Twenty-three patients (mean age, 11.7 years) underwent a total of 45 embolization sessions. The median Spetzler-Martin grade was 3 (range 1 to 4). The primary endpoint was achieved in 19 patients (82.6 %). Complete angiographic occlusion of the AVM was obtained in 21 patients (91.3 %) immediately after embolization and at the 6-month follow-up. Embolization-related complications were observed in three patients (13 %). None of the complications resulted in permanent functional disability or death. In two patients (8.7 %), the AVM could not be completely occluded by embolization alone and the patients were referred to radiosurgery and microsurgery, respectively. CONCLUSION Onyx embolization of AVM in pediatric patients with the intention to cure resulted in high occlusion rates without increasing neurological disability or death. The development of new embolization techniques and devices seems to improve the safety of Onyx embolization.","de Castro-Afonso, L H; Nakiri, G S; Oliveira, R S; Santos, M V; Santos, A C Dos; Machado, H R; Abud, D G",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-016-1666-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26909692/,611

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, shows excellent efficacy against stroke and deep vein thrombosis in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine serum apixaban concentrations and anti-factor Xa activity in horses after orally administered apixaban. Five horses received a single dose of intravenous (0.09 mg/kg) and oral (1 mg/kg) apixaban in a cross-over design. Serum apixaban concentrations and anti-Xa activity were measured serially via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a commercial assay, respectively, for 12 hr following oral administration. Apixaban was detected in all horses after both oral and intravenous administration. Oral administration yielded a mean maximum concentration of 60.3 ng/ml (59.4-111 ng/ml), mean time to maximum concentration of 0.5 hr (0.5-2), mean half-life of 6.2 hr (4.6-8.3), and mean oral bioavailability of 10% (3.8-17.4). After oral administration, anti-Xa activity had a strong positive relationship with serum apixaban and was best represented by a dose-response model with the following parameters: E0 = 5.00 ng/ml, EMAX = 311 ng/mL, EC50 = 267 ng/ml, and n = 1.58. Anti-Xa activity was significantly higher 2 hr post-administration compared with baseline (p = .032). Despite low oral bioavailability, administration of 1 mg/kg oral apixaban, in healthy horses, achieves serum concentrations similar to those reported in humans. Apixaban has potential clinical utility in horses and warrants further investigation.","Wallace, Gabrielle E; McKaba, Victoria F; Reinhart, Jennifer M; Li, Zhong; Austin, Scott; Fries, Ryan C",Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvp.12979; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046920/,611

We profiled eGDR in younger adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) by their demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS In this single centre study, medical records of TIDM were assessed and eGDR tertiles correlated with demographic and clinical variables. RESULTS Of 175 T1DM individuals, 108 (61.7%) were males. Mean age (±SD) was 22.0 ± 1.6 years and median time from diagnosis 11.0 years (range 1-23). Individuals were predominantly Caucasian (81.7%), with 27.4% being overweight (BMI: 25-30 kg/m2) and 13.7% obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). Mean total cholesterol (TC) levels were significantly lower in high and middle eGDR tertiles (4.4 ± 1 and 4.3 ± 0.8 mmol/l, respectively) compared with low eGDR tertile (4.8 ± 1, p < 0.05 for both). Triglyceride (TG) levels showed a similar trend at 1.1 ± 0.5 and 1.1 ± 0.5 mmol/l for high and middle eGDR tertile compared to low eGDR tertile (1.5 ± 1 mmol/l, p < 0.05 for both). Renal function was similar across eGDR tertiles and no difference in retinopathy was detected. CONCLUSION TC and TG are altered in individuals with T1DM and low eGDR, suggesting that this subgroup requires optimal lipid management to ameliorate their vascular risk.","Nishtala, Revathi; Kietsiriroje, Noppadol; Karam, Mohammad; Ajjan, Ramzi A; Pearson, Sam",Diabetes & vascular disease research,https://doi.org/10.1177/1479164120952321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883101/,611
108262,Can you hear me now?: Improving palliative care access through telehealth.,2021-01-04,"OBJECTIVES Neutrophils are thought to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to form in response to exogenous bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. However, the mechanisms underlying NET formation during sterile inflammation are still unclear. In this study, we would like to identify neutrophil extracellular traps formation during sterile inflammation and tissue injury and associated pathways and its mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified different injuries such as chemical-induced and trauma-induced formation of NETs and investigated mechanism of the formation of NETs in vitro and in vivo during the treatment of mtDNA. RESULTS Here, we find the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and oxidized mtDNA in acute peripheral tissue trauma models or other chemically induced lung injury, and moreover, endogenous mtDNA and oxidized mtDNA induce the formation of NETs and sterile inflammation. Oxidized mtDNA is a more potent inducer of NETs. Mitochondrial DNA activates neutrophils via cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING and the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathways and increases the production of neutrophil elastase and extracellular neutrophil-derived DNA in NETs. Mitochondrial DNA also increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of the NET-associated proteins Rac 2 and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4). CONCLUSIONS Altogether, these findings highlight that endogenous mitochondrial DNA inducted NETs formation and subsequent sterile inflammation and the mechanism associated with NET formation.","Liu, Li; Mao, Ye; Xu, Bocheng; Zhang, Xiangxian; Fang, Chunju; Ma, Yu; Men, Ke; Qi, Xiaorong; Yi, Tao; Wei, Yuquan; Wei, Xiawei",Cell proliferation,https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.12579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30851061/,611

The detrimental effect of underweight on reproduction complicates the safety evaluation of anti-obesity drugs, making it challenging to distinguish pathological changes mediated through the intended drug-induced weight loss from direct drug effects on reproductive organs. Four-weeks dosing of normal weight Sprague Dawley rats with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)/glucagon receptor co-agonist induced a robust weight loss, accompanied by histological findings in prostate, seminal vesicles, mammary glands, uterus/cervix and vagina. Characterization of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in male rats revealed reduced hypothalamic Kiss1 mRNA levels and decreased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone concentrations following co-agonist dosing. These alterations resemble hypogonadotropic hypogonadism typically seen in adverse energy deprived conditions, like chronic food restriction. Concomitant daily administration of kisspeptin-52 from day 21 to the end of the four-week co-agonist dosing period evoked LH and testosterone responses without normalizing histological findings. This incomplete rescue by kisspeptin-52 may be due to the rather short kisspeptin-52 treatment period combined with a desensitization observed on testosterone responses. Concomitant leptin treatment from day 21 did not reverse co-agonist induced changes in HPG axis activity. Furthermore, a single co-agonist injection in male rats slightly elevated LH levels but left testosterone unperturbed, thereby excluding a direct acute inhibitory effect on the HPG axis. Our data suggest that the reproductive phenotype after repeated co-agonist administration was driven by the intended weight loss, however, we cannot exclude a direct organ related effect in chronically treated rats.","Bolze, Florian; Williams, Hannah; Bhuwania, Ridhirama; Egecioglu, Emil; Bloem, Esther; Paulsson, Johan F; Pedersen, Marie Ø; Broadmeadow, Alan; Chesher, Clare J; Moore, Emma L; Skydsgaard, Mikala; Galle, Pia Søndergaard; Dalgaard, Majken; Wulff, Birgitte S; Tena-Sempere, Manuel; Andersen, Lærke W",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2020.115152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726590/,611

METHODS Between September 2006 and August 2010, all 517 patients (333 men and 184 women; mean age 70.6 years) undergoing primary stent placement in femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions at 2 European vascular centers were prospectively enrolled in the study. The main study outcome was primary stent patency. Secondary outcomes included secondary patency, limb salvage, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Women had a higher incidence of critical limb ischemia (32.1% vs. 16.9%, p<0.001). Lesion characteristics according to the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) classification were comparable in both genders (p=0.52), although total occlusions and popliteal involvement were observed more frequently in female patients (p=0.043 and p=0.001, respectively). Both genders showed similar 5-year primary patency rates (64.3% men vs. 58.1% women, p=0.11). A statistically significant difference was observed concerning the secondary patency rates in favor of men (71.9% vs. 66.8% at 5 years, p=0.005). Limb salvage rates did not vary between the groups (p=0.83). Survival rates were comparable at 5 years (83.3% and 82.6% for men and women, respectively; p=0.63), although female patients were older at their presentation (68.5 vs. 74.3 years, p<0.001). Female gender was an independent risk factor for restenosis for TASC C/D lesions (primary patency rate 39.8% in women vs. 62.0% in men; p=0.002). Finally, critical limb ischemia was an independent risk factor for restenosis in women (odds ratio 1.5). CONCLUSION Female gender was associated with a higher prevalence of critical limb ischemia, poorer secondary patency, and more frequent restenosis in TASC C/D lesions. Endovascular treatment of femoropopliteal lesions provides equal results between genders in terms of primary stent patency in the long term.","Stavroulakis, Konstantinos; Donas, Konstantinos P; Torsello, Giovanni; Osada, Nani; Schönefeld, Eva",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602814564382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775677/,611
109723,Can Telehealth Advance Professional Equity for Women in Medicine?,2021-03-03,"BACKGROUND There are sparse patient-level data available for children with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, there is an urgent need for an updated systematic literature review that analyzes individual children rather than aggregated data in broad age groups. METHODS Six databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Google Scholar, medRxiv) were searched for studies indexed from January 1 to May 15, 2020, with MeSH terms: children, pediatrics, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. 1241 records were identified, of which only unique papers in English with individual patient information and documented COVID-19 testing were included. This review of 22 eligible studies followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of individual participant data guidelines. RESULTS A total of 123 patients from five countries were identified. 46% were females. The median age was 5 years (IQR = 8). At presentation, 62% had a fever, 32% had a cough, 58% had a single symptom, and 21% were asymptomatic. Abnormal chest imaging was seen in 62% (65/105) of imaged and 76.9% (20/26) of asymptomatic children. A minority of children had elevated platelets, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. CONCLUSION Data from this independent participant data systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. IMPACT This systematic review revealed that the majority of children with COVID-19 presented with either no symptoms or a single, non-respiratory symptom. By using an independent participant data approach, this analysis underscores the challenge of diagnosing COVID-19 in pediatric patients due to the wide variety of symptoms and seemingly poor correlation of imaging findings with symptomatic disease.

We explored various induction parameters including media composition, temperature, pH, and methanol concentration, to optimize conditions for sEDIII-2 expression in shake flask culture. Induction at 20°C in the presence of 2% (v/v) methanol in a medium buffered to pH 5.8 resulted in highest secretion of sEDIII-2. This yield could be further enhanced up to 70% by repeated induction of the same initial biomass. Using a fed-batch cultivation strategy, we observed that shake-flask yields can be scaled up ∼8-fold in a bioreactor. We obtained ∼94% purity with >70% recovery after purification. This study, which demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of secreting envelope domain III using the P. pastoris host, will be relevant to sub-unit approaches to dengue vaccine development.","Batra, Gaurav; Gurramkonda, Chandrasekhar; Nemani, Satish Kumar; Jain, Swatantra Kumar; Swaminathan, Sathyamangalam; Khanna, Navin",Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiosc.2010.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20538539/,611

AIM This original research aimed to study the perspectives of pregnant women in Australia in relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their pregnancy experience. METHODS A qualitative descriptive study design with semi-structured interviews was adopted. The study was performed in Melbourne, Australia. A total of fifteen interviews were conducted. Data was analysed thematically to develop major themes and subthemes. RESULTS A total of four major themes were developed: support for a positive experience, impact on preparedness in pregnancy and beyond, facing uncertainty of a pandemic, and retaining resilience and optimism.

110856,"Obesity, self-reported symptom severity, and quality of life in people with atrial fibrillation: A community-based cross-sectional survey.",2020-07-17,"MAIN CONCLUSION Principal component and meta-QTL analyses identified genetic loci affecting the trade-off of wheat grain number and size, which could provide opportunities to optimize local breeding strategies for further yield improvement. Grain yield of wheat is complex, and its physiological and genetic bases remain largely unknown. Using the Forno/Oberkulmer recombinant inbred lines, this study validated the negative phenotypic relationships between thousand grain weight (TGW) and grain number components. This trade-off might be alleviated at the population level by early anthesis and at the shoot level by higher shoot biomass. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed three useful PCs, of which both PC1 and PC3 were positively associated with grain yield and grains m-2 through increased spikes m-2 (for PC1) or grains per spike (for PC3), while PC2 primarily reflected the trade-off of grain number and TGW. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping detected eight and seven loci for PC1 and PC2, respectively, on chromosomes 1D, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A and 7B, individually explaining 11.7‒29.3% of phenotypic variations. Using the 1203 QTLs published previously, a meta-analysis was performed to reveal 12, 21, 37 and 54 genomic regions (MQTLs) affecting grains m-2, spikes m-2, grains per spike and TGW, respectively. Moreover, 67 MQTLs (96%) for grain number were coincided with the TGW MQTLs, with reverse phenotypic effects, suggesting intensive genetic trade-off between grain number and size. The AGP2 gene, which encodes ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase determining TGW, was found by haplotype analysis in the Forno/Oberkulmer population to affect grain number oppositely, indicating this trade-off at the gene level. Appropriate combinations of the QTLs/genes for local breeding targets, such as higher grain number or larger grains, therefore, would be critical to achieve future yield gains.","Xie, Quan; Sparkes, Debbie L",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-021-03658-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117927/,611
112810,Telemedicine Utilization at an Academic Medical Center During COVID-19 Pandemic: Are Some Patients Being Left Behind?,2021-03-31,"PURPOSE This consensus review article considers the question of whether glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is still relevant in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, with a particular focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and whether its side effects can be adequately managed. Recent basic and clinical research on the molecular, cellular and clinical effects of GCs have considerably advanced our knowledge in this field. An overview of the subject seems appropriate. METHODS This review is the result of a multidisciplinary expert working group, organised by European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis. The recent literature was surveyed and the salient evidence synthetized. RESULTS The pathophysiological basis of RA (and other inflammatory rheumatic diseases) now strongly implicates the adaptive immune system in addition to innate mechanisms. The molecular effect of GCs and differential GC sensitivity is better understood, although exploiting this knowledge is still in its infancy. The newer treatment strategies of early and aggressive control of RA have gr eatly improved clinical outcomes, but improvements are still possible. Newer targeted anti-inflammatory drugs have made an important impact, yet they too are associated with numerous side effects. DISCUSSION Short durations of moderate doses of GCs are generally well tolerated and have a positive benefit/risk ratio. Patients should be assessed for fracture risk and bone preserving agents and be prescribed calcium and vitamin D supplementation. CONCLUSIONS Within a strategy of a disease modifying approach to inflammatory disease, combination therapy including a GC is effective approach.","Cooper, Cyrus; Bardin, Thomas; Brandi, Maria-Luisa; Cacoub, Patrice; Caminis, John; Civitelli, Roberto; Cutolo, Maurizio; Dere, Willard; Devogelaer, Jean-Pierre; Diez-Perez, Adolfo; Einhorn, Thomas A; Emonts, Patrick; Ethgen, Olivier; Kanis, John A; Kaufman, Jean-Marc; Kvien, Tore K; Lems, Willem F; McCloskey, Eugene; Miossec, Pierre; Reiter, Susanne; Ringe, Johann; Rizzoli, René; Saag, Kenneth; Reginster, Jean-Yves",Aging clinical and experimental research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-015-0522-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26746234/,611
114018,Association of COVID-19 With Race and Socioeconomic Factors in Family Medicine.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Intraoperative arterial hypotension can lead to severe complications in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, in particular if cerebral auto-regulation is impaired. Short-acting agents, such as phenylephrine or ephedrine, commonly used to correct intra-operative hypotension, have different hemodynamic effects. Recently, it was reported that, in healthy anesthetized subjects with intact cerebral auto-regulation, frontal lobe cerebral tissue oxygenation declined after phenylephrine bolus administration, while it was preserved after ephedrine use (Br J Anaesth 107:209-217, 2011; Neurocrit Care 12:17-23, 2010). However, the effect of both agents in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of two routinely used vasopressors (phenylephrine and ephedrine) on the cerebral hemodynamics during carotid endarterectomy. METHODS/DESIGN Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy will be prospectively included and randomized for correction of intraoperative hypotension with either phenylephrine (50 to 100 μg) or ephedrine (5 to 10 mg). If hypotension persists for more than five minutes after treatment, the patient will be classified as a non-responder and escape medication as preferred by the anesthesiologist will be administered. Changes in cerebral hemodynamics will be quantified by changes in transcranial Doppler-derived middle cerebral artery blood velocity and near infra-red spectroscopy-derived frontal lobe cerebral tissue oxygenation, when intra-operative hypotension is treated with phenylephrine or ephedrine in patients who undergo carotid endarterectomy with or without an adequate functioning cerebral auto-regulation.To quantify whether the intra-operative cerebral auto-regulation is impaired or not, a decrease in breathing frequency from the normal 12 breaths per minute to 6 breaths per minute for an episode of three minutes will be performed. DISCUSSION Phenylephrine and ephedrine are two of the most commonly used short-acting agents to increase blood pressure in clinical anesthesiologic practice. Monitoring of middle cerebral artery blood velocity with transcranial Doppler and frontal lobe cerebral tissue oxygenation with near infra-red spectroscopy are part of the standard of care. Furthermore, there are no reports that the three-minute modification in breathing frequency described in the ""intervention""-section is harmful. Therefore, the risks for participating patients are negligible and the burden minimal.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an association exists between the recently reported ZigZag pattern (FHR baseline amplitude changes of > 25 bpm with a duration of 2-30 min) and asphyxia-related neonatal outcomes in GDM pregnancies. METHODS Intrapartal CTGs were recorded in a one-year cohort of 5150 singleton childbirths. The following CTG changes were evaluated: ZigZag pattern, saltatory pattern, late decelerations, episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia, reduced variability, and uterine tachysystole. The cohort was divided into three groups: women with GDM, women with normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and women with no OGTT performed. Umbilical artery (UA) blood gases, Apgar scores, neonatal respiratory distress, and neonatal encephalopathy were used as outcome variables. RESULTS GDM was diagnosed in 624 (12.1%), OGTT was normal in 4115 (79.9%), and OGTT was not performed in 411 (8.0%) women. Hypoxia-related ZigZag patterns (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.64-2.34) and late decelerations (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-2.13) of FHR, as well as a greater risk of fetal asphyxia (UA pH < 7.10 and/or UA BE < -12.0 meq/L and/or Apgar scores < 7 at 5-min) (OR 6.64, 95% CI 1.84-12.03) were observed in those with GDM compared with those without GDM. CONCLUSIONS GDM is associated with intrapartal ZigZag pattern and late decelerations, cord blood acidemia and low 5-min Apgar scores at birth indicating increased occurrence of fetal hypoxia in GDM pregnancies.","Tarvonen, Mikko; Hovi, Petteri; Sainio, Susanna; Vuorela, Piia; Andersson, Sture; Teramo, Kari",Acta diabetologica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-021-01756-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151398/,611

An online survey was distributed through social networks during forced home confinement, collecting data from1298 participants of 19 different Italian regions. Chronotype was evaluated using the reduced version of the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ); sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); resilience levels were measured by the 10-item version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10); post-traumatic stress reactions were assessed by the 6-item version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES6). Resilience and sleep quality were significantly lower in the evening compared to non-evening types, as well as in females as compared to males. Moreover, resilience was negatively correlated with post-traumatic stress reactions and positively correlated with sleep quality. A negative correlation was also reported between sleep quality and post-traumatic stress reactions. Sleep quality was identified as a possible mediator between chronotype and resilience, and between resilience and post-traumatic stress reactions, after controlling for age and sex. These findings provide new insights into the role of chronotype in adapting to continuous stressful situations. Sleep quality seems to mediate the causal path between the antecedents of resilience and the development of trauma.

Understanding the unique characteristics of hospitalized DM patients with underlying malignancy is important in guiding development of specific work-up and treatment algorithms. OBJECTIVES We aim to characterize the inpatient burden of DM patients with malignancy (DM malignancy), determine unique characteristics of DM-malignancy inpatients, and assess trends and predictors of cost of care and length of stay for hospitalized DM-malignancy patients. METHODS Hospitalized DM patients with and without malignancy were characterized and compared using 2009-2015 National Inpatient Sample. Associated malignancies, risk factors for malignancy, and trends/predictors for cost of care and length of stay were evaluated using multivariable models. RESULTS Prevalence of malignancies among hospitalized DM inpatients was 10.9%. Age > 40 years and female sex were significantly associated with increased malignancy risk in DM inpatients. Numerous malignancies were significantly more common in men with DM compared to women, including bronchial, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head/neck, bladder, esophageal, kidney, and stomach. The most common malignancies in women with DM were breast and ovarian. Head/neck carcinomas were more common in hospitalized DM patients than previous cohorts evaluating outpatients. Socioeconomic characteristics differed between DM patients with/without malignancy. The presence of underlying malignancy did not affect hospitalization cost, length of stay, or mortality in the hospitalized DM population. The economic burden of hospitalized DM patients is increasing over time. CONCLUSIONS DM inpatients with malignancy display numerous differences compared to DM inpatients without malignancy. Further research characterizing hospitalized DM patients is warranted in order to optimize work-up and treatment guidelines for these patients.","Tripathi, Raghav; Fernandez, Anthony P",Archives of dermatological research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00403-020-02127-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803354/,611

METHODS A cohort comprised of 567 patients with COVID-19 at a large acute care healthcare system between 10 February 2020 and 7 April 2020 observed until either death or discharge. Random forest (RF) model was developed on randomly drawn 70% of the cohort (training set) and its performance was evaluated on the rest of 30% (the test set). The outcome variable was in-hospital mortality within 20-84 hours from the time of prediction. Input features included patients' vital signs, laboratory data and ECG results. RESULTS Patients had a median age of 60.2 years (IQR 26.2 years); 54.1% were men. In-hospital mortality rate was 17.0% and overall median time to death was 6.5 days (range 1.3-23.0 days). In the test set, the RF classifier yielded a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI: 78.2% to 94.3%), specificity of 60.6% (95% CI: 55.2% to 65.8%), accuracy of 65.5% (95% CI: 60.7% to 70.0%), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 85.5% (95% CI: 80.8% to 90.2%) and area under the precision recall curve of 64.4% (95% CI: 53.5% to 75.3%).

The behavior of implants in vivo is not sufficiently understood to design a surgical mesh mechanically compatible with the human abdominal wall. METHODS This analysis was based on radiological pictures of patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The pictures show the trunk of the patient at rest in a standing position and under side bending. The change in the distance between different tacks due to trunk movement was analyzed, which allowed us to determine the in vivo elongation of the mesh incorporated into the abdominal wall. FINDINGS The relative elongations of the surgical mesh varied from a few percent to greater than 100% in two cases. The median of the median relative elongations obtained for all patients is 9.5%, and the median of the maximum relative elongations for all patients is 32.6%.

Trunk movement causes implant deformation, and this study provides quantitative information regarding changes in the distance between fasteners. INTERPRETATION The physiological movement of the human abdomen must be regarded as a very important factor in mesh deformation and should be considered in surgical practice to reduce the hernia recurrence rate and postoperative pain.","Lubowiecka, Izabela; Tomaszewska, Agnieszka; Szepietowska, Katarzyna; Szymczak, Czesław; Śmietański, Maciej",Clinical biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2020.105076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32535476/,611

METHODS Data were evaluated of pregnant women who died following a laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The data were obtained from electronic medical records. Additionally, a questionnaire was completed for each patient, including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and treatment data. In case of missing information, a member of the research team contacted the first-degree relatives via phone. RESULTS Of 32 pregnant women who tested positive for COVID-19, 15 were enrolled into the study (mean age 30.0±5.0 years). The mean time from first symptoms to death was 12±7.0 days. Pre-existing comorbidities were seen in six patients. The main presentations at admission were fatigue and coughing, but most of the women had a fever below 38 °C. Increased white blood cell count and neutrophils were noticeable. A significant drop of saturation of O2 with ground glass and consolidation seen in both lungs were prominent. The most common complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome followed by respiratory failure. CONCLUSION Computed tomography findings, O2 pressure, and regular blood assessment may be considered suitable indicators for the surveillance of patients.","Moghadam, Soheila A; Dini, Parisa; Nassiri, Setare; Motavaselian, Mahtab; Hajibaba, Marzieh; Sohrabi, Masoudreza",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141933/,611
121747,Hospital admissions to geriatric ward related to adverse drug events: a cross-sectional study from the Czech Republic.,2021-03-24,"Background Remifentanil infusion during emergence lowers cough. Effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil using target-controlled infusion (TCI) has been evaluated in previous studies. Recent studies revealed the existence of sex-related differences in remifentanil Ce in young and elderly patients. Thus, there was the need to re-evaluate the effect of age in single sex. We investigated the remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough in young and elderly male patients and evaluated the age-related differences. Patients and methods In total, 25 young (ages between 20 and 50 years) and 24 elderly (ages between 65 and 75 years) male patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled. Anesthesia was implemented with remifentanil using TCI and sevoflurane. The remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough was estimated for each group using Dixon's up-and-down method and isotonic regression method with a bootstrapping approach. Results The remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough in 50% (EC50) and 95% (EC95) of the patients was comparable between the young and elderly patients. Isotonic regression demonstrated that the EC50 (83% confidence interval [CI]) of remifentanil was 2.56 (2.39-2.75) ng/mL in the young patients and 2.15 (1.92-2.5) ng/mL in the elderly patients. The EC95 (95% CI) of remifentanil was 3.33 (2.94-3.46) ng/mL in the young patients and 3.41 (3.18-3.48) ng/mL in the elderly patients. Dixon's up-and-down method also demonstrated that the EC50 was comparable between the two groups (2.69±0.32 ng/mL vs 2.39±0.38 ng/mL, P=0.132). Conclusion The remifentanil Ce for suppressing emergence cough following extubation during general anesthesia was comparable between young and elderly male patients. It indicates that age-related differences in remifentanil requirement for suppressing emergence cough did not exist in male sex.","Kim, Ha Yeon; Lee, Sook Young; Kang, Seyoon; Kim, Bora; Moon, Yeo Rae; Kim, Ji Eun",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s166423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29881261/,611
122593,It Takes a Region: Rural-Academic Partnerships to Decrease Health Inequity During the Pandemic.,2021-02-05,"PURPOSE To report the incidence and risk factors for contrast material ( CM contrast material )-induced nephropathy ( CIN CM-induced nephropathy ) in patients with no history of chronic kidney disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate that exceeded 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) after a relatively high dose of CM contrast material (≥250 mL) during neuroendovascular procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS An institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who received a dose of CM contrast material 250 mL or greater while they underwent a neuroendovascular procedure between January 2011 and February 2013. The control group consisted of comparable patients who received a CM contrast material dose of 75-249 mL during the same period. Patients with pre-existing estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or less or documented history of chronic kidney disease were excluded. CIN CM-induced nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine 50% above the baseline or an absolute increase of 0.3 mg/dL at either 24 or 48 hours after the procedure. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student t test, χ(2) analysis, and mixed-model analysis of variance. RESULTS Clinical characteristics between the control and high-dose group were similar for age (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.69, 5.48; P = .70), sex (95% CI: 0.28, 0.43; P = .62), and ethnicity (95% CI: 0.42, 0.58; P = .47). The average volume of CM contrast material administered was 172 mL in the control group and 326 mL in the high-dose cohort (95% CI: 131.78, 175.05; P < .001). Of the 79 cases in the high-dose cohort, 36 (46%) received a CM contrast material dose between 250 and 299 mL, 29 (37%) received 300-399 mL, nine (11%) received 400-499 mL, and five (6%) received greater than 500 mL. By 48 hours, a statistically significant decrease in serum creatinine was seen in two of the four high-dose CM contrast material dose categories: 250-299 mL (decrease of 24%; [95% CI: 0.04, 0.36]; P = .003) and greater than 500 mL (decrease of 14% [95% CI: -0.33, 0.57]; P = .007). There were four cases (5%) of CIN CM-induced nephropathy : three (4%) at 24 hours and one (1%) at 48 hours. The comorbid rate of diabetes (25% vs 15% [95% CI: -0.01, 0.04]; P < .001) was found to be higher among those who developed CIN CM-induced nephropathy compared with those who did not within the high-dose cohort. No cases of CIN CM-induced nephropathy occurred in the control group. CONCLUSION Risk of developing CIN CM-induced nephropathy is relatively low in patients who undergo neuroendovascular procedures with CM contrast material doses of 250 mL or greater.","Prasad, Vikram; Gandhi, Dheeraj; Stokum, Carly; Miller, Timothy; Jindal, Gaurav",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.14131104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102293/,611
122618,STFM Podcasts Launch With a Celebration of Family Medicine's Critical Front Line Leadership (STFM).,2020-07-01,"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to sequentially investigate the biomechanical effects of anterosuperior rotator cuff tear size on superior and anterosuperior translation, including tears interrupting the anterior cable attachment and the anterior force couple. METHODS Five cadaveric shoulders were subjected to different loading conditions in both the superior and anterosuperior directions in the intact state, with the supraspinatus cut and with sequentially larger anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. RESULTS Isolated tears of the supraspinatus had no significant biomechanical consequences under any condition tested. Anterosuperior translation was greater than superior translation in the intact specimen and for every combination of anterosuperior rotator cuff defect. With the supraspinatus and the superior half of the subscapularis (i.e., the anterior cable attachment) released, there was no significant increase in anterosuperior or superior glenohumeral translation in response to lower loading conditions (10 to 20 N). At higher loading conditions (40 to 50 N), tears of the supraspinatus and superior half of the subscapularis led to significantly increased translation in both directions. CONCLUSIONS Simulated anterosuperior rotator cuff tears involving the superior half of the subscapularis significantly alter shoulder biomechanics and lead to increased anterosuperior and superior glenohumeral translation under higher loads. The anterior attachment of the rotator cuff cable is therefore an important determinant of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears at higher loads but not at lower loads. Preserving the inferior half of the subscapularis was sufficient to maintain relatively normal shoulder kinematics under lower loading conditions. Tears of the entire subscapularis altered glenohumeral kinematics at essentially all loads. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Knowledge of the biomechanics of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears enhances our understanding of how to best treat these lesions.","Su, Wei-Ren; Budoff, Jeffrey E; Luo, Zong-Ping",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2008.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19245991/,611

This Commission aimed to document and reflect on the changes seen in the surgical environment during the pandemic, by reviewing colleagues' experiences and published evidence. METHODS In late 2020, BJS contacted colleagues across the global surgical community and asked them to describe how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had affected their practice. In addition to this, the Commission undertook a literature review on the impact of COVID-19 on surgery and perioperative care. A thematic analysis was performed to identify the issues most frequently encountered by the correspondents, as well as the solutions and ideas suggested to address them. RESULTS BJS received communications for this Commission from leading clinicians and academics across a variety of surgical specialties in every inhabited continent. The responses from all over the world provided insights into multiple facets of surgical practice from a governmental level to individual clinical practice and training. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered a variety of problems in healthcare systems, including negative impacts on surgical practice. Global surgical multidisciplinary teams are working collaboratively to address research questions about the future of surgery in the post-COVID-19 era. The COVID-19 pandemic is severely damaging surgical training. The establishment of a multidisciplinary ethics committee should be encouraged at all surgical oncology centres.

The baseline extent of brain stem ischemic damage can also influence outcomes. We evaluated the validity of an easy-to-use DWI score to predict clinical outcome in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion treated by mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed the baseline clinical and DWI parameters of 31 patients with acute basilar artery occlusion, treated within 24 hours of symptom onset by using a Solitaire FR device. The DWI score of the brain stem was assessed with a 12-point semiquantitative score that separately considered each side of the medulla, pons, and midbrain. Clinical outcome was assessed at 180 days by using the mRS. According to receiver operating characteristic analyses, the cutoff score determined the optimal positive predictive value for outcome. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient assessed the correlation between the DWI brain stem score and baseline characteristics. RESULTS Successful recanalization (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 3-2b) was achieved in 23 patients (74%). A favorable outcome (mRS ≤ 2) was observed in 11 patients (35%). An optimal DWI brain stem score of <3 predicted a favorable outcome. The probability of a very poor outcome (mRS ≥ 5) if the DWI brain stem score was ≥5 reached 80% (positive predictive value) and 100% if this score was ≥6. Interobserver reliability of the DWI brain stem score was excellent, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99). The DWI brain stem score was significantly associated with baseline tetraplegia (P = .001) and coma (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS In patients with acute basilar artery occlusion treated by mechanical thrombectomy, the baseline DWI brain lesion score seems to predict clinical outcome.","Mourand, I; Machi, P; Nogué, E; Arquizan, C; Costalat, V; Picot, M-C; Bonafé, A; Milhaud, D",AJNR.

For every study describing a lack of correlation between antemortem clinical and laboratory findings and postmortem culture results, there is equal evidence from other studies that indicates at least some limited utility in select cases. While the contributions of autopsies and postmortem microbiologic examinations in the discovery of novel infectious microorganisms are generally appreciated by the medical and scientific societies, the problems of implementing routine procedures in daily autopsy practice clearly relate to the lack of consensus on their broader utility as well as to a lack of regulatory guidelines. This review provides an overview of the literature-based evidence regarding the utility of postmortem microbiologic examinations together with some practical aspects and guidelines for those confronted with the issue of whether to allow or discourage the use of bacteriologic cultures obtained during autopsies.","Riedel, Stefan",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.03102-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24403308/,611

Between November 2009 and November 2014, 84 consecutive isolated pediatric LTs were performed in 81 children. Potential preoperative predictive factors for bleeding, amount of intra-operative transfusions, postoperative course, and outcome were recorded. Cutoff point for intra-operative HBL was defined as intra-operative RBC transfusions ≥1 TBV. Twenty-six patients (31%) had intra-operative HBL. One-year patient survival after LT was 66.7% (CI 95%=[50.2-88.5]) in HBL patients and 83.8% (CI 95%=[74.6-94.1]) in the others (P=.054). Among 13 potential preoperative risk factors, three of them were identified as independent predictors of high intra-operative bleeding: abdominal surgical procedure(s) prior to LT, factor V level ≤30% before transplantation, and ex situ parenchymal transsection of the liver graft. Based on these findings, we propose a simple score to predict the individual hemorrhagic risk related to each patient and graft association. This score may help to better anticipate intra-operative bleeding and improve patient's management.","Fanna, Martina; Baptiste, Amandine; Capito, Carmen; Ortego, Rocio; Pacifico, Raffaella; Lesage, Fabrice; Moulin, Florence; Debray, Dominique; Sissaoui, Samira; Girard, Muriel; Lacaille, Florence; Telion, Caroline; Elie, Caroline; Aigrain, Yves; Chardot, Christophe",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.12794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27681842/,611

Regrettably, acute pain is often underestimated and poorly managed in this setting. The scoping review was conducted to gain insight into existing research on the topic and to make recommendations for future work. Objectives To identify all available evidence related to acute pain assessment and management in the African prehospital setting, describe the extent of the evidence, encapsulate findings, and identify research gaps. Methods The scoping review considered primary and secondary research related to acute pain assessment and management of both medical and traumatic origins in all age groups in the African prehospital setting. The search strategy aimed to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing research which met the inclusion criteria. Potentially eligible studies were identified by a comprehensive search of electronic databases, trial registers, dissertation/thesis databases, grey literature databases, and conference proceedings. Screening and data extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. Results The comprehensive search identified 3823 potential studies, duplicate titles were removed, and 3358 titles/abstracts were screened. Full text of 66 potentially eligible titles was screened, 60 were excluded, and six publications met the inclusion criteria. Despite recommendations for pain assessment during general patient care, most studies reported no/limited pain assessment. In general, pain management was concluded to be insufficient and not conforming to best practice. Conclusions Only six publications addressing prehospital acute pain care in Africa could be identified, possibly indicative of a knowledge gap. Future research is indicated to enable a better understanding of the epidemiology of acute pain and barriers and enablers of acute pain care and to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) catering for all EMS systems in Africa. Additionally, educational initiatives should be implemented to improve the quality of acute pain care and to monitor quality through continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs.","Lourens, Andrit; McCaul, Michael; Parker, Romy; Hodkinson, Peter",Pain research & management,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/2304507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31149317/,611

To contribute to a better understanding of its pathogenesis, this study aims to identify proteins differentially expressed in plasmas from severe dengue fever patients relative to healthy donors. The use of 2-D Fluorescence Difference Gel Electrophoresis to analyze plasmas depleted of six high-abundance proteins (albumin, IgG, antitrypsin, IgA, transferrin and haptoglobin) allowed for the detection of 73 differentially expressed protein spots (n = 13, p < 0.01), of which 37 could be identified by mass spectrometry. These 37 spots comprised a total of 14 proteins, as follows: 7 had increased expression in plasmas from dengue fever patients (C1 inhibitor, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, vitamin D-binding protein, fibrinogen gamma-chain, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, apolipoprotein J and complement component C3c), while 7 others had decreased expression in the same samples (alpha-2 macroglobulin, prothrombin, histidine-rich glycoprotein, apolipoproteins A-IV and A-I, transthyretin and complement component C3b).

Nurses skilled in exercising self-care practices are better equipped to manage complex clinical situations. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of short mindfulness sessions (Mindful Moment) practiced prior to a shift, available in person and online, on nurse burnout and perceived levels of stress. The 8-week Mindful Moment study consisted of 20-minute sessions delivered either in person or online that included yoga, self-reflection, and meditation. Nurse burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Perceived stress was assessed using a visual analog scale before and after each Mindful Moment session. Descriptive statistics, pre/postintervention differences, and percent change calculations were used to evaluate study outcomes. Forty-seven nurses agreed to participate, with 20 nurses completing the study (43%). Participants were all female, aged 36.8 ± 9.8 years, with 12 ± 8.6 years of nursing experience. With respect to nurse burnout, there was a -31% change in emotional exhaustion (P = .079), a -31% change in depersonalization (P = .057), and a +10% change in personal accomplishment (P = .331). There were consistent reductions in nurses' perceived stress pre/post-Mindful Moment session, with percent changes ranging from -35% to 40%.

132838,A scoping review of interventions for older adults transitioning from hospital to home.,2021-06-19,"Fibromyalgia is a complex disease process that is as prevalent as it is poorly understood. Research into the pathophysiology is ongoing, and findings will likely assist in identifying new therapeutic options to augment those in existence today that are still insufficient for the care of a large population of patients. Recent evidence describes the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of fibromyalgia. This study provides a systematic, thorough review of the evidence alongside a review of the seminal data regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and current treatment options. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread chronic pain, fatigue, and depressive episodes without an organic diagnosis, which may be prevalent in up to 10% of the population and carries a significant cost in healthcare utilization, morbidity, a reduced quality of life, and productivity. It is frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidities. The diagnosis is clinical and usually prolonged, and diagnostic criteria continue to evolve. Some therapies have been previously described, including neuropathic medications, milnacipran, and antidepressants. Despite some level of efficacy, only physical exercise has strong evidence to support it. Cannabis has been used historically to treat different pain conditions since ancient times. Recent advances allowed for the isolation of the active substances in cannabis and the production of cannabinoid products that are nearly devoid of psychoactive influence and provide pain relief and alleviation of other symptoms. Many of these, as well as cannabis itself, are approved for use in chronic pain conditions. Evidence supporting cannabis in chronic pain conditions is plentiful; however, in fibromyalgia, they are mostly limited. Only a handful of randomized trials exists, and their objectivity has been questioned. However, many retrospective trials and patient surveys suggest the significant alleviation of pain, improvement in sleep, and abatement of associated symptoms. Evidence supporting the use of cannabis in chronic pain and specifically in fibromyalgia is being gathered as the use of cannabis increases with current global trends. While the current evidence is still limited, emerging data do suggest a positive effect of cannabis in fibromyalgia. Cannabis use is not without risks, including psychiatric, cognitive, and developmental as well as the risks of addiction. As such, clinical judgment is warranted to weigh these risks and prescribe to patients who are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Further research is required to define appropriate patient selection and treatment regimens.","Berger, Amnon A; Keefe, Joseph; Winnick, Ariel; Gilbert, Elasaf; Eskander, Jonathan P; Yazdi, Cyrus; Kaye, Alan D; Viswanath, Omar; Urits, Ivan",Best practice & research.

METHODS Adults from the United States with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from the ArthritisPower Patient-Powered Research Network and CreakyJoints patient community completed surveys. Concerns and behaviors were compared among patients with different autoimmune conditions, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) use, and geographic measures of urban status, income, education, and COVID-19 activity. RESULTS Among 1,517 participants (925 RA, 299 PsA, 185 AS, 108 SLE), mean age was 55.1 years, 88.3% were female, and 89.5% white. COVID-19 concerns were similar across the country and were higher in biologic users (p < 0.001). Avoidance of doctor's office visits (56.6%) or laboratory testing (42.3%) and use of telehealth (29.5%) were more common in urban areas. Among participants on DMARDs without COVID-19 or other respiratory illness, 14.9% stopped a DMARD, with 78.7% of DMARD interruptions not recommended by a physician. DMARD stopping was more common participants with lower socioeconomic status and in participants who avoided an office visit [OR 1.46(1.04-2.04)] or reported lack of telehealth availability [OR 2.26(1.25-4.08)]. CONCLUSION In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with RA, PsA, AS, and SLE frequently avoided office visits and laboratory testing. DMARD interruptions commonly occurred without the advice of a physician and were associated with socioeconomic status, office visits, and telehealth availability, highlighting the need for adequate healthcare access and attention to vulnerable populations during the pandemic.","George, Michael; Venkatachalam, Shilpa; Banerjee, Shubhasree; Baker, Joshua F; Merkel, Peter A; Gavigan, Kelly; Curtis, David; Danila, Maria I; Curtis, Jeffrey R; Nowell, W Benjamin",The Journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.201017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33191284/,611

We describe the safety and effectiveness of the self-expanding, fully retrievable Separator 3D device as a component of the Penumbra System in revascularization of large artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke. The 3D secures thrombus with lesional aspiration and functions by retrieving or debulking the clot. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospective, single-center pilot study of 20 patients with an acute ischemic stroke secondary to a large artery occlusion within 9 h from symptom onset. The occlusion sites were middle cerebral artery in nine patients, internal carotid artery terminus in eight patients, and basilar artery in three patients. Thrombectomy was performed in 18 patients who had previously received IV rtPA, and of these, two patients had prior failed treatment with the Solitaire stent. One patient had prior failed treatment with the Revive stent. RESULTS Successful revascularization defined by Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3 was achieved in 17 of 20 (85%) treated vessels. The median time from symptom onset to recanalization was 4.4 h (interquartile range 3.8-5.6 h). No procedural complications occurred, and no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was observed. Three (15%) patients died. At 90 days, 50% of patients showed good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 2). CONCLUSION Early results suggest that the Separator 3D, which combines a retriever with lesional aspiration, enables safe and effective revascularization.","Mpotsaris, A; Bussmeyer, M; Weber, W",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-013-0242-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23892954/,611
134081,Socio-behavioural impact of COVID-19 on general population: A cross-sectional survey of one thousand seventy-nine participants across India between the first and the second wave of pandemic.,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and their cardiac tissue distribution profile and anticalcification abilities are associated with risk of aortic stenosis (AS) progression. METHODS Out of the five different classes of DPP-4 inhibitors, two had relatively favourable heart to plasma concentration ratios and anticalcification ability in murine and in vitro experiments and were thus categorised as 'favourable'. We reviewed the medical records of 212 patients (72±8 years, 111 men) with diabetes and mild-to-moderate AS who underwent echocardiographic follow-up and classified them into those who received favourable DPP-4 inhibitors (n=28, 13%), unfavourable DPP-4 inhibitors (n=69, 33%) and those who did not receive DPP-4 inhibitors (n=115, 54%). RESULTS Maximal transaortic velocity (Vmax) increased from 2.9±0.3 to 3.5±0.7 m/s during follow-up (median, 3.7 years), and the changes were not different between DPP-4 users as a whole and non-users (p=0.143). However, the favourable group showed significantly lower Vmax increase than the unfavourable or non-user group (p=0.018). Severe AS progression was less frequent in the favourable group (7.1%) than in the unfavourable (29.0%; p=0.03) or the non-user (29.6%; p=0.01) group. In Cox regression analysis after adjusting for age, baseline renal function and AS severity, the favourable group showed a significantly lower risk of severe AS progression (HR 0.116, 95% CI 0.024 to 0.551, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS DPP-4 inhibitors with favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties were associated with lower risk of AS progression. These results should be considered in the preparation of randomised clinical trials on the repositioning of DPP-4 inhibitors.","Lee, Sahmin; Lee, Seung-Ah; Choi, Bongkun; Kim, Ye-Jee; Oh, Soo Jin; Choi, Hong-Mi; Kim, Eun Kyoung; Kim, Dae-Hee; Cho, Goo-Yeong; Song, Jong-Min; Park, Seung Woo; Kang, Duk-Hyun; Song, Jae-Kwan",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-317024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917732/,611

However, mRNA can also induce an immune response with associated toxicity. Replacement of uridine bases with pseudouridine has been postulated to modulate both mRNA immunogenicity and potency. Here, we explore the immune response and activity of lipid nanoparticle-formulated unmodified and pseudouridine-modified mRNAs administered systemically in vivo. Pseudouridine modification to mRNA had no significant effect on lipid nanoparticle physical properties, protein expression in vivo, or mRNA immunogenicity compared to unmodified mRNA when delivered systemically with liver-targeting lipid nanoparticles, but reduced in vitro transfection levels. Indicators of a transient, extracellular innate immune response to mRNA were observed, including neutrophilia, myeloid cell activation, and up-regulation of four serum cytokines. This study provides insight into the immune responses to mRNA lipid nanoparticles, and suggests that pseudouridine modifications may be unnecessary for therapeutic application of mRNA in the liver.","Kauffman, Kevin J; Mir, Faryal F; Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth; Kaczmarek, James C; Hurtado, Juan E; Yang, Jung H; Webber, Matthew J; Kowalski, Piotr S; Heartlein, Michael W; DeRosa, Frank; Anderson, Daniel G",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27680591/,611

Little is known, however, about gastric emptying after distal gastrectomy. The aim of our study was to investigate gastric emptying patterns after distal gastrectomy. Methods This gastric-emptying study investigated patients who underwent distal gastrectomy in the 6 months or more before May 2008 to July 2013 at Chungbuk National University Hospital with a study sample of 205 patients. We analyzed patterns of gastric emptying. Results Delayed gastric emptying was found in 109 of the 205 patients (53.2%). Food stasis was more frequent in a group with delayed gastric emptying. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for gastroparesis were laparoscopic operation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.731; P = 0.008) and duration of less than 24 months after distal gastrectomy (HR, 2.795; P = 0.001). Delayed gastric emptying tended to decrease with duration of the postoperative period. Conclusion Delayed gastric emptying is common in distal gastrectomy, and is related to laparoscopic operation and duration of the postoperative period. Food stasis was more frequent in a group with delayed gastric emptying.","Kim, Dae Hoon; Yun, Hyo Yung; Song, Young-Jin; Ryu, Dong Hee; Han, Hye-Suk; Han, Joung-Ho; Kim, Ki Bae; Yoon, Soon Man; Youn, Sei Jin",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2017.93.6.310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29250510/,611

However, the OAM states of magnons (spin waves)-the building block of modern magnetism-and particularly their implications have yet to be addressed. Here, we theoretically investigate the twisted spin-wave generation and propagation in magnetic nanocylinders. The OAM nature of magnons is uncovered by showing that the spin-wave eigenmode is also the eigenstate of the OAM operator in the confined geometry. Inspired by optical tweezers, we predict an exotic ""magnetic tweezer"" effect by showing skyrmion gyrations under twisted magnons in the exchange-coupled nanocylinder-nanodisk heterostructure, as a practical demonstration of magnonic OAM transfer to manipulate topological spin defects. Our study paves the way for the emerging magnetic manipulations by harnessing the OAM degree of freedom of magnons.","Jiang, Yuanyuan; Yuan, H Y; Li, Z-X; Wang, Zhenyu; Zhang, H W; Cao, Yunshan; Yan, Peng",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.217204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530668/,611

During 2012, a total of 4314 normotensive daytime employees (3153 men and 1161 women) were included in this study. Participants had a wide range of occupations and were employed at one of 12 workplaces from various economic sectors in Japan. After a 2-year follow-up, incident hypertension was compared among groups according to household income: <5.0, 5.0-7.9, 8.0-9.9, and ≥10.0 million Japanese yen (¥)/year. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratio for incident hypertension in each household income group, compared with the group earning <5.0 million ¥/year. The hazard ratios for men were 1.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.18) for 5.0-7.9 million ¥/year, 1.49 (0.98-2.27) for 8.0-9.9 million ¥/year, and 1.92 (1.23-3.01) for ≥10.0 million ¥/year after adjusting for age, baseline systolic blood pressure, worksite, type of occupation, number of family members, and smoking status. This positive relationship was attenuated but remained significant after further adjustment for alcohol consumption and body mass index, both of which were higher among men with higher household income. Conversely, there was no significant difference for women in the risk of incident hypertension among household income groups, although those with higher household income tended to have a lower risk of incident hypertension. Household income is positively associated with the onset of hypertension in Japanese employed men working daytime hours.","Yanagiya, Shingo; Nakamura, Koshi; Ukawa, Shigekazu; Tsutsumi, Akizumi; Atsumi, Tatsuya; Tamakoshi, Akiko",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41440-020-0517-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830197/,611

However, Ce2O3 NPs have not been further investigated in the treatment of acute oxidative injury in vivo. It is meaningful to improve the efficiency for treatment of acute oxidative injury with NPs in vivo. In this report, we designed Er3+-doped Ce2O3 (Er/Ce2O3) NPs with a size of 7.9 nm, which were used to treat acute liver injury. Er/Ce2O3 NPs realized high-efficiency catalysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at room temperature. An acute liver damage model was established through intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C57 mice. By analyzing histopathological and biochemical indexes, Er/Ce2O3 NPs showed a significant improvement in LPS-induced acute liver injury. Acute liver oxidative damage can be treated within 24 hours, which proved the high catalytic efficiency of Er/Ce2O3 NPs in vivo. The activities of SOD, GPx and CTA increased and production of ROS decreased with Er/Ce2O3 NP treatment in comparison with LPS-induced injury, indicating that the mechanism of Er/Ce2O3 NPs in the treatment of acute oxidative damage of liver was mainly via catalysis of ROS products. Moreover, the protein expression levels of TNF-α, CD45 and IL-1β in liver decreased in the Er/Ce2O3 NPs-treated group, which indicated that Er/Ce2O3 NPs have the function of anti-inflammation property. Therefore, Er/Ce2O3 NPs can be applied to treat and prevent diseases caused by acute oxidative damage.","Li, Yongmei; Li, Yuemei; Bai, Yandong; Lin, Laixiang; Sun, Yina",Journal of materials chemistry.

141907,Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of intra-arterial treatment (IAT) on early recovery from aphasia in acute ischemic stroke. We hypothesized that the early effect of IAT on aphasia is smaller than the effect on motor deficits. METHODS We included patients with aphasia from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), in which 500 patients with a proximal anterior circulation stroke were randomized to usual care plus IAT (<6 hours after stroke, mainly stent retrievers) or usual care alone. We estimated the effect of IAT on the shift on the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) item language and the NIHSS item motor arm at 24 hours and 1 week after stroke with multivariable ordinal logistic regression as a common odds ratio, adjusted for prognostic variables (acOR). Differences between the effect of IAT on aphasia and on motor deficits were tested in a multilevel model with a multiplicative interaction term. RESULTS Of the 288 patients with aphasia, 126 were assigned to IAT and 162 to usual care alone. The acOR for improvement of language score at 24 hours was 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-2.60), and at 1 week 1.86 (95% CI 1.18-2.94). The acOR for improvement of motor deficit at 24 hours was 2.44 (95% CI 1.54-3.88), and at 1 week 2.32 (95% CI 1.43-3.77). The effect of IAT on language deficits was significantly different from the effect on motor deficits at 24 hours and 1 week (p = 0.005 and p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS IAT results in better early recovery from aphasia than usual care alone. The early effect of IAT on aphasia is smaller than the effect on motor deficits. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with acute ischemic stroke IAT increases early recovery from aphasia and that the early effect on aphasia, as measured by the NIHSS, is smaller than the effect on motor deficits.","Crijnen, Yvette S; Nouwens, Femke; de Lau, Lonneke M L; Visch-Brink, Evy G; van de Sandt-Koenderman, Mieke W M E; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Fransen, Puck S S; Beumer, Debbie; van den Berg, Lucie A; Lingsma, Hester F; Roos, Yvo B W E M; van der Lugt, Aad; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van Zwam, Wim H; Majoie, Charles B L M; Dippel, Diederik W J",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27170565/,611

144904,COVID-19 and children. From Luis Sepulveda to Madam Mim.,2020-07-04,"Context Melanoma treatment has substantially changed over the last several years, yet little information regarding physician's preferences around treatment exists. Objective Our aim is to describe the results of the CancerMPact (CMP) survey performed in 2019 about the treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma. Methods CMP is a data source from Kantar, Health Division, containing data on cancer epidemiology and treatment. Once a year, Kantar performs a series of surveys with specialists in the field of interest in the United States of America (USA), Western Europe (WE), Japan, and China. The results of the survey reported in this work comprise the answers from 94 USA and 99 WE physicians about the treatment of melanoma. Results In the first-line for the BRAF wild-type population, immuno-oncology (IO) drugs including nivolumab, ipilimumab or pembrolizumab (alone or in combination) were used in 80.1% of the cases in the USA and 70.6% in WE. Conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments were used in 16.4% of the USA patients and 28.2% in WE. In the second-line in the USA, 45.8% of BRAF wild-type patients received IO drugs, while 45.0% of patients received conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments. The majority of patients with BRAF mutant advanced/metastatic melanoma were treated in the first-line with BRAF-targeted therapy (61.3% USA, 71.9% WE), and few patients received conventional chemotherapy or cytokine-based treatments (11.9% USA, 12.4% WE); the most commonly used BRAF-targeted therapy was the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib. In the second-line, BRAF mutant patients received IO drugs (45.1% USA, 53.7% WE), targeted therapy (37.6% USA, 32% WE) or conventional chemotherapy/cytokine-based treatments (14.4% USA, 11.7% WE). Conclusion The use of IO or targeted therapy for patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma is the preferred treatment strategy by physicians in the USA and WE based on BRAF mutation status. Many patients still receive conventional chemotherapies or cytokines with unsubstantial benefit, especially in recurrent patients of BRAF wild type.","Hawthorne, Stephanie; Zhao, Linda; Hanson, Madelyn; Kanas, Gena; Davis, Christine; Robinson, David; Turnure, Matthew; Clark, Otavio",Cancer management and research,https://doi.org/10.2147/cmar.s263468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765066/,611

The procedure success rate in the DEFINITIVE LE study was determined using radiologic imaging. The aim of our study was to determine the usefulness of intraoperative ultrasonography (USG) during DA for evaluating the early results of this procedure. METHODS Patients who underwent DA from January to December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Twenty lesions from 14 patients with femoral artery stenosis (>70% stenosis) with short segment occlusive lesions (<2 cm in length) were treated. Among 20 lesions, 3 were treated with the TurboHawk system with a protective device due to lesion calcification. The percentage of stenosis during and after DA was determined with USG. RESULTS Median follow-up was 5.1 months, and the procedural success rate (<30% stenosis at the end of the procedure) was 100% on angiography, but only 30% on intraoperative USG. On USG, median residual stenosis was 40% (range, 28%-42%) at the end of DA, 40% (range, 30%-55%) at 1 month, 55% (range, 35%-85%) at 6 months, and 64% (range, 60%-100%) at 1 year. There was one dissection, but no cases of perforation, pseudoaneurysm, or thrombosis. Primary patency, which was defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio ≤3.5 with no reintervention at 6 months, was found in 18 lesions (90%), and 11 of 14 patients (78.6%) were free of ischemic symptoms such as claudication at 6 months. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrated that DA with intraoperative USG is an effective treatment option for short segment occlusive lesions of the femoral artery.","Park, Yoong-Seok; Heo, Seon-Hee; Hyun, Dong-Ho; Do, Young-Soo; Park, Hong-Suk; Park, Kwang-Bo; Kim, Young-Wook; Park, Yang-Jin; Lee, Chul-Hyung; Kim, Dong-Ik",Annals of surgical treatment and research,https://doi.org/10.4174/astr.2017.92.1.42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28090505/,611

METHODS We conducted a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of sunitinib in patients with advanced, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. All patients had Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors-defined disease progression documented within 12 months before baseline. A total of 171 patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive best supportive care with either sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg per day or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival; secondary end points included the objective response rate, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS The study was discontinued early, after the independent data and safety monitoring committee observed more serious adverse events and deaths in the placebo group as well as a difference in progression-free survival favoring sunitinib. Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the sunitinib group as compared with 5.5 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.66; P<0.001). A Cox proportional-hazards analysis of progression-free survival according to baseline characteristics favored sunitinib in all subgroups studied. The objective response rate was 9.3% in the sunitinib group versus 0% in the placebo group. At the data cutoff point, 9 deaths were reported in the sunitinib group (10%) versus 21 deaths in the placebo group (25%) (hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.89; P=0.02). The most frequent adverse events in the sunitinib group were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS Continuous daily administration of sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and the objective response rate as compared with placebo among patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

There were no obstruction and symptom after the mean follow-up of 40.7 months. We found 7 papers from PubMed, which had more than five cases of laparoscopic reconstruction of RCU. We reviewed and summarized the clinical and operative parameters. Conclusions Our results show that transperitoneal laparoscopic ureteroureterostomy with excision of the compressed ureter is a safe and effective treatment for RCU. Data from published papers and ours summarize clinical parameters of RCU, and suggest that the laparoscopic reconstruction can be considered as the standard treatment for it.","Seo, Ill Young; Oh, Tae Hoon; Jeon, Seung Hyun",Investigative and clinical urology,https://doi.org/10.4111/icu.2019.60.2.108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838343/,611

Objective To evaluate the outcomes of all-cause 30-day hospital encounter proportion among patients who have a postdischarge video-based virtual visit follow-up compared with in-person follow-up. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, active, controlled noninferiority trial in an urban setting, including patients from a small community hospital and a large, tertiary care hospital. Patients who underwent minimally invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy by a group of surgeons who cover emergency general surgery at these 2 hospitals were included. Patients undergoing elective and nonelective procedures were included. Interventions Patients were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to video-based virtual visit or in-person visit. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome is the percentage of patients with 30-day hospital encounter, and we hypothesized that there would not be a significant increase in the 30-day hospital encounter proportion for patients who receive video-based virtual postdischarge care compared with patients who receive standard (in-person) care. Hospital encounter includes emergency department visit, observation, or inpatient admission. Results A total of 1645 patients were screened; 289 patients were randomized to the virtual group and 143 to the in-person group. Fifty-three patients crossed over to the in-person follow-up group. The percentage of patients who had a hospital encounter was noninferior for virtual visits (12.8% vs 13.3% for in-person, Δ 0.5% with 1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 5.2%). The amount of time patients spent with the clinician (mean of 8.4 minutes virtual vs 7.8 minutes in-person; P = .30) was not different, but the median overall postoperative visit time was 27.5 minutes shorter (95% CI, -33.5 to -24.0). Conclusions and Relevance Postdischarge video-based virtual visits did not increase hospital encounter proportions and provided shorter overall time commitment but equal time with the surgical team member. This information will help surgeons and patients feel more confident in using video-based virtual visits.

The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations-to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.","Friston, Karl J; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Ollie J; Billig, Alexander J; Litvak, Vladimir; Moran, Rosalyn J; Price, Cathy J; Lambert, Christian",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15881.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832701/,611

Pathogenesis and the reason why cases have a mild or severe course in CCHF have not been explained. In this study, we investigated the relationship between promoter -2518 A/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of MCP-1 gene and clinical course of CCHF. MCP-1 -2518 A/G SNP (rs1024611)frequency was examined in 128 virologically/serologically confirmed CCHF patients and 181 healthy controls by using PCR-RFLP method. When CCHF patients and controls were compared, no significant difference was found between genotype distributions and allele frequencies of -2518 A/G SNP of MCP-1 gene (p>0.05). Compared to the AA genotype, both AG (p=0.016; OR= 2.57) and GG genotype (p=0.039; OR=3.43) were found significantly higher frequency in mild/moderate cases than in severe cases. Compared to AG + GG genotype, AA showed a significant risk for severe CCHF (60.0% vs. 38.4%, p=0.02; OR=2.41). In contrast, AG genotype showed a significant protective effect against severe disease compared to AA + GG genotype (29.1% vs. 47.9%, p=0.013; OR=2.58). Compared to mild/moderate cases, the A allele was found to be significantly higher in severe cases (0.745 vs. 0.623, p=0.039; OR=1.77). However, no significant relationship was found between fatal and non-fatal cases in terms of genotype or allele frequencies (p>0.05). In conclusion, both -2518 AA genotype and A allele of MCP-1 were associated with the disease severity, and AG genotype had protective effect against severe disease course in CCHF patients.

METHODS To evaluate the systematic effects of elastic abdominal belts on the trunk musculature, a total of 36 persons with acute lumbar back pain (no longer than one week) were divided into two groups: an abdominal belt wearing group (B) and a non-abdominal belt wearing control group (C). All were examined over a period of three weeks at three time points: T1 just after assignment, T2 one week later, and T3 further two weeks later. Surface EMG (sEMG) was used to record trunk muscle activation when walking on a treadmill at walking speeds of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 km/h. Similarly, pain intensity (VAS) and functional impairment (ODI) over time were recorded in both groups. RESULTS Over the observation period, a slight advantage for decreased pain intensity (C: p<0.05 T2 vs. T1; B: p<0.01 T2 vs. T1, p<0.05 T3 vs. T1) and decreased functional impairment (Cohen's d vs. T1, C: T2 0.45, T3 0.86; B: T2 1.1, T3 1.0) was observed for the belt group. For the belt group both oblique abdominal muscles exhibited significantly lower sEMG throughout the observation period (external abdominal oblique muscle: (T1), T2, (T3), internal abdominal oblique muscle: T1, (T2), (T3)) and the sEMG for the back muscles ranged from unchanged to slightly elevated for this group, but never reached statistical significance. DISCUSSION The reduced abdominal amplitude levels in the belt group likely result from the permanent elastic stabilization provided by the belt: the required elevated intra-abdominal pressure to enhance spinal stability is then provided by lessened abdominal muscle activity complemented by the belt's elastic support. With regard to the back muscles, the belt, due to its movement-restricting effect, tends to activate the paravertebral musculature. In this respect, the effect of elastic abdominal belts on the trunk muscles is not uniform. Therefore, the present results suggest that the effect of elastic abdominal belts appears to be more of a temporary neutral alteration of trunk muscle coordination, with some trunk muscles becoming more active and others less, and not a case of uniform deconditioning as is suspected.","Anders, Christoph; Hübner, Agnes",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677095/,611

Unphysiologically high doses of glucocorticoids that do not follow the circadian rhythm lead to increased rates of morbidity, mortality and reduced quality of life. OBJECTIVES Does a switch to modified-release hydrocortisone in multimorbid elderly patients offer benefits compared to a conventional therapy regime? METHODS Evaluation, analysis and discussion of statistics, recent research results and expert advice. RESULTS Overdosage and unphysiological timing of cortisol administration result in higher incidences of obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, coronary heart disease and cardiac events. Body weight, body mass index and HbA1c decline with Plenadren® (Shire Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, Dublin, Ireland) treatment compared to conventional therapy. CD16+ natural killer cells and natural killer cytotoxycity are reduced, and the incidence of respiratory-tract infections is increased, with conventional therapy compared to Plenadren®. Cortisol influences sleep pattern and sleep quality by its circadian secretion. CONCLUSION Novel modified-release hydrocortisone preparations offer diverse benefits with regard to their effect on metabolism, cardiovascular risk, immunity and sleep, which might be beneficial in particular in multimorbid elderly.","Nowotny, H; Reisch, N",Der Internist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00108-020-00795-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394073/,611

Flaviviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV) induce reorganization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes to facilitate viral replication. Here, using 3D super resolution microscopy, ZIKV infection is shown to induce the formation of dense tubular matrices associated with viral replication in the central ER. Viral non-structural proteins NS4B and NS2B associate with replication complexes within the ZIKV-induced tubular matrix and exhibit distinct ER distributions outside this central ER region. Deep neural networks trained to identify ZIKV-infected versus mock-infected cells successfully identified ZIKV-induced central ER tubular matrices as a determinant of viral infection. Super resolution microscopy and deep learning are therefore able to identify and localize morphological features of the ER and may be of use to screen for inhibitors of infection by ER-reorganizing viruses.","Long, Rory K.

Sister to Anchomanes, Pseudohydrosme is distinct from Anchomanes because of its 2–3-locular ovary (not unilocular), peduncle concealed by cataphylls at anthesis and far shorter than the spathe (not exposed, far exceeding the spathe), stipitate fruits and viviparous (vegetatively apomictic) roots (not sessile, roots non-viviparous). Three species, one new to science, are recognised, in two sections. Although doubt has previously been cast on the value of recognising Pseudohydrosme buettneri, of Gabon, it is here accepted and maintained as a distinct species in the monotypic section, Zyganthera. However, it is considered to be probably globally extinct. Pseudohydrosme gabunensis, type species of the genus, also Gabonese, is maintained in Sect. Pseudohydrosme together with Pseudohydrosme ebo sp.nov. of the Ebo Forest, Littoral, Cameroon, the first addition to the genus since the nineteenth century, and which extends the range of the genus 450 km north from Gabon, into the Cross-Sanaga biogeographic area. The discovery of Pseudohydrosme ebo resulted from a series of surveys for conservation management in Cameroon, and triggered this paper. All three species of Pseudohydrosme are morphologically characterised, their habitat and biogeography discussed, and their extinction risks are respectively assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), Endangered and Critically Endangered using the IUCN standard. Clearance of forest habitat for logging, followed by agriculture or urbanisation are major threats.

However, our understanding of the effect of urban biodiversity interventions on the human microbiota remains limited, especially on the skin (Hui et al. 2019; Roslund et al. 2020) and in the context of permanent green spaces (Lehtimäki et al. 2018; Selway et al. 2020). Here, we test the short-term response of experimentally disturbed bacterial communities on the skin of healthy children exposed to different school environments – either a ‘classroom’, a ‘sports field’, or a biodiverse ‘forest’ – to understand how exposures to different types of biodiversity may influence skin microbiota. Children exposed to the ‘forest’ had significantly increased skin microbiota diversity when compared to pre-exposure, an effect that increased over three days suggesting long-term effects. The microbiota on children exposed to the ‘forest’ had the largest structural and compositional community change compared to children exposed to ‘sports fields’, which in turn was larger than those who remained in ‘classrooms’. Children exposed to ‘sports fields’ and ‘forests’ also acquired new core bacteria after exposure to green spaces, potentially buffering against disturbances to the skin microbiota’s diversity, while individuals who remained in the ‘classroom’ lost microbes throughout the experiment. Overall, we conclude that urban green spaces can have an enriching influence on the diversity of skin microbiota, including core members shared between all children. These findings have important implications for the design and construction of new school yards and public spaces with respect to biodiversity, health, and human microbiota.","Mills, Jacob G.; Selway, Caitlin A.; Thomas, Torsten; Weyrich, Laura S.; Lowe, Andrew J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.448749,611

To better understand their impact on gut microbiota, we analysed the bacterial, protozoal, fungal and helminth communities of stool samples collected from children that had previously been recruited to a cluster randomized controlled trial of micronutrient supplementation in Pakistan. We show that while bacterial diversity was reduced in supplemented children, vitamins and iron may promote colonization with distinct protozoa and mucormycetes, whereas the addition of zinc ameliorates this effect. In addition to supplements, residence in a rural versus urban setting is an important determinant of eukaryotic composition.

Design Interpretative qualitative study employing thematic and linguistic analyses of metaphor embedded in interview data. Setting England and Scotland. Participants 24 bereaved parents (21 women, 3 men) Methods Participants were recruited through the True Colours Trust website and mailing list, similar UK charities, and word of mouth. Following interviews in person or via video-conferencing platforms (Skype/Zoom), transcripts first underwent thematic and subsequently linguistic analyses supported by Nvivo. A focused analysis of metaphors used by the parents was undertaken allow in-depth interpretation of how they conceptualised their experiences. Results The findings illuminate the ways parents experienced communication with healthcare practitioners surrounding the death of a child. They show how their evaluations of effective care relate to the experience of the bereavement itself, as expressed through metaphor. We identified three broad themes: (1) Identity (2) Emotional and Physical Response(s) and (3) Time. Successful communication from healthcare practitioners takes account of parents' experiences related to these themes. Conclusions This study suggests that healthcare practitioners when communicating with bereaved parents need to recognise, and seek to comprehend, the ways in which the loss impacts upon an individual's identity as a parent, the 'physical' nature of the emotions that can be unleashed, and the ways in which the death of a child can alter their metaphorical conceptions of time.","Turner, S.; Littlemore, J.; Topping, A.; Parr, E.; Taylor, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.08.21259704v1?rss=1,611

Thanks to their modular expandable wireless transceiver architecture, these radar chips offer implementing multimode radar sensors capable of deploying multiple radar techniques to detect object presence, range, velocity, vibrations and direction of arrival across multiple applications in conjunction with data communication capability for machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction. A 60GHz single-channel radar sensor prototype is implemented where the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar technique is applied for object detection and range measurement in a multitarget scenario. A range resolution of 6cm and a ranging precision of 0.1mm at 1m range are experimentally verified. Another two-channel sensor prototype is implemented where multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar technique is applied for direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation. An experiment of measuring vibration rates from multiple targets at different locations using Doppler radar technique is successfully conducted. This experiment simulates a remote control environment of running machines in factories. Furthermore, an experiment of monitoring a human heartbeat rate remotely by the sensor is performed where a 78bpm rate is measured. Such contactless measurement is extremely important to prevent disease spreading during pandemic seasons such as COVID-19.","Ahmad, W. A.; Wessel, J.; Ng, H.

The virus has now made the COVID-19 disease a worldwide epidemic. This virus has affected the global health, economy, and the daily lives of individuals. The timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial task as it reduces the risk of pandemic spread. Chest x-rays play an important role in the testing and diagnosis of COVID-19 disease in the recent pandemic. Advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Deep Learning have shown high efficiency in detecting patterns such as those that can be found in diseased tissue, so convolution neural networks were evaluated for their ability to detect infected patients from chest X-ray images. The key component of deep learning research is the availability of training data sets. In this study, a parallel Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) model has been proposed for the detection of covid-19 infected patients using chest X-ray radiographs. This paper also presents how to evaluate the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art CNN proposed by the scientific community about their expertise in the automatic diagnosis of Covid-19 from thoracic x-rays. To validate results, we trained the CNN model network by using 500 Covid-19 Positive images and 1600 Covid-19 Negative images.

The focus is on the interdependence and relation between African youth, African faith(s) and African environment within the context of spirituality and religiosity. Africa is a youth continent, where 200 million of the population is between the ages of 15 and 24 years of age. Although African people are known for their religiosity and spirituality, not much attention is given to these aspects when thinking of and planning for development. Speaking about African traditional beliefs, Africans live close to nature and the environment;traditionally, they were and some still are subsistence farmers, making a living from the natural environment, while most of the youth struggle to survive in a more industrialised, modern and global world. As such, the sustainability of development, especially in the form of urbanisation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution – which hit Africa as a reality with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – remains in question, where so many seemingly valuable developments have failed in the past. Contribution: The research question this article wants to answer is: What is unique in the contribution of missional diaconate as method of sustainable development amongst African youth in their context? The question is answered when missional diaconate is applied to the five elements of faith formation as discussed by Weber. It became clear from this article that while development is designed to overcome material needs, missional diaconate motivated from the unconditional love of God is focused on identity, relations and values.","Knoetze, Johannes J.",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,https://doi.org/10.4102/hts.v77i2.6607,611

The classic cardiovascular risk factors, like age, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Cardiovascular complications can have a diverse clinical presentation including silent myocardial injury, acute coronary syndromes, thromboembolism, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. There are multiple mechanisms of cardiac injury that are not mutually exclusive. The approach to diagnosis and management should be carried out according to usual practice, while considering the particularities of COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the heart is complex and is manifested in multiple ways. Regardless of the clinical presentation, cardiac complications convey a worse prognosis.

During that time, memory B cells express increasingly broad and potent antibodies that are resistant to mutations found in variants of concern1. As a result, vaccination of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines produces high levels of plasma neutralizing activity against all variants tested1, 2. Here, we examine memory B cell evolution 5 months after vaccination with either Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer- BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccines in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals. Between prime and boost, memory B cells produce antibodies that evolve increased neutralizing activity, but there is no further increase in potency or breadth thereafter. Instead, memory B cells that emerge 5 months after vaccination of naïve individuals express antibodies that are similar to those that dominate the initial response. While individual memory antibodies selected over time by natural infection have greater potency and breadth than antibodies elicited by vaccination, the overall neutralizing potency of plasma is greater following vaccination. These results suggest that boosting vaccinated individuals with currently available mRNA vaccines will increase plasma neutralizing activity but may not produce antibodies with breadth equivalent to those obtained by vaccinating convalescent individuals.","Cho, Alice; Muecksch, Frauke; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Wang, Zijun; Finkin, Shlomo; Gaebler, Christian; Ramos, Victor; Cipolla, Melissa; Mendoza, Pilar; Agudelo, Marianna; Bednarski, Eva; DaSilva, Justin; Shimeliovich, Irina; Dizon, Juan; Daga, Mridushi; Millard, Katrina; Turroja, Martina; Schmidt, Fabian; Zhang, Fengwen; Tanfous, Tarek Ben; Jankovic, Mila; Oliveria, Thiago Y.; Gazumyan, Anna; Caskey, Marina; Bieniasz, Paul D.; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Nussenzweig, Michel C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454333,611

The detection of the infection is quite tedious since it takes 3–14 days for the symptoms to surface in patients. Early detection of the infection and prohibiting it would limit the spread to only to Local Transmission. Deep learning techniques can be used to gain insights on the early detection of infection on the medical image data such as Computed Tomography (CT images), Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI images), and X-Ray images collected from the infected patients provided by the Medical institution or from the publicly available databases. The same techniques can be applied to do the analysis of infection rates and do predictions for the coming days. A wide range of open-source pre-trained models that are trained for general classification or segmentation is available for the proposed study. Using these models with the concept of transfer learning, obtained resultant models when applied to the medical image datasets would draw much more insights into the COVID-19 detection and prediction process. Innumerable works have been done by researchers all over the world on the publicly available COVID-19 datasets and were successful in deriving good results.

Adolescent girls and young women, men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender persons, and people who inject drugs continue to experience a high burden of new infections. Sexually transmitted infections during pregnancy can lead to a number of adverse outcomes in infants; novel strategies to detect and treat these infections are needed. Innovative HIV testing strategies, including self-testing and assisted partner services, are expanding the reach of testing; however, linkage to care can be improved. Novel preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery strategies are increasing uptake of PrEP in different groups, although adherence and persistence remain a challenge.

Instead of a simplistic approach where institutions react to long waiting times by growing capacity to meet demand, this paper emphasises the need to focus on the final intended outcome (timely diagnosis and treatment) rather than on a single performance indicator, such as waiting time. A broad systems approach at the national level is advocated, rather than piecemeal, uncoordinated actions by individual hospitals.","Wee, Shiou Liang; Kwok, Bernard W K; Tan, Chee Beng; Chua, Terrance S J","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18327353/,611

METHODS RT-PCR was performed using SARS coronavirus-specific primers to amplify the polymerase gene fragment of SARS-associated coronavirus from specimens of suspected and established SARS cases. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. All the obtained sequences were compared with the sequence of published SARS-associated coronavirus, and alignment was proceeded with other coronavirus sequences. RESULTS Specific amplicons can be amplified from the sputum samples, throat swab and plasma of most SARS patients, and 8 were random selected and sequenced. All of them possessed 100% homology with the published SARS-associated coronavirus sequence, while all the negative controls were RT-PCR negative. Nucleotide-sequence and amino acid-sequence alignment of the fragment BNI109 with other six known coronavirus show that the fragment BNI109 is more close to bovine coronavirus(BCV) and murine hepatitis virus(MHV). The BNI109 fragment showed 75% homology with BCV and MHV at amino acid level.

We need to understand why we were all caught unprepared. On the one hand, we have all short memories. As we forget too quickly, we were unable to recognize key factors influencing response and preparedness to public health threats. For many years, economic evaluation pushed governments all over the world to cut resources for public health systems, with COVID-19 pandemic the question arises: do we spend too much or too little on health care? What is the right amount to spend on health? Moreover, in many countries, the privatisation, or semi-privatisation, of healthcare may give rise to inequitable access to health care for everyone. Although COVID-19 is very ""democratic"", its consequences aren't. According to OECD, income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest level for the past half century. Three main causes have been recognized, technological revolution, globalization, and ""financialisation"". In this scenario, lockdown measures adopted to save lives are showing dramatic economic consequences. To address post COVID-19 reconstruction we need to go beyond GDP.

We investigated the applicability of the technique to intraoperative evaluation of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS This retrospective study analyzed 85 HCCs treated with RFA using extracted-overlay fusion imaging for guidance and evaluation. To perform RFA, an electrode was inserted targeting the tumor and a virtual 5-mm ablative margin overlaid on the US image. Following ablation, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) was performed to assess the ablative margin, and the minimal ablative margins were categorized into three groups: (I) margin <0 mm (protrusion), (II) margin 0 to <5 mm, and (III) margin ≥5 mm. Margin assessment was based on the positional relationship between the overlaid tumor plus margin and the perfusion defect of the ablation zone. Tumors in group I underwent repeat ablation until they were in groups II or III. The final classifications were compared with those obtained by retrospectively created fusion images of pre- and post-RFA CT or MR imaging (CT-CT/MR-MR fusion imaging). RESULTS Treatment evaluation was impossible using CEUS in six HCCs because the tumors were located far below the body surface. Of the remaining 79 HCCs, the categorizations of minimal ablative margins between CEUS extracted-overlay fusion imaging and CT-CT/MR-MR fusion imaging were in agreement for 72 tumors (91.1%) (Cohen's quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient 0.66, good agreement, p<0.01).

200266,Crisis Standards of Care for the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Essential Resource for the PALTC Community,2020,"Many nucleoside analog drugs, such as ribavirin and viramidine, are activated or metabolized in vivo through 5'-phosphorylation. In this report, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for 5'-monophosphorylation of ribavirin and viramidine by adenosine kinase. The apparent Km for ribavirin is 540 microM, and k(cat) is 1.8 min-1. Its catalytic efficiency of 3.3 x 10(-3) min-1 . microM-1 is 1,200-fold lower than that of adenosine. In contrast to the common belief that ribavirin is exclusively phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II was found to catalyze ribavirin phosphorylation in vitro. The reaction is optimally stimulated by the physiological concentration of ATP or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In phosphate-buffered saline plus ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, the apparent Km for ribavirin is 88 microM, and k(cat) is 4.0 min-1. These findings suggest that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II may be involved in ribavirin phosphorylation in vivo. Like ribavirin, viramidine was found to be phosphorylated by either adenosine kinase or cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II, albeit with a much lower activity. The catalytic efficiency for viramidine phosphorylation is 10- to 330-fold lower than that of ribavirin, suggesting that other nucleoside kinase(s) may be involved in viramidine phosphorylation in vivo. Both ribavirin and viramidine are not phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and uridine-cytidine kinase. The coincidence of presence of high concentrated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes suggests that cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II could play an important role in phosphorylating ribavirin and contribute to anabolism of ribavirin triphosphate in erythrocytes. Elucidation of ribavirin and viramidine phosphorylation mechanism should shed light on their in vivo metabolism, especially the ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in erythrocytes.","Wu, Jim Zhen; Larson, Gary; Walker, Heli; Shim, Jae Hoon; Hong, Zhi",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15917509/,611

Previous reports of MAV-1 infection of adult mice generally described serologic evidence of infection without morbidity or mortality. However, our current results demonstrate that MAV-1 causes a fatal illness in adult C57BL/6(B6) mice (50% lethal dose, [LD50], 10(3.0) PFU) but not in adult BALB/c mice at all of the doses tested (LD50, > or = 10(5.0) PFU). Adult (BALB/c x B6)F1 mice were intermediately susceptible (LD50, 10(4.5) PFU). Clinically, the sensitive B6 mice showed symptoms of acute central nervous system (CNS) disease, including tremors, seizures, ataxia, and paralysis. Light microscopic examination of CNS tissue from the B6 animals revealed petechial hemorrhages, edema, neovascularization, and mild inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Analysis by electron microscopy showed evidence of inflammation, such as activated microglia, as well as swollen astrocytic endfeet and perivascular lipid deposition indicative of blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Outside of the CNS, the only significant pathological findings were foci of cytolysis in the splenic white pulp. Assessment of viral replication from multiple tissues was performed by using RNase protection assays with an antisense MAV-1 early region 1a probe. The greatest amounts of viral mRNA in MAV-1-infected B6 animals were located in the brain and spinal cord. Less viral message was detected in the spleen, lungs, and heart. No viral mRNA was detected in BALB/c mouse tissue, with the exception of low levels in the heart. Viral titers of organ tissues were also determined and were concordant with RNase protection findings on the brain and spinal cord but failed to demonstrate significant infectious virus in additional organs. Our experiments demonstrate that MAV-1 has a striking tropism for the CNS that is strain dependent, and this provides an informative in vivo model for the study of adenoviral pathogenesis.","Guida, J D; Fejer, G; Pirofski, L A; Brosnan, C F; Horwitz, M S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7494276/,611

As expected, the geometric means (GM) of the WPFs increased with increasing particle size ranging from 21 for 0.7-1 microm particles to 270 for 5-10 microm particles (p < 0.001). The WPF for total culturable fungi (GM = 35) was significantly greater than for total culturable bacteria (GM = 9) (p = 0.01). Among the different microorganism groups, the WPFs of Cladosporium, culturable fungi, and total fungi were significantly correlated with the WPFs of particles of the same sizes. As compared with the WPFs for dust particles, the WPFs for bioaerosols were found more frequently below 10, which is a recommended assigned protection factor (APF) for N95 filtering facepiece respirators. More than 50% of the WPFs for microorganisms (mean aerodynamic diameter < 5 microm) were less than the proposed APF of 10. Even lower WPFs were calculated after correcting for dead space and lung deposition. Thus, the APF of 10 for N95 filtering facepiece respirators seems inadequate against microorganisms (mean aerodynamic size < 5 microm). These results provide useful pilot data to establish guidelines for respiratory protection against airborne dust and microorganisms on agricultural farms. The method is a promising tool for further epidemiological and intervention studies in agricultural and other similar occupational and nonoccupational environments.","Lee, Shu-An; Adhikari, Atin; Grinshpun, Sergey A; McKay, Roy; Shukla, Rakesh; Zeigler, Haoyue Li; Reponen, Tiina",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16234218/,611

205545,COVID-19: Encountering Never-Before-Known Suffering,2021,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike (S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2 are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites. These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.","Licitra, Beth N.; Sams, Kelly L.; Lee, Donald W.; R.Whittaker, Gary",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4034v1.pdf,611

Vaccine development efforts focus on the viral trimeric spike glycoprotein as the main target of the humoral immune response. Viral spikes carry glycans that facilitate immune evasion by shielding specific protein epitopes from antibody neutralization, and antigen efficacy is influenced by spike glycoprotein production in vivo. Therefore, immunogen integrity is important for glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates. Here, we show how site-specific glycosylation differs between virus-derived spikes, spike proteins derived from a construct similar to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, and commonly used recombinant, engineered spike glycoproteins. Furthermore, we show that their distinctive cellular secretion pathways result in different protein glycosylation and secretion patterns, including shedding of spike monomeric subunits for the vaccine candidate tested, which may have implications for the resulting immune response and vaccine design. ©","Brun, J.; Vasiljevic, S.; Gangadharan, B.; Hensen, M.; V.

Effective anticoagulation therapy may play a dominant role in the management of severe COVID-19 cases. CASE REPORT A 73-year-old man with a 6-day history of fever up to 38.5°C, dyspnea, cough, and fatigue was diagnosed with COVID-19. He had a past medical history significant for hypertension and coronary artery bypass grafting. Two days after hospital admission, the patient developed acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU). He received treatment including antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, vasopressors, prone positioning, and anticoagulation with enoxaparin at a prophylactic dose. After a 15-day ICU stay, the patient was hemodynamically stable but still hypoxemic; a transthoracic echocardiogram at that time, followed by a transesophageal echocardiogram for better evaluation, revealed the presence of a right atrium thrombus without signs of acute right ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic function. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, we decided to treat him with conventional anticoagulation under close monitoring for signs of hemodynamic deterioration; thus, the prophylactic dose of enoxaparin was replaced by therapeutic dosing, which was a key component of the patient's successful outcome. Over the next few days he showed significant clinical improvement. The follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram 3 weeks after effective therapeutic anticoagulation revealed no signs of right heart thrombus. CONCLUSIONS The presented COVID-19 case, one of the first reported cases with evidence of right heart thrombus by transesophageal echocardiography, highlights the central role of diagnostic imaging strategies and the importance of adequate anticoagulation therapy in the management of severe COVID-19 cases in the ICU.","Anthi, Anastasia; Konstantonis, Dimitrios; Theodorakopoulou, Maria; Apostolopoulou, Olympia; Karampela, Irene; Konstantopoulou, Georgia; Patsilinakou, Stavroula; Armaganidis, Apostolos; Dimopoulos, George",Am J Case Rep,,611

Various treatment strategies have been attempted. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 61-year-old man with heart transplantation in 2017 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea, and was confirmed positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Laboratory tests showed significant elevations in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction 58% (with ejection fraction 57% 6 months prior). Given the lack of clear management guidelines, the patient was initially managed symptomatically. However, the patient subsequently had a rapid respiratory deterioration with worsening inflammatory markers on day 5 of admission. Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) was in low supply in the hospital. The patient was offered clazakizumab (anti-IL-6) for compassionate use. Patient received 25 mg intravenously × 1 dose. Within 24 hours, he showed significant improvement in symptoms, oxygen requirements, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers. There was a transient leukopenia that improved in 4 days. He was discharged home on day 11, with negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR as an outpatient on day 35, development of positive serum COVID-19 IgG antibody, and he continued to do well on day 60, with no heart-related symptoms. CONCLUSION: Clazakizumab is a monoclonal antibody against human IL-6, which may be helpful in inhibiting the cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Although not yet FDA approved, it is being investigated for treatment of renal antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical trials of clazakizumab for treatment of COVID-19 are underway worldwide.","Vaidya, Gaurang; Czer, Lawrence S C; Kobashigawa, Jon; Kittleson, Michelle; Patel, Jignesh; Chang, David; Kransdorf, Evan; Shikhare, Anuja; Tran, Hai; Vo, Ashley; Ammerman, Noriko; Huang, Edmund; Zabner, Rachel; Jordan, Stanley",Transplant Proc,,611
208531,Digital health and COVID-19: challenges of use and implementation in sub-Saharan Africa,2021,"Tembotrione is a triketone group herbicide having worldwide applications for weed management in maize. It is considered to be less stable in the environment and its degradation products may have toxicological consequences due to longer persistence and off-site movements. We studied the persistence behavior and leaching potential of tembotrione and its major metabolite TCMBA in clay loam and sandy loam soils having different physico-chemical properties. The rapid transformation of parent tembotrione to degradation products and their high interactions with soil provided challenging task of residues separation from complex soil matrix. Therefore, a novel sample preparation method (modified QuEChERS) was optimized for trace estimation of tembotrione and TCMBA which offered 86.6-95.6% recoveries with limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) as 0.001 and 0.003 µg/g, respectively in both soils without any matrix interference. A first order dissipation kinetics was followed by tembotrione and TCMBA residues with half-life ranged from 7.2 to 13.4 days in both soils. Residues reached below detectable limit on 45-60 days after treatments in two application doses. Leaching experiment revealed maximum retention of tembotrione residues from 15 to 25 cm depth in both soils whereas TCMBA show appreciable leaching potential. It was concluded that tembotrione can be phytotoxic to the succeeding crops if applied at late post-emergence stage. TCMBA can contaminate surface and ground water due to continuous and prolonged use of tembotrione particularly in light textured soils.","Rani, Naincy; Duhan, Anil; Tomar, Dinesh",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,611
208532,Digital health and COVID-19: challenges of use and implementation in sub-Saharan Africa,2021,"Viral internalization is aided by host cell surface receptors. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the primary host receptor is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Considering the disparities in the transmission rate and viral tropism of the two coronaviruses, additional host factors were suspected. Recently, a novel host factor for SARS-CoV-2 entry, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) has been identified. These receptors potentiate viral infection in the presence of other host factors like ACE2. Through its C-end rule (CendR) motif exposed following furin processing, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the CendR pocket of NRP-1 and achieves cell entry through endocytosis. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the NRP-1 receptor interferes with the docking of its endogenous ligand VEGF-A, signaling that would otherwise promote nociception. This review looks at the function of neuropilins and how it contributes to SARS-CoV-2 infection and nociception.","Jobe, Amie; Vijayan, Ranjit",,,611

High-dimensional scenarios are usually tackled with scan-statistics and related methods, requiring stringent modeling assumptions for proper calibration. In this work we take a non-parametric stance, and propose a permutation-based variant of the higher criticism statistic not requiring knowledge of the null distribution. This results in an exact test in finite samples which is asymptotically optimal in the wide class of exponential models. We demonstrate the power loss in finite samples is minimal with respect to the oracle test. Furthermore, since the proposed statistic does not rely on asymptotic approximations it typically performs better than popular variants of higher criticism that rely on such approximations. We include recommendations such that the test can be readily applied in practice, and demonstrate its applicability in monitoring the daily number of COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands.","Stoepker, Ivo V.; Castro, Rui M.; Arias-Castro, Ery; Heuvel, Edwin van den",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03117v2.pdf,611

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the canonical cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 together with angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2 and ACE2 are components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Exacerbated production of cytokines, mainly IL-6, points to macrophages as key to understand differential COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 may modulate macrophage-mediated inflammation events by altering the balance between angiotensin II, which activates angiotensin receptor types 1 and 2, and angiotensin 1-7 and alamandine, which activate MAS proto-oncogene and MAS-related D receptors, respectively. In addition to macrophages, lung cells express RAS components; also, some lung cells are able to produce IL-6. Addressing how SARS-CoV-2 unbalances RAS functionality via ACE2 will help design therapies to attenuate a COVID-19-related cytokine storm.","Franco, Rafael; Rivas-Santisteban, Rafael; Serrano-Marín, Joan; Rodríguez-Pérez, Ana I; Labandeira-García, José L; Navarro, Gemma",J Immunol,,611

On the other hand, even without acute kidney injury, COVID-19 was a major cause of death globally in the year 2020, but the occurrence of acute kidney injury among COVID-19 patients is an independent risk factor of increased mortality. Continuous renal replacement therapy has been recommended to treat acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients instead of conventional intermittent hemodialysis. Moreover, its use might have another beneficial role in stopping the progression of severe COVID-19 by removing pro-inflammatory cytokines during cytokine storm syndrome, which is postulated as the pathophysiology behind severe and critically severe cases of COVID-19.

Hence, this study identified COVID-19 clustering and defined the predictability performance of Google RSV models in clustered and non-clustered areas of the United States. METHODS: Getis-Ord General and local G statistics were used to identify monthly clustering patterns. Monthly country- and state-level correlations between new daily COVID-19 cases and Google RSVs were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and Poisson regression models for the period of January to December 2020. RESULTS: Huge clusters involving multiple states were found, which resulted from various control measures in each state. This demonstrates the importance of state-to-state coordination in implementing control measures to tackle the spread of outbreaks. Variability in Google RSV model performances was found among states and time periods, possibly suggesting the necessity of utilizing different frameworks for Google RSV data in each state. Moreover, the sign of a correlation can be utilized to understand public responses to control and preventive measures, as well as in communicating risk. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 Google RSV model accuracy in the United States may be influenced by COVID-19 transmission dynamics, policy-driven community awareness, and past outbreak experiences.","Husnayain, Atina; Chuang, Ting-Wu; Fuad, Anis; Su, Emily Chia-Yu",Int. j. infect. dis,,611

216617,COVID-19-related psychiatric impact on Italian adolescent population: A cross-sectional cohort study,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 virus has triggered a global pandemic with devastating consequences. The understanding of fundamental aspects of this virus is of extreme importance. In this work, we studied the viral ribonuclease nsp14, one of the most interferon antagonists from SARS-CoV-2. Nsp14 is a multifunctional protein with two distinct activities, an N-terminal 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), both critical for coronaviruses life cycle, indicating nsp14 as a prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs. In coronaviruses, nsp14 ExoN activity is stimulated through the interaction with the nsp10 protein. We have performed a biochemical characterization of nsp14-nsp10 complex from SARS-CoV-2. We confirm the 3'-5' exoribonuclease and MTase activities of nsp14 and the critical role of nsp10 in upregulating the nsp14 ExoN activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 N7-MTase activity is functionally independent of the ExoN activity and nsp10. A model from SARS-CoV-2 nsp14-nsp10 complex allowed mapping key nsp10 residues involved in this interaction. Our results show that a stable interaction between nsp10 and nsp14 is required for the nsp14-mediated ExoN activity of SARS-CoV-2. We studied the role of conserved DEDD catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 ExoN. Our results show that motif I of ExoN domain is essential for the nsp14 function, contrasting to the functionality of these residues in other coronaviruses, which can have important implications regarding the specific pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This work unraveled a basis for discovering inhibitors targeting specific amino acids in order to disrupt the assembly of this complex and interfere with coronaviruses replication.","Saramago, Margarida; Bárria, Cátia; Costa, Vanessa G; Souza, Caio S; Viegas, Sandra C; Domingues, Susana; Lousa, Diana; Soares, Cláudio M; Arraiano, Cecília M; Matos, Rute G",FEBS j,,611

However, in the nutritionally stringent environment of the macrophage phagolysosome, Mtb relies mainly on cholesterol. In previous studies, we demonstrated that Mtb can accumulate and utilize cholesterol as the sole carbon source. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that a lipid-rich environment may have a much broader impact on the pathogenesis of Mtb infection than previously thought. Therefore, we applied high-resolution transcriptome profiling and the construction of various mutants to explore in detail the global effect of cholesterol on the tubercle bacillus metabolism. The results allow re-establishing the complete list of genes potentially involved in cholesterol breakdown. Moreover, we identified the modulatory effect of vitamin B12 on Mtb transcriptome and the novel function of cobalamin in cholesterol metabolite dissipation which explains the probable role of B12 in Mtb virulence. Finally, we demonstrate that a key role of cholesterol in mycobacterial metabolism is not only providing carbon and energy but involves also a transcriptome remodeling program that helps in developing tolerance to the unfavorable host cell environment far before specific stress-inducing phagosomal signals occur.","Pawelczyk, Jakub; Brzostek, Anna; Minias, Alina; Plocinski, Przemyslaw; Rumijowska-Galewicz, Anna; Strapagiel, Dominik; Zakrzewska-Czerwinska, Jolanta; Dziadek, Jaroslaw",Sci Rep,,611

Social distancing measures imposed the interruption of face-to-face activities besides the implementation of remote work and online classes. For safe and gradual return, the monitoring of individuals, quick detection of infection, contact tracing, and isolation of those infected became essential. In this sense, we developed strategies to face the pandemic at the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA) - Brazil. A Telemedicine Program (TeleCovid) and the assemblage of a laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis (LabCovid) were essential measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling outbreaks at the university. TeleCovid works with a team of students who guide and answer questions regarding COVID-19 and, when necessary, make the referral for online consultation with medical professionals. In the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the doctor refers the patient for testing at LabCovid. LabCovid performs the sample collection using nasal swabs, followed by processing samples by the RT-qPCR method. We have placed all positive patients in isolation and tested their contacts. This approach meant that positive cases were identified early, thus avoiding outbreaks in different environments in face-to-face activities.","Cherem, Jose; Pylro, Victor Satler; Poles, Katia; Carvalho, Richardson Costa; Carvalho, Ewerton; Santos, Juliana Anacleto dos; Alvarenga, Ingrid Marciano; Rocha, Denise Alvarenga; Souza, Karla Silva Teixeira; Castro, Joseane Camilla; Torquete, Mariana Almeida; Ferreira, Sidney de Almeida; Barcante, Joziana MP",,,611

Here, we report major clinical and organisational challenges at a high-volume Italian IBD centre one month after the start of the Italian government's restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All routine follow-up IBD visits of patients in remission were cancelled or rescheduled for 8-12 weeks' time. However, access to the hospital for therapy or for unstable/relapsing patients was not considered postponable. Everyone attending the centre (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrative personnel and patients) were advised to respect the general recommended rules for hand hygiene and social distancing, to disclose if they had a fever or cough or flu-like symptoms and to wear a surgical mask and gloves. At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning. A total of 1451 IBD patients under biotechnological or experimental therapy actively followed in the CEMAD IBD centre were included in the study. About 65% of patients maintained their appointment schedules without major problems, while in 20% of cases planned infusions were delayed because of the patient's decision or practical issues. About 10% of patients receiving subcutaneous therapy were allowed to collect their medicine without a follow-up visit. Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home. At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in 'quarantine' for contact considered to be 'at risk' for the infection. Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms. This study represents the first observational detailed report about short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient organisation and management in a high-volume IBD centre.","Scaldaferri, Franco; Pugliese, Daniela; Privitera, Giuseppe; Onali, Sara; Lopetuso, Loris Riccardo; Rizzatti, Gianenrico; Settanni, Carlo Romano; Pizzoferrato, Marco; Schiavoni, Elisa; Turchini, Laura; Amatucci, Valeria; Napolitano, Daniele; Bernabei, Tiziana; Mora, Vincenzina; Laterza, Lucrezia; Papa, Alfredo; Guidi, Luisa; Rapaccini, Gian Lodovico; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Armuzzi, Alessandro",United European Gastroenterol J,,611

Since university students could be considered a knowledgeable group, this study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among this group in Jordan. Additionally, we aimed to examine the association between vaccine conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy. We used an online survey conducted in January 2021 with a chain-referral sampling approach. Conspiracy beliefs were evaluated using the validated Vaccine Conspiracy Belief Scale (VCBS), with higher scores implying embrace of conspiracies. A total of 1106 respondents completed the survey with female predominance (n = 802, 72.5%). The intention to get COVID-19 vaccines was low: 34.9% (yes) compared to 39.6% (no) and 25.5% (maybe). Higher rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were seen among males (42.1%) and students at Health Schools (43.5%). A Low rate of influenza vaccine acceptance was seen as well (28.8%), in addition to 18.6% of respondents being anti-vaccination altogether. A significantly higher VCBS score was correlated with reluctance to get the vaccine (p < 0.001). Dependence on social media platforms was significantly associated with lower intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (19.8%) compared to dependence on medical doctors, scientists, and scientific journals (47.2%, p < 0.001). The results of this study showed the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with conspiracy beliefs among university students in Jordan. The implementation of targeted actions to increase the awareness of such a group is highly recommended. This includes educational programs to dismantle vaccine conspiracy beliefs and awareness campaigns to build recognition of the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.","Sallam, Malik; Dababseh, Deema; Eid, Huda; Hasan, Hanan; Taim, Duaa; Al-Mahzoum, Kholoud; Al-Haidar, Ayat; Yaseen, Alaa; Ababneh, Nidaa A; Assaf, Areej; Bakri, Faris G; Matar, Suzan; Mahafzah, Azmi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,611

The combined data for the three cities from 2017 to 2019 indicated that the lowest AQI (averaged 78.1) occurred in the summer season, for which the AQI proportions for classes I, II, III, IV, V, and VI were 25.6%, 49.9%, 21.9%, 2.7%, 0%, and 0%, respectively. The highest (AQI average of 112.6) was in winter, for which the proportions were 7.4%, 39.5%, 33.3%, 12.5%, 7.2%, and 0.1%, respectively. PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO 2in order were the most important indicatory air pollutants for AQI classes IV, V, and VI, which all prevailed in winter and spring, while O 3was the indicatory air pollutant that occurred most in summer. The COVID-19 event, which triggered global attention, broke out at the end of 2019. This study also investigated and compared the air quality levels in the three cities from January to March 2017–2019 with those in 2020. The results showed that during February 2020, in the three cities, the average ambient air concentrations of PM 2.5, PM 10, SO 2, CO, and NO 2were 41.9 µg m –3, 50.1 µg m –3, 2.18 ppb, 0.48 ppm, and 8.97 ppb, and were 46.5%, 48.9%, 52.5%, 36.2%, and 52.8%, respectively, lower than those in the same month in 2017–2019, respectively. However, the O 3average concentration (80.6 ppb) did not show significant fluctuations and even slightly increased by 3.6%. This is because a lower concentration of NO 2resulted in constraints on the reaction of NO + O 3, so the O 3level could not be effectively further reduced. In addition, this study also analyzed and compared the five highest daily AQIs from February 2017–2019 with those of 2020 for the three cities. The mean AQI for the 5 days with the highest daily AQI (averaged 122.6) in February 2020 was 45.1% lower than that for February 2017–2019 (averaging 223.2), and the indicatory air pollutant was always PM 2.5, which decreased by 46.7% (from 173.6 to 92.6 µg m –3). It is clear that during the COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control action periods, the air quality near central China improved significantly.","Xu, Kaijie; Cui, Kangping; Young, Li-Hao; Wang, Ya-Fen; Hsieh, Yen-Kung; Wan, Shun; Zhang, Jiajia",Aerosol Air Qual.

233772,Annals On Call - Protecting Health Care Workers From COVID-19,2020,"Background: Pre-symptomatic transmission can be a key determinant of the effectiveness of containment and mitigation strategies for infectious diseases, particularly if interventions rely on syndromic case finding. For COVID-19, infections in the absence of apparent symptoms have been reported frequently alongside circumstantial evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. We estimated the potential contribution of pre-symptomatic cases to COVID-19 transmission. Methods: Using the probability for symptom onset on a given day inferred from the incubation period, we attributed the serial interval reported from Shenzen, China, into likely pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. We used the serial interval derived for cases isolated more than 6 days after symptom onset as the no active case finding scenario and the unrestricted serial interval as the active case finding scenario. We reported the estimate assuming no correlation between the incubation period and the serial interval alongside a range indicating alternative assumptions of positive and negative correlation. Results: We estimated that 23% (range accounting for correlation: 12 - 28%) of transmissions in Shenzen may have originated from pre-symptomatic infections. Through accelerated case isolation following symptom onset, this percentage increased to 46% (21 - 46%), implying that about 35% of secondary infections among symptomatic cases have been prevented. These results were robust to using reported incubation periods and serial intervals from other settings. Conclusions: Pre-symptomatic transmission may be essential to consider for containment and mitigation strategies for COVID-19.","Liu, Yang; Funk, Sebastian; Flasche, Stefan; Jit, Mark; Bosse, Nikos I.; Gimma, Amy; Klepac, Petra; Russell, Timothy W.; Sun, Fiona; Rosello, Alicia; Diamond, Charlie; Kucharski, Adam J.; Houben, Rein M.G.J.; Munday, James D.; Jambart, Thibaut; John Edmunds, W.; Pearson, Carl A.B.; van Zandvoort, Kevin; Eggo, Rosalind M.; Medley, Graham; Gibbs, Hamish; Abbott, Sam; Hellewell, Joel; Quilty, Billy J.; Jarvis, Christopher I.; Prem, Kiesha; Clifford, Samuel; Davies, Nicholas",Wellcome Open Res.,,611

By computing set relations, the government agency, given the knowledge of two identified persons, has an instrument that provides a (possible) infection chain from the initial to the final infected user no matter at which location on a worldwide scale they are. The benefit of our approach is that intermediate possible infected users can be identified and subsequently contacted by the agency.

236337,Predictors of Threat from COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study in the Spanish Population,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review investigated the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the synergy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, preeclampsia (PE), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Maternal health is a great concern when treating pregnant women fighting this triad of diseases, which is highly prevalent in South Africa. MicroRNAs are involved in fine-tuning of physiological processes. Disruptions to the balance of this minute protein can lead to various physiological changes that are sometimes pathological. RECENT FINDINGS: MicroRNAs have recently been implicated in PE and have been linked to the anti-angiogenic imbalance evident in PE. Recent in silico studies have identified potential host miRNAs with anti-viral properties against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have demonstrated dysregulated expression of several miRNAs in HIV-1 infection along with the ability of HIV-1 to downregulate anti-viral host microRNAs. This review has highlighted the significant gap in literature on the potential of miRNAs in women with HIV-associated PE in synergy with the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, this review has provided evidence of the critical role that the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of miRNA plays in viral infections and PE, thereby providing a foundation for further research investigating the potential of therapeutic miRNA development with fewer side-effects for pregnant women.","Abel, Tashlen; Moodley, Jagidesa; Naicker, Thajasvarie",Curr Hypertens Rep,,611

237125,The proportion of death anxiety and its related factors during the covid-19 pandemic in the iranian population,2021,"PURPOSE: COVID pandemic significantly affected the delivery and maintenance of healthcare system, resulting in greater utilization of digital health interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multi-national cross-sectional survey was administered to clinicians working in major Asia-Pacific cities during the mandatory social lockdown period in June 2020. Clinical demographics and professional data, delivery of Andrology-related healthcare services, and patient distress based on validated questionnaires such as Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and Decisional Engagement Scale (DES) were collected. RESULTS: Telehealth medicine was instituted in all the centres with the majority of centres (92.9%) reported a 50% or more reduction in out-patient related services. The numbers of phone calls, emails correspondence and educational webinars have significantly increased. Despite the provision of reasons for changes in healthcare service and delay in surgery, more than half of the patients (57.1%) rated 2 on the DASS score for the item on patients over-react to situations, while a third of the patients (35.7%) scored a 2 for DASS item on patients being more demanding or unreasonable. The DES scores were more positive with most patients reported a score above 7 out of 10 in terms of items on accepting current arrangement (85.7%), confident in clinician decision-making about treatment (92.9%) and comfortable that the decision is consistent with their preferences (71.4%). Most patients (85.7%) indicated their preferences for more detailed information on healthcare provision. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed telehealth services were integrated early and successfully during the COVID pandemic and patients were generally receptive with minimal psychosocial distress.","Chung, Eric; Jiann, Bang Ping; Nagao, Koichi; Hakim, Lukman; Huang, William; Lee, Joe; Lin, Haocheng; Mai, Dung Ba Tien; Nguyen, Quang; Park, Hyun Jun; Sato, Yoshikazu; Tantiwongse, Kavirach; Yuan, Yiming; Park, Kwangsung",,,611

A follow-up survey planned for 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic changed life for all residents, was redesigned to assess mobility needs and changes during the Shelter-in-Place order and focused on COVID-19 impacts. Results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Shelter-in-Place order have had a major impact on senior mobility. Communications for many were restricted to phone, email, texts, social media and video chats. Among those with a medical problem, just over 60% called a doctor or nurse line or went to a doctor’s office, while 11.2% went to an emergency room, and 8.6% did nothing. A total of 8% of respondents said they had run out of food or other important items during the Shelter-in-Place order. Rates of exercise outside the home dropped 20% between January and June 2020, and while over 60% sought outside entertainment in January 2020, by June 2020, nearly 70% accessed their entertainment online at home. Almost 80% of working respondents feared spreading or contracting COVID-19 because of their work or related transportation. Almost 20% felt a lack of companionship or closeness sometimes or often. Over 30% were worried about their current or long-term finances. A total of 84.5% strongly agreed or agreed that the Shelter-in-Place order was necessary. None of the respondents to the follow-up survey were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 88.2% were not concerned about risk of exposure from any member of their household.","Ragland, David R.; Shor, Glenn Felschundneff Grace University of California Berkeley University of California Institute of Transportation Studies",,,611

In this paper, we present a new portfolio policy network architecture for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)that can exploit more effectively cross-asset dependency information and achieve better performance than state-of-the-art architectures. In particular, we introduce a new property, referred to as \textit{asset permutation invariance}, for portfolio policy networks that exploit multi-asset time series data, and design the first portfolio policy network, named WaveCorr, that preserves this invariance property when treating asset correlation information. At the core of our design is an innovative permutation invariant correlation processing layer. An extensive set of experiments are conducted using data from both Canadian (TSX) and American stock markets (S&P 500), and WaveCorr consistently outperforms other architectures with an impressive 3%-25% absolute improvement in terms of average annual return, and up to more than 200% relative improvement in average Sharpe ratio. We also measured an improvement of a factor of up to 5 in the stability of performance under random choices of initial asset ordering and weights. The stability of the network has been found as particularly valuable by our industrial partner.","Marzban, Saeed; Delage, Erick; Li, Jonathan Yumeng; Desgagne-Bouchard, Jeremie; Dussault, Carl",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07005v2.pdf,611

The objective of this study was to understand the factors contributing to the perceived stress levels of HCWs in a public primary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, including their training, protection and support (TPS), job stress (JS), and perceived stigma and interpersonal avoidance. METHODS: This cross-sectional study using an electronic self-administered questionnaire was conducted at the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics in March 2020. Data was collected anonymously. Analysis was performed using regression modelling. RESULTS: The response rate was 69.7% (n = 1,040). The mean perceived stress level of HCWs in various departments ranged from 17.2 to 20.3. Respondents who reported higher perceived stress were those who made alternative living arrangements, were more affected by the current pandemic, reported higher JS and were Muslims. Respondents who reported lower perceived stress were those who had been through the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003 and H1N1 pandemic in 2009 as HCWs, and those who had higher confidence in the organisation's TPS. CONCLUSION: All HCWs, regardless of scope of work, were similarly stressed by the current pandemic compared to the general population. Improving the confidence of HCWs in their training, protection and the support of personal protective equipment, and retaining experienced HCWs who can provide advice and emotional support to younger colleagues are important. Adequate psychological support for HCWs in the pandemic can be transformed into reserves of psychological resilience for future disease outbreaks.","Lee, Eng Sing; Tan, Shu Yun; Lee, Poay Sian Sabrina; Koh, Hui Li; Soon, Shok Wen Winnie; Sim, Kang; Tang, Wern Ee; Chong, Phui-Nah",Singap. med. j,,611
243861,Hidden Power of Yoga in COVID19: A cross sectional study,2021,"Infection by SARS-CoV-2 commonly begins in the nasopharynx, and the cytologic and molecular correlates are not characterized. Fifty-eight cytologic preps (20 oral and 38 from the nasopharynx) were obtained from ten patients and analyzed in a blinded fashion for SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope protein by immunohistochemistry and viral RNA by in situ hybridization. qRTPCR identified three positive cases and seven controls; the three cases reported mild symptoms that resolved in 2-3 days. Blinded analyses confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins and viral RNA in the three cases and viral absence in the seven controls. A signal for the positive cases was evident in each nasopharyngeal and none of the oral samples. Viral RNA/proteins localized exclusively to glandular cells and was present in high copy number. Blinded analysis of the cytology documented that the glandular cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed marked degeneration with ciliocytophthoria; viral inclusions were not evident. Co-expression analysis showed viral infected cells had increased apoptosis, marked by strong expression of activated caspase 3. Weekly serial testing of two of the cases showed persistence of productive viral infection for up to 2 weeks after symptom onset. It is concluded that the target cell of SARS-CoV-2 in the head and neck region is the glandular cell of the nasal passages, that viral infection is lytic and associated with high copy number that facilitates viral spread. The method outlines a simple, rapid test for productive SARS-CoV-2 based on immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization of the glandular cells from the nasopharynx.","Nuovo, Gerard J; Magro, Cynthia; Mikhail, Adel",Ann Diagn Pathol,,611

Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant Unit One (BNPP-1) is modeled using the KIANA software and the release of radioactive materials from the BNPP-1 stack on the members of the public through the airborne pathway is evaluated during normal operation as well as in the accident conditions including Design Basis Accidents (DBA) and Beyond Design Basis Accidents (BDBA). To verify and validate the KIANA software, the results of the KIANA are compared with the results of DOZA_M, ESTE, PC-CREAM 98, RECASS Express, and the values of the total effective dose monitored by the local detectors of BNPP-1. The KIANA is developed based on the Gaussian diffusion model written using C# programming language. In the current research, the total effective dose received by a member of the public due to the radioactive plume passage through the airborne pathway is calculated in the normal condition of BNPP-1. Moreover, the total effective dose in the case of the primary-to-secondary leakage inside the steam generators, the total effective dose in the case of Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LBLOCA) and Small Break Loss of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA), and the equivalent dose of the thyroid gland tissue for an infant group (1-8 years old) in the case of LBLOCA in DBA conditions are evaluated. Finally, the absorbed dose of the whole body of adults at the initial stage after a BDBA, absorbed dose of the thyroid gland tissue for an infant group (1-8 years old) at the initial stage after a BDBA, and the total effective dose in the first year after the accident in the case of a BDBA are assessed. The results of the KIANA software indicate a good agreement with the results of the DOZA_M, ESTE, PC-CREAM 98, RECASS Express computer programs, and the values of the total effective dose monitored by the local detectors of BNPP-1.

Given the logistical challenges of psychophysical testing, understanding the longitudinal relationship between self-reported and quantitative measures can help accurately identify patients with persistent olfactory dysfunction. This study aimed to longitudinally correlate measured and subjective olfactory function in COVID-19 subjects. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating subjective and measured olfaction was conducted on ambulatory COVID-19 subjects. Olfaction scores were obtained using a visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = anosmia, 10 = normosmia) and the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT). Weekly testing was performed until recovery (BSIT &#8805; 9/12 and/or VAS = 10/10) or study completion. RESULTS: Eighty-six polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 subjects were recruited &#8804;3 days from diagnosis and 52 completed longitudinal testing. Among those with self-reported smell loss at recruitment, similar levels (75.8%) of objective (BSIT &#8805; 9/12) and subjective recovery were obtained using a VAS cutoff &#8805;8, yet only 30.3% reported complete subjective recovery (VAS = 10). Median times to objective and complete subjective olfactory recovery were 12 ± 2.3 and 24 ± 3.5 days, respectively. Although both measures showed chemosensory improvement, the distributions of objective and full subjective olfactory recovery differed significantly (log rank test &#967;2 = 6.46, degrees of freedom [df] = 1, p = 0.011). Overall correlation between BSIT and VAS scores was moderate to strong across longitudinal follow-up (rs = 0.41-0.65). CONCLUSION: Self-reported and psychophysically measured COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction improve at similar levels and are moderately correlated longitudinally, yet there is a significant delay in complete subjective recovery. Psychophysical testing in conjunction with qualitative assessments may be considered for counseling and follow-up of patients with COVID-19 smell loss.","Prajapati, Divya P; Shahrvini, Bita; Said, Mena; Srinivas, Shanmukha; DeConde, Adam S; Yan, Carol H",Int. forum allergy rhinol,,611

In this study, we investigate whether patients with ILD are more susceptible to COVID-19 than those without ILD and evaluate the impact of ILD on disease severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A nationwide cohort of patients with COVID-19 (n=8070) and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121â050) were constructed between January 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020 in Korea. We performed a nested case-control study to compare the proportions of patients with ILD between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Using the COVID-19 cohort, we also evaluated the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with ILD versus those without ILD. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with ILD was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (0.8% versus 0.4%, p<0.001). The odds ratio [OR] of having ILD was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR=2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.54-2.61).

253502,Health care of the elderly during Covid-19 pandemic-All a family physician should know,2021,"This article positions equitable access to information as a matter of social justice and questions how the library and information science sector might work more intentionally and systemically to close the pervasive information retrieval and navigation gaps that disproportionately disenfranchize lower-income and/or majority Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. Though much attention since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 has rightfully been paid to the need for more robust broadband infrastructure in the United States, this article links the persistent disparities in digital literacy instruction, possession of digital devices, and access to consistent wireless internet technology as critical and profoundly race and class-biased components of connectivity. Hall describes the intentional/unintentional lack of recognition or inaction regarding whole groups of people being denied this access as “information redlining,” and suggests that not only can libraries play a leading role in disrupting it, but also that libraries are the essential link in any comprehensive national response. © 2021 The Author(s).

UK-produced LICBT guided self-help (GSH) materials were originally used in the MindStep&#8482; program. In 2017, Australian LICBT GSH materials were developed to better suit Australian users. This study explored whether the Australian-produced materials continued to achieve the benchmark recovery rates established in the UK and maintained in recent Australian studies.MethodsBinomial logistic regression was conducted using retrospective client data, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, between 2016 and 2019.ResultsDuring time periods in which the Australian-produced materials were used, equivalent rates of reliable recovery and improvement were achieved compared with time periods in which the UK-produced materials were used. Australian-trained LICBT coaches, using Australian-produced LICBT GSH materials, achieve client recovery rates of up to 60%, reliable improvement rates of 58% and reliable recovery rates of 46% (with the probability of recovery increasing with client age).ConclusionsThese findings are particularly pertinent with COVID-19 changing the landscape of mental health service delivery, requiring greater flexibility in the use of teleservices to ensure access to effective mental health care for populations that may already experience problems with isolation, access and service engagement.What is known about the topic?LICBT is an acceptable, feasible and effective treatment approach for people experiencing mild-to-moderate anxiety and depression in Australia. LICBT GSH materials used with clients in Australia originated from the UK. However, according to guidelines, LICBT GSH materials should be contextualised to suit the audience they are being used with.What does this paper add?This paper demonstrates that LICBT GSH materials tailored to an Australian context can be used in place of UK-produced materials because they yield equivalent and consistent therapeutic outcomes. Although contextualising the LICBT GSH materials for health services users was important, it is likely that the evidence-based cognitive behaviour therapy techniques sitting 'under the hood' of these materials are most important to ensure successful therapeutic outcomes.What are the implications for practitioners?As we face unprecedented challenges following 2020, the physical, social, psychological and economic impacts of life-changing events must not inhibit access to treatments for common mental health conditions. It is anticipated that more non-traditional, alternative providers of mental health services will be needed to scale-up and respond to increasing demand. This paper shows that the provision of telephone-based LICBT in Australia, by trained coaches using Australian-produced GSH materials, is an evidenced-based support pathway that can reduce the access gap to treatments.","Venning, Anthony; Oswald, Tassia K; Barnes, Mary; Glover, Fiona; Lawn, Sharon; Azadi, Leva; Tepper, Nicci; Redpath, Paula",,,611

In particular, frustration, loneliness, and worries about the future are common reactions and represent well-known risk factors for several mental disorders, including anxiety, affective, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The vast majority of available studies have been conducted in China, where the pandemic started. Italy has been severely hit by the pandemic, and the socio-cultural context is compl etel y di fferent from Eastern countri es. Therefore, there i s the need for methodologically rigorous studies aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on the mental health of the Italian population. In fact, our results will help us to develop appropriate interventions for managing the psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The “COVID-IT-mental health trial” is a no-profit, not-funded, national, multicentric, cross-sectional population-based trial which has the following aims: a) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures on mental health of the Italian population; b) to identify the main areas to be targeted by supportive long-term interventions for the different categories of people exposed to the pandemic. Data will be collected through a web-platform using validated assessment tools. Participants will be subdivided into four groups: a) Group 1 —COVID-19 quarantine group. This group includes the general population which are quarantined but not isolated, i.e., those not directly exposed to contagion nor in contact with COVID-19+ individuals; b) Group 2—COVID-19+ group, which includes isolated people directly/indirectly exposed to the virus; c) Group 3—COVID-19 healthcare staff group, which includes first-and second-line healthcare professionals; d) Group 4— COVID-19 mental health, which includes users of mental health services and all those who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Mental health services worldwide are not prepared yet to manage the short-and long-term consequences of the pandemic.

262972,Health care-based voter registration: a new kind of healing,2021,"Terpenoids are natural compounds predominantly present in plants. They have many pharmaceutical and/or nutritional functions, and have been widely applied in medical, food, and cosmetics industries. Recently, terpenoids have been used in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 due to the good antiviral activities. The increasing demand for terpenoids in international markets poses a serious threat to many plant species. For environmentally sustainable development, microbial cell factories have been utilized as the promising platform to produce terpenoids. Nevertheless, the bioproduction of most terpenoids cannot meet commercial requirements due to the low cost-benefit ratio until now. The biosynthetic potential of endophytes has gained attention in recent decades owing to the continual discovery of endophytes capable of synthesizing plant bioactive compounds. Accordingly, endophytes could be alternative sources of terpenoid-producing strains or terpenoid synthetic genes. In this review, we summarized the research progress describing the main and supporting roles of endophytes in terpenoid biosynthesis and biotransformation, and discussed the current problems and challenges which may prevent the further exploitation. This review will improve our understanding of endophyte resources for terpenoid production in industry in the future. The four main research interests on endophytes for terpenoid production.

Because of its lethality, it is important to understand the current strain's effects and mechanisms not only in the respiratory system but also in other affected organ systems as well. Past coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV inflicted life-threatening acute kidney injuries (AKI) on their hosts leading to significant mortality rates, which went somewhat overlooked in the face of the severe respiratory effects. Recent evidence has emphasized renal involvement in SARS-CoV-2, stressing that kidneys are damaged in patients with COVID-19. The mechanism by which this virus inflicts AKI is still unclear, but evidence from other coronavirus strains may hold some clues. Two theories exist for the proposed mechanism of AKI: 1) the AKI is a secondary effect to reduced blood and oxygen levels causing hyperinflammation and 2) the AKI is due to cytotoxic effects. Kidneys express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 target receptor as well as collectrin, an ACE2 homologue that localizes to the primary cilium, an organelle historically targeted by coronaviruses. Although the available literature suggests that kidney damage is leading to higher mortality rates in patients with COVID-19, especially in those with preexisting kidney and cardiovascular diseases, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still being investigated. Here, we present brief literature review supporting our proposed hypothesis of a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 cellular infection and cilia.","Buqaileh, Raghad; Saternos, Hannah; Ley, Sidney; Aranda, Arianna; Forero, Kathleen; AbouAlaiwi, Wissam A",Physiol Genomics,,611

METHODS: Nine hundred ninety-two parents of children and adolescents with ADHD filled out an anonymous online survey through the ADHD family association website. The survey investigated the sleep patterns and disturbances (using a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) and screen exposure time before and during the lockdown. RESULTS: During the lockdown, 59.3% of children and 69.4% of adolescents with ADHD reported a change of bedtime with significant increase of ADHD patients that went to sleep at 11pm or later. Sleep duration, in contrast, resulted in two opposing processes with more children and adolescent sleeping either less than 6 hours/night or 10-11 hours/night. Among children and adolescents, respectively, 19.9% and 22% slept less than they did before lockdown, while 21.4% and 27.4% slept more hours. Bedtime delay and decreased sleep duration were associated with an increase in the screen time exposure. Moreover, ADHD patients reported an increase in sleep disturbances when compared to previous condition, including mainly difficulties falling asleep, anxiety at bedtime, night awakenings, nightmares and daytime sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown impacted on sleep-wake rhythms by strengthening the maladaptive sleep patterns reported in usual life conditions in ADHD children.","Bruni, Oliviero; Giallonardo, Martina; Sacco, Roberto; Ferri, Raffaele; Melegari, Maria Grazia",J. clin. sleep med,,611

To examine shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices in relation to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection point prevalence during universal testing at homeless shelters in the United States.Methods. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to clients and staff at homeless shelters, irrespective of symptoms. Site assessments were conducted from March 30 to June 1, 2020, to collect information on shelter characteristics and infection prevention practices. We assessed the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and shelter characteristics, including 20 infection prevention practices by using crude risk ratios (RRs) and exact unconditional 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results. Site assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing results were reported for 63 homeless shelters in 7 US urban areas. Median infection prevalence was 2.9% (range = 0%-71.4%). Shelters implementing head-to-toe sleeping and excluding symptomatic staff from working were less likely to have high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3, 0.8; and RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.6; respectively); shelters with medical services available were less likely to have very high infection prevalence (RR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.2, 1.0).Conclusions.

METHODS: In this dose-escalating study, favipiravir pharmacokinetics and tolerability were assessed in critically ill influenza patients. Participants received one of two dosing regimens; Japan licensed dose (1600 mg BID on day 1 and 600 mg BID on the following days) and the higher dose (1800 mg/800 mg BID) trialed in uncomplicated influenza. The primary pharmacokinetic endpoint was the proportion of patients with a minimum observed plasma trough concentration (Ctrough) &#8805;20 mg/L at all measured time points after the second dose. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were enrolled into the low dose group and 19 patients into the high dose group of the study. Favipiravir Ctrough decreased significantly over time in both groups (p <0.01). Relative to day 2 (48 hrs), concentrations were 91.7% and 90.3% lower in the 1600/600 mg group and 79.3% and 89.5% lower in the 1800/800 mg group at day 7 and 10, respectively. In contrast, oseltamivir concentrations did not change significantly over time. A 2-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination described the observed favipiravir concentration-time data well. Modeling demonstrated that less than 50% of patients achieved Ctrough &#8805;20 mg/L for >80% of the duration of treatment of the two dose regimens evaluated (18.8% and 42.1% of patients for low and high dose regimen, respectively). Increasing the favipravir dosage predicted a higher proportion of patients reaching this threshold of 20 mg/L, suggesting that dosing regimens of &#8805;3600/2600 mg might be required for adequate concentrations. The two dosing regimens were well-tolerated in critical ill patients with influenza. CONCLUSION: The two dosing regimens proposed for uncomplicated influenza did not achieve our pre-defined treatment threshold.","Wang, Yeming; Zhong, Wu; Salam, Alex; Tarning, Joel; Zhan, Qingyuan; Huang, Jian-An; Weng, Heng; Bai, Changqing; Ren, Yanhong; Yamada, Koichi; Wang, Dayan; Guo, Qiang; Fang, Qiongqiong; Tsutomu, Sakurai; Zou, Xiaohui; Li, Haibo; Gillesen, Annelies; Castle, Lyndsey; Chen, Cheng; Li, Hongyan; Zhen, Jing; Lu, Binghuai; Duan, Jun; Guo, Liping; Jiang, Jinfang; Cao, Ruiyuan; Fan, Guohui; Li, Jintong; Hayden, Frederick G; Wang, Chen; Horby, Peter; Cao, Bin",EBioMedicine,,611

We formulated recommendations to meet the urgent need for a consensus for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews were performed to evaluate: (a) outcomes in PRD with COVID-19; (b) efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccination; and (c) published guidelines/recommendations for non-live, non-COVID-19 vaccinations in PRD. Recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and expert opinion according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. RESULTS: The consensus comprises 2 overarching principles and 7 recommendations. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in PRD should be aligned with prevailing national policy and should be individualized through shared decision between the healthcare provider and patient. We strongly recommend that eligible PRD and household contacts be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. We conditionally recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered during quiescent disease if possible. Immunomodulatory drugs, other than rituximab, can be continued alongside vaccination. We conditionally recommend that the COVID-19 vaccine be administered prior to commencing rituximab if possible. For patients on rituximab, the vaccine should be administered a minimum of 6 months after the last dose and/or 4 weeks prior to the next dose of rituximab. Post-vaccination antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 need not be measured. Any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines may be used, with no particular preference.

275090,Tools for the evaluation of the psychological impact of COVID-19: A practical guide for Family physicians and Primary Care Practitioners,2021,"Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Small case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) IgG/IgM) in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected anticardiolipin IgM antibodies in 23%, anti-PS/PT IgG in 24%, and anti-PS/PT IgM in 18%. Any aPL was present in 52% of patients using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (>40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rates. Similar to patients with known and longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.","Zuo, Yu; Estes, Shanea K; Gandhi, Alex A; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Ali, Ramadan A; Shi, Hui; Sule, Gautam; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A; Zuo, Melanie; Woodard, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S",,,611
275091,Tools for the evaluation of the psychological impact of COVID-19: A practical guide for Family physicians and Primary Care Practitioners,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged as a highly virulent respiratory pathogen that is known as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Diarrhea is a common early symptom in a significant proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in esophageal cells and enterocytes, leading to direct damage to the intestinal epithelium. The infection decreases the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, thereby altering the composition of the gut microbiota. SARS-CoV-2 elicits a cytokine storm, which contributes to gastrointestinal inflammation. The direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2, gut dysbiosis, and aberrant immune response result in increased intestinal permeability, which may exacerbate existing symptoms and worsen the prognosis. By exploring the elements of pathogenesis, several therapeutic options have emerged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, such as biologics and biotherapeutic agents. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 through fecal-oral transmission and contaminate the environment. Thus gastrointestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection has important epidemiological significance. The development of new therapeutic and preventive options is necessary to treat and restrict the spread of this severe and widespread infection more effectively. Therefore, we summarize the key elements involved in the pathogenesis and the epidemiology of COVID-19-associated diarrhea.","Megyeri, Klara; Dernovics, Áron; Al-Luhaibi, Zaid I I; Rosztóczy, András",World J Gastroenterol,,611

At present, in the COVID-19 pandemic, such screening is often limited to isolated regions as determined by local governments. Screening of potentially infectious individuals should be conducted through coordinated national or global unified actions. Our current research focuses on using resources to conduct comprehensive national and regional regular testing with a risk rate based, algorithmic guided, multiple-level, pooled testing strategy. Here, combining methodologies with mathematical logistic models, we present an analytic procedure of an overall plan for coordinating state, national, or global testing. The proposed plan includes three parts 1) organization, resource allocation, and distribution; 2) screening based on different risk levels and business types; and 3) algorithm guided, multiple level, continuously screening the entire population in a region. This strategy will overcome the false positive and negative results in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and missing samples during initial tests. Based on our proposed protocol, the population screening of 300,000,000 in the US can be done weekly with between 15,000,000 and 6,000,000 test kits. The strategy can be used for population screening for current COVID-19 and any future severe infectious disease when drugs or vaccines are not available.","Gu, Tianshu; Yao, Lan; Meng, Xia; Graff, J Carolyn; Thomason, Donald; Li, Jing; Dong, Wei; Jiao, Yan; Aleya, Lotfi; Maida, Marcello; Wang, Cong-Yi; Zangerl, Barbara; Genini, Sem; Ray, Kunal; Goldman, Emanuel; Ji, Jiafu; Alexandrov, Andrei V; Sun, Dianjun; Gu, Weikuan; Wang, Yongjun",Sci Total Environ,,611

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of monthly operative case volumes and types for 8 residency programs for 2019 and January through April 2020. Cases were grouped as elective cranial, elective spine, and nonelective emergent cases. Programs were surveyed regarding residents' perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on surgical training, didactics, and research participation. Data were analyzed for individual programs and pooled across programs. RESULTS: Across programs, the 2019 monthly mean ± SD case volume was 211 ± 82; 2020 mean ± SD case volumes for January, February, March, and April were 228 ± 93, 214 ± 84, 180 ± 73, and 107 ± 45. Compared with 2019, March and April 2020 mean cases declined 15% (P = 0.003) and 49% (P = 0.002), respectively. COVID-19 affected surgical case volume for all programs; 75% reported didactics negatively affected, and 90% reported COVID-19 resulted in increased research time. Several neurosurgery residents required COVID-19 testing; however, to our knowledge, only 1 resident from the participating programs tested positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study documents a significant reduction in operative volume in 8 neurosurgery residency training programs in early 2020. During this time, neurosurgery residents engaged in online didactics and research-related activities, reporting increased research productivity. Residency programs should collect data to determine the educational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents' operative case volumes, identify deficiencies, and develop plans to mitigate any effects.","Aljuboori, Zaid S; Young, Christopher C; Srinivasan, Visish M; Kellogg, Ryan T; Quon, Jennifer L; Alshareef, Mohammed A; Chen, Stephanie H; Ivan, Michael; Grant, Gerald A; McEvoy, Sean D; Davanzo, Justin R; Majid, Sonia; Durfy, Sharon; Levitt, Michael R; Sieg, Emily P; Ellenbogen, Richard G; Nauta, Haring J",World Neurosurg,,611

Applying European age-specific death rates in 2017 to the US population, we then show that adverse mortality conditions in the United States resulted in 400,700 excess deaths that year. Finally, we show that these excess deaths entailed a loss of 13.0 My of life. In 2017, excess deaths and years of life lost in the United States represent a larger annual loss of life than that associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020.","Preston, Samuel H; Vierboom, Yana C",Proc.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery. METHODS: This international cohort study included adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection before operation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. Preoperative testing strategies were adjusted for confounding using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2 per cent) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6 per cent) had a swab test, 521 (5.9 per cent) CT only, and 324 (3.7 per cent) swab and CT. Pulmonary complications occurred in 3.9 per cent, whereas SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 2.6 per cent. After risk adjustment, having at least one negative preoperative nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.68 to 0.98; P = 0.040) was associated with a lower rate of pulmonary complications. Swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in areas with a high 14-day SARS-CoV-2 case notification rate, but not before minor surgery or in low-risk areas. To prevent one pulmonary complication, the number needed to swab test before major or minor surgery was 18 and 48 respectively in high-risk areas, and 73 and 387 in low-risk areas. CONCLUSION: Preoperative nasopharyngeal swab testing was beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 risk areas.

Methods To evaluate self-reported medication use in relation to urine drug metabolite levels in a large cohort of CKD patients, the Germany Chronic Kidney Disease study, we ascertained self-reported use of 158 substances and 41 medication groups and coded active ingredients according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. We used a nontargeted mass spectrometry-based approach to quantify metabolites in urine; calculated specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of medication use and corresponding metabolite measurements; and used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations and prescription patterns. Results Among 4885 participants, there were 108 medication-drug metabolite pairs based on reported medication use and 78 drug metabolites. Accuracy was excellent for measurements of 36 individual substances in which the unchanged drug was measured in urine (median, 98.5%; range 61.1%-100%). For 66 pairs of substances and their related drug metabolites, median measurement-based specificity and sensitivity were 99.2% (range 84.0%-100%) and 71.7% (range 1.2%-100%), respectively. Commonly prescribed medications for hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction-including angiotensin-II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and metoprolol-showed high sensitivity and specificity. Although self-reported use of prescribed analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) was <3% each, drug metabolite levels indicated higher usage (acetaminophen, 10%-26%; ibuprofen, 10%-18%). Conclusions This comprehensive screen of associations between urine drug metabolite levels and self-reported medication use supports the use of pharmacometabolomics to assess medication adherence and prescription patterns in persons with CKD, and indicates underreported use of medications available over the counter, such as analgesics.","Kotsis, Fruzsina; Schultheiss, Ulla; Wuttke, Matthias; Schlosser, Pascal; Mielke, Johanna; Becker, Michael; Oefner, Peter; Karoly, Edward; Mohney, Robert; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Sekula, Peggy; Köttgen, Anna",J.

Objective: To discover how physical activity and lifestyle affect the epidemic as well as the disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 203 adults infected with COVID-19 and 228 uninfected adults in three Chinese provinces, with 164 (80.7%) of the infected participants and 188 (82.5%) of the uninfected participants answering a doctor-administered telephone questionnaire on lifestyle. The binary logistic regression model and the ordinal logit model were used to observe relevance. Results: Comparing sick and non-sick patients, we found that irregular exercise (P=0.004), sedentary lifestyle (P=0.010), and overexertion (P<0.001) may be associated with the susceptibility to COVID-19. In symptomatic patients, using the recommended status as a reference, risk of severe infection increased with decreased sleep status, being 6.729 (95% CI=2.138-21.181) times higher for potentially appropriate sleep (P=0.001) and peaking at 8.612 (95% CI=1.913-38.760) times higher for lack of sleep (P=0.005). Reduction in average daily sleep time significantly increased the likely severity (P=0.002). Discussion: Through further examination of damage of external lung organs, we found that lack of sleep affected not only disease severity but also prognosis.

Secondly, it has several antigenic regions that might be targeted for vaccine development. However, the structural analytical data for the spike protein of this virus is not available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we performed an analysis to understand the structural two subunits of S glycoprotein (S gp) of SARS-CoV-2. Further, an analysis of secondary structure components and the tertiary structure analysis of RBD was carried out. We also performed molecular interaction analysis between S gp of this virus and hACE2 as well as between SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 to compare the binding properties of these two viruses. RESULTS: We noted that the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 form eleven hydrogen bonds, while the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 receptor form seven hydrogen bonds, indicating that the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 receptor is more stable than SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 receptor. The pairwise sequence alignment of S gp SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shows several conserved residues of these two proteins. Besides, conserved pattern analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 revealed the presence of several highly conserved regions for these two proteins. The molecular dynamics simulation shows a stable interplay between SARS-CoV-2 S gp with the hACE2 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: The present study might help determine the SARS-CoV-2 virus entrance mechanism into the human cell. Moreover, the understanding of the conserved regions may help in the process of therapeutic development from the infection of the deadly virus.","Chakraborty, C; Sharma, A R; Mallick, B; Bhattacharya, M; Sharma, G; Lee, S-S",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,611

289056,Predictors of Electronic Learning Self-Efficacy: A Cross-Sectional Study in Saudi Arabian Universities,2021,"COVID-19 has spread around the world since December 2019, creating one of the greatest pandemics ever witnessed. According to the current reports, this is a situation when people need to be more careful and take the precaution measures more seriously, unless the condition may become even worse. Maintaining social distances and proper hygiene, staying at isolation or adopting the self-quarantine method are some of the common practices that people should use to avoid the infection. And the growing information regarding COVID-19 and its symptoms help the people to take proper precautions. In this present study, we consider an SEIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission which accounts for the effect of an individual's behavioural response due to the information regarding proper precautions. Our results indicate that if people respond to the growing information regarding awareness at a higher rate and start to take the protective measures, then the infected population decreases significantly. The disease fatality can be controlled only if a large proportion of individuals become immune, either by natural immunity or by a proper vaccine. In order to apply the latter option, we need to wait until a safe and proper vaccine is developed and it is a time-taking process. Hence, in the latter part of the work, an optimal control problem is considered by implementing control strategies to reduce the disease burden. Numerical figures show that the control denoting behavioural response works with higher intensity immediately after implementation and then gradually decreases with time. Further, the control policy denoting hospitalisation of infected individuals works with its maximum intensity for quite a long time period following a sudden decrease. As, the implementation of the control strategies reduce the infected population and increase the recovered population, so, it may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current epidemic situation.","Saha, Sangeeta; Samanta, G P; Nieto, Juan J",Nonlinear Dyn,,611

Surgery remains the optimal treatment for the majority of oral malignancies, and primary reconstruction is often necessary to avoid significant morbidity as a result of ablative procedures. Description: The supraclavicular artery island flap (SCAIF) is increasingly finding a place as an alternative to free flap reconstruction of soft-tissue defects and has several specific advantages when compared to use of a soft-tissue free flap during the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be used for a range of head and neck defects. Results: We describe our experience with the SCAIF during the pandemic in five patients with a variety of tumour types and locations. All five patients had a successful outcome with none requiring further reconstruction and all had a functional swallow postoperatively, including a patient who underwent a total pharyngeal reconstruction with a SCAIF. Discussion: The use of a SCAIF during the current COVID-19 pandemic has significant advantages and is a reliable alternative to a soft tissue free flap.","Thompson, Alexandra; Khan, Zia; Patterson, Alan; Java, Kapil; Varley, Iain",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,,611
289626,Factors associated with work performance and mental health of healthcare workers during pandemics: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The recent outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 virus has had a significant effect on human respiratory health around the world. The contagious disease infected a large proportion of the world population, resulting in long-term health issues and an excessive mortality rate. The SARS CoV-2 virus can spread as small aerosols and enters the respiratory systems through the oral (nose or mouth) airway. The SARS CoV-2 particle transport to the mouth-throat and upper airways is analyzed by the available literature. Due to the tiny size, the virus can travel to the terminal airways of the respiratory system and form a severe health hazard. There is a gap in the understanding of the SARS CoV-2 particle transport to the terminal airways. The present study investigated the SARS CoV-2 virus particle transport and deposition to the terminal airways in a complex 17-generation lung model. This first-ever study demonstrates how far SARS CoV-2 particles can travel in the respiratory system. ANSYS Fluent solver was used to simulate the virus particle transport during sleep and light and heavy activity conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that a higher percentage of the virus particles are trapped at the upper airways when sleeping and in a light activity condition. More virus particles have lung contact in the right lung than the left lung. A comprehensive lobe specific deposition and deposition concentration study was performed. The results of this study provide a precise knowledge of the SARs CoV-2 particle transport to the lower branches and could help the lung health risk assessment system. © 2021 Author(s).","Islam, M.

Using data from Italy and other countries we evaluated the role of different determinants of this phenomenon. We found that the Italian testing strategy could explain an important part of the observed difference in CFR. In particular, the majority of patients that are currently tested in Italy have severe clinical symptoms that usually require hospitalization and this translates to a large CFR. We are confident that, once modifications in the testing strategy leading to higher population coverage are consistently adopted in Italy, CFR will realign with the values reported worldwide.","Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Ragazzoni, Luca; Schmid, Maurizio",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,611

298649,Differential impacts of COVID-19 across racial-ethnic identities in persons with opioid use disorder,2021,"In light of the recent pandemic, favipiravir (Avigan®), a purine nucleic acid analog and antiviral agent approved for use in influenza in Japan, is being studied for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Increase in blood uric acid level is a frequent side effect of favipiravir. Here, we discussed the mechanism of blood uric acid elevation during favipiravir treatment. Favipiravir is metabolized to an inactive metabolite M1 by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, and excreted into urine. In the kidney, uric acid handling is regulated by the balance of reabsorption and tubular secretion in the proximal tubules. Favipiravir and M1 act as moderate inhibitors of organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3), which are involved in uric acid excretion in the kidney. In addition, M1 enhances uric acid reuptake via urate transporter 1 (URAT1) in the renal proximal tubules. Thus, favipiravir is thought to decrease uric acid excretion into urine, resulting in elevation of uric acid levels in blood. Elevated uric acid levels were returned to normal after discontinuation of favipiravir, and favipiravir is not used for long periods of time for the treatment of viral infection. Thus, the effect on blood uric acid levels was subclinical in most studies. Nevertheless, the adverse effect of favipiravir might be clinically important in patients with a history of gout, hyperuricemia, kidney function impairment (in which blood concentration of M1 increases), and where there is concomitant use of other drugs affecting blood uric acid elevation.","Mishima, Eikan; Anzai, Naohiko; Miyazaki, Mariko; Abe, Takaaki",Tohoku J Exp Med,,611

300205,Global Health Partnerships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Perspectives and Insights from International Partners,2021,"Agricultural water management (AWM) interventions play an important role in ensuring sustainable food production and mitigating climate risks. This study was carried out in a watershed located in a low rainfall (400-600 mm) region of western India. The SWAT model was calibrated using surface runoff, soil loss and reservoir storage levels, between the year 2000 and 2006. The investigation indicated that the various AWM interventions increased groundwater recharge from 30 mm/year to 80 mm/year and reduced surface runoff from 250 mm/year to 100 mm/year. The intervention structures were refilled 2 to 3 times during the monsoon season depending on rainfall intensity and duration. The interventions have the advantage of building a resilient system by enhancing groundwater availability even in dry years, stimulating crop intensification and protecting the landscape from severe erosion. The results indicate that soil erosion has been reduced by more than 75% compared to the non-intervention situation. Moreover, the AWM interventions led to the cultivation of 100-150 ha of fallow land with high value crops (horticulture, vegetables and fodder). Household income increased by several-folds compared to the non-intervention situation. The study showed about 50% reduction in downstream water availability, which could be a major concern. However, there are a number of ecosystem trade-offs such as improved base flow to the stream and reduction in soil loss that should be considered. The study is of great importance to stakeholders to decide on the optimum design for AWM interventions to achieve sustainable development goals.","Garg, Kaushal K; Anantha, K H; Radha, A Venkata; Dixit, Sreenath; Singh, Ramesh; Ragab, Ragab",,,611

Although several FDA-approved drugs are currently under clinical trials for drug repositioning, there is an on-going global effort for new drug identification. In this paper, using multi-omics (interactome, proteome, transcriptome, and bibliome) data and subsequent integrated analysis, we present the biological events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify several candidate drugs against this viral disease. We found that: (i) Interactome-based infection pathways differ from the other three omics-based profiles. (ii) Viral process, mRNA splicing, cytokine and interferon signaling, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis are important pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection also shares pathways with Influenza A, Epstein-Barr virus, HTLV-I, Measles, and Hepatitis virus. (iv) Further, bacterial, parasitic, and protozoan infection pathways such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Leishmaniasis are also shared by this virus. (v) A total of 50 candidate drugs, including the prophylaxis agents and pathway specific inhibitors are identified against COVID-19. (vi) Betamethasone, Estrogen, Simvastatin, Hydrocortisone, Tositumomab, Cyclosporin A etc. are among the important drugs. (vii) Ozone, Nitric oxide, plasma components, and photosensitizer drugs are also identified as possible therapeutic candidates. (viii) Curcumin, Retinoic acids, Vitamin D, Arsenic, Copper, and Zinc may be the candidate prophylaxis agents. Nearly 70% of our identified agents are previously suggested to have anti-COVID-19 effects or under clinical trials. Among our identified drugs, the ones that are not yet tested, need validation with caution while an appropriate drug combination from these candidate drugs along with a SARS-CoV-2 specific antiviral agent is needed for effective COVID-19 management.","Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; Weener, Marianna E; Azevedo, Vasco; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Gromiha, M Michael; Ghosh, Preetam",Comput Biol Med,,611

In the educational materials used in these resources, the Microcontent (MC) format predominates, with its fragmented and small information units. So, we ask: can the LongForm (LF) format, which allows the presentation of dense and extensive content, be a viable alternative to MC, when applied to complex educational content, specific to undergraduate courses? The LF, hypothetically, can offer better support for higher distance education courses. To answer the question, an educational activity, elaborated in both formats, was applied to 67 students from a university of Minas Gerais state, in Brazil. The observation of student activity revealed their preferences: MC has shown to be good for building learning with smaller materials in both size and content complexity, but LF was more appropriated when dealing with complex, dense, multimedia-requiring contents to facilitate understanding.

The LF, hypothetically, can offer better support for higher distance education courses To answer the question, an educational activity, elaborated in both formats, was applied to 67 students from a university of Minas Gerais state, in Brazil The observation of student activity revealed their preferences: MC has shown to be good for building learning with smaller materials in both size and content complexity, but LF was more appropriated when dealing with complex, dense, multimedia-requiring contents to facilitate understanding It was confirmed that the LF presents itself as a viable alternative for online studying because it is constituted by a single virtual space where larger texts and varied multimedia resources can be inserted to enrich the educational material and to offer the full content for students","Gomes, N.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to discuss the evidence related to telehealth medication reviews and provide practical considerations for conducting successful medication reviews by telehealth. DISCUSSION: Leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth technologies had been increasingly used to deliver medication review services, mainly to patients in rural and remote areas, and were accepted by patients. Available evidence suggests telehealth medication reviews may positively affect clinical and cost outcomes, but there are ongoing challenges. When delivering these services, appropriate preparation - using support people, maintaining patients' privacy, selecting the most suitable technology on the basis of individual circumstances and ensuring good communication between healthcare professionals involved in medication review cycle of care - can help produce best results for patients.","Shafiee Hanjani, Leila; Bell, J Simon; Freeman, Christopher",Aust J Gen Pract,,611
318710,Healthcare Provider Attitudes toward the Newly Developed COVID-19 Vaccine: Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"We conduct simulations of white dwarf (WD) - neutron star (NS) reverse evolution, and conclude that a core collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion might occur inside a planetary nebula (PN) only if a third star forms the PN. In the WD-NS reverse evolution the primary star evolves and transfers mass to the secondary star, forms a PN, and leaves a WD remnant. If the mass transfer brings the secondary star to have a mass of>8Mo before it develops a helium core, it explodes as a CCSN and leaves a NS remnant. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) we find that in the reverse evolution the time period from the formation of the PN by the primary star to the explosion of the secondary star is longer than a million years. By that time the PN has long dispersed into the interstellar medium. If we start with two stars that are too close in mass to each other, then the mass transfer takes place after the secondary star has developed a helium core and it ends forming a PN and a WD. The formation of a CCSN inside a PN (so called CCSNIP) requires the presence of a third star, either as a tertiary star in the system or as a nearby member in an open cluster. The third star should be less massive than the secondary star but by no more than few 0.01Mo. We estimate that the rate of CCSNIP is about 0.0001 times the rate of all CCSNe.","Bear, Ealeal; Soker, Noam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04437v1.pdf,611

322763,Have the sleep habits in children of health workers been more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) results from autoimmune attack on the peripheral nerves, causing sensory, motor and autonomic abnormalities. Emerging evidence suggests that there might be an association between COVID-19 and GBS. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed bioinformatic analyses to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between COVID-19 and GBS. RESULTS: COVID-19 and GBS were associated with a similar subset of immune/inflammation regulatory genes, including TNF, CSF2, IL2RA, IL1B, IL4, IL6 and IL10. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that the combined gene set showed an increased connectivity as compared to COVID-19 or GBS alone, particularly the potentiated interactions with CD86, IL23A, IL27, ISG20, PTGS2, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and ITGAM, and these genes are related to Th17 cell differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID-19 and GBS further demonstrated the activation of interleukin-17 signalling in both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine response was identified in both COVID-19 and GBS. PBMC transcriptome analysis also suggested the pivotal involvement of Th17 signalling pathway. In conclusion, our data suggested aberrant Th17 cell differentiation as a possible mechanism by which COVID-19 can increase the risk of GBS.","Li, Zheng; Huang, Ziheng; Li, Xingye; Huang, Cheng; Shen, Jianxiong; Li, Shugang; Zhang, Lin; Wong, Sunny H; Chan, Matthew T V; Wu, William Ka Kei",Cell Prolif,,611

324674,A holistic care approach to combat the COVID-19 disease,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The association between sleep and adiposity (indexed by body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio) has typically been evaluated using a single dimension of self-reported sleep. However, other dimensions and behavioral measures of sleep may also be associated with adiposity. This study evaluated whether multidimensional sleep health calculated from actigraphy and self-report was longitudinally associated with adiposity in a sample of midlife women who have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances and adiposity. DESIGN: Longitudinal study with 11-14 years of follow-up time between the sleep health assessment and body mass index / waist-to-hip ratio measurements. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and twenty-one midlife women enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Sleep Study. MEASUREMENTS: Multidimensional sleep health was quantified using actigraphy (M[SD] = 29.1[7.2] nights) measures of sleep efficiency, midpoint, duration, regularity, and self-report measures of alertness and satisfaction. Each component was dichotomized and summed; higher values indicated better sleep health. Height, body weight, and waist and hip circumference were measured at the sleep study and at follow-up. Linear regression models were used to assess associations between sleep health and adiposity, adjusting for demographic and menopausal covariates. RESULTS: There was no substantial within-person change in adiposity over time. Better sleep health was cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with lower adiposity in unadjusted, but not in adjusted, models. Individual sleep health components were not associated with adiposity after adjustment. CONCLUSION: We did not observe cross-sectional or longitudinal associations between multidimensional sleep health and adiposity. The sleep-adiposity link may be weaker in midlife adults than in other age groups.","Bowman, Marissa A; Brindle, Ryan C; Joffe, Hadine; Kline, Christopher E; Buysse, Daniel J; Appelhans, Bradley M; Kravitz, Howard M; Matthews, Karen A; Neal-Perry, Genevieve S; Krafty, Robert T; Hall, Martica H",Sleep Health,,611

331324,Acceptability of ENG-releasing subdermal implants among postpartum Brazilian young women during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically changed life in the United States, as the country has recorded over 23 million cases and 383,000 deaths to date. In the lead-up to widespread vaccine deployment, testing and surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible routes of transmission. Contact tracing has become an important surveillance measure for COVID-19 control in the United States, and mobile health interventions have found increased prominence in this space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use and usability of MyCOVIDKey, a mobile-based web application to assist COVID-19 contact tracing efforts during the 6-week pilot period. METHODS: A six-week study was conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, TN. The population, consisting primarily of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt University, was asked to use the MyCOVIDKey web application during the course of the study period. Paradata was collected as users engaged with the MyCOVIDKey web application. At the end of the study, all participants were asked to report on their user experience in a survey, and the results were analyzed in the context of the user paradata. RESULTS: MyCOVIDKey enrolled 45 users during the pilot period. An analysis of their enrollment suggests that initial recruiting efforts were effective, however participant recruitment and engagement efforts at the mid-point of the study were less effective. Application usage paralleled the number of users, indicating incentives were useful for recruiting new sign-ups, but did not result in users trying to artificially inflate their usage as a result of prize offers. Time-to-completion of key tasks were low, indicating that the main features of the application could be quickly used. Of the 45 users, 30 provided feedback through a post-pilot survey with 26 (58%) completing it in its entirety. The MyCOVIDKey app as a whole was rated 70.0 on the System Usability Scale, indicating that it performed above the accepted threshold for usability. When the key-in and self-assessment features were examined on their own, it was found that they individually crossed the same thresholds for acceptable usability, but that the key-in feature had a higher margin for improvements. CONCLUSIONS: The MyCOVIDKey application was found overall to be a useful tool for COVID-19 contact tracing in a university setting. Most users suggested simple-to-implement improvements, such as replacing the web application framework with a native application format, or changing the placement of the scanner within the app workflow. After these updates, this tool could readily be deployed and could easily be adapted for other settings across the country. The need for digital contact tracing tools is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly as case numbers continue to increase while more businesses begin to re-open.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; DeSousa, Jenna; Moore, Carson; Hardcastle, Austin; Wright, David Wilson",,,611

This outbreak can be controlled only by the diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection in early stages. It is found that the radiographic images are ideal for the fastest diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. This paper proposes an ensemble model which detects the COVID-19 infection in the early stage with the use of chest X-ray images. The transfer learning enables to reuse the pretrained models. The ensemble learning integrates various transfer learning models, i.e., EfficientNet, GoogLeNet, and XceptionNet, to design the proposed model. These models can categorize patients as COVID-19 (+), pneumonia (+), tuberculosis (+), or healthy. The proposed model enhances the classifier's generalization ability for both binary and multiclass COVID-19 datasets. Two popular datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model. The comparative analysis validates that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art models in terms of various performance metrics.","Kumar, N; Gupta, M; Gupta, D; Tiwari, S",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,611

It is considered to be one of the highest malignancy grades. We present a case of a liposarcoma of the spermatic cord in a 45-year-old male complaining of a progressive painless swelling in the right inguinoscrotal region. Ultrasonography and computed tomography findings were compatible with liposarcoma of the spermatic cord. We performed a right radical orchiectomy with a wide resection of the mass. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis and showed a pleomorphic subtype. The mainstay of management of spermatic cord liposarcoma is wide excision with radical orchiectomy. The most important factors for prognosis are the histologic subtype and surgical margin status. Adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered in cases at high risk for local recurrence. Long-term surveillance is mandatory. Liposarcoma of the spermatic cord is an uncommon para testicular tumor which should be part of the differential diagnosis of inguinoscrotal mass.

336235,A learning experience of pandemic COVID-19 management at our medical institute,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing global pandemic, must overcome a conundrum faced by all viruses. To achieve its own replication and spread, it simultaneously depends on and subverts cellular mechanisms. At the early stage of infection, SARS-CoV-2 expresses the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), which inhibits host translation by blocking the mRNA entry tunnel on the ribosome; this interferes with the binding of cellular mRNAs to the ribosome. Viral mRNAs, on the other hand, overcome this blockade. We show that NSP1 enhances expression of mRNAs containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader. The first stem-loop (SL1) in viral leader is both necessary and sufficient for this enhancement mechanism. Our analysis pinpoints specific residues within SL1 (three cytosine residues at the positions 15, 19 and 20) and another within NSP1 (R124) which are required for viral evasion, and thus might present promising drug targets. Additionally, we carried out analysis of a functional interactome of NSP1 using BioID and identified components of anti-viral defense pathways. Our analysis therefore suggests a mechanism by which NSP1 inhibits the expression of host genes while enhancing that of viral RNA. This analysis helps reconcile conflicting reports in the literature regarding the mechanisms by which the virus avoids NSP1 silencing.","Bujanic, Lucija; Shevchuk, Olga; Kuegelgen, Nicolai von; Ludwik, Katarzyna; Koppstein, David; Zerna, Nadja; Sickmann, Albert; Chekulaeva, Marina",,,611

BNT162b2 effectiveness against any Delta infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, was 64.2% (95% CI: 38.1-80.1%) [≥]14 days after the first dose and before the second dose, but was only 53.5% (95% CI: 43.9-61.4%) [≥]14 days after the second dose, in a population in which a large proportion of fully vaccinated persons received their second dose several months earlier. Corresponding effectiveness measures for mRNA-1273 were 79.0% (95% CI: 58.9-90.1%) and 84.8% (95% CI: 75.9-90.8%), respectively. Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to Delta was 89.7% (95% CI: 61.0-98.1%) for BNT162b2 and 100.0% (95% CI: 41.2-100.0%) for mRNA-1273, [≥]14 days after the second dose.

Applying the principle of controlling hazards at the source is argued in this context to call for an understanding of the upstream production and socio-political factors that are jointly affecting the nature of work and employment and their impact on the health of workers, the public, and the planet.","Loewenson, Rene",New Solut,,611
339338,COVID-19 pandemic and systemic autoinflammatory diseases management: a cross-sectional survey,2021,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are in the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic are often under significant pressures that may predispose them to symptoms of poor mental health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. And, it also aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August, 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting, as well as the HADS. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD = 6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in the final analysis. The Bangla HADS was psychometrically sound, and demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability (&#945; = 0.83), and excellent construct validity. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were 69.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, for less severe symptomology (at least borderline abnormal), and 41.2% and 15.7% for more severe (at least abnormal) symptomology. Regression analyses with the total HADS score as a dependent variable revealed significant (p < 0.05) associations with female gender, moderate and poor health status, infrequent physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about one's profession because of the pandemic and associated experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for screening for mental health concerns, and employing early intervention to help these individuals.","Tasnim, Rafia; Sujan, Md Safaet Hossain; Islam, Md Saiful; Ritu, Asmaul Husna; Siddique, Md Abid Bin; Toma, Tanziha Yeasmin; Nowshin, Rifat; Hasan, Abid; Hossain, Sahadat; Nahar, Shamsun; Islam, Salequl; Islam, Muhammad Sougatul; Potenza, Marc N; van Os, Jim",BMC Psychiatry,,611

343166,"Creating Practical Primary Care Supports for Parent-Child Relationships-Language, Literacy, and Love",2021,"RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm often disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport to preferentially translate their own transcripts and prevent host antiviral responses. The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be a major inhibitor of interferon production in both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we show SARS-CoV-2-infected cells display an elevated level of nuclear mRNA accumulation compared to mock-infected cells. We demonstrate that ORF6 is responsible for this nuclear imprisonment of host mRNA, and using a cotransfected reporter assay, we show this nuclear retention of mRNA blocks expression of newly transcribed mRNAs. ORF6's nuclear entrapment of host mRNA is associated with its ability to copurify with the mRNA export factors, Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6, a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and presymptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also show that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a broad range of host proteins. Together, these data support a model in which ORF6 clogs the nuclear pore through its interactions with Rae1 and Nup98 to prevent both nuclear import and export, rendering host cells incapable of responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an RNA virus with a large genome that encodes multiple accessory proteins. While these accessory proteins are not required for growth in vitro, they can contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells accumulate poly(A) mRNA in the nucleus, which is attributed to the accessory protein ORF6. Nuclear entrapment of mRNA and reduced expression of newly transcribed reporter proteins are associated with ORF6's interactions with the mRNA export proteins Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also shows the same interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. However, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly represses reporter expression and copurifies with Rae1 and Nup98 compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. Both SARS-CoV ORF6 and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 block nuclear import of a wide range of host factors through interactions with Rae1 and Nup98. Together, our results suggest ORF6's disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport prevents infected cells from responding to the invading virus.","Addetia, Amin; Lieberman, Nicole A P; Phung, Quynh; Hsiang, Tien-Ying; Xie, Hong; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Shrestha, Lasata; Loprieno, Michelle A; Huang, Meei-Li; Gale, Michael; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",mBio (Online),,611
343169,Geographical distribution and prevalence of mental disorders among healthcare workers in China: A cross-sectional country-wide survey: A cross-sectional study to assess mental disorders of healthcare workers in China,2021,"OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients may have cardiac involvement including arrhythmias. Although arrhythmia characterization and possible predictors were previously reported, there are conflicting data regarding the exact prevalence of arrhythmias. Clinically applicable algorithms to classify COVID patients' arrhythmic risk are still lacking, and are the aim of our study. METHODS: We describe a single center cohort of hospitalized patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 during the initial Israeli outbreak between 1/2/2020 -30/5/2020. The study's outcome was any documented arrhythmia during hospitalization, based on daily physical examination, routine ECG's, periodic 24-hour Holter, and continuous monitoring. Multivariate analysis was used to find predictors for new arrhythmias and create classification trees for discriminating patients with high and low arrhythmic risk. RESULTS: Out of 390 COVID-19 patients included, 28 (7.2%) had documented arrhythmias during hospitalization, including: 23 atrial tachyarrhythmias, combined atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia storm, and 3 bradyarrhythmias. Only 7/28 patients had previous arrhythmias. Our study showed significant correlation between disease severity and arrhythmia prevalence (p<0.001) with a low arrhythmic prevalence among mild disease patients (2%). Multivariate analysis revealed background heart failure (CHF) and disease severity are independently associated with overall arrhythmia while age, CHF, disease severity, and arrhythmic symptoms are associated with tachyarrhythmias. A novel decision tree using age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels was created to stratify patients into high and low risk for developing arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Dominant arrhythmia among COVID-19 patients is AF. Arrhythmia prevalence is associated with age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels. A novel simple Classification tree, based on these parameters, can discriminate between high and low arrhythmic risk patients.","Rav-Acha, Moshe; Orlev, Amir; Itzhaki, Itay; Zimmerman, Shmuel F; Fteiha, Bashar; Bohm, Davina; Kurd, Ramzi; Samuel, Tal Y; Asher, Elad; Helviz, Igal; Glikson, Michael; Michowitz, Yoav",Int J Clin Pract,,611

344065,COVID-19: Global Health Equity in Pandemic Response,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to develop a multiparametric prognostic model for death in COVID-19 patients and to assess the incremental value of CT disease extension over clinical parameters. METHODS: Consecutive patients who presented to all five of the emergency rooms of the Reggio Emilia province between February 27 and March 23, 2020, for suspected COVID-19, underwent chest CT, and had a positive swab within 10 days were included in this retrospective study. Age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory data were retrieved from institutional information systems. CT disease extension was visually graded as < 20%, 20-39%, 40-59%, or &#8805; 60%. The association between clinical and CT variables with death was estimated with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models; model performance was assessed using k-fold cross-validation for the area under the ROC curve (cvAUC). RESULTS: Of the 866 included patients (median age 59.8, women 39.2%), 93 (10.74%) died. Clinical variables significantly associated with death in multivariable model were age, male sex, HDL cholesterol, dementia, heart failure, vascular diseases, time from symptom onset, neutrophils, LDH, and oxygen saturation level. CT disease extension was also independently associated with death (HR = 7.56, 95% CI = 3.49; 16.38 for &#8805; 60% extension). cvAUCs were 0.927 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.899-0.947) for the clinical model and 0.936 (bootstrap bias-corrected 95% CI = 0.912-0.953) when adding CT extension. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic model based on clinical variables is highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients. Adding CT disease extension to the model scarcely improves its accuracy. KEY POINTS: â¢ Early identification of COVID-19 patients at higher risk of disease progression and death is crucial; the role of CT scan in defining prognosis is unclear. â¢ A clinical model based on age, sex, comorbidities, days from symptom onset, and laboratory results was highly accurate in predicting death in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency room. â¢ Disease extension assessed with CT was independently associated with death when added to the model but did not produce a valuable increase in accuracy.","Besutti, Giulia; Ottone, Marta; Fasano, Tommaso; Pattacini, Pierpaolo; Iotti, Valentina; Spaggiari, Lucia; Bonacini, Riccardo; Nitrosi, Andrea; Bonelli, Efrem; Canovi, Simone; Colla, Rossana; Zerbini, Alessandro; Massari, Marco; Lattuada, Ivana; Ferrari, Anna Maria; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo",Eur. radiol,,611

352957,Knowledge and Attitudes Towards COVID-19: A Cross-sectional Study in Portugal,2021,"BACKGROUND: With the persistent COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to use rapid and reliable diagnostic tools for highly urgent cases. Antigen tests are disappointing with their lack of sensitivity. Among molecular tools allowing a diagnosis in less than an hour, only one, the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, has exhibited a good sensitivity. However, we are also facing a global shortage of reagents and kits. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate other point-of-care molecular tests. METHODS: We evaluated the VitaPCR&#8482; RT-PCR assay, whose sample analysis time is of approximately 20 min, in nasopharyngeal secretions from 534 patients presenting to our Institute, for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and compared it to our routine RT-PCR assay. We also compared the two assays with tenfold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 strain. RESULTS: Compared to our routine RT-PCR and the previous diagnosis of COVID-19, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of VitaPCR&#8482; can be evaluated to be 99.3 % (155/156), 94.7 % (358/378), 88.6 % (155/175) and 99.7 % (358/359), respectively. Tenfold dilutions of a SARS-CoV-2 strain show that the VitaPCR&#8482; was more sensitive that our routine RT-PCR assay. CONCLUSION: The VitaPCR&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 is an accurate rapid test, suitable for clinical practice that can be performed as part of a point-of-care testing, for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.","Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Zandotti, Christine; Ninove, Laetitia; Prudent, Elsa; Colson, Philippe; Gazin, Céline; Million, Matthieu; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Fenollar, Florence",J Clin Virol,,611

The Chinese National Health and Medical Commission recently recommended the use of inhaled H2 in addition to O2 therapy in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia, and its effects extend to anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. SUMMARY: In this review, we highlight key findings from preclinical research and recent clinical studies demonstrating that H2 reduces the organ damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion. We outline the critical role this effect plays in a variety of medical emergencies, including myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic shock, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as well as in organ transplantation. H2 is compared with established treatments such as targeted temperature management, and we discuss its possible mechanisms of action, including the recently identified suppression of TNF-&#945;-mediated endothelial glycocalyx degradation by inhaled H2 . In addition, we describe our new method that enables H2 gas to be easily transported to emergency settings and quickly injected into an organ preservation solution at the site of donor organ procurement. CONCLUSION: H2 is an easily administered, inexpensive, and well-tolerated agent that is highly effective for a wide range of conditions in emergency medicine, as well as for preserving donated organs.","Sano, Motoaki; Tamura, Tomoyoshi",Curr. pharm. des,,611

Our study aimed to investigate clinical features of Staphylococcus aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia (SA-VAP) and, if bronchoalveolar lavage samples were available, lung bacterial community features in ICU patients with or without COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across two medical ICUs of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy), who developed SA-VAP between 20 March 2020 and 30 October 2020 (thereafter referred to as cases). After 1:2 matching based on the simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, cases were compared with SA-VAP patients without COVID-19 (controls). Clinical, microbiological, and lung microbiota data were analyzed. RESULTS: We studied two groups of patients (40 COVID-19 and 80 non-COVID-19). COVID-19 patients had a higher rate of late-onset (87.5% versus 63.8%; p = 0.01), methicillin-resistant (65.0% vs 27.5%; p < 0.01) or bacteremic (47.5% vs 6.3%; p < 0.01) infections compared with non-COVID-19 patients. No statistically significant differences between the patient groups were observed in ICU mortality (p = 0.12), clinical cure (p = 0.20) and microbiological eradication (p = 0.31). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, SAPS II and initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy were independently associated with ICU mortality. Then, lung microbiota characterization in 10 COVID-19 and 16 non-COVID-19 patients revealed that the overall microbial community composition was significantly different between the patient groups (unweighted UniFrac distance, R2 0.15349; p < 0.01). Species diversity was lower in COVID-19 than in non COVID-19 patients (94.4 ± 44.9 vs 152.5 ± 41.8; p < 0.01). Interestingly, we found that S. aureus (log2 fold change, 29.5), Streptococcus anginosus subspecies anginosus (log2 fold change, 24.9), and Olsenella (log2 fold change, 25.7) were significantly enriched in the COVID-19 group compared to the non-COVID-19 group of SA-VAP patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, COVID-19 seemed to significantly affect microbiological and clinical features of SA-VAP as well as to be associated with a peculiar lung microbiota composition.","De Pascale, Gennaro; De Maio, Flavio; Carelli, Simone; De Angelis, Giulia; Cacaci, Margherita; Montini, Luca; Bello, Giuseppe; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Pintaudi, Gabriele; Tanzarella, Eloisa Sofia; Xhemalaj, Rikardo; Grieco, Domenico Luca; Tumbarello, Mario; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Posteraro, Brunella; Antonelli, Massimo",Crit Care,,611
361718,Challenging the Stigma of Mental Illness Through Creative Storytelling: A Randomized Controlled Trial of This Is My Brave,2020,"The aging immune system (immunosenescence) has been implicated with increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Of note, T cell aging and low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) are implicated with several age-related conditions. The expansion of late-differentiated T cells (CD28-), regulatory T cells, increased serum levels of autoantibodies, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were implicated with morbidities during aging. Features of accelerated immunosenescence can be identified in adults with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and are predictive of poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, there is an interplay between immunosenescence and age-related diseases. In this review, we discuss how the aging immune system may contribute to the development and clinical course of age-related diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases.","Barbé-Tuana, Florencia; Funchal, Giselle; Schmitz, Carine Raquel Richter; Maurmann, Rafael Moura; Bauer, Moisés E",Semin. immunopathol,,611

The online study was carried out during the first wave of the pandemic on a sample of 926 adults. Through cluster analysis, three groups of respondents were isolated: 1. People who fear a Covid-19 infection and follow the isolation rules (FFR), 2. People moderately afraid of the disease and following the rules loosely (MFFR), 3. People who are not afraid of the infection and do not follow the rules of isolation. (NFFR). The clusters were profiled with consideration of different aspects of eating behaviors as well as socio-demographic and economic features. The results of the study show a close relationship between the level of fear of contracting Covid-19 and the degree to which isolation rules are followed. These two factors were found to have a significant impact on eating behaviors, such as food purchases, eating patterns, and levels of consumption. It was stated that the FFR group changed their eating behaviors the most in terms of food purchasing, eating habits (excluding diversity and quality of diet), and food product consumption. The greatest stability in the majority of the analyzed areas of nutritional behaviors was observed in the MFFR cluster. The NFFR group shown the greatest decrease both in regularity and quality of their meals. This group also exhibited a significant increase in the consumption of alcoholic beverages. The results of the study can be useful in the decision making process when introducing restrictions or managing information. They also point to the need for extensive nutritional education focused on explaining the relationship between nutrition and health during a pandemic.","Kowalczuk, Iwona; Gebski, Jerzy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,611

The aim is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy on the careers of individuals aged 15-34. We find that the pandemic worsened an already concerning situation of higher unemployment and inactivity rates and significantly longer STWT duration compared to other EU countries, particularly for females and residents in the South of Italy. In the midst of the pandemic, individuals aged 20-29 were less in (permanent and temporary) employment and more in the NLFET (Neither in the Labour Force nor in Education or Training) state, particularly females and non Italian citizens. We also provide evidence of an increased propensity to return to schooling, but most importantly of a substantial prolongation of the STWT duration towards permanent employment, mostly for males and non Italian citizens.

Angiotensin-converting- enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell surface receptor that recognizes the coronavirus spike protein has protective effects against inflammation and chronic hyperglycemia in animal models. The roles of ACE2 in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections remains ambiguous due to contradictory findings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between human plasma ACE2 levels in diabetics and the high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the medical records of 245 patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive who have chronic diseases were analyzed. We also recruited 404 elderly subjects with comorbid chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and obesity, and investigated the ACE2 plasma levels. Plasma concentrations of ACE2 were much lower (2973.83±2196.79 pg/mL) in diabetics with chronic disease than in healthy controls (4308.21±2352.42 pg/ml), and the use of hypoglycemia drugs was associated with lower circulating concentrations of ACE2 (P=1.49E-08). Diabetics with lower plasma levels of ACE2 may be susceptible to severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the poor prognosis in patients with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be due to low circulating ACE2 levels.","Zhang, Yanliang; Sun, Yangyang; Liu, Kang; Alolga, Raphael N; Xu, Xueqiang; Feng, Ganzhu; Xiao, Pingxi",Aging (Albany NY),,611

In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface. This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic. In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a ""tele-bridge"" clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment.

A renewed approach to EU's role is needed,2020,"Touchless computer interaction has become an important consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Despite progress in machine learning and computer vision that allows for advanced gesture recognition, an integrated collection of such open-source methods and a user-customisable approach to utilising them in a low-cost solution for touchless interaction in existing software is still missing. In this paper, we introduce the MotionInput v2.0 application. This application utilises published open-source libraries and additional gesture definitions developed to take the video stream from a standard RGB webcam as input. It then maps human motion gestures to input operations for existing applications and games. The user can choose their own preferred way of interacting from a series of motion types, including single and bi-modal hand gesturing, full-body repetitive or extremities-based exercises, head and facial movements, eye tracking, and combinations of the above. We also introduce a series of bespoke gesture recognition classifications as DirectInput triggers, including gestures for idle states, auto calibration, depth capture from a 2D RGB webcam stream and tracking of facial motions such as mouth motions, winking, and head direction with rotation. Three use case areas assisted the development of the modules: creativity software, office and clinical software, and gaming software. A collection of open-source libraries has been integrated and provide a layer of modular gesture mapping on top of existing mouse and keyboard controls in Windows via DirectX. With ease of access to webcams integrated into most laptops and desktop computers, touchless computing becomes more available with MotionInput v2.0, in a federated and locally processed method.","Kummen, Ashild; Li, Guanlin; Hassan, Ali; Ganeva, Teodora; Lu, Qianying; Shaw, Robert; Ratwatte, Chenuka; Zou, Yang; Han, Lu; Almazov, Emil; Visram, Sheena; Taylor, Andrew; Sebire, Neil J; Stott, Lee; Rogers, Yvonne; Roberts, Graham; Mohamedally, Dean",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04357v1.pdf,611

The aim of this study was to compare the impact on triage, diagnosis and prognosis of patients with suspected COVID-19 when clinical decisions are derived from reconstructed CXR or from CT. METHODS: we reconstructed CXR (r-CXR) from high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan. Five clinical observers independently reviewed clinical charts of 300 subjects with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, integrated with either r-CXR or HRCT report in two consecutive blinded and randomised sessions: clinical decisions were recorded for each session. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and prognostic value were compared between r-CXR and HRCT. The best radiological integration was also examined to develop an optimised respiratory triage algorithm. RESULTS: interobserver agreement was fair (Kendall's W=0.365; p<0.001) by r-CXR-based protocol and good (Kendall's W=0.654; p<0.001) by CT-based protocol. NPV assisted by r-CXR (31.4%) was lower than that of HRCT (77.9%). In case of indeterminate or typical radiological appearence for COVID-19 pneumonia, extent of disease on r-CXR or HRCT were the only two imaging variables that were similarly linked to mortality by adjusted multivariable models CONCLUSIONS: the present findings suggest that clinical triage is safely assisted by CXR. An integrated algorithm using first-line CXR and contingent use of HRCT can help optimise management and prognostication of COVID-19.","Sverzellati, Nicola; Ryerson, Christopher J; Milanese, Gianluca; Renzoni, Elisabetta A; Volpi, Annalisa; Spagnolo, Paolo; Bonella, Francesco; Comelli, Ivan; Affanni, Paola; Veronesi, Licia; Manna, Carmelinda; Ciuni, Andrea; Sartorio, Carlotta; Tringali, Giulia; Silva, Mario; Michieletti, Emanuele; Colombi, Davide; Wells, Athol U",Eur. respir. j,,611

In this commentary, we offer two ideas to enhance the discussion on foodborne zoonotic diseases in food systems. DESIGN: First, we focus on the probable consequences that the loss of access to wildlife could cause to the status of food and nutrition security of many people in developing countries that rely on bushmeat to subsist. Second, we argue that all animal-based food systems, especially the ones based on intensive husbandry, present food safety threats. CONCLUSION: To ban the access to bushmeat without a rational analysis of all human meat production and consumption in the global animal-based food system will not help us to prevent future outbreaks.","Jacob, Michelle Cristine Medeiros; Feitosa, Ivanilda Soares; Albuquerque, Ulysses Paulino",Public Health Nutr,,611

This article considers the distinctive positive leadership style of Ardern while also demonstrating the ways it is grounded in the exigencies of the political field. A critical reading of Ardern’s media conference answers reveals four nominated categories: positive assertions, management of conflict/disagreement, delineation of politician role/responsibility, and political evasion. The four categories map the terrain of agreement and disagreement and they locate the subject position of the politician on that terrain.","Craig, Geoffrey",Journalism and Media,,611

373833,COVID-19 related anxiety in people living with HIV: An online cross-sectional study,2020,"In modern societies, human rest-activity rhythms and sleep result from the tensions and dynamics between the conflicting poles of external social time (e.g., work hours and leisure activities) and an individual's internal biological time. A mismatch between the two has been suggested to induce 'social jetlag' [1] and 'social sleep restriction', that is, shifts in sleep timing and differences in sleep duration between work days and free days. Social jetlag [2,3] and sleep restrictions [4] have repeatedly been associated with negative consequences on health, mental wellbeing, and performance. In a large-scale quasi-experimental design, we investigated the effects of the phase with the most rigorous COVID-19 restrictions on the relationship between social and biological rhythms as well as sleep during a six-week period (mid-March until end of April 2020) in three European societies (Austria, Germany, Switzerland). We found that, on one hand, the restrictions reduced the mismatch between external (social) and internal (biological) sleep-wake timing, as indexed by significant reductions in social jetlag and social sleep restriction, with a concomitant increase in sleep duration. Sleep quality on the other hand was slightly reduced. The improved individual sleep-wake timing can presumably be attributed to an increased flexibility of social schedules, for instance due to more work being accomplished from home. However, this unprecedented situation also led to a significant increase in self-perceived burden, which was attendant to the decrease in sleep quality. These adverse effects may be alleviated by exposure to natural daylight as well as physical exercise.","Blume, Christine; Schmidt, Marlene H; Cajochen, Christian",Curr Biol,,611

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective data collection of patients admitted to stroke units eventually treated with thrombolysis and thrombectomy, ranging from January to May 2020 from the beginning to the end of the main first pandemic period of COVID-19 in Italy. The primary endpoint was the number of patients arriving to these stroke units, and secondary endpoints were the number of thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy. Chi-square analysis was used on all patients; furthermore, patients were divided into two cohorts (pre-lockdown and lockdown periods) and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test differences on admission and reperfusive therapies. RESULTS: In total, 2536 patients were included in 22 centers. There was a significant decrease of admissions in April compared to January. Furthermore, we observed a significant decrease of thrombectomy during the lockdown period, while thrombolysis rate was unaffected in the same interval across all centers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a decrease in admission rate of stroke patients in a large area of northern Italy during the lockdown period, especially during the first dramatic phase. Overall, there was no decrease in thrombolysis rate, confirming an effect of emergency care system for stroke patients. Instead, the significant decrease in thrombectomy rate during lockdown addresses some considerations of local and regional stroke networks during COVID-19 pandemic evolution.","Manganotti, Paolo; Naccarato, Marcello; Scali, Ilario; Cappellari, Manuel; Bonetti, Bruno; Burlina, Alessandro; Turinese, Emanuele; Bogo, Sabrina; Teatini, Francesco; Franchini, Enrica; Caneve, Giorgio; Ruzza, Giampietro; Gaudenzi, Anna; Bombardi, Roberto; Bozzato, Giulio; Padoan, Roberta; Gentile, Carolina; Rana, Michele; Turazzini, Michelangelo; Alessandra, Danese; Brigo, Francesco; Nardone, Raffaele; Quatrale, Rocco; Menegazzo, Elisabetta; Masato, Maela; Novello, Stefano; Passadore, Paolo; Baldi, Antonio; Valentinis, Luca; Baracchini, Claudio; Pieroni, Alessio; Basile, Anna Maria; Semplicini, Claudio; Piffer, Silvio; Giometto, Bruno; Tonello, Simone; Bonifatti, Domenico Marco; Lorenzut, Simone; Merlino, Giovanni; Valente, Maria Rosaria; Paladin, Francesco; Tonon, Agnese; de Luca, Cristina; Perini, Francesco; Centonze, Sandro; Bovi, Paolo",Neurol. sci,,611
374522,Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on female sexual behavior,2020,"Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) has spread to many countries around the world, developing into a global pandemic with increasing numbers of deaths reported worldwide. To data, although some vaccines have been developed, there are no ideal drugs to treat novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)). By examining the structure of the coronavirus and briefly describing its possible pathogenesis based on recent autopsy reports conducted by various teams worldwide, this review analyzes the possible structural and functional changes of the human body upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. We observed that the most prominent pathological changes in COVID-19 patients are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) of the lungs and microthrombus formation, resulting in an imbalance of the ventilation/perfusion ratio and respiratory failure. Although direct evidence of viral infection can also be found in other organs and tissues, the viral load is relatively small. The conclusion that the injuries of the extra-pulmonary organs are directly caused by the virus needs further investigation.","Wu, Zhonglin; Zhang, Qi; Ye, Guo; Zhang, Hui; Heng, Boon Chin; Fei, Yang; Zhao, Bing; Zhou, Jing",J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,,611

376185,A cross--sectional study of mental wellbeing with practice of yoga and meditation during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes within aerosol particles can be partially shielded from UV radiation. The particles refract and absorb light, and thereby reduce the UV intensity at various locations within the particle. Previously, we demonstrated shielding in calculations of UV intensities within spherical approximations of SARS-CoV-2 virions within spherical particles approximating dried-to-equilibrium respiratory fluids. The purpose of this paper is to extend that work to survival fractions of virions (i.e., fractions of virions that can infect cells) within spherical particles approximating dried respiratory fluids, and to investigate the implications of these calculations for using UV light for disinfection. The particles may be on a surface or in air. Here, the survival fraction (S) of a set of individual virions illuminated with a UV fluence (F, in J/m2) is assumed described by S(kF) = exp(-kF), where k is the UV inactivation rate constant (m2/J). The average survival fraction (Sp) of the simulated virions in a group of particles is calculated using the energy absorbed by each virion in the particles. The results show that virions within particles of dried respiratory fluids can have larger Sp than do individual virions. For individual virions, and virions within 1-, 5-, and 9-µm particles illuminated (normal incidence) on a surface with 260-nm UV light, the Sp = 0.00005, 0.0155, 0.22, and 0.28, respectively, when kF = 10. The Sp decrease to <10-7, <10-7, 0.077, and 0.15, respectively, for kF = 100. Results also show that illuminating particles with UV beams from widely separated directions can strongly reduce the Sp. These results suggest that the size distributions and optical properties of the dried particles of virion-containing respiratory fluids are likely important to effectively designing and using UV germicidal irradiation systems for microbes in particles. The results suggest the use of reflective surfaces to increase the angles of illumination and decrease the Sp. The results suggest the need for measurements of the Sp of SARS-CoV-2 in particles having compositions and sizes relevant to the modes of disease transmission.","Hill, Steven C; Mackowski, Daniel W; Doughty, David C",J Occup Environ Hyg,,611

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine whether adherence to clinical routines for good end-of-life care differed for deaths because of COVID-19 compared with a reference cohort from 2019 and whether they differed between nursing homes and hospitals. METHODS: Data about five items reflecting clinical routines for persons who died an expected death from COVID-19 during the first three months of the pandemic (March-May 2020) were collected from the Swedish Register of Palliative Care. The items were compared between the COVID-19 group and the reference cohort and between the nursing home and hospital COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: About 1316 expected deaths were identified in nursing homes and 685 in hospitals. Four of the five items differed for total COVID-19 group compared with the reference cohort: fewer were examined by a physician during the last days before death, pain and oral health were less likely to be assessed, and fewer had a specialized palliative care team consultation (P < 0.0001, respectively). Assessment of symptoms other than pain did not differ significantly. The five items differed between the nursing homes and hospitals in the COVID-19 group, most notably regarding the proportion of persons examined by a physician during the last days (nursing homes: 18%; hospitals: 100%). CONCLUSION: This national register study shows that several clinical routines for end-of-life care did not meet the usual standards during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. Higher preparedness for and monitoring of end-of-life care quality should be integrated into future pandemic plans.","Martinsson, Lisa; Strang, Peter; Bergström, Jonas; Lundström, Staffan",J Pain Symptom Manage,,611

Objective: To assess outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged via the expected practice approach to home or quarantine housing with supplemental home oxygen. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 621 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were discharged from 2 large urban public hospitals caring primarily for patients receiving Medicaid from March 20 to August 19, 2020. Patients were included in the analysis cohort if they received emergency or inpatient care for COVID-19 and were discharged with home oxygen. Interventions: Patients receiving at least 3 L per minute of oxygen, stable without other indication for inpatient care, were discharged from either emergency or inpatient encounters with home oxygen equipment, educational resources, and nursing telephone follow-up within 12 to 18 hours of discharge. Nurses provided continued telephone follow up as indicated, always with physician back-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality and all-cause 30-day return admission. Results: A total of 621 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (404 male [65.1%] and 217 female [34.9%]) were discharged with home oxygen. Median age of these patients was 51 years (interquartile range, 45-61 years), with 149 (24.0%) discharged from the emergency department and 472 (76%) discharged from inpatient encounters. The all-cause mortality rate was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.5%) and the 30-day return hospital admission rate was 8.5% (95% CI, 6.2%-10.7%) with a median follow-up time of 26 days (interquartile range, 15-55 days). No deaths occurred in the ambulatory setting. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged on home oxygen had low rates of mortality and return admission within 30 days of discharge. Ambulatory management of COVID-19 with home oxygen has an acceptable safety profile, and the expected practice approach may help optimize outcomes, by ensuring right care in the right place at the right time and preserving access to acute care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Banerjee, Josh; Canamar, Catherine P; Voyageur, Christian; Tangpraphaphorn, Soodtida; Lemus, Anabel; Coffey, Charles; Wald-Dickler, Noah; Holtom, Paul; Shoenberger, Jan; Bowdish, Michael; Yee, Hal F; Spellberg, Brad",JAMA Netw Open,,611

The objective of this study was to assess the arrhythmogenic risk of these two drugs using a multiscale heart simulation, which allows testing even at high concentrations, including those that cause fatal arrhythmias. We measured the inhibitory action of CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with 30 µM azithromycin (AZ) on six ion currents (fast [INa] and late [INa,L] components of the sodium current, L-type calcium current [ICa,L], rapid [IKr/hERG], and slow [IKs] components of delayed rectifier potassium, and inward rectifier potassium [IK1]) over a wide range of concentrations using the automated patch-clamp system. Using the concentration-inhibition relationship that was thus obtained, we simulated the drug effects while increasing the concentration until the life-threatening arrhythmia, torsade de pointes (TdP), was observed. The obtained threshold concentrations for TdP were 12.5, 35, and 22.5 µM for CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with AZ, respectively. Adding therapeutic concentrations of mexiletine or verapamil successfully prevented the occurrence of TdP, and verapamil was more effective. CQ, HCQ, and HCQ with AZ thresholds for TdP were larger than both antiviral concentrations that were reported by in vitro experiments and free plasma concentrations that were attained by the clinically used dosage. The current simulation data provided a safety margin to the currently used clinical dose for CQ and HCQ/AZ.","Okada, Jun-Ichi; Yoshinaga, Takashi; Washio, Takumi; Sawada, Kohei; Sugiura, Seiryo; Hisada, Toshiaki",Clinical and translational science (Online),,611

National governments issued reopening guidance at varying speeds. The purpose of this study was to invite health and education professionals to share what was happening in their country about school reopening in terms of the features and implications of the guidance issued. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study. Initial interviews informed a semi-structured questionnaire distributed through the global community of UNESCO Chair 'Global Health and Education' and partner organisations. Its aim was to collect, analyse and share globally relevant knowledge and practices about school reopening. Findings There were 192 useable responses from 43 countries and territories and 1 multi-country region. 20 of these, mainly in the Global North, had received reopening guidance, 23 were still waiting and 1 had not closed its schools. Guidance prioritised public health measures like social distancing, with less emphasis on education impacts. Success came from partnerships between schools, families and local authorities, consistent guidance and enough time and resources for implementation. Fear of infection led to significant absenteeism among students and staff. Respondents waiting for guidance, mainly in the Global South, shared similar concerns and expectations.

Similar to the ubiquitous adiabatic approximation of time-dependent density-functional theory, the static approximation, which substitutes a dynamical (i.e., frequency-dependent) kernel by its static limit, is usually enforced in most implementations of the BSE formalism. Here, going beyond the static approximation, we compute the dynamical correction of the electron-hole screening for molecular excitation energies, thanks to a renormalized first-order perturbative correction to the static BSE excitation energies. The present dynamical correction goes beyond the plasmon-pole approximation as the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction is computed exactly within the random-phase approximation. Our calculations are benchmarked against high-level (coupled-cluster) calculations, allowing one to assess the clear improvement brought by the dynamical correction for both singlet and triplet optical transitions.","Loos, Pierre-François; Blase, Xavier",J Chem Phys,,611

Using data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey, this paper investigates the roles of ethnicity and the sex composition of living children on unrealized fertility in Nigeria. The results show that the odds of having unrealized fertility were higher among Hausa-Fulani women compared with women of other ethnic groups in Nigeria. Also, having daughters only (no sons) was associated with higher odds of unrealized fertility, after controlling for other important covariates. The findings suggest that cultural norms and pronatalism significantly influence the fertility desires of women in Nigeria, even at the end of their reproductive lifespan.","Fayehun, Olufunke; Sanuade, Olutobi Adekunle; Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Isiugo-Abanihe, Uche",Popul Stud (Camb),,611

However, it generally takes several hours for these surfaces to inactivate most of the bacteria, which greatly limits their application in the fields favoring rapid bactericidal performance. Besides, the accumulated bacteria debris left on these surfaces is rarely discussed in the previous reports. Herein we report the nanotip-engineered ZnO nanoarrays (NAs) with ultrafast physical bactericidal rate and the ability to photocatalytically remove the bacteria debris. Neither chemical (Zn2+ or reactive oxygen species) nor photocatalytic effect leads to the ultrafast bactericidal rate, where 97.5% of E. coli and 94.9% of S. aureus are inactivated within only 1 min. The simulation analysis further supported our proposed mechanism attributing the ultrafast bactericidal activity to the great stress enabled by the uneven topography. Moreover, the re-exposure of the ZnO NAs nanotips can be achieved in only 10 min under a mild UV light source. This study not only presents an ultrafast physical bactericidal activity, but also demonstrates the potential of the recyclable and photocatalytic self-cleaning functions of theses surfaces for applications that desire rapid and sustainable bactericidal performance.","Xie, Yuan; Qu, Xi; Li, Jinyang; Li, Da; Wei, Wei; Hui, David; Zhang, Qiao; Meng, Fanbin; Yin, Hong; Xu, Xiaoling; Wang, Yong; Wang, Li; Zhou, Zuowan",Sci Total Environ,,611

400452,"Knowledge, attitude and preventive practices related to COVID-19: a cross-sectional study in two Pakistani university populations",2020,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the transmission of influenza in the context of primary care practices, despite the fact that a significant proportion of the population consult their primary care physician for an influenza-like illness every year. AIM: To describe the use of influenza prevention and control methods in private practices of the Swiss sentinel network. METHODS: This online cross-sectional survey collected data about infection prevention and control measures in the 166 private practices of the Swiss sentinel surveillance network during the 2018-2019 influenza season. Questions pertained to the practice setting, infection prevention and control recommendations, influenza vaccination status of the physicians and their staff, adhesion to hand hygiene, and mask wearing. FINDINGS: Among the 122 practices that answered (response rate 73.5%), 90.2% of the responding physicians had been vaccinated themselves, and 46.7% (56/120) estimated that their staff vaccination coverage was >60%, although it was offered to employees in all practices. Most practices (N=68, 55.7%) had no specific recommendations for their staff concerning mask wearing. Most physicians reported washing or disinfecting their hands before examining a patient (N=91, 74.6%), after examination (N=110, 90.2%) and before a medical procedure (N=112, 91.8%). However, this rate was lower for arrival at the practice (N=78, 63.9%) and leaving the practice (N=83, 68.0%). CONCLUSION: Most physicians in the Swiss sentinel surveillance network have been vaccinated themselves. However, the vaccination rates among their staff are low, despite vaccine availability. Hand hygiene measures were also suboptimal. These results warrant further efforts to implement infection prevention and control measures in the ambulatory setting.","Peytremann, A; Senn, N; Mueller, Y",J Hosp Infect,,611

401164,Masks in COVID-19 pandemic: Are we doing it right?,2020,"Importance: Approximately 5% to 15% of patients with COVID-19 require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and, at times, tracheostomy. Details regarding the safety and use of tracheostomy in treating COVID-19 continue to evolve. Objective: To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources: EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Results: Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.","Staibano, Phillip; Levin, Marc; McHugh, Tobial; Gupta, Michael; Sommer, Doron D",JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,611

Satellite-based (Sentinel-2) water quality analysis before and during lockdown was performed for seven selected locations spread across the entire stretch of the Ganges (Rishikesh-Dimond Harbour). Results revealed that due to the lockdown, the water quality of the Ganges improved with reference to specific water quality parameters, but the improvements were region specific. Along the entire stretch of Ganges, only the Haridwar site showed improvement to an extent of being potable as per the threshold set by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi, India. A 55% decline in turbidity at that site during the lockdown was attributed to the abrupt halt in pilgrimage activities. Absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter which is an indicator of organic pollution declined all along the Ganges stretch with a maximum decline at the downstream location of Diamond Harbour. Restricted discharge of industrial effluent, urban pollution, sewage from hotels, lodges, and spiritual dwellings along the Ganges are some of the reasons behind such declines. No significant change in the geographic trend of chlorophyll-a was observed. The findings of this study highlight the importance of regular monitoring of the changes in the Ganges water quality using Sentinel-2 data to further isolate the anthropogenic impact, as India continues the phase-wise opening amidst the pandemic.","Muduli, P R; Kumar, A; Kanuri, V V; Mishra, D R; Acharya, P; Saha, R; Biswas, M K; Vidyarthi, A K; Sudhakar, A",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),,611

Speculatively, we suggest that many children and adolescents who did not have social phobia before the pandemic may begin to experience worries about social situations as schools reopen. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a range of mental health symptoms including social phobia are likely to become more obvious as many pupils return to school.","Loades, Maria Elizabeth; Reynolds, Shirley",J.

407855,Family medicine residents' skill levels in emergency chest X-ray interpretation,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Prior studies of universal masking have not measured face-mask compliance. We performed a quality improvement study to monitor and improve face-mask compliance among healthcare personnel (HCP) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in West Haven, Connecticut. PATIENTS: HCP including physicians, nurses, and ancillary staff. METHODS: Face-mask compliance was measured through direct observations during a 4-week baseline period after universal masking was mandated. Frontline and management HCP completed semistructured interviews from which a multimodal intervention was developed. Direct observations were repeated during a 14-week period following implementation of the multimodal intervention. Differences between units were evaluated with &#967;2 testing using the Bonferroni correction. Face-mask compliance between baseline and intervention periods was compared using time-series regression. RESULTS: Among 1,561 observations during the baseline period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 82.2% (range, 80.8%-84.4%). Semistructured interviews were performed with 16 HCP. Qualitative analysis informed the development of a multimodal intervention consisting of audit and passive feedback, active discussion, and increased communication from leadership. Among 2,651 observations during the intervention period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 92.6% (range, 84.6%-97.9%). There was no difference in weekly face-mask compliance between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. The multimodal intervention was associated with an increase in face-mask compliance (ß = 0.023; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Face-mask compliance remained suboptimal among HCP despite a facility-wide mandate for universal masking. A multimodal intervention consisting of audit and passive feedback, active discussion, and increased communication from leadership was effective in increasing face-mask compliance among HCP.","Datta, Rupak; Glenn, Keith; Pellegrino, Anthony; Tuan, Jessica; Linde, Brian; Kayani, Jehanzeb; Patel, Kavin; Calo, Lisbeysi; Dembry, Louise Marie; Fisher, Ann",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,611

410264,Parental Acceptability of COVID-19 Vaccination for Children Under the Age of 18 Years: Cross-Sectional Online Survey,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic expanded its geographic distribution through the movement of humans and caused subsequent local outbreaks. Hence, it is essential to investigate how human mobility and travel ban affect the transmission and spatial spread while minimizing the impact on social activities and national economics. METHODS: We developed a mobility network model for spatial epidemics, explicitly taking into account time-varying inter-province and inner-province population flows, spatial heterogeneity in terms of disease transmission, as well as the impact of media reports. The model is applied to study the epidemic of the dynamic network of 30 provinces of mainland China. The model was calibrated using the publicly available incidence and movement data. RESULTS: We estimated that the second outbreak occurred approximately on February 24, 2020, and the cumulative number of cases as of March 15, 2020, increased by 290.1% (95% CI: (255.3%, 324.9%)) without a travel ban in mainland China (excluding Hubei and Tibet). We found that intra-province travel contributes more to the increase of cumulative number of cases than inter-province travel. CONCLUSION: Our quantitative and qualitative research results suggest that the strict travel ban has successfully prevented a severe secondary outbreak in mainland China, which provides solutions for many countries and regions experiencing secondary outbreaks of COVID-19.","Xue, Ling; Jing, Shuanglin; Sun, Wei; Liu, Maoxing; Peng, Zhihang; Zhu, Huaiping",Int J Infect Dis,,611

We assessed IL-6 in a cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with different degrees of disease severity, and compared it with clinical and laboratory findings. We found higher levels of IL-6 in patients with more severe pneumonia according to CURB-65 scale (p = 0.001), with ICU mechanical ventilation requirements (p = 0.02), and who subsequently died (p = 0.003). Of the clinical and analytical parameters analyzed in the current study, the serum levels of IL-6 was the most effective predictor of disease severity. From the data obtained in ROC curve analysis, we defined a cut-off point for serum IL-6 levels of 35 pg/mL above which both the risk of mortality (OR = 20.00, 95 % CI 4.214-94-912, p = 0.0001) and ICU admission (OR = 12.750, 95 % CI 2,159-75,3,3, p = 0.005) were increased. Starting from blood IL-6 levels 27 out of 50 patients, with high levels and more severe symptoms, were treated with the IL-6 receptor antagonist Tocilizumab. IL-6 serum levels appear to be a useful prognostic biomarker in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A cut-off point of 35 pg/mL could clearly differentiate patients a with more severe disease.","Guirao, Jose J; Cabrera, Carmen M; Jiménez, Natalia; Rincón, Laura; Urra, José M",Mol Immunol,,611

We describe SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and associated symptoms and review shelter infection prevention and control (IPC) policies. METHODS: PEH and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during April 7-May 6, 2020. A subset of PEH and staff was screened for symptoms. Shelter assessments were conducted concurrently at a convenience sample of shelters using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 2,875 individuals at 24 shelters and nine unsheltered outreach events underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and 2,860 (99.5%) had conclusive test results. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 2.1% (36/1,684) among PEH living sheltered, 0.5% (3/628) among PEH living unsheltered, and 1.3% (7/548) among staff. Reporting fever, cough, or shortness of breath in the last week during symptom screening was 14% sensitive and 89% specific for identifying COVID-19 cases compared with RT-PCR. Prevalence by shelter ranged 0%-27.6%. Repeat testing 3-4 weeks later at four shelters documented decreased SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (0%-3.9%). Nine of 24 shelters completed shelter assessments and implemented IPC measures as part of the COVID-19 response. CONCLUSIONS: PEH living in shelters experienced higher SARS-CoV-2 prevalence compared with PEH living unsheltered. Facility-wide testing in congregate settings allowed for identification and isolation of COVID-19 cases and is an important strategy to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Yoon, Jane C; Montgomery, Martha P; Buff, Ann M; Boyd, Andrew T; Jamison, Calla; Hernandez, Alfonso; Schmit, Kristine; Shah, Sarita; Ajoku, Sophia; Holland, David P; Prieto, Juliana; Smith, Sasha; Swancutt, Mark A; Turner, Kim; Andrews, Tom; Flowers, Kevin; Wells, Alyssa; Marchman, Cathryn; Laney, Emaline; Bixler, Danae; Cavanaugh, Sean; Flowers, Nicole; Gaffga, Nicholas; Ko, Jean Y; Paulin, Heather N; Weng, Mark K; Mosites, Emily; Morris, Sapna Bamrah",Clin. infect. dis,,611

It has affected humans on every continent. Clinically, it has affected every organ system. The outcome has also been variable, with most of the older patients showing grave outcomes as compared with the younger individuals. Here we present a rare and severe variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome that complicated the disease in recovery phase.

415389,Levels and predictors of fear and health anxiety during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in immunocompromised and chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional correlational study,2021,"With the increasing need to minimize in-person contact as a way to stem the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the world, many clinicians are now providing mental health care exclusively through telepsychotherapy. Mental health mobile applications (MH apps) offer clients complementary therapeutic resources available outside of the telepsychotherapy session and have the potential to enhance the quality of care. However, not all mental health apps are created equal and clinicians lack guidance on how best to evaluate MH apps. This article discusses several ethical and practical considerations involved in using MH apps as an adjunct to telepsychotherapy, proposes recommendations for app evaluation, and provides a summary table of 28 popular English-language MH apps to assist clinicians in evaluating the manyMHapps available on the market today. The authors conducted a review of recent literature in EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) and included 10 peer reviewed, English language meta-analyses and systematic reviews on the efficacy of MH apps. The emerging literature suggests that the MH apps that have been studied in randomized control trials provide some benefit for targeted problems (e.g., depression) over waitlist control groups and under some circumstances are comparable to active intervention groups, although effect sizes tend to be small. However, of the 28 popular MH apps featured in this article, only 5 were found to have empirical support. Of note, few empirical studies reference any harmful effects, although risks have been posited.","Wang, Liying; Fagan, Corey; Yu, Chia-li",J. Psychother. Integr.,,611

419208,"Dietary knowledge, attitude and practice among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Sudan: a hospital-based cross-sectional study",2021,"Unlike initially predicted by WHO, the severity of the novel coronavirus pandemic has remained relatively low in Sub-Saharan Africa, more than two months after the first confirmed cases were identified. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which demographic and geographic factors associated to the disease explain this phenomenon. We use publicly available data from a cross-section of 182 countries worldwide, and we employ a regression analysis that accounts for possible misreporting of COVID-19 cases, as well as a Ramsey-type specification that preserves degree of freedom. We found that proportion of population aged 65+, population density, and urbanization are significantly positively associated with high numbers of active infected cases, while mean temperature around the first quarter (January-March) is negatively associated to this COVID-19 outcome. These factors are those for which Africa has a comparative advantage. In contrast, factors for which Africa has a relative disadvantage, such as income and quality of health care infrastructure, are found to be insignificant predictors of the spread of the pandemic. These results hold even when accounting for possible underreporting, as well as differences in the duration of the epidemic in each country, as measured by the time elapsed since the first confirmed case occurred. We conclude that differences in demographic and geographic characteristics help understand the relatively low progression of the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa as well as the gap in the number of active cases between this region and the rest of the World. We also found, however, that this gap is insignificant beyond these factors, and is expected to narrow over time as the pandemic evolves. These results provide insights for relevant urban policies and kinds of development planning to consider in the fight against disease spreads of the coronavirus type.","Nguimkeu, Pierre; Tadadjeu, Sosson",World Dev,,611

419775,The Effect of Stress Perceived by Adults Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Their Sleep Quality,2021,"The widespread coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global health emergency. As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, the Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly analyzed the energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the high structural similarity, the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor is estimated to be -16.35 kcal mol-1 stronger than that of SARS-CoV. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (F486, Y505, N501, Y489, Q493, L455, etc.), which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces arise from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found seven mutational sites (K417, L455, A475, G476, E484, Q498 and V503) on SARS-CoV-2 that unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Interestingly, the E484 site is recognized to be the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface, indicating that from the energy point of view, a mutation of E484 would be beneficial to RBD-ACE2 binding. This is in line with recent findings that it is mutated by lysine (E484K mutation) in the rapidly spreading variants of COVID-19 belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. In addition, this mutation is reported to cause virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Thus, further efforts are required to probe its functional relevance. Overall, our results present a systematic understanding of the energetic binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the ACE2 receptor, which can provide a valuable insight for the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active antibodies.","Yang, Yanmei; Zhang, Yunju; Qu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Chao; Liu, Xue-Wei; Zhao, Mingwen; Mu, Yuguang; Li, Weifeng",Nanoscale,,611

422257,Challenges of pregnancy during the covid19 pandemic and lockdown - A cross-sectional study,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 cases resurged worldwide in the second half of 2020. Not much is known about the changes in public responses to containment measures from the initial outbreak to resurgence. Monitoring public responses is crucial to inform policy measures to prepare for COVID-19 resurgence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess and compare public responses to containment measures during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: We curated all COVID-19-related posts from Sina Weibo (China's version of Twitter) during the initial outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 in Beijing, China. With a Python script, we constructed subsets of Weibo posts focusing on 3 containment measures: lockdown, the test-trace-isolate strategy, and suspension of gatherings. The Baidu open-source sentiment analysis model and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, a widely used machine learning algorithm, were used to assess public engagement, sentiments, and frequently discussed topics on each containment measure. RESULTS: A total of 8,985,221 Weibo posts were curated. In China, the containment measures evolved from a complete lockdown for the general population during the initial outbreak to a more targeted response strategy for high-risk populations during COVID-19 resurgence. Between the initial outbreak and resurgence, the average daily proportion of Weibo posts with negative sentiments decreased from 57% to 47% for the lockdown, 56% to 51% for the test-trace-isolate strategy, and 55% to 48% for the suspension of gatherings. Among the top 3 frequently discussed topics on lockdown measures, discussions on containment measures accounted for approximately 32% in both periods, but those on the second-most frequently discussed topic shifted from the expression of negative emotions (11%) to its impacts on daily life or work (26%). The public expressed a high level of panic (21%) during the initial outbreak but almost no panic (1%) during resurgence. The more targeted test-trace-isolate measure received the most support (60%) among all 3 containment measures in the initial outbreak, and its support rate approached 90% during resurgence. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the initial outbreak, the public expressed less engagement and less negative sentiments on containment measures and were more supportive toward containment measures during resurgence. Targeted test-trace-isolate strategies were more acceptable to the public. Our results indicate that when COVID-19 resurges, more targeted test-trace-isolate strategies for high-risk populations should be promoted to balance pandemic control and its impact on daily life and the economy.","Zhou, Xinyu; Song, Yi; Jiang, Hao; Wang, Qian; Qu, Zhiqiang; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Jit, Mark; Hou, Zhiyuan; Lin, Leesa",J Med Internet Res,,611

423280,Sharp Increase in Prevalence of Current Mental Disorders in the Context of COVID-19: Analysis of Repeated Nationwide Cross-Sectional Surveys,2020,"Since the reporting of the first cases of coronavirus in China and the publication of the first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, the virus has undergone numerous mutations. In Europe, the spring outbreak (March-April) was followed by a drop in the number of cases and deaths. The disease may have evolved into a milder form. The increase in PCR-positive cases in late summer 2020 did not lead to the expected increase in hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths, based on the severity of the disease in the spring. This difference in disease severity could be due to factors independent of the virus or to the evolution of the virus. This review attempts to identify the mutations that have appeared since the beginning of the pandemic and their role in the temporal evolution of the pandemic. There are a cell and humoral type cross-reactivity in a large part of the population to common cold coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2. Evolutionarily important mutations and deletions have emerged in the SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding proteins that interact with the host immune system. In addition, one of the major mutations (in viral polymerase) is logically associated with a higher frequency of mutations throughout the genome. This frequency fluctuates over time and shows a peak at the time when the epidemic was most active. The rate of mutations in proteins involved in the relationship to the immune system continues to increase after the first outbreak. The cross-reactivity on the 1 hand and the viral mutations observed on the other hand could explain the evolution of the pandemic until the summer of 2020, partly due to the evolution of the virus in relation to the host immune system. The immunization campaign began in December 2020: concerns are emerging about a possible escape of the circulating variants vaccines in early 2021. These variants could also escape immunity acquired through infection with the 2020 strains.","Banoun, Helene",Nephron,,611

429494,Drawing inference from nationwide lockdown as a response towards novel cornavirus-19 (COVID-19) epidemic in India,2020,"The number of COVID-19 infections is key for accurately monitoring the pandemics. However, due to differential testing policies, asymptomatic individuals and limited large-scale testing availability, it is challenging to detect all cases. Seroprevalence studies aim to address this gap by retrospectively assessing the number of infections, but they can be expensive and time-intensive, limiting their use to specific population subgroups. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that combines estimated (1) infection fatality rates (IFR) using a Bayesian melding SEIR model with (2) reported case-fatality rates (CFR) in order to indirectly estimate the fraction of people ever infected (from the total population) and detected (from the ever infected). We apply the technique to the U.S. due to their remarkable regional diversity and because they count with almost a quarter of all global confirmed cases and deaths. We obtain that the IFR varies from 1.25% (0.39-2.16%, 90% CI) in Florida, the most aged population, to 0.69% in Utah (0.21-1.30%, 90% CI), the youngest population. By September 8, 2020, we estimate that at least five states have already a fraction of people ever infected between 10% and 20% (New Jersey, New York, Massachussets, Connecticut, and District of Columbia). The state with the highest estimated fraction of people ever infected is New Jersey with 17.3% (10.0, 55.8, 90% CI). Moreover, our results indicate that with a probability of 90 percent the fraction of detected people among the ever infected since the beginning of the epidemic has been less than 50% in 15 out of the 20 states analyzed in this paper. Our approach can be a valuable tool that complements seroprevalence studies and indicates how efficient have testing policies been since the beginning of the outbreak.","Sánchez-Romero, Miguel; di Lego, Vanessa; Prskawetz, Alexia; L Queiroz, Bernardo",PLoS One,,611
429497,Knowledge and awareness on usage of mouth masks among dental fraternity during this pandemic COVID-19: A cross-sectional study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began, resulting in a number of antivirals and immune modulators being repurposed to treat the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many patients requiring treatment for COVID-19 may have either pre-existing renal or hepatic disease or experience acute renal/hepatic injury as a result of the acute infection. Altered renal or hepatic function can significantly affect drug concentrations of medications due to impaired drug metabolism and excretion, resulting in toxicity or reduced efficacy. The aim of this paper is to review the pharmacokinetics and available study data for the experimental COVID-19 therapies in patients with any degree of renal or hepatic impairment to make recommendations for dosing. METHODS: COVID-19 agents included in these recommendations were listed as primaries on the University of Liverpool COVID-19 drug interaction website ( www.covid19-druginteractions.org ), initially identified from Clinicialtrials.gov and ChicCTR.org.cn. A literature search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE as well as product licences and pharmacokinetic databases. FINDINGS: Remdesivir, dexamethasone, azithromycin, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta, ribavirin, tocilizumab, anakinra and sarilumab were identified as experimental drugs being used in COVID-19 trials as of November 2020. Limited study data was found for these drugs in patients with renal or hepatic impairment for COVID-19 or other indications. Recommendations were made based on available data, consideration of pharmacokinetic properties (including variability), the dosing and anticipated treatment duration of each regimen in COVID-19 and known toxicities. CONCLUSION: Dosing of drugs used to treat COVID-19 in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is complex. These recommendations were produced to provide guidance to clinicians worldwide who are treating patients with COVID-19, many of whom will have some degree of acute or chronic renal or hepatic impairment.","Marra, Fiona; Smolders, Elise J; El-Sherif, Omar; Boyle, Alison; Davidson, Katherine; Sommerville, Andrew J; Marzolini, Catia; Siccardi, Marco; Burger, David; Gibbons, Sara; Khoo, Saye; Back, David",Drugs R&amp;D (Online),,611

Analysis of the use of radiology resources may render us insight regarding the public health behavior during pandemic. We measured the influence COVID-19 had on the use of radiology resources in terms of the number of examinations performed, and turnaround time for portable radiography. METHODS: This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital located in area where the prevalence of COVID-19 infection was low (0.01%). We compared the number of radiology examinations 1) before pandemic (in 2019) vs. during peak of pandemic (January to March 2020), and 2) before pandemic vs. after the peak of pandemic (April to June 2020) via t-tests. We repeated similar analyses for subgroups as follows: gender, age, department (outpatient, inpatient, emergency, screening), body parts, and modality. We also performed a survey of radiologic technologists regarding the turnaround time and rate-limiting step of portable radiography for patients with and without suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19. RESULTS: Although not statistically significant, the daily number of examinations during the peak of pandemic decreased by 9 percentage points (2,638 vs. 2,413; difference [95% CI], -225 [-489, 38]; P = 0.094). The percentage change was especially notable for children, emergency, and screening department (25, 19, and 44 percentage points, respectively). After the peak of the pandemic, the number of examinations increased back to near the pre-pandemic level (2,638 vs. 2,588; -50 [-317, 218]; P = 0.71). The turnaround time for portable radiography tended to be longer for patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19, with donning personal protective equipment being the major rate-limiting step. CONCLUSION: The number of examinations decreased during the pandemic, reflecting the tendency of the public to refrain from seeking medical care even in a community of low infection risk. Nevertheless, burden of healthcare providers may not have decreased as much, considering longer turnaround time required for COVID-19 related examinations.","Cho, Jungheum; Lee, Seungjae; Gu, Bon Seung; Jung, Sang Hun; Kim, Hae Young",J Korean Med Sci,,611

When the usual means of resuscitation were no longer sufficient, the implementation of the Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO was needed. AIM: The whole problem of the management of these patients in this pandemic period has been to manage the operation of the ECMO machine, usually reserved for expert and specialized centers in the field. METHODS: The cardio-vascular surgery department of La Rabta teaching hospital of Tunis has tried the experience of management of ECMO implanted in the different reanimations of Tunis, remotely, using telemedicine and social networks. Thus, a Facebook-Messenger discussion group was created and enabled the management of patients under ECMO via video conferencing in real time involving all stakeholders. RESULTS: A call was made whenever the physician needed it. The video provided an opportunity to discuss with surgeons and perfusionists in real time the complications or problems of these patients. Their clinical status was continuously shared on the focus group. Following the instructions of the expert surgeons and the exchanges made on the group, the reanimator could then intervene on this or that parameter. CONCLUSION: Social media have invaded everyone's daily lives and health professionals are not exception to this trend. The Covid-19 pandemic has only strengthened this digital alternative with the goal of efficiency and patient interest. While their use in a professional setting offers many advantages, it must nevertheless be done in compliance with the rules of ethics and bring real added value.","Mleyhi, S; Ziadi, J; Ben Hmida, Y; Ghédira, F; Ben Mrad, M; Denguir, R",Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),,611

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection.

An alternative is pooled testing (or""group testing""), where samples are mixed together in different pools, and those pooled samples are tested. When the prevalence of the disease is low and the accuracy of the test is fairly high, pooled testing strategies can be more efficient than individual testing. In this chapter, we discuss the mathematics of pooled testing and its uses during pandemics, in particular the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyse some one- and two-stage pooling strategies under perfect and imperfect tests, and consider the practical issues in the application of such protocols.","Aldridge, Matthew; Ellis, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08845v2.pdf,611

442025,The direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of patients with pituitary disease: a cross sectional study,2020,"Les implants en silicone sont très bien tolérés mais peuvent être à l'origine de complications locales comme des granulomes ou à distance par migration ou embolisation de silicone provoquant des lymphadénopathies, pneumopathies, hypercalcémie liée au granulome. Les ruptures de prothèses mammaires sont quant à elles le plus souvent asymptomatiques ou se manifestent par des signes cliniques locaux. L'évolution chronique de ses complications en fait tout le challenge diagnostique et thérapeutique. En mai 2020, Mme B, originaire du Sénégal, 55 ans est hospitalisée pour un bilan de toux productive fébrile associée à une dyspnée au moindre effort n'ayant pas régressé après une semaine d'Amoxicilline à domicile. Son principal antécédent est une pose de prothèses mammaires en 2005. Elle ne prend aucun traitement au long cours. Cliniquement, elle a une SaO2 à 96 % en air ambiant, l'auscultation retrouve un foyer de crépitants secs en base droite et des sibilants expiratoires diffus, pas de signes d'insuffisance cardiaque, le reste de l'examen clinique est sans anomalie, il n'y a pas d'adénopathie palpable. Le bilan biologique montre un syndrome inflammatoire biologique modérée. La TDM thoracique met en évidence des condensations en bande et nodulaires, de topographie sous-pleurale à prédominance inférieure, compatible mais non caractéristiques d'une Covid-19, avec atteinte étendue. Sur le plan étiologique, 2 PCR COVID réalisées à 1 semaine d'intervalle, un ECBC, 3 BK crachats, une PCR multiplex grippes A et B, le VRS et le Métapneumovirus sont négatifs. La fibroscopie bronchique mal tolérée est non contributive. La sérologie VIH est négative. L'électrophorèse des protides retrouve une hypergammaglobulinémie polyclonale à 23 g/l. Un traitement probabiliste par ceftriaxone 1 g/j pendant 7 jours est réalisé. Alors que la symptomatologie de la patiente ne s'améliore pas, la TDM de contrôle à 1 mois retrouve toujours de multiples condensations intraparenchymateuses. S'y associe un syndrome interstitiel réticulo-micronodulaire à prédominance périlymphatique et des adénomégalies axillaires droites et médiastinohilaires évoquant en premier lieu un tableau de lymphangite. De façon concomittante, la patiente développe une arthrite du genou gauche. La ponction ramène un liquide inflammatoire sans argument pour une atteinte microcristalline. Le bilan immunologique retrouve des anti CCP à 357 UI/ml. Une seconde fibroscopie bronchique est réalisée sous anesthésie générale ainsi qu'une biopsie ganglionnaire axillaire droite. Le diagnostic sera porté sur l'examen anatomopathologique du ganglion : granulomatose associant de nombreux histiocytes et parfois des cellules géantes au sein desquels sont visibles des vacuoles optiquement vides en faveur d'une siliconose. Ce diagnostic est confirmé par une échographie mammaire qui confirme une rupture intra-capsulaire de la prothèse mammaire droite. Sur le plan thérapeutique, l'introduction d'une corticothérapie orale (0,5 mg/kg/j de prednisone) entraîne une amélioration rapide sur le plan clinique avec la disparition de la dyspnée, de la toux, et des atteintes articulaires. De façon concomittante, amélioration des images scannographiques et régression complète du syndrome inflammatoire biologique. Les prothèses mammaires sont aussi explantées. La corticothérapie est progressivement diminuée. L'association siliconose et PR est connue, mais il n'y a pas d'étude démontrant de façon significative l'association entre maladie auto-immune et exposition prolongée au silicone. Sur le plan physiopathologique, il semblerait cependant que la bioassimilation de silicone soit associée à une toxicité tissulaire par production d'espèces réactives de l'oxygène (ROS) et monoxyde d'azote (NO), de cytokines proinflammatoires. Par ailleurs, la clairance des particules de silice par les macrophages entraîne une activation de l'inflammasome, pérennisant la réaction inflammatoire et favorisant la production d'autoanti orps. À noter également, un déséquilibre des réponses Th1/Treg. Les données de la littérature suggèrent une évolution variable après le retrait des prothèses mammaires, soit vers la guérison dont les chances augmentent avec la précocité du geste, soit vers la chronicisation des symptômes liées à la migration du silicone. Le diagnostic de siliconose reste difficile car ses manifestations sont proteiformes. Elle n'en reste pas moins une pathologie très invalidante au pronostic réservé malgré un traitement adapté.

The full-length Spike protein is highly immunogenic but the majority of antibodies do not target the virus: ACE2 interface. In an effort to concentrate the antibody response to the receptor-binding motif (RBM) we generated a series of conformationally-constrained immunogens by inserting solvent-exposed RBM amino acid residues into hypervariable loops of an immunoglobulin molecule. Priming C57BL/6 mice with plasmid (p)DNA encoding these constructs yielded a rapid memory response to booster immunization with recombinant Spike protein. Immune sera antibodies bound strongly to the purified receptor-binding domain (RBD) and Spike proteins. pDNA primed for a consistent response with antibodies efficient at neutralizing authentic WA1 virus and two variants of concern (VOC), B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. These findings demonstrate that immunogens built on structure selection can focus the response to conserved sites of vulnerability shared between wildtype virus and VOCs and induce neutralizing antibodies across variants.","Almanza, Gonzalo; Kouznetsova, Valentina; Clark, Alex E; Olmedillas, Eduardo; Castro, Andrea; Tsigelny, Igor F; Wu, Yan; Gao, George F.; Saphire, Erica Ollmann; Carlin, Aaron F; Zanetti, Maurizio",,,611
444065,International Collaboration in the Time of COVID-19: The World Hospice and Palliative Care Social Work Network,2021,"Rapidly spreading outbreak of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing serious health concerns worldwide. It started as an epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province, central China, and has now become a pandemic, spreading over most of the continents of the planet. The major clinical symptoms of the infection are dry cough, fever, pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypoxia, and in certain cases, even death. Alveolar damage and respiratory system failure are observed in severe cases. Initial mild infection leads to activation of the immune system in the lungs and accumulation of various inflammatory cells and molecules. At a later phase during the infection, a “cytokine storm” causes an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), leading to an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, migration of a large number of immune cells to the site of infection, and ultimately pulmonary damage. The rapid and uncontrolled outbreak requires putative therapeutic drugs for treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19. Amongst the currently used antiviral drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir etc. we would like to present an update on another effective drug, pentoxifylline. Pentoxifylline has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-viral, and bronchodilatory properties. Pentoxifylline is known to reduce cytokine production, immune cell migration, and suppress certain signal transduction pathways (e.g. NF-κβ and STAT3). Thus, it minimizes inflammatory damage in the lung tissues.","Dhameliya, Hiren A.; Thakkar, Vasudev R.; Trivedi, Gauravi N.; Mesara, Sureshkumar N.; Subramanian, R. B.",J. Pure Appl. Microbiol.,,611
444342,Treating Insomnia during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observations and Perspectives from a Behavioral Sleep Medicine Clinic,2020,"Physicians' beliefs and attitudes about COVID-19 are important to ascertain because of their central role in providing care to patients during the pandemic. Identifying topics and sentiments discussed by physicians and other healthcare workers can lead to identification of gaps relating to theCOVID-19 pandemic response within the healthcare system. To better understand physicians' perspectives on the COVID-19 response, we extracted Twitter data from a specific user group that allows physicians to stay anonymous while expressing their perspectives about the COVID-19 pandemic. All tweets were in English. We measured most frequent bigrams and trigrams, compared sentiment analysis methods, and compared our findings to a larger Twitter dataset containing general COVID-19 related discourse. We found significant differences between the two datasets for specific topical phrases. No statistically significant difference was found in sentiments between the two datasets, and both trended slightly more positive than negative. Upon comparison to manual sentiment analysis, it was determined that these sentiment analysis methods should be improved to accurately capture sentiments of anonymous physician data. Anonymous physician social media data is a unique source of information that provides important insights into COVID-19 perspectives.","Sullivan, Katherine J; Burden, Marisha; Keniston, Angela; Banda, Juan M; Hunter, Lawrence E",Pac Symp Biocomput,,611
446796,Tools for Distributed Teamwork and Rapid Adaptation to Change: COVID-19 and Frontline Learning,2021,"Across eight studies, we tested whether people understand the time course of their own creativity. Prior literature finds that creativity tends to improve across an ideation session. Here we compared people's beliefs against their actual creative performance. Consistent with prior research, we found that people's creativity, on aggregate, remained constant or improved across an ideation session. However, people's beliefs did not match this reality. We consistently found that people expected their creativity to decline over time. We refer to this misprediction as the creative cliff illusion. Study 1 found initial evidence of this effect across an ideation task. We found further evidence in a sample with high domain-relevant knowledge (study 2), when creativity judgments were elicited retrospectively (study 3), and across a multiday study (study 5). We theorized the effect occurs because people mistakenly associate creativity (the novelty and usefulness of an idea) with idea production (the ability to generate an idea). Study 4 found evidence consistent with this mechanism. The creative cliff illusion was attenuated among those with high levels of everyday creative experience (study 6) and after a knowledge intervention that increased awareness of the effect (study 7). Demonstrating the impact of creativity beliefs on downstream performance, study 8 found that declining creativity beliefs negatively influenced task persistence and creative performance, suggesting that people underinvest in ideation. This research contributes to work on prediction in the creative domain and demonstrates the importance of understanding creativity beliefs for predicting creative performance.","Lucas, Brian J; Nordgren, Loran F",Proc.

Methods: This review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Search engines like PubMed and PMC through HINARI, Cochrane database, Google Scholar were used to get information about the current evidences on management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in intensive care unit (ICU). Discussion: Mortality with COVID 19 is associated with geriatric population, the presence comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and cancer, acute respiratory failure, higher d-dimer and C-reactive protein concentrations, lower lymphocyte counts, and secondary infections. Conclusion: The international recommendations on nutrition in the ICU should be followed. Some specific issues about the nutrition of the COVID-19 patients in the ICU should be emphasized.

Herein we used an integrated approach of LC-MS-and GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics to analyze plasma metabolic characteristics in men and women with non-severe COVID-19 at both acute period and 30 days after discharge. The results demonstrate that metabolic alterations in plasma of COVID-19 patients during the recovery and rehabilitation process were presented in a sex specific manner. Overall, the levels of most metabolites were increased in COVID-19 patients after the cure relative to acute period. The major plasma metabolic changes were identified including fatty acids in men and glycerophosphocholines and carbohydrates in women. In addition, we found that women had shorter length of hospitalization than men and metabolic characteristics may contribute to predict the duration from positive to negative in non-severe COVID-19 patients. Collectively, this study shed light on sex-specific metabolic shifts in non-severe COVID-19 patients during the recovery process, suggesting a sex bias in prognostic and therapeutic evaluations based on metabolic profiling.","Zheng, Hong; Jin, Shengwei; Li, Ting; Ying, Weiyang; Ying, Binyu; Chen, Dong; Ning, Jie; Zheng, Chanfan; Li, Yuping; Li, Chen; Chen, Chengshui; Li, Xiaokun; Gao, Hongchang",,,611

Primary diagnosis by whole-slide imaging (WSI) is a key component that would aid departments in providing uninterrupted histopathology diagnosis and maintaining revenue streams from disruption. We sought to perform rapid validation of the use of WSI in primary diagnosis meeting recommendations of the College of American Pathologists guidelines. METHODS: Glass slides from clinically reported cases from 5 participating pathologists with a preset washout period were digitally scanned and reviewed in settings identical to typical reporting. Cases were classified as concordant or with minor or major disagreement with the original diagnosis. Randomized subsampling was performed, and mean concordance rates were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 cases were included and distributed equally among participants. For the group as a whole, the mean concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 90) was 83.6% counting all discrepancies and 94.6% counting only major disagreements. The mean pathologist concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 18) ranged from 90.49% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel double-blinded method for rapid validation of WSI for primary diagnosis. Our findings highlight the occurrence of a range of diagnostic reproducibility when deploying digital methods.","Samuelson, Megan I; Chen, Stephanie J; Boukhar, Sarag A; Schnieders, Eric M; Walhof, Mackenzie L; Bellizzi, Andrew M; Robinson, Robert A; Rajan K D, Anand",Am J Clin Pathol,,611

458861,An Investigation of Mental Health Status Among Medical Staff Following COVID-19 Outbreaks: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"The study aims to identify 'missing' diagnoses amongst paediatric admissions during the UK's first national lockdown, compared with the previous 5 years. A retrospective observational cohort study of all children (0-15 years) attending for urgent care across Oxfordshire, during the first UK lockdown in 2020, compared to matched dates in 2015-2019, across two paediatric hospitals providing secondary care, including one with tertiary services. Our outcome measures were changes in numbers of patients attending and inpatient diagnoses (using ICD-10 classification) during the first 2020 lockdown, compared with the previous 5 years, were used. We found that total Emergency Department (ED) attendances (n = 4030) and hospital admissions (n = 1416) during the first UK lockdown were reduced by 56.8% and 59.4%, respectively, compared to 2015-2019 (5-year means n = 7446.8 and n = 2491.6, respectively). Proportions of patients admitted from ED and length of stay were similar across 2015-2020. ICD-10 diagnoses in lockdown of 2020 (n = 2843) versus matched 2015-2019 dates (n = 19,946) demonstrated significantly greater neoplasm diagnoses (p = 0.0123). Of diagnoses 'missing' in lockdown, 80% were categorised as infectious diseases or their sequelae and 20% were non-specific pains/aches/malaise and accidental injury/poisonings.Conclusions: Pandemic public health measures significantly altered paediatric presentations. Oxfordshire hospitals had a 58% reduction in ED attendances/inpatient admissions, with 'missing' diagnoses predominantly infection-related illnesses. These are likely driven by a combination of the following: (1) public health infection control measures successfully reducing disease transmission, (2) parents/carers keeping mild/self-limiting disease at home, and (3) pandemic-related healthcare anxieties. Prospective studies are needed to ensure referral pathways identify vulnerable children, those with social concerns, and avoid delayed presentation. What is Known: â¢ Significant reductions of paediatric ED attendances and inpatient admissions are reported globally, throughout national and regional lockdowns for COVID-19. â¢ Previous studies (supplemental table 5) examined only ED diagnoses or specific inpatient diagnoses during lockdown periods, demonstrating reductions of infectious diseases, accidents/injuries, and safeguarding referrals. What is New: â¢ Using ICD-10 coding, robustly controlling for five historical years and adopting a hypothesis-independent analysis, demonstrating 80% of 'missing' inpatient diagnoses during national COVID-19 lockdown were infectious diseases or its sequelae, the remainder being non-specific aches/pains/malaise and accidental injuries/poisonings. â¢ Greater numbers of neoplasms and other specific diagnoses were detected during lockdown, including greater documentation of co-morbidities and incidental findings.","Charlesworth, James E G; Bold, Rhian; Pal, Rani",Eur. j. pediatr,,611
460393,Learning from Covid-19: System Blindness to Primary Care,2021,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has prompted a worldwide pandemic and poses a great threat to public safety and global economies. Most present personal protective equipment (PPE) used to intercept pathogenic microorganisms is deficient in biocidal properties. Herein, we present green nanofibers with effective antibacterial and antiviral activities that can provide sustainable bioprotection by continuously producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). The superiority of the design is that the nanofibers can absorb and store visible light energy and maintain the activity under light or dark environment. Moreover, the nanofibers can uninterruptedly release ROS in the absence of an external hydrogen donor, acting as a biocide under all weather conditions. A facile spraying method is proposed to rapidly deploy the functional nanofibers to existing PPE, such as protective suits and masks. The modified PPE exhibit stable ROS production, excellent capacity for storing activity potential, long-term durability, and high bactericidal (>99.9%) and viricidal (>99.999%) efficacies.","Wu, Fan; He, Peiwen; Chang, Xinyi; Jiao, Wenling; Liu, Lifang; Si, Yang; Yu, Jianyong; Ding, Bin",Small,,611

463382,Anxiety and depression in spinocerebellar ataxia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A cross-sectional study,2021,"COVID-19 vaccination efforts are underway offering hope for saving lives and eliminating the pandemic. The most promising vaccines require two injections separated 3-4 weeks apart. To achieve heard immunity, 70-90% of the population or perhaps more must be inoculated. Anticipation of adherence challenges has generated commentaries on strategies to enhance adherence including financial incentives. A notable gap in these commentaries is any discussion of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of financial incentives for increasing vaccine adherence. This commentary addresses that gap. There is a body of controlled trials on incentivizing vaccine adherence, mostly to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine among injection drug users (IDUs). Prevalence of HBV infection is increasing as part of the opioid addiction crisis. The HBV vaccine entails a three-dose regimen (typically 0, 1, and 6 months) which has created adherence challenges among IDUs. Systematic literature reviews document significant benefit of financial incentives. For example, a 2019 meta-analysis (Tressler & Bhandari, 2019) examined 11 controlled trials examining HBV-vaccine adherence strategies, including financial incentives, accelerated dosing schedules, and case-management/enhanced services. Financial incentives were most effective resulting in a 7-fold increase in adherence to the vaccination regimen relative to no financial incentives (OR, 7.01; 95% CI, 2.88-17.06). Additional reviews provide further support for the efficacy of financial incentives for promoting adherence with vaccination (HBV & influenza). Overall, this literature suggests that financial incentives could be helpful in promoting the high levels of adherence to COVID-19 vaccines that experts project will be necessary for herd immunity.","Higgins, Stephen T; Klemperer, Elias M; Coleman, Sulamunn R M",Prev Med,,611

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: US Department of Veterans Affairs. PARTICIPANTS: 49 238 US veterans with a positive COVID-19 test between 20 March 2020 and 19 September 2020; and 9428 US veterans hospitalised with a positive COVID-19 test during the same period. OUTCOME MEASURES: 30-day mortality rate and hospitalisation rate. RESULTS: Between 20 March 2020 and 19 September 2020 and in COVID-19 positive individuals, 30-day mortality rate dropped by 9.2% from 13.6% to 4.4%; hospitalisation rate dropped by 16.8% from 33.8% to 17.0%. In hospitalised COVID-19 individuals, 30-day mortality rate dropped by 12.7% from 23.5% to 10.8%. Among COVID-19 positive individuals, decomposition analyses suggested that changes in demographic, health and contextual characteristics, COVID-19 testing capacity, and hospital occupancy rates accounted for 40.2% and 33.3% of the decline in 30-day mortality and hospitalisation, respectively. Changes in the underlying characteristics of hospitalised COVID-19 individuals accounted for 29.9% of the decline in 30-day mortality. CONCLUSION: Between March and September 2020, changes in demographic and health characteristics of people infected with COVID-19 contributed measurably to the substantial decline in 30-day mortality and hospitalisation.","Cai, Miao; Bowe, Benjamin; Xie, Yan; Al-Aly, Ziyad",BMJ Open,,611

This study assesses the accessibility and content available on child and adolescent fellowship websites. METHODS: Using the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) list of child and adolescent fellowship programs for 2020, 139 child and adolescent fellowship training websites were compiled. Information on websites was evaluated within the following three categories: program overview, application information and recruitment, and educational opportunities. A total of 22 criteria were evaluated within these three categories. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the websites. RESULTS: A list provided by ERAS and a Google search identified child and adolescent fellowship program websites. Analysis of content revealed most websites included an overview of the program (97.8%), but fewer included information such as the number of fellowship spots (51.5%), salary (45.5%), application deadline (41.0%), and call responsibility (19.4%). CONCLUSION: Results suggest there is room for improvement in the comprehensiveness and accessibility of child and adolescent fellowship websites. Especially during a time when much of the programmatic information will be obtained virtually due to COVID-19, it is critical that fellowship websites are uniformly curated so applicants can more easily find information about programs.","Bernstein, Simone A; Gu, Alex; Bernstein, Sophie L; Wei, Chapman; Vogel, Alecia C; Gold, Jessica A",Acad. psychiatry,,611
465088,Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222) is ideal for resource-constrained low- and middle-income countries,2021,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and anorexia, are frequently observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these GI symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain elusive. Previous studies indicate that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal cells leads to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors resulting in impaired barrier function. While intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, the B0AT1/ACE2 complex within the intestinal epithelium acts as a regulator of gut microbiota composition and function. Alternations to the B0AT1/ACE2 complex lead to microbial dysbiosis through increased local and systemic immune responses. Previous studies have also suggested that altered serotonin metabolism may be the underlying cause of GI disorders involving diarrhea. The findings of elevated plasma serotonin levels and high fecal calprotectin in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea indicate that the viral infection evokes a systemic inflammatory response that specifically involves the GI. Interestingly, the elevated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with elevated serotonin and fecal calprotectin levels further supporting the evidence of GI inflammation, a hallmark of functional GI disorders. Moreover, the finding that rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after the nasopharynx clears the virus, suggests that viral replication and shedding from the GI tract may be more robust than that of the respiratory tract, further indicating fecal-oral transmission as another important route of viral spread. This review summarized the evidence for pathophysiological mechanisms (impaired barrier function, gut inflammation, altered serotonin metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis) underlying the GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19.","Jin, Byungchang; Singh, Rajan; Ha, Se Eun; Zogg, Hannah; Park, Paul J; Ro, Seungil",World J Gastroenterol,,611
465302,The Time is NOW,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes have been detected in wastewater worldwide. However, the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in wastewater has been limited due to the stringent requirements of biosafety level 3. The main objective of this study is to investigate the applicability of capsid integrity RT-qPCR for the selective detection of intact SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Three capsid integrity reagents, namely ethidium monoazide (EMA, 0.1-100 µM), propidium monoazide (PMA, 0.1-100 µM), and cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (CDDP, 0.1-1000 µM), were tested for their effects on different forms (including free genomes, intact and heat-inactivated) of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which was used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. CDDP at a concentration of 100 µM was identified as the most efficient reagent for the selective detection of infectious MHV by RT-qPCR (CDDP-RT-qPCR). Next, two common virus concentration methods including ultrafiltration (UF) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation were investigated for their compatibility with capsid integrity RT-qPCR. The UF method was more suitable than the PEG method since it recovered intact MHV (mean ± SD, 38% ± 29%) in wastewater much better than the PEG method did (0.013% ± 0.015%). Finally, CDDP-RT-qPCR was compared with RT-qPCR alone for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 16 raw wastewater samples collected in the Greater Tokyo Area. Five samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 when evaluated by RT-qPCR alone. However, intact SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only three positive samples when determined by CDDP-RT-qPCR. Although CDDP-RT-qPCR was unable to determine the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, this method could improve the interpretation of positive results of SARS-CoV-2 obtained by RT-qPCR.","Canh, Vu Duc; Torii, Shotaro; Yasui, Midori; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Katayama, Hiroyuki",Sci Total Environ,,611

During the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping larger IPS than usual, along with wearing a face mask, is one of the most effective measures to slow down the COVID-19 outbreak. Here, we explore the contribution of actual and perceived risk of contagion and anxiety levels in regulating our preferred social distance from other people during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this study, 1293 individuals from six Italian regions with different levels of actual risk of infection participated in an online survey assessing their perceived risk to be infected, level of anxiety and IPS. Two tasks were adopted as measures of interpersonal distance: the Interpersonal Visual Analogue Scale and a questionnaire evaluating interpersonal distance with and without face mask. The results showed that the IPS regulation was affected by how people subjectively perceived COVID-19 risk and the related level of anxiety, not by actual objective risk. This clarifies that the role of threat in prompting avoidant behaviors expressed in increased IPS does not merely reflect environmental events but rather how they are subjectively experienced and represented.","Iachini, Tina; Frassinetti, Francesca; Ruotolo, Francesco; Sbordone, Filomena Leonela; Ferrara, Antonella; Arioli, Maria; Pazzaglia, Francesca; Bosco, Andrea; Candini, Michela; Lopez, Antonella; Caffò, Alessandro Oronzo; Cattaneo, Zaira; Fornara, Ferdinando; Ruggiero, Gennaro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,611

However, genetic differences have emerged among SARS-CoV-2 lineages, and it is possible that these differences may affect environmental stability and the potential for aerosol transmission. METHODS: The influence of temperature, relative humidity, and simulated sunlight on the decay of four SARS-CoV-2 isolates in aerosols, including one belonging to the recently emerged B.1.1.7 lineage, were compared in a rotating drum chamber. Aerosols were generated from simulated respiratory tract lining fluid to represent aerosols originating from the deep lung. RESULTS: No differences in the stability of the isolates were observed in the absence of simulated sunlight at either 20°C or 40°C. However, a small but statistically significant difference in the stability was observed between some isolates in simulated sunlight at 20°C and 20% relative humidity. . CONCLUSIONS: The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols does not vary greatly among currently circulating lineages, including B.1.1.7, suggesting that the increased transmissibility associated with recent SARS-CoV-2 lineages is not due to enhanced survival in the environment.","Schuit, Michael; Biryukov, Jennifer; Beck, Katie; Yolitz, Jason; Bohannon, Jordan; Weaver, Wade; Miller, David; Holland, Brian; Krause, Melissa; Freeburger, Denise; Williams, Gregory; Wood, Stewart; Graham, Amanda; Rosovitz, M J; Bazinet, Adam; Phillips, Aaron; Lovett, Sean; Garcia, Karla; Abbott, Elyse; Wahl, Victoria; Ratnesar-Shumate, Shanna; Dabisch, Paul",J. infect. dis,,611

Nevertheless, as of April 15, 2021, the only recommended treatment in current practice is the ""standard of care"", i.e. the symptomatic management of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This review presents the state of knowledge on COVID-19 in the acute phase (virological, immunological, epidemiological and therapeutic data) available on 15th April, 2021. OUTLOOK: A large number of clinical trials are currently ongoing. It is important to propose to patients the opportunity to participate in clinical trials and to structure the research in order to complete the studies. CONCLUSION: Current management is based on oxygen therapy, thromboprophylaxis and in some cases corticosteroids. No antiviral therapy is currently recommended. These data are constantly evolving.","Basille, D; Andrejak, C",Rev. mal. respir,,611

During this public health crisis, reliable forecasting of the disease becomes critical for resource allocation and administrative planning. The results from compartmental models such as SIR and SEIR are popularly referred by CDC and news media. With more and more COVID-19 data becoming available, we examine the following question: Can a direct data-driven approach without modeling the disease spreading dynamics outperform the well referred compartmental models and their variants? In this paper, we show the possibility. It is observed that as COVID-19 spreads at different speed and scale in different geographic regions, it is highly likely that similar progression patterns are shared among these regions within different time periods. This intuition lead us to develop a new neural forecasting model, called Attention Crossing Time Series (\textbf{ACTS}), that makes forecasts via comparing patterns across time series obtained from multiple regions. The attention mechanism originally developed for natural language processing can be leveraged and generalized to materialize this idea. Among 13 out of 18 testings including forecasting newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths, \textbf{ACTS} outperforms all the leading COVID-19 forecasters highlighted by CDC.","Jin, Xiaoyong; Wang, Yu-Xiang; Yan, Xifeng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13006v1.pdf,611

481130,The willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and affecting factors among healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study in Turkey,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We define prediction bias as the systematic error arising from an incorrect prediction of the number of positive COVID cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data on the same. Our objective is to investigate the importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. To that end, our goal is to document EGPB in the comprehension of disease data, study how it evolves as the epidemic progresses, and connect it with compliance of personal safety guidelines such as the use of face coverings and social distancing. We also investigate whether a behavioral nudge, cost less to implement, can significantly reduce EGPB. RATIONALE: The scientific basis for our inquiry is the received wisdom that infectious disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. If people suffer from EGPB, they will likely make incorrect judgments about their infection risk, which in turn, may lead to reduced compliance of safety protocols. METHOD: To collect data on prediction bias, we ran an incentivized, experiment on a global, online platform with participation from people in forty-three countries, each at different stages of progression of COVID-19. We also constructed several indices of compliance by surveying participants about their frequency of hand-washing and use of sanitizers and masks; their willingness to pay for masks; their view about the social appropriateness of others' behavior; and their like/dislike of government responses. The prediction data was used to construct several measures of EGPB. Our experimental design permits us to identify the root of under-prediction as EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate the speed at which exponential processes unfold. RESULTS: Respondents make predictions about the path of the disease using a model that is substantially less convex than the actual data generating process. This creates significant EGPB, which, in turn, is significantly and negatively associated with non-compliance with safety measures. The bias is significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression. A simple behavioral nudge that shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. CONCLUSION: Behavioral biases concerning the comprehension of disease data are quantitatively important, and act as severe impediments to effective policy action against the spread of COVID-19. Clear communication of future infection risk via raw numbers could increase the accuracy of risk perception, in turn, facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.","Banerjee, Ritwik; Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Majumdar, Priyama",Soc Sci Med,,611
481131,The willingness to accept the COVID-19 vaccine and affecting factors among healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study in Turkey,2021,"Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) is a recently identified virus which provides an unexpected connection between segmented and unsegmented RNA viruses. Recent investigations reveal that JMTV including JMTV-like virus (Alongshan virus) could be associated with human disease, suggesting the significance of JMTV in public health. To better understand the genetic diversity and host range of JMTV, a total of 164 rodents representing 8 species were collected in Qapqal Xibe county of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, and were screened for JMTVs using RT- PCR. Consequently, JMTV was identified in 42 rodents including 23 Microtus arvalis voles (24.5%), 9 Apodemus uralensis mice (29.0%), 5 Mus musculus mice, 1 Rhombomys opimus gerbil, 1 Meriones tamariscinus gerbil, 1 Meriones libycus gerbil, 1 Cricetulus migratorius hamster and 1 Microtus gregalis vole. Interestingly, nearly complete genome sequences were successfully recovered from 7 JMTV positive samples. Although the newly identified rodent JMTVs were closely related to those previously identified in ticks from China, based on the phylogenetic analysis of the S1, S2 and S3 segments, the newly identified rodent viruses clustered into two genetic groups. One group comprised of viruses only found in M. arvalis, while another group included viruses from A. uralensis, C. migratorius and M. gregalis. However, all rodent viruses clustered together in the S4 tree. Considering rodents live in close proximity to humans, more efforts are needed to investigate the role of rodents in the evolution and transmission of JMTV in nature.","Yu, Zhu-Mei; Chen, Jin-Tao; Qin, Jing; Guo, Jing-Jing; Li, Kun; Xu, Qi-Yi; Wang, Wen; Lu, Miao; Qin, Xin-Cheng; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",Infect Genet Evol,,611

The atrioventricular (AV) conduction axis is key for the passage of electrical signals to ventricles. We investigated whether environmental nanoparticles (NPs) reach the AV axis and whether they are associated with ultrastructural cell damage. Here, we demonstrate the detection of the shape, size, and composition of NPs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) in 10 subjects from Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) with a mean age of 25.3 ± 5.9 and a 71-year-old subject without cardiac pathology. We found that in every case, Fe, Ti, Al, Hg, Cu, Bi, and/or Si spherical or acicular NPs with a mean size of 36 ± 17 nm were present in the AV axis in situ, freely and as conglomerates, within the mitochondria, sarcomeres, lysosomes, lipofuscin, and/or intercalated disks and gap junctions of Purkinje and transitional cells, telocytes, macrophages, endothelium, and adjacent atrial and ventricular fibers. Erythrocytes were found to transfer NPs to the endothelium. Purkinje fibers with increased lysosomal activity and totally disordered myofilaments and fragmented Z-disks exhibited NP conglomerates in association with gap junctions and intercalated disks. AV conduction axis pathology caused by environmental NPs is a plausible and modifiable risk factor for understanding common arrhythmias and reentrant tachycardia. Anthropogenic, industrial, e-waste, and indoor NPs reach pacemaker regions, thereby increasing potential mechanisms that disrupt the electrical impulse pathways of the heart. The cardiotoxic, oxidative, and abnormal electric performance effects of NPs in pacemaker locations warrant extensive research. Cardiac arrhythmias associated with nanoparticle effects could be preventable.","Calderón-Garcidueñas, Lilian; González-Maciel, Angélica; Reynoso-Robles, Rafael; Rodríguez-López, José Luis; Silva-Pereyra, Hector G; Labrada-Delgado, Gladis J; Pérez-Guillé, Beatriz; Soriano-Rosales, Rosa Eugenia; Jiménez-Bravo Luna, Miguel Angel; Brito-Aguilar, Rafael; Mukherjee, Partha S; Gayosso-Chávez, Carlos; Delgado-Chávez, Ricardo",Environ Sci Technol,,611

However, evidence directly testing the link between infectious diseases and political ideology and partisanship is lacking. Across four studies, including a large sample representative of the U.S. population (N > 12,000), we demonstrate that higher environmental levels of human transmissible diseases and avoidance of germs from human carriers predict conservative ideological and partisan preferences. During the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 848), we replicated this germ aversion finding and determined that these conservative preferences were primarily driven by avoidance of germs from outgroups (foreigners) rather than ingroups (locals). Moreover, socially conservative individuals expressed lower concerns of being susceptible to contracting infectious diseases during the pandemic and worried less about COVID-19. These effects were robust to individual-level and state-level controls.

489647,Bloviating and Bungling the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Suicide among older adults is a multifactorial problem with several interrelated factors involved that vary with age, gender and culture. The number of suicides is highest in those aged 70 years or older in almost all regions of the world. With the increase in life expectancy, and the decrease in mortality due to other causes of death, we could expect the absolute number of older adults' suicide continue increasing. METHODS: Review of the literature on suicide protective factors of suicide among older adults. RESULTS: Improvements on social determinants of health and the timely detection and early treatment of affective disorders are key interventions. Prevention based on community actions and training of gatekeepers may have positive impact. Community programs that promote a sense of usefulness, belonging and that contribute to preserve social integration should be encouraged. Governments should develop the improvement of retirement programs and the development of support systems. The access to general health and mental health services should be facilitated and Primary Care professionals should receive proper training to detect and manage older persons at risk. Actively promoting a culture of coping to different stages of life and to the changes imposed by the advancing of age should form the essential part of a process bringing to better successful aging avenues. CONCLUSIONS: Suicide prevention in older adults should broaden its focus and pay attention to the many socio-environmental conditions that may be relevant in older age, especially social isolation, financial security and physical health.","de Mendonça Lima, Carlos Augusto; De Leo, Diego; Ivbijaro, Gabriel; Svab, Igor",Asia Pac Psychiatry,,611

Clarifying the mechanisms underlying such a ""post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome"" is essential for the development of preventive and early treatment methods for this syndrome. In the present paper, by integrating insights pertaining to the glymphatic system and the nasal cerebrospinal fluid outflow pathway with findings in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and COVID-19, I provide a coherent conceptual framework for understanding the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. According to this hypothesis, this syndrome may result from damage to olfactory sensory neurons, causing reduced outflow of cerebrospinal fluid through the cribriform plate, and further leading to congestion of the glymphatic system with subsequent toxic build-up within the central nervous system. I further postulate that patients with post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome may benefit from cerebrospinal fluid drainage by restoring glymphatic transport and waste removal from the brain. Obviously, further research is required to provide further evidence for the presence of this post-viral syndrome, and to provide additional insight regarding the relative contribution of the glymphatic-lymphatic system to it. Other mechanisms may also be involved. If confirmed, the glymphatic-lymphatic system could represent a target in combating post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome. Moreover, further research in this area could also provide new insights into the understanding of chronic fatigue syndrome.","Wostyn, Peter",Med Hypotheses,,611

The approaches span from exploiting techniques related to network analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the usage of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose DEAP-FAKED, a knowleDgE grAPh FAKe nEws Detection framework for identifying Fake News. Our approach is a combination of the NLP -- where we encode the news content, and the GNN technique -- where we encode the Knowledge Graph (KG). A variety of these encodings provides a complementary advantage to our detector. We evaluate our framework using two publicly available datasets containing articles from domains such as politics, business, technology, and healthcare. As part of dataset pre-processing, we also remove the bias, such as the source of the articles, which could impact the performance of the models. DEAP-FAKED obtains an F1-score of 88% and 78% for the two datasets, which is an improvement of 21%, and 3% respectively, which shows the effectiveness of the approach.","Mayank, Mohit; Sharma, Shakshi; Sharma, Rajesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10648v1.pdf,611
499874,Challenges and Strategies for Promoting Health Equity in Virtual Care: Protocol for a Scoping Review of Reviews,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) started its devastating trajectory into a global pandemic in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Ever since, several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. In the present review, we aimed to characterize the different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and explore the related morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A systematic review including the current evidence related to different variants of SARS-CoV-2 and the related morbidity and mortality was conducted through a systematic search utilizing the keywords in the online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct; we retrieved all related papers and reports published in English from December 2019 to September 2020. RESULTS: A review of identified articles has shown three main genomic variants, including type A, type B, and type C. we also identified three clades including S, V, and G. Studies have demonstrated that the C14408T and A23403G alterations in the Nsp12 and S proteins are the most prominent alterations in the world, leading to life-threatening mutations.The spike D614G amino acid change has become the most common variant since December 2019. From missense mutations found from Gujarat SARS-CoV-2 genomes, C28854T, deleterious mutation in the nucleocapsid (N) gene was significantly associated with patients' mortality. The other significant deleterious variant (G25563T) is found in patients located in Orf3a and has a potential role in viral pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Overall, researchers identified several SARS-CoV-2 variants changing clinical manifestations and increasing the transmissibility, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19. This should be considered in current practice and interventions to combat the pandemic and prevent related morbidity and mortality.","SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Mirzapour, Pegah; Dadras, Omid; Pashaei, Zahra; Karimi, Amirali; MohsseniPour, Mehrzad; Soleymanzadeh, Mahdi; Barzegary, Alireza; Afsahi, Amir Masoud; Vahedi, Farzin; Shamsabadi, Ahmadreza; Behnezhad, Farzane; Saeidi, Solmaz; Mehraeen, Esmaeil",Eur J Med Res,,611

501853,Nutrition knowledge and its relation with dietary behaviour in children and adolescents: a systematic review,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic brings to the forefront the complex interconnected dilemmas of globalization, health equity, economic security, environmental justice, and collective trauma, severely impacting the marginalized and people of color in the United States. This lack of access to and the quality of healthcare, affordable housing, and lack of financial resources also continue to have a more significant impact on documented and undocumented immigrants. This paper aims at examining these critical issues and developing a framework for family therapists to address these challenges by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: cultural values, social determinants of health, collective trauma, and the ethical and moral responsibility of family therapists. Given the fact that family therapists may unwittingly function as the best ally of an economic and political system that perpetuates institutionalized racism and class discrimination, we need to utilize a set of principles, values, and practices that are not just palliative or after the fact but bring forth into the psychotherapeutic and policy work a politics of care. Therefore, a strong call to promote and advocate for the broader continuum of health and critical thinking preparing professionals to meet the challenges of health equity, as well as economic and environmental justice, is needed. The issues discussed in this paper are specific to the United States despite their relevance to family therapy as a field. We are mindful not to generalize the United States' reality to the rest of the world, recognizing that issues discussed in this paper could potentially contribute to international discourse.","Watson, Marlene F; Bacigalupe, Gonzalo; Daneshpour, Manijeh; Han, Wen-Jui; Parra-Cardona, Rubén",Fam Process,,611
502224,"Decreases in Reported Sexually Transmitted Infections During the Time of COVID-19 in King County, WA: Decreased Transmission or Screening?",2021,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a global reminder of the need to attend to the mental health of patients and health professionals who are suddenly facing this public health crisis. In the last two decades, a number of medical pandemics have yielded insights on the mental health impact of these events. Based on these experiences and given the magnitude of the current pandemic, rates of mental health disorders are expected to increase. Mental health interventions are urgently needed to minimize the psychological sequelae and provide timely care to affected individuals. METHOD: We conducted a rapid systematic review of mental health interventions during a medical pandemic, using three electronic databases. Of the 2404 articles identified, 21 primary research studies are included in this review. RESULT: We categorized the findings from the research studies using the following questions: What kind of emotional reactions do medical pandemics trigger? Who is most at risk of experiencing mental health sequelae? What works to treat mental health sequelae (psychosocial interventions and implementation of existing or new training programs)? What do we need to consider when designing and implementing mental health interventions (cultural adaptations and mental health workforce)? What still needs to be known? CONCLUSION: Various mental health interventions have been developed for medical pandemics, and research on their effectiveness is growing. We offer recommendations for future research based on the evidence for providing mental health interventions and supports to those most in need.","Soklaridis, Sophie; Lin, Elizabeth; Lalani, Yasmin; Rodak, Terri; Sockalingam, Sanjeev",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,611

The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a low intensity psychological intervention for adults experiencing psychological distress. This paper outlines the study protocol for a trial that tests the effectiveness of an adapted version of PM+ to reduce distress associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial will be carried out for distressed people across Australia. via video conferencing on a small group basis. Following informed consent, adults that screen positive for levels of psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12 score &#8805; 3) and have access to videoconferencing platform will be randomised to an adapted version of gPM+ (n = 120) or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) (n = 120). The primary outcome will be reduction in psychological distress including anxiety and depression at 2-months post treatment. Secondary outcomes include worry, sleep problems, anhedonia, social support, and stress in relation to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: The trial aims assess whether an adapted version of videoconferencing PM+ that is specifically designed to target COVI-19 related distress will result in reduced distress relative to enhanced usual care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was prospectively registered on the ANZCTR on 14/4/20 ( ACTRN12620000468921 ).","Keyan, Dharani; Dawson, Katie; Azevado, Suzanna; Yadav, Srishti; Tran, Jenny; Bryant, Richard A",BMC Public Health,,611

Moreover, procedural differences in data acquisition and their processing to generate three-dimensional models are presented. Models built using a point cloud were created from data collected in the Afrasiyab museum in Samarkand (Uzbekistan) during “The 1st Scientific Expedition of the Lublin University of Technology to Central Asia” in 2017. Photos for creating 3D models in SfM technology were taken during a virtual expedition carried out under the “3D Digital Silk Road” program in 2021. The obtained results show that the quality of the 3D models generated with SfM differs from the models from the technology (3D SLS), but they may be placed in the galleries of the vitrual museum.

519762,Leveraging COVID-19 to sustain regulatory flexibility in the treatment of opioid use disorder,2020,"Current diagnostic testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is based on detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in nasopharyngeal swab samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, this test is associated with increased risks of viral dissemination and environmental contamination and shows relatively low sensitivity, attributable to technical deficiencies in the sampling method. Given that COVID-19 is transmitted via exhaled aerosols and droplets, and that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is an established modality for sampling exhaled aerosols, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in EBC offers a promising diagnostic approach. However, current knowledge on the detection and load of the virus in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients remains limited and inconsistent. The objective of the study was to quantify the viral load in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients and to validate the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection from EBC as a diagnostic test for the infection. EBC samples were collected from 48 COVID-19 patients using a collection device, and viral loads were quantified by RT-PCR targeting the E gene. Changes in detection rates and viral loads relative to patient characteristics and days since disease onset were statistically evaluated. Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with higher viral load (p< 0.05). Need for oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation, less than 3 d since onset, and presence of cough or fever were significantly associated with higher detection rates (p< 0.05). Among spontaneously breathing patients, viral load in EBC attenuated exponentially over time. The detection rate was 86% at 2 d since onset and deteriorated thereafter. In mechanically ventilated patients, detection rate and viral load were high regardless of days since onset. These results support the feasibility of using RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 from EBC for COVID-19 patients within 2 d of symptom onset.","Sawano, Makoto; Takeshita, Kyousuke; Ohno, Hideaki; Oka, Hideaki",Journal of breath research (Online),,611

Early ground glass opacities detected by CT, which are reminiscent of lung infarcts associated with pulmonary embolism, point to a novel vascular pathology in COVID-19. Under physiological conditions, normal parenchymal oxygenation is maintained by three sources: the alveolus itself and dual oxygen supply from the pulmonary and bronchial artery circulations. We propose a model in which these three components are disrupted in COVID-19 pneumonia, with severe viral alveolitis and concomitant immunothrombotic obstruction of the pulmonary and bronchiolar circulation. Tricompartmental disruption might have two main consequences: systemic clot embolisation from pulmonary vein territory immunothrombosis, and alveolar-capillary barrier disruption with systemic access of thrombogenic viral material.

Because of treatment advances introduced in the 1970s-1980s, >95% of preterm infants who receive modern neonatal and pediatric care now survive into adulthood. The earliest birth cohorts to benefit from those advances are now in their 4th and 5th decades of life. A growing number of large cohort studies have investigated the long-term health sequelae in adulthood. Evidence has consistently shown that adult survivors of preterm birth have increased risks of chronic disorders involving various organ systems, including cardiovascular, endocrine/metabolic, respiratory, renal, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders, which either persist from childhood into adulthood or sometimes first manifest in adulthood. These disorders also lead to moderately (30% to 50%) increased mortality risks during early to mid-adulthood among persons born preterm compared with full-term, and even higher risks among those born at the earliest gestational ages. However, the majority of persons born preterm have low absolute risks of these outcomes and good self-reported quality of life in adulthood. Priorities for future research include the assessment of long-term health sequelae of preterm birth in racially and economically diverse populations, additional follow-up of existing cohorts into older adulthood, elucidation of outcomes by preterm birth subtype (e.g., different underlying causes) to improve risk stratification, and identification of protective factors that will support the long-term health trajectory and well-being of preterm-born adults.","Crump, Casey",Early Hum Dev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2020.105187; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378378220306484?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948365/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378378220306484,611

Effective infection control measures and identifying areas of highest risk is required to reduce the risk of spread to patients who are admitted with other illnesses. This is the first pandemic where whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been readily available. We demonstrate how WGS can be deployed to help identify and control outbreaks. Aims & Methods Swabs performed on patients to detect SARS-CoV-2 underwent RT-PCR on one of multiple different platforms available at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Positive samples underwent WGS on the GridION platform using the ARTIC amplicon sequencing protocol at the University of Nottingham. Results Phylogenetic analysis from WGS and epidemiological data was used to identify an initial transmission that occurred in the admissions ward. It also showed high prevalence of asymptomatic staff infection with genetically identical viral sequences which may have contributed to the propagation of the outbreak. Actions were taken to help reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission by the introduction of rapid point of care testing in the admissions ward and introduction of portable HEPA14 filters. WGS was also used in two instances to exclude an outbreak by discerning that the phylotypes were not identical, saving time and resources. Conclusions In conjunction with accurate epidemiological data, timely WGS can identify high risk areas of nosocomial transmission, which would benefit from implementation of appropriate control measures. Conversely, WGS can disprove nosocomial transmission, validating existing control measures and maintaining clinical service, even where epidemiological data is suggestive of an outbreak.","Billam, H.; Francis, R.

597071,700 Young African American Adults Endorse Greater Distress from Racism than COVID though COVID may have Greater Impact on Sleep,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: Whereas several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been examined, the role of cognitive function following the widely publicised development of an inoculation is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To test the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within Understanding Society (Main Survey). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16–95. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. To summarise our results, we computed odds ratios with accompanying 95% confidence intervals for general cognitive function adjusted for selected covariates. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N=1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p<0.0001). LIMITATIONS: Our outcome was based on intention rather than behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability test scores being vaccine-hesitant. With people with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.","Batty, G.

Initial reports of COVID-19 concentrated on pulmonary issues, but with time, additional features such as hyposmia/anosmia, dysgeusia, and skin lesions were added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms. There have been an increasing number of reports on oral cavity lesions in individuals with COVID-19, which might be relevant considering that this location is one of the first sites coming into contact with the virus and that it contains the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We hereby aim to familiarize practicing head and neck clinicians with the range of oral lesions reported in COVID-19 patients and to critically appraise the most recent data on the role of SARS-CoV-2 in these lesions. We also discuss the ongoing debate on the direct/indirect association of oral symptoms with the disease. COVID-19 cases with simultaneous oral symptoms were extracted from the literature, and articles discussing the role of SARS-CoV-2 in oral lesions were compiled and methodically analyzed. We found approximately 95 COVID-19 patients with a wide range of oral lesions. Based on current evidence, the exact role of SARS-CoV-2 in the development of oral lesions remains unclear. Oral examination of patients is needed to provide adequate cases for analysis to clarify unknown problems related to COVID-19. There is evidence to support both the direct and indirect roles of SARS-CoV-2 in the development of oral lesions. Awareness of the possibility of oral manifestations in COVID-19 is important to clarify the range of disease signs and symptoms.","Etemad-Moghadam, Shahroo; Alaeddini, Mojgan",Int J Dent,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054961/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6648082,611

Questioning focussed on social isolation and desire to interact with others before and since COVID‐19; effects of safety measures including personal protective equipment and social distancing; and perceived influences of the pandemic on service users and social aspects of service delivery. All employees at an English NHS mental health service were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire (July–September 2020), resulting in 464 completed questionnaires. Response frequencies were summed across the total sample, and the influence of patient contact, age, and vulnerability to COVID‐19 were explored using pairwise comparisons. Approximately two thirds of employees felt there had been a fundamental change in how they felt about interacting with others, and many had lost confidence in their ability to relate emotionally to others. Respondents were keen to adhere to safety guidance, but the majority believed that face masks and social distancing could have a detrimental effect on communication and rapport within the workplace. Other concerns included passing on the virus, social isolation of employees and service users, and a reduction in community services. COVID‐19 safety measures may impact morale, communication, empathy, and the provision of client‐centred care. More generally, the pandemic has changed the attitudes of mental health workers towards social interaction, with younger employees reporting more mental health difficulties that may be linked to concerns about longer term social change.","Eddy, Clare M.",Int J Ment Health Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34021670/; https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12883,611

It is critical to intervene early to prevent chronic and debilitating trajectories. Existing prevention programs among adolescents are limited in effectiveness and implementation. This Australian-first study will examine the effectiveness and feasibility of a personality-targeted program called Preventure, in preventing the onset or escalation of alcohol use, internalising problems and externalising problems among young Australians, when delivered by school staff. A cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of effectiveness will be conducted from 2020 to 2022 with 12 schools in Sydney, Australia, with students aged 13 years at baseline. Schools will be randomly allocated to the Preventure intervention or a control condition who will receive their usual Health Education curriculum. Schools allocated to the intervention will deliver Preventure to students scoring one standard deviation above the population mean on one of four personality traits. Preventure consists of two 90-minute group sessions that incorporate cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing to promote coping skills. Students will be invited to complete surveys at baseline, 6- and 12-months following the intervention. Primary outcomes include student alcohol use, internalising problems, and externalising problems. Implementation fidelity, feasibility and acceptability will also be examined through surveys with school staff and students.

It was indispensable for generating coronavirus-specific ELISA antibody activities that the sample was applied to the mock-infected, normal CRFK cells in parallel with the CCV-infected cells and then the optical density values given by the mock-infected cell antigen were subtracted from those given by the virus-infected cell antigen. On the basis of ELISA antibody titers obtained in sera from the cats experimentally infected with CCV and from the spontaneous feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) cases, the ELISA described in the present study was found to be applicable as a simple and easy serologic test which was able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies as efficiently as the indirect immunofluorescence assay with homologous FIP virus.","Mochizuki, Masami; Furukawa, Hisashi","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2558837/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0147957189900623; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0147957189900623,611

The growing scarcity of health care services in rural settings limits STI prevention and treatment for rural Americans. Local health departments are the primary source for STI care in rural communities; however, these providers experience two main challenges, also known as a double disparity: (1) inadequate capacity and (2) poor health in rural populations. Moreover, in rural communities the interaction of rural status and key determinants of health increase STI disparities. These key determinants can include structural, behavioral, and interpersonal factors, one of which is stigma. Engaging the expertise and involvement of affected community members in decisions regarding the needs, barriers, and opportunities for better sexual health is an asset and offers a gateway to sustainable, successful, and non-stigmatizing STI prevention programs.","Valentine, Jo A.; Delgado, Lyana F.; Haderxhanaj, Laura T.; Hogben, Matthew",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34436713/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03416-4,611

METHODS: The review of the literature followed PRISMA guidelines. We included studies of hospitalized children aged 0-4 years with confirmed ALRI published between 1995 and 2011. A total of 51 studies were included in the final review, comprising 56 091 hospitalized ALRI episodes. RESULTS: IV was detected in 3.0% (2.2%-4.0%) of all hospitalized ALRI cases, PIV in 2.7% (1.9%-3.7%), and AV in 5.8% (3.4%-9.1%). CV are technically difficult to culture, and they were detected in 4.8% of all hospitalized ALRI patients in one study. When respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and less common viruses were included, at least one virus was detected in 50.4% (40.0%-60.7%) of all hospitalized severe ALRI episodes. Moreover, 21.9% (17.7%-26.4%) of these viral ALRI were mixed, including more than one viral pathogen. Among all severe ALRI with confirmed viral etiology, IV accounted for 7.0% (5.5%-8.7%), PIV for 5.8% (4.1%-7.7%), and AV for 8.8% (5.3%-13.0%). CV was found in 10.6% of virus-positive pneumonia patients in one study. CONCLUSIONS: This article provides the most comprehensive analysis of the contribution of four viral causes to severe ALRI to date.

We investigated the diversity and resistance of bacterial agents from respiratory, blood, and urine samples during the lockdown period (from week 12 to 35 of 2020), using the same period of years from 2017 to 2019 as control. Taking into account the drop in patient recruitment, several species have exhibited significant changes in their relative abundance (either increasing or decreasing) with changes up to 9%. The changes were more important for respiratory and urine samples than for blood samples. The relative abundance in respiratory samples for the whole studied period was higher during the lockdown. A significant increase in the percentage of wild phenotypes during the lockdown was observed for several species.

Despite appropriate management, the patient went on to develop left main coronary artery dilatation. Given the spectrum of clinical presentations and absence of pathognomonic findings or diagnostic tests for MIS-C, it is essential to maintain a high index of suspicion for MIS-C when pediatric patients first present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and recent exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Importantly, this case illustrates that the diagnosis of MIS-C can be missed in three different ways: 1) if the patient has an absence of classic symptoms such as rash, conjunctivitis, edema, or evidence of mucocutaneous involvement on initial presentation; 2) if the patient initially has leukocytosis, instead of leukopenia (which is more prevalent in MIS-C cases), and a normal platelet count early on in the disease course; and 3) if providers confuse MIS-C for other more common postoperative causes of fever, such as atelectasis. Finally, MIS-C should still be considered part of the differential even if abdominal computer tomography (CT) findings are unremarkable for systemic inflammation.

CL/P can be divided into syndromic CL/P (SCL/P) and nonsyndromic CL/P (NSCL/P). Genetic factors are an important component to the etiology of NSCL/P. ARHGAP29, one of the NSCL/P disease-causing genes, mediates the cyclical regulation of small GTP binding proteins such as RhoA and plays an essential role in cellular shape, proliferation, and craniofacial development. METHODS: The present study investigated a Chinese family with NSCL/P and explored potential pathogenic variants using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Variants were screened and filtered through bioinformatic analysis and prediction of variant pathogenicity. Cosegregation was subsequently conducted. RESULTS: We identified a novel heterozygous missense variant of ARHGAP29 (c.2615C > T, p.A872V) in a Chinese pedigree with NSCL/P. CONCLUSION: We detected the disease-causing variant in this NSCL/P family. Our identification expands the genetic spectrum of ARHGAP29 and contributes to novel approaches to the genetic diagnosis and counseling of CL/P families.","Tang, Jian-Xia; Xiao, Xiang-Shui; Wang, Kai; Jin, Jie-Yuan; Fan, Liang-Liang; Xiang, Rong",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8790531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150183/,611

605435,Mental health status of pregnant and breastfeeding women during the COVID‐19 pandemic—A multinational cross‐sectional study,2021-02-13,"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been international concern about the emergence of virus variants with mutations that increase transmissibility, enhance escape from the human immune response, or otherwise alter biologically important phenotypes. In late 2020, several ""variants of concern"" emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California ""variants of interest"" (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility capacity. For the South African variant, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Based on our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 virus specimens from COVID-19 patients dating from March 2020, we report identification of all important SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States to have all variants documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates worldwide, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence and frequency of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination. This information is critical for medical and public health efforts to effectively address and mitigate this global crisis.","Long, S. W.; Olsen, R. J.; Christensen, P.

Moreover, little is known about how demographic, social, economic, behavioral, and clinical determinants are jointly associated with these infectious diseases. SETTING: Contiguous US counties (N = 3108). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis and investigated the joint association between new HIV infection prevalence in 2018 and COVID-19 infections (January 22, 2020 and October 7, 2020) and explore the contribution of factors such as income inequality, binge drinking, and socioeconomic deprivation. We used Bayesian multivariate spatial models to estimate the cross-disease correlations between these diseases and identified hotspots, which we defined as a county with a posterior probability greater than 80% of being in the top decile of that disease. RESULTS: New HIV infection prevalence and COVID-19 infection moderately and significantly intersect [spatial correlation = 0.37, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.36–0.37]. Seventy-five counties, mostly in the south, were at elevated burden for HIV and COVID-19 infections. Higher income inequality was positively associated with both COVID-19 (relative risk 1.05, 95% CrI = 1.03–1.07) and HIV infection (relative risk = 1.12, 95% CrI = 1.09–1.15).

First defined in 2005, SUDC cases are more often male, with death occurring during a sleep period, being found prone, peak winter incidence, associated with febrile seizure history in ~28% of cases and mild pathologic changes insufficient to explain the death (1, 2). There has been little progress in understanding the causes of SUDC and no progress in prevention. Despite reductions in sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) and other causes of mortality in childhood, the rate of SUDC has increased during the past two decades (3–5). In Ireland, SUID deaths were cut in half from 1994 to 2008 while SUDC deaths more than doubled (4). Surveillance issues, including lack of standardized certification practices, affect our understanding of the true magnitude of unexplained child deaths. Mechanisms underlying SUDC, like SUID, remain largely speculative. Limited and inconsistent evidence implicates abnormalities in brainstem autonomic and serotonergic nuclei, critical for arousal, cardiorespiratory control, and reflex responses to life-threatening hypoxia or hypercarbia in sleep (6). Abnormalities in medullary serotonergic neurons and receptors, as well as cardiorespiratory brainstem nuclei occur in some SUID cases, but have never been studied in SUDC. Retrospective, small SUDC studies with non-standardized methodologies most often demonstrate minor hippocampal abnormalities, as well as focal cortical dysplasia and dysgenesis of the brainstem and cerebellum. The significance of these findings to SUDC pathogenesis remains unclear with some investigators and forensic pathologists labeling these findings as normal variants, or potential causes of SUDC. The development of preventive strategies will require a greater understanding of underlying mechanisms.","McGuone, Declan; Crandall, Laura G.; Devinsky, Orrin",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178125/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.582051,611

In Italy, a period of generalized lockdown involving home confinement of the entire population was imposed for almost two months (9 March–3 May 2020). The present is the most extensive investigation aimed to unravel the demographic, psychological, chronobiological, and work-related predictors of sleep disturbances throughout the pandemic emergency. A total of 13,989 Italians completed a web-based survey during the confinement period (25 March–3 May). We collected demographic and lockdown-related work changes information, and we evaluated sleep quality, insomnia and depression symptoms, chronotype, perceived stress, and anxiety using validated questionnaires. The majority of the respondents reported a negative impact of confinement on their sleep and a delayed sleep phase. We highlighted an alarming prevalence of sleep disturbances during the lockdown. Main predictors of sleep disturbances identified by regression models were: female gender, advanced age, being a healthcare worker, living in southern Italy, confinement duration, and a higher level of depression, stress, and anxiety. The evening chronotype emerged as a vulnerability factor, while morning-type individuals showed a lower predisposition to sleep and psychological problems. Finally, working from home was associated with less severe sleep disturbances. Besides confirming the role of specific demographic and psychological factors in developing sleep disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose that circadian typologies could react differently to a particular period of reduced social jetlag. Moreover, our results suggest that working from home could play a protective role against the development of sleep disturbances during the current pandemic emergency.","Salfi, Federico; Lauriola, Marco; D’Atri, Aurora; Amicucci, Giulia; Viselli, Lorenzo; Tempesta, Daniela; Ferrara, Michele",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90993-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075173/,611

Recent evidence has documented several immunometabolic pathways in patients with diabetes directly related to the COVID-19 infection. This also seems to be the case for prediabetic subjects with proinflammatory insulin resistance syndrome accompanied with prothrombotic hyperinsulinemic and dysglycemic states. Patients with frank hyperglycemia, dysglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia develop systemic immunometabolic inflammation with higher levels of circulating cytokines. This deleterious scenario has been proposed as the underlying mechanism enhancing a cytokine storm-like hyperinflammatory state in diabetics infected with severe COVID-19 triggering multi-organ failure. Compared with moderately affected COVID-19 patients, diabetes was found to be highly prevalent among severely affected patients suggesting that this non-communicable disease should be considered as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic mirrors with the diabetes pandemic in many pathobiological aspects. Our interest is to emphasize the ties between the immunoinflammatory mechanisms that underlie the morbidity and lethality when COVID-19 meets diabetes. This review brings attention to two pathologies of highly complex, multifactorial, developmental and environmentally dependent manifestations of critical importance to human survival.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectins (CLECs) CLEC2 and CLEC5A are highly expressed on platelets and myeloid cells, respectively. CLEC2 has been shown to recognize snake venom aggretin and the endogenous ligand podoplanin and acts as a critical regulator in the development and immunothrombosis. Although CLEC2 has been reported to interact with type I immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), its role in viral infections is still unclear. CLEC5A binds to fucose and mannose moieties of dengue virus membrane glycans, as well as to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)/N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) disaccharides that form the backbone of L. monocytogenes peptidoglycans. Recently, we demonstrated that both CLEC2 and CLEC5A are critical in microbe-induced “neutrophil extracellular trap” (NET) formation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Moreover, activation of CLEC2 by dengue virus (DV) and H5N1 influenza virus (IAV) induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which further enhance NETosis and proinflammatory cytokine production via CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These findings not only illustrate the immunomodulatory effects of EVs during platelet-leukocyte interactions, but also demonstrate the critical roles of CLEC2 and CLEC5A in acute viral infections.","Sung, Pei-Shan; Hsieh, Shie-Liang",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867016/,611

South Africa, like many other countries, initiated a multifaceted national response to the pandemic. Self-isolation and quarantine are essential components of the public health response in the country. This paper examined perceptions and preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine during the initial phase of the pandemic in South Africa. METHODS: The analysis used data obtained from an online quantitative survey conducted in all nine provinces using a data-free platform. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Of 55,823 respondents, 40.1% reported that they may end up in self-isolation or quarantine, 32.6% did not think that they would and 27.4% were unsure. Preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was 59.0% for self, 53.8% for child and 59.9% for elderly. The odds of perceived possibility for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly higher among Coloureds, Whites, and Indians/Asians than Black Africans, and among those with moderate or high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than those with low risk perception. The odds were significantly lower among older age groups than those aged 18–29 years, and those unemployed than fully employed. The odds of preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly less likely among females than males. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly more likely among other population groups than Black Africans and among older age groups than those aged 18–29 years. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those self-employed than fully employed and those residing in informal dwellings than formal dwellings. In addition, preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those with moderate and high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than low risk perception. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the challenge of implementing self-isolation or quarantine in a country with different and unique social contexts.

611983,Diagnostic radiographer advanced clinical practice in the United Kingdom – A national cross-sectional survey,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. RESULTS: This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","Goethals, Luc; Barth, Nathalie; Guyot, Jessica; Hupin, David; Celarier, Thomas; Bongue, Bienvenu",JMIR Aging,https://doi.org/10.2196/19007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32356777/,611

Discovering potent compounds is a critical step to inhibit coronavirus. 3CLpro and RdRp are the most conserved targets associated with COVID-19. In this study, three-dimensional pharmacophore modeling, scaffold hopping, molecular docking, structure-based virtual screening, QSAR-based ADMET predictions and molecular dynamics analysis were used to identify inhibitors for these targets. Binding free energies estimated by molecular docking for each ligand in different binding sites of RdRp were used to predict the active site. Previously reported active 3CLpro and RdRp inhibitors were used to build a pharmacophore model to develop different scaffolds. Structure-based simulations and pharmacophore modeling based on Hip Hop algorithm converged in a state that suggest hydrogen bond acceptor and donor features have a critical role in the two binding sites. Further validations indicated that the best pharmacophore model has fairly good correlation values compared with approved inhibitors. Structure-based simulation results approved that GLu166 and Gln189 in 3CLpro and Lys551 and Glu811 in RdRp, are critical residues for dual activities. Ten compounds were extracted from pharmacophore-based virtual screening in six databases. The results, gained by repurposing approach, suggest the effectiveness of these ten compounds with different scaffolds as possible inhibitors of the two targets. Some quinoline-based hybrid derivatives also were designed. QSAR descriptors plot predicted that the scaffolds have had accepted pharmacokinetic profiles. Multiple molecular dynamics simulations in 100 ns and MM/PBSA studies of some reference inhibitors and the novel compounds in complex with both targets demonstrated stable complexes and confirmed the interaction modes.

614492,"Relationship between physical activity, healthy lifestyle and COVID-19 disease severity; a cross-sectional study",2021-02-04,"Abstract Background Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes significant human disease and mortality in the tropics and subtropics. By examining the effects of virus infection on gene expression, and interactions between virus and vector, new targets for prevention of infection and novel treatments may be identified in mosquitoes. We previously performed a microarray analysis of the Aedes aegypti transcriptome during infection with DENV and found that mosquito ubiquitin protein Ub3881 (AAEL003881) was specifically and highly down-regulated. Ubiquitin proteins have multiple functions in insects, including marking proteins for proteasomal degradation, regulating apoptosis and mediating innate immune signaling. Methods We used qRT-PCR to quantify gene expression and infection, and RNAi to reduce Ub3881 expression. Mosquitoes were infected with DENV through blood feeding. We transfected DENV protein expression constructs to examine the effect of Ub3881 on protein degradation. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transfection to determine what amino acids are involved in Ub3881-mediated protein degradation. Immunofluorescence, Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were used to examine protein interactions and co-localization. Results The overexpression of Ub3881, but not related ubiquitin proteins, decreased DENV infection in mosquito cells and live Ae. aegypti. The Ub3881 protein was demonstrated to be involved in DENV envelope protein degradation and reduce the number of infectious virions released. Conclusions We conclude that Ub3881 has several antiviral functions in the mosquito, including specific viral protein degradation.

However, the role of pulmonary vascular pathology in COVID-19 pneumonia is still not well understood. PURPOSE: To investigate pulmonary vascular abnormalities on CT pulmonary angiography in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 48 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection who had undergone CT pulmonary angiography between 3/22/20 and 4/5/20 in our large urban health care system were included. Patient demographics and clinical data were collected through the electronic medical record system. Twenty-five patients underwent dual energy CT (DECT) as part of the standard CT pulmonary angiogram protocol at a subset of the hospitals. Two thoracic radiologists independently assessed all studies. Disagreement in assessment was resolved by consensus discussion with a third thoracic radiologist. RESULTS: Of the 48 patients, 45 patients required admission, with 18 admitted to the ICU, and 13 requiring intubation. Seven patients (15%) were found to have pulmonary emboli. Dilated vessels were seen in 41 cases (85%), with 38 (78%) and 27 (55%) of cases demonstrating vessel enlargement within and outside of lung opacities, respectively. Dilated distal vessels extending to the pleura and fissures were seen in 40 cases (82%) and 30 cases (61%), respectively. On DECT, mosaic perfusion pattern was observed in 24 cases (96%), regional hyperemia overlapping with areas of pulmonary opacities or immediately surrounding the opacities were seen in 13 cases (52%), opacities associated with corresponding oligemia were seen in 24 cases (96%), and hyperemic halo was seen in 9 cases (36%). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary vascular abnormalities such as vessel enlargement and regional mosaic perfusion patterns are common in COVID-19 pneumonia. Perfusion abnormalities are also frequently observed at DECT in COVID-19 pneumonia and may suggest an underlying vascular process.","Lang, Min; Som, Avik; Carey, Denston; Reid, Nicholas; Mendoza, Dexter P.; Flores, Efren J.; Li, Matthew D.; Shepard, Jo-Anne O.; Little, Brent P.",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036264/; https://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200277,611

OBJECTIVES: (1) Determine the overall incidence of RTIs in a daycare cohort using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). (2) Determine the relative incidence and impact of specific respiratory viruses, and characterize and compare clinical features associated with these pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study conducted from February 2006 to April 2008, nasal swabs were obtained from symptomatic children ages 0–30 months enrolled in fulltime daycare. RT-PCR was performed to detect respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza (Flu) viruses A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), human coronaviruses (CoV) and rhinovirus (RhV). Symptom diaries were completed for each illness. RESULTS: We followed 119 children (mean age 10 months; range 2–24 months) for 115 child years. The mean annual incidence of RTI per child was 4.2 the first year and 1.2 the second year of the study. At least 1 virus was identified in 67% RTIs. Co-infections were common (27% RTIs), with RhV, CoV, and AdV the most common co-pathogens. PIV was identified in 12% of RTIs with a high incidence of PIV4. The viruses with the greatest impact on our population were RSV, RhV and AdV. CONCLUSIONS: Using molecular techniques, viruses were identified in approximately twice as many RTIs as previously reported in a daycare cohort. Infections with newly identified viruses, such as HMPV and CoV subtypes were less frequent and severe than infections with RSV, AdV and RhV.","Fairchok, Mary P.; Martin, Emily T.; Chambers, Susan; Kuypers, Jane; Behrens, Melinda; Braun, LoRanee E.; Englund, Janet A.",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321000257X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321000257X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20650679/,611

Besides, the context of digitalization, integration, and globalization of the supply chain has raised an increasing awareness of advanced information processing techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in building SCRes and improving supply chain performance (SCP). The present study investigates the direct and indirect effects of AI, SCRes, and SCP under a context of dynamism and uncertainty of the supply chain. In doing so, we have conceptualized the use of AI in the supply chain on the organizational information processing theory (OIPT). The developed framework was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Survey data was collected from 279 firms representing different sizes, operating in various sectors, and countries. Our findings suggest that while AI has a direct impact on SCP in the short-term, it is recommended to exploit its information processing capabilities to build SCRes for long-lasting SCP. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on maximizing the benefits of AI capabilities to generate sustained SCP. The study could be further extended using a longitudinal investigation to explore more facets of the phenomenon.","Belhadi, Amine; Mani, Venkatesh; Kamble, Sachin S.; Khan, Syed Abdul Rehman; Verma, Surabhi",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551534/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-03956-x,611

Method Employees (n = 1363) were offered a nasopharyngeal swab and serology for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, employees completed a questionnaire about preexisting conditions, contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and COVID-19-specific symptoms. Results 1212 employees participated. 19 of 1363 (1.4 %) employees tested positive by PCR (3 within and 16 before the study). 40 (3.3 %) and 105 (8.6 %) had IgG and IgA, respectively, 32 (2.6 %) both IgG and IgA. Overall, 47 employees tested positive. In this group, most frequently reported symptoms were headache (56 %), fatigue (49 %), sore throat (49 %), and cough (46 %); fever was reported by 33 %. SARS-CoV-2-positive employees reported more frequently contact with COVID-19 cases (60.5 % vs. 37.3 %, p = 0.006). Employees testing positive only for IgA reported less symptoms. Conclusion Between 27.04. and 20.05.2020, 3.9 % of the employees working in a general hospital were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. This proportion was lower than expected; possible explanations are the low level of endemic infection and the extensive, uniform in-house preventative measures.","Platten, Martin; Cranen, Rita; Peters, Claudia; Wisplinghoff, Hilmar; Nienhaus, Albert; Bach, Alexander Daniel; Michels, Guido",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513626/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1322-5355,611

Accordingly, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the challenges of hospital preparedness in biological events. METHODS: This study used a qualitative method using content analysis in which 20 health-care managers and experts who are experienced in biological events were selected through purposeful sampling. The data collection was done through semi-structured interviews, which continued until data saturation. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis as well as the Landman and Graneheim Approach. RESULTS: Six main concepts (training and practice, resource management, safety and health, patient management, risk communication, and laboratory and surveillance) and 14 subconcepts were extracted on hospital preparedness challenges in biological events through analyzing interviews. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that the health system of the country faces many challenges in response to biological events and threats. Moreover, study participants indicated that Iranian hospitals were not prepared for biological events. It is recommended to design preparedness plans of hospitals based on preparedness standards for biological events.

Further, adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm delivery and stillbirth, might be more common among pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (2,3). Information about SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is rapidly growing; however, data on reasons for hospital admission, pregnancy-specific characteristics, and birth outcomes among pregnant women hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections are limited. During March 1-May 30, 2020, as part of Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) surveillance of COVID-19 hospitalizations, 105 hospitalized pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, including 62 (59%) hospitalized for obstetric reasons (i.e., labor and delivery or another pregnancy-related indication) and 43 (41%) hospitalized for COVID-19 illness without an obstetric reason. Overall, 50 (81%) of 62 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted for obstetric reasons were asymptomatic. Among 43 pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19, 13 (30%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission, six (14%) required mechanical ventilation, and one died from COVID-19. Prepregnancy obesity was more common (44%) among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 than that among asymptomatic pregnant women hospitalized for obstetric reasons (31%). Likewise, the rate of gestational diabetes (26%) among pregnant women hospitalized for COVID-19 was higher than it was among women hospitalized for obstetric reasons (8%). Preterm delivery occurred in 15% of pregnancies among 93 women who delivered, and stillbirths (fetal death at ≥20 weeks' gestation) occurred in 3%.

Objective The study aimed to characterize corrected QT (QTc) prolongation in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with combination HCQ/AZM. Methods A retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients treated with HCQ/AZM was reviewed. The QTc interval was calculated prior to drug administration and for the first 5 days following initiation. The primary end point was the magnitude of QTc prolongation, and factors associated with QTc prolongation. Secondary endpoints were incidences of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and all-cause mortality. Results Among 415 patients receiving concomitant HCQ/AZM, the mean QTc increased from 443±25 msec to a maximum of 473±40 msec (87 (21%) had a QTc ≥500 msec). Factors associated with QTc prolongation ≥500 msec were age (p < 0.001), body mass index <30 kg/m2 (p = 0.005), heart failure (p < 0.001), elevated creatinine (p = 0.005), and peak troponin (p < 0.001). The change in QTc was not associated with death over the short period of the study in a population where mortality was already high (hazard ratio, 0.998, p = 0.607). No primary high-grade ventricular arrhythmias were observed. Conclusions An increase in QTc was seen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ/AZM. Several clinical factors were associated with greater QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were not associated with increased risk of death.","O’Connell, Thomas F.; Bradley, Christopher J.; Abbas, Amr E.; Williamson, Brian D.; Rusia, Akash; Tawney, Adam M.; Gaines, Rick; Schott, Jason; Dmitrienko, Alex; Haines, David E.",JACC Clin Electrophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacep.2020.07.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405500X20306939?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405500X20306939,611
622916,Analysis of Social Determinants and the Utilization of Pediatric Tele–Urgent Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study,2021-08-30,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a significant public health threat worldwide. As of mid-June 2020, COVID-19 has spread worldwide with more than 7.7 million confirmed cases and more than 400,000 deaths. The impacts are substantial particularly in developing and densely populated countries like Bangladesh with inadequate health care facilities, where COVID-19 cases are currently surging. While early detection and isolation were identified as important non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures for containing the disease spread, this may not be pragmatically implementable in developing countries primarily due to social and economic reasons (i.e. poor education, less public awareness, massive unemployment). To shed light on COVID-19 transmission dynamics and impacts of NPI scenarios, e.g. social distancing, this study conducted emerging pattern analysis using the space-time scan statistic at district and thana (i.e. a sub-district or 'upazila' with at least one police station) levels in Bangladesh and its capital Dhaka city, respectively. We found that the central and south eastern regions in Bangladesh are currently exhibiting a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Dhaka megacity remains as the highest risk ""active"" cluster since early April. The space-time progression of COVID-19 infection, when validated against the chronicle of government press releases and newspaper reports, suggests that Bangladesh have experienced a community level transmission at the early phase (i.e., March, 2020) primarily introduced by Bangladeshi citizens returning from coronavirus-affected countries in the Europe and the Middle East. A linkage is evident between the violation of NPIs and post-incubation period emergence of new clusters with elevated exposure risk around Bangladesh. This study provides novel insights into the space-time patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics and recommends pragmatic NPI implementation for reducing disease transmission and minimizing impacts in a resource-scarce country with Bangladesh as a case-study example.","Masrur, A.; Yu, M.; Luo, W.; Dewan, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.15.20154757v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154757,611

Thus, 30 samples from supermarkets in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, were collected for the study of risk assessment of exposure to heavy metals contained in hydroalcoholic gels. This study consists of the characterization of the danger by calculating the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk by skin contact. Almost all samples analysed contain trace of lead, cadmium and mercury but at concentrations below the Canadian limit in cosmetic products applied to the skin and below the US FDA limit as an impurity in colour additives used in cosmetic products. The mean values of chronic daily intake via dermal absorption (CDIdermal) for adults were found in the order of mercury > lead > cadmium. The health risk estimation indicated that the mean total hazard quotient for dermal adsorption (HIdermal) obtained is 7.10 × 10(-5) ± 5.52 × 10(-5). This value was below 1, the acceptable limit, representing a non-carcinogenic risk for Abidjan residents through dermal adsorption. Moreover, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) evaluation for lead and cadmium was insignificant, and the cancer risk can be neglected, but in case of their overusing, they can cause long-term health problems for consumers.","Gnonsoro, Urbain Paul; Ake Assi, Yolande Epouse Datte; Sangare, Naminata Soumahoro; Kouakou, Yao Urbain; Trokourey, Albert",Biol Trace Elem Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34491517/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-021-02822-y,611
623865,Perceived Utilities of COVID-19 Related Chatbots in Saudi Arabia: a Cross-sectional Study,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Immune-mediated lung injury and systemic hyperinflammation are characteristic of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults. Although the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multi-organ involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials. The framework presented herein offers an approach to decision-making regarding immunomodulatory therapy for severe or critical pediatric COVID-19 and is informed by currently available data, while awaiting results of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.","Dulek, Daniel E; Fuhlbrigge, Robert C; Tribble, Alison C; Connelly, James A; Loi, Michele M; El Chebib, Hassan; Chandrakasan, Shanmuganathan; Otto, William R; Diorio, Caroline; Keim, Garrett; Walkovich, Kelly; Jaggi, Preeti; Girotto, Jennifer E; Yarbrough, April; Behrens, Edward M; Cron, Randy Q; Bassiri, Hamid",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piaa098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808988/,611
624417,Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and its relationship with perception and knowledge about social distancing: A cross-sectional study,2021-03-09,"OBJECTIVE: When faced with an emergent epidemic with high mortality and morbidity potential, policy makers must decide what public health interventions to deploy at different stages of the outbreak. However, almost nothing is known about how the public view these interventions or how they trade off risks (of disease) with inconvenience (of interventions). In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment. SETTING: This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013. PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of 500 Singapore residents aged 21 and over, including 271 women and 229 men, was analysed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes and declared a preference for one combination. A random utility model was developed to determine the individual’s preference for interventions and a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct respondent preference classes. RESULTS: On average, participants preferred more intense interventions, and preferred scenarios with fewer deaths and lower tax. The number of infections did not significantly influence respondents’ responses. We identified two broad classes of respondents: those who were mortality averse and those who were expenditure averse. Education was found to be a predictor of group membership. CONCLUSION: Overall, there was considerable support for government interventions to prevent or mitigate outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, including those that greatly restricted individual liberties, as long as the restrictions showed a reasonable chance of reducing the adverse health effects of the outbreak.","Cook, Alex R; Zhao, Xiahong; Chen, Mark I C; Finkelstein, Eric A",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29453294/,611

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of Mucorales associated infections, now termed COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM), have been reported. Despite an increase in fatality reports, no cases of rhino-orbital CAM complicated with gangrenous bone necrosis have been described in the literature to date. Case: A 56-year-old male with a recent COVID-19 diagnosis developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis after 22 days of treatment with dexamethasone. Cultures and histopathological assessment of tissue biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. The patient survived after treatment with amphotericin B. Conclusions: Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection affecting mostly immunocompromised patients. Along with the COVID-19 pandemic, the inappropriate use of steroids, in addition to concurrent risk factors, such as diabetes, has led to an increase in the occurrence of these devastating mycoses, leading to the development of severe presentations and complications, as observed in many cases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of spending on healthcare R&D to address the needs of developing innovative therapeutic products in Indonesia. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed by taking into account four stages of R&D: stage 1 from raw concept to feasibility, stage 2 from feasibility to development, stage 3 from development to early commercialization, and stage 4 from early to full commercialization. Considering a 3-year time horizon, a stage-dependent success rate was applied and analyses were conducted from a business perspective. Two scenarios were compared by assuming the government of Indonesia would increase GERD in health and medical sciences up to 2- and 3-times higher than the baseline (current situation) for the first and second scenario, respectively. Cost per number of innovative products in health and medical sciences was considered as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of different input parameters on the ICER. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant association (P-value<0.05) between countries’ GERD in medical and health sciences with the number of innovative products. We estimated the ICER would be $8.50 million and $2.04 million per innovative product for the first and second scenario, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the success rates in all stages and total GERD were the most influential parameters impacting the ICER. CONCLUSION: The result showed that there was an association between GERD in medical and health sciences with the number of innovative products. In addition, the second scenario would be more cost-effective than the first scenario.","Suwantika, Auliya A; Kautsar, Angga P; Zakiyah, Neily; Abdulah, Rizky; Boersma, Cornelis; Postma, Maarten J",Ther Clin Risk Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116546/; https://doi.org/10.2147/tcrm.s260377,611

Objective: To compare mental and social health of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown versus before, identify associated factors, describe the change in atmosphere at home and qualitatively assess the impact of COVID-19 regulations on daily life. Design: Cross-sectional study comparing two Dutch representative samples of children and adolescents (8-18 years); before COVID-19 (Dec2017-July2018) and during the COVID-19 lockdown (April/May 2020). Setting: Population-based Participants: Children and adolescents aged 8-18 years (M=13.4, 47.4% male), representative of the Dutch population on key demographics. Exposure(s): COVID-19 pandemic lockdown Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger and Sleep-Related Impairment. Single item on atmosphere at home and open question regarding the impact of the regulations on the childs/adolescents daily life Results: Children and adolescents reported significantly worse PROMIS T-scores on all domains (absolute mean difference range, 2.1-7.1; absolute 95% CI range, 1.3-7.9) during the COVID-19 lockdown as compared to before COVID-19. More children reported severe Anxiety (during 16.7% vs. before 8.6%; relative risk 1.95; 95% CI 1.55-2.46) and Sleep-Related Impairment (during 11.5% vs. before 6.1%; relative risk 1.89; 95% CI 1.29-2.78). Fewer children reported poor Global Health (during 1.7 vs. before 4.6%; relative risk 0.36; 95% CI 0.20-0.65). More mental and social health complaints during the COVID-19 lockdown were found in children and adolescents growing up in a single-parent family, having >three children in the family, a negative change in work situation of parents due to COVID-19 regulations, and having a relative/friend infected with COVID-19. A small effect was found on atmosphere at home during the lockdown compared to before (mean difference, -3.1; 95% CI, -4.1 - -2.1). A large majority (>90%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 regulations on their daily life.

METHOD: After the mice had been immunized intramuscularly and/or intraperitoneally with pcDNA3.1-N and rAd-N in prime-triple boost immunization, humoral and cellular immune responses were detected. RESULTS: After detection, different levels of anti-N humoral and cellular responses are shown compared to controls. The humoral immune response was induced more effectively by the DNA priming and recombinant adenovirus boosting regimen and the reverse sequence of heterogeneous combinations. There is a significant difference between heterogeneous and homologous vaccinations. However, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response was not significantly altered by the different prime-boost immunizations or the recombinant adenovirus of pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen alone, but lymphoproliferation and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion were all enhanced by heterologous combination immunizations compared to homologous combinations. For the reverse sequence immunization regimen, lymphoproliferation, IFN-γ and CTL responses were all significantly weaker compared with pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen. CONCLUSION: Taken together, of all the combinations, the prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N can effectively induce SARS-CoV-N-specific and strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The present results suggest that DNA immunization followed by recombinant adenovirus boosting could be used as a potential SARS-CoV vaccine in the induction of an enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.","Chunling, Ma; Kun, Yao; Jian, Xu; Jian, Qin; Hua, Sun; Minsheng, Zhu",Intervirology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16809936/,611

Studies conducted in early 2020 suggested that temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and other meteorological factors have an influence on the transmissibility and viral dynamics of COVID‐19. Previous reviews of the literature have found significant heterogeneity in associations but did not examine many factors relating to epidemiological quality of the analyses such as rigor of data collection and statistical analysis, or consideration of potential confounding factors. To provide greater insight into the current state of the literature from an epidemiological standpoint, the authors conducted a rapid descriptive analysis with a strong focus on the characterization of COVID‐19 health outcomes and use of controls for confounding social and demographic variables such as population movement and age. We have found that few studies adequately considered the challenges posed by the use of governmental reporting of laboratory testing as a proxy for disease transmission, including timeliness and consistency. In addition, very few studies attempted to control for confounding factors, including timing and implementation of public health interventions and metrics of population compliance with those interventions. Ongoing research should give greater consideration to the measures used to quantify COVID‐19 transmission and health outcomes as well as how to control for the confounding influences of public health measures and personal behaviors.","Quintana, Amanda V.; Clemons, Meredith; Hoevemeyer, Krista; Liu, Ann; Balbus, John",Geohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430778/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gh000367,611

Researchers in different fields are continually working to develop vaccines and prevention strategies. However, an accurate forecast of the outbreak can help control the pandemic until a vaccine is available. Several machine learning and deep learning-based approaches are available to forecast the confirmed cases, but they lack the optimized temporal component and nonlinearity. To enhance the current forecasting frameworks’ capability, we proposed optimized long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to forecast COVID-19 cases and reduce mean absolute error. For the optimization of LSTM, we applied bat algorithm. Furthermore, to tackle the premature convergence and local minima problem of BA, we proposed an enhanced variant of BA. The proposed version utilized Gaussian adaptive inertia weight to control the individual velocity in the entire swarm. In addition, we substitute random walk with the Gaussian walk to observe the local search mechanism. The proposed LSTM examines the personal best solution with the swarm’s local best and preserves the optimal solution by combining the Gaussian walk. To evaluate the optimized LSTM, we compared it with the non-optimal version of LSTM, recurrent neural network, gated recurrent units, and other recent state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results prove the superiority of the optimized LSTM over other recent algorithms by obtaining 99.52 % accuracy.","Rauf, Hafiz Tayyab; Gao, Jiechao; Almadhor, Ahmad; Arif, Muhammad; Nafis, Md Tabrez",Soft comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-06075-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34393647/,611

METHODS: Onsite evaluation of 16 hospitals consisted of interviews with managers and health care workers about RPPs and practices, review of written RPPs, and limited observations of personnel using respirators. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: All hospitals had implemented policies requiring the minimum use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators when working with patients with H1N1 virus infection; 95.5% of health care workers (n = 199) reported they would wear at least this level of protection when in close contact with a patient with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection. However, evaluation of written RPPs indicated deficiencies in required areas, most commonly in recordkeeping, designation of a program administrator, program evaluation, employee training, and fit testing procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers were aware of respiratory protection required when providing care for patients with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection. Hospitals should improve written RPPs, fully implement written procedures, and conduct periodic program evaluation to ensure effectiveness of respirator use for health care worker protection.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2, highly expressed in the respiratory system, has been identified as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2. Notably, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 is also expressed in the cardiovascular system, and there are multiple cardiovascular implications of COVID‐19. Cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease have been associated with severe manifestations and poor prognosis in patients with COVID‐19.

640381,221 Social Integration and Sleep Quality during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective Evidence from a Study of Retired Older Adults,2021-05-03,"BackgroundThe world is going through the critical phase of COVID-19 pandemic, caused by human coronavirus, SARS-CoV2. Worldwide concerted effort to identify viral genomic changes across different sub-types has identified several strong changes in the coding region. However, there have not been many studies focusing on the variations in the 5 and 3 untranslated regions and their consequences. Considering the possible importance of these regions in host mediated regulation of viral RNA genome, we wanted to explore the phenomenon. MethodsTo have an idea of the global changes in 5 and 3-UTR sequences, we downloaded 8595 complete and high-coverage SARS-CoV2 genome sequence information from human host in FASTA format from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 15 different geographical regions. Next, we aligned them using Clustal Omega software and investigated the UTR variants. We also looked at the putative host RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA binding sites in these regions by RBPmap and RNA22 v2 respectively. Expression status of selected RBPs and microRNAs were checked in lungs tissue. ResultsWe identified 28 unique variants in SARS-CoV2 UTR region based on a minimum variant percentage cut-off of 0.5. Along with 241C>T change the important 5-UTR change identified was 187A>G, while 29734G>C, 29742G>A/T and 29774C>T were the most familiar variants of 3UTR among most of the continents. Furthermore, we found that despite of the variations in the UTR regions, binding of host RBP to them remains mostly unaltered, which further influenced the functioning of specific miRNAs. ConclusionOur results, shows for the first time in SARS-Cov2 infection, a possible cross-talk between host RBPs-miRNAs and viral UTR variants, which ultimately could explain the mechanism of escaping host RNA decay machinery by the virus. The knowledge might be helpful in developing anti-viral compounds in future.","Mukherjee, Moumita; GOSWAMI, SRIKANTA",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.134585,611
640545,Quality of Life of Urolithiasis Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multi-Institutional Cross-Sectional Study,2021,"Simulations of tissue-specific effects of primary acute viral infections like COVID-19 are essential for understanding disease outcomes and optimizing therapies. Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (e.g., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.","Sego, T.

The aim of this study was to investigate current VR assessment, treatment, education, and research practices. This was an online, cross-sectional survey with 39 VR specific questions and four sections: demographics, current practice, education, and research. The survey was disseminated through the Dizzynet network to individual therapists through country-specific VR special interest groups. Results were analysed descriptively. A thematic approach was taken to analyse open questions. A total of 471 individuals (median age 41, range 23 − 68 years, 73.4% women), predominately physiotherapists (89.4%) from 20 European countries responded to the survey. They had worked for a median of 4 years (range < 1 − 35) in VR. The majority (58.7%) worked in hospital in-patient or out-patient settings and 21.4% in dedicated VR services. Most respondents specialized in neurology, care of the elderly (geriatrics), or otorhinolaryngology. VR was reported as hard/very hard to access by 48%, with the main barriers to access identified as lack of knowledge of health care professionals (particularly family physicians), lack of trained therapists, and lack of local services. Most respondents reported to know and treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV 87.5%), unilateral vestibular hypofunction (75.6%), and cervicogenic dizziness (63%). The use of vestibular assessment equipment varied widely. Over 70% used high-density foam and objective gait speed testing. Over 50% used dynamic visual acuity equipment. Infrared systems, Frenzel lenses, and dynamic posturography were not commonly employed (< 20%). The most frequently used physical outcome measures were the Clinical Test of the Sensory Interaction of Balance, Functional Gait Assessment/Dynamic Gait Index, and Romberg/Tandem Romberg. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Visual Analogue Scale, Falls Efficacy Scale, and the Vertigo Symptom Scale were the most commonly used patient reported outcome measures. Adaptation, balance, and habituation exercises were most frequently used (> 80%), with virtual reality used by 15.6%. Over 70% reported knowledge/use of Semont, Epley and Barbeque-Roll manoeuvres for the treatment of BPPV. Most education regarding VR was obtained at post-registration level (89.5%) with only 19% reporting pre-registration education. There was strong (78%) agreement that therapists should have professionally accredited postgraduate certification in VR, with blended learning the most popular mode. Three major research questions were identified for priority: management of specific conditions, effectiveness of VR, and mechanisms/factors influencing vestibular compensation and VR. In summary, the survey quantified current clinical practice in VR across Europe. Knowledge and treatment of common vestibular diseases was high, but use of published subjective and objective outcome measures as well as vestibular assessment varied widely.

The number of affected cases and deaths continues to rise. Primarily a respiratory illness, COVID-19 is now known to affect various organ systems including peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this review is to discuss the scope of neuromuscular manifestations and complications of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Several neuromuscular conditions, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, and myositis, have been reported in patients infected with COVID-19, but even with a temporal association, a causal relationship remains unproven. Direct invasion of neurons or myocytes by the virus, and immune-mediated injury have been speculated but not consistently demonstrated. In addition to potentially causing the above conditions, COVID-19 can trigger exacerbations of preexisting neuromuscular conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and severe infections can lead to critical illness myopathy/polyneuropathy. SUMMARY: COVID-19 appears to be potentially associated with a wide range of neuromuscular manifestations and complications. Further studies are needed to examine these possible associations, understand the pathogenesis, and develop preventive and treatment strategies.","Suh, Joome; Amato, Anthony A.",Curr Opin Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155186/,611

The aim of this study was to assess the self-perceived beliefs of Montenegrin secondary school pupils regarding the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of the pupils was conducted during October and November 2020 in four randomly selected public secondary schools in Podgorica, Montenegro. All 500 pupils were asked to fill in a questionnaire that included questions on age, sex, presence of acne, perceived acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, and sources of their information about acne. RESULTS: A total of 500 pupils, 234 (46.8%) boys, and 266 (53.2%) girls, aged 14−17 years, participated in the study. Acne was self-reported in 249 (49.8%) pupils, whereas 251 (50.2%) did not report acne. Factors most often believed to aggravate acne were inadequate face washing (85.0%), hormones (84.0%), sweets (82.0%), greasy food (72.6%), makeup (71.2%), and stress (67.8%). Overall the most prevalent acne ameliorating factors were cosmetic treatment (80.4%), increased water consumption (77.6%), a diet change to a healthier food choice (77.4%), and being on school holidays (62.2%). Girls reported more frequently that genetics, stress, sweets consumption, inadequate face wash, and makeup are acne exacerbating factors, whilst cosmetic treatment, increased water consumption, smoking, and being on school holidays are acne ameliorating factors. Boys more frequently considered the benefit of losing weight. There was no statistically significant difference between pupils with and without acne in perceived factors, except for cosmetic treatment. Those with acne more frequently believed in the benefits of cosmetic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents’ self-perceived beliefs about factors that aggravate and ameliorate acne are myths and misconceptions without evidence-based justification. More efforts are needed to educate pupils about the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, its health-related consequences, and the treatment possibilities.","Ražnatović Đurović, Milena; Janković, Janko; Đurović, Milica; Spirić, Jelena; Janković, Slavenka",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133464/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253421,611

This virus includes Nebraska (NB)- and Newbury agent 1 (NA1)-like strains. The prevalence of this BEC and its genetic characterization has only been reported in the UK and the USA. This study examined the prevalence and genetic diversity of these BECs in diarrheic calves in South Korea. Among a total of 645 diarrheic fecal specimens obtained from 629 cattle herds, these unclassified BECs were detected in 59 (9.1%) diarrheic fecal samples from 57 herds (9.3%) by either RT-PCR or nested PCR. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the partial RdRp gene showed that all the Korean BECs clustered together and were closely related to the NB-like viruses (80.9–88.1% nucleotide and 84.5–98.4% amino acid) but not to the NA1-like viruses (75.8–78.4% nucleotide and 79.7–82.8% amino acid). Although these viruses could not be classified into NA1- and NB-like viruses from the sequence and phylogenetic data of the entire capsid gene, all the Korean BECs clustered together on a branch separate from the other known BECs. These results show that these BEC infections are endemic in diarrheic calves in South Korea. The infecting strains are genetically closer to the NB-like viruses but have a distinct evolutionary pathway.","Park, Sang-Ik; Jeong, Cheol; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Jeong, Young-Ju; Hyun, Bang-Hun; Chun, Young-Hyun; Kang, Mun-Il; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18387758/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.01.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508000527; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508000527,611

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence on the viral messenger RNA and is stimulated by a specific structure, downstream of the shift site. While in group M, the most abundant HIV-1 group, the frameshift stimulatory signal is an extended bulged stem-loop, we show here, using a combination of mutagenesis and probing studies, that it is a pseudoknot in group O. The mutagenesis and probing studies coupled to an in silico analysis show that group O pseudoknot is a hairpin-type pseudoknot with two coaxially stacked stems of eight base-pairs (stem 1 and stem 2), connected by single-stranded loops of 2 nt (loop 1) and 20 nt (loop 2). Mutations impairing formation of stem 1 or stem 2 of the pseudoknot reduce frameshift efficiency, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of these stems restore the frameshift efficiency to near wild-type level. The difference between the frameshift stimulatory signal of group O and group M supports the hypothesis that these groups originate from a different monkey to human transmission.","Baril, Martin; Dulude, Dominic; Steinberg, Sergey V; Brakier-Gingras, Léa",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283603007848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12899829/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603007848,611

The virus has spread across the world, claiming lives on all continents with the exception of Antarctica. Since its arrival in the United States, attention has been paid to how Covid-19 cases and deaths have been distributed across varying socioeconomic and ethnic groups. The goal of this study was to examine this issue during the early weeks of the pandemic, with the hope of shedding some light on how the number of cases and the number of deaths were, or were not related to poverty. Results of this study revealed that during the early weeks of the pandemic more disadvantaged counties in the United States had a larger number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, but that over time this trend changed so that by the beginning of April, 2020 more affluent counties had more confirmed cases of the virus. The number of deaths due to Covid-19 were associated with poorer and more urban counties. Discussion of these results focuses on the possibility that testing for the virus was less available in more disadvantaged counties later in the pandemic than was the case earlier, as the result of an overall lack of adequate testing resources across the nation.","Finch, W.

In this study, evidence is provided that immunity induced by natural exposure to enteric CCoV is not fully protective against strain CB/05. Twenty-two, 10-week-old beagles with a recent natural infection by enteric CCoV were randomly distributed in two experimental groups of eight (groups A and B) and one control group of six (group C) dogs. Dogs in groups A and B were inoculated oronasally with different doses (4 × 10(5) or 4 × 10(3) TCID(50)) of the pantropic strain CB/05, whereas dogs in group C were used as negative controls. Clinical, post-mortem and virological investigations showed that, despite the high serum antibody titres induced by the prior natural infection with enteric CCoV, dogs were susceptible to experimental infection with strain CB/05. This was shown by the occurrence of faecal shedding, and dogs displaying moderate clinical signs, mainly vomiting and diarrhoea. Involvement of the lymphoid tissues was evident as demonstrated by the acute lymphopenia (below 70% of the initial counts), gross lesions in spleen and lymph nodes and detection of CB/05 RNA in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes of some infected dogs. The presence of viral RNA in lymphoid tissues was observed only in dogs euthanised in the early stages of infection and the clinical course of the infection was unrelated to the viral dose administered. The present study demonstrates that strain CB/05 is able to induce infection and disease in dogs seropositive to enteric CCoV, thus highlighting the need for extensive epidemiological investigation and for the possible development of novel antigenically relevant vaccines.","Decaro, Nicola; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Campolo, Marco; Mari, Viviana; Desario, Costantina; Lucente, Maria Stella; Lorusso, Eleonora; Kanellos, Theofanis; Gibbons, Rachel H.; Buonavoglia, Canio",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09016077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887130/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.10.077; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09016077,611

This study assessed the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine among university students in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey using a Google Form was conducted between 2 April and 23 April 2021. A snowball technique was used to recruit participants for this study. The final sample consisted of 407 participants. More than one-third of the participants (36.1%) had received the COVID-19 vaccine, and 13.3% had registered to receive the vaccine. Of the participants who were not yet vaccinated (n = 260), 90.4% indicated that they would like to be vaccinated when given the opportunity. Of the unvaccinated participants, 82.3% trusted the COVID-19 vaccines that had been provided in Saudi Arabia. The most reported reasons for the participants’ acceptance to receive the COVID-19 vaccine included preventive purposes (95.8%), a belief in the safety of the vaccines (84.3%), and the availability of public awareness information regarding the vaccines (77.3%). A small portion of participants (6.1%) were refusing to receive the vaccine due to the potential long-term side effects (92.0%) and expedited vaccine trials (80.0%). Acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine was strongly associated with participants who regularly received the flu vaccine (p < 0.05). All other demographic variables were not statistically associated with the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. In conclusion, it would be appropriate for universities to launch peer programs to urge reluctant students to receive the vaccine voluntarily. In terms of further research, it is valuable to follow up with unvaccinated participants to investigate if they received the vaccine since the data were collected, and their reasons for doing so. This research would reveal changes toward vaccine acceptability over time and any related determinants. Future research should consider students from non-Arabic speaking backgrounds.","Almalki, Mohammed J.; Alotaibi, Amani A.; Alabdali, Salman H.; Zaalah, Ayman A.; Maghfuri, Mohsen W.; Qirati, Naif H.; Jandali, Yahya M.; Almalki, Sami M.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579180/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9090943,611

Methods: Using a mathematical model, we identified contact mitigation strategies that minimised COVID-19-related deaths or years of life lost (YLLs) over a time-horizon of 15 months, using an intervention lasting six or 12 months, in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK. We used strategies that either altered age- or location-specific contact patterns. The optimisation was performed under the constraint that herd immunity should be achieved by the end of the intervention period if post-infection immunity was persistent. We then tested the effect of waning immunity on the strategies. Findings: Strategies of contact mitigation by age were much more effective than those based on mitigation by location. Extremely stringent contact reductions for individuals aged over 50 were required in most countries to minimise deaths or YLLs. The median final proportion of the population ever-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after herd immunity was reached ranged between 30% and 43%, depending on the country and intervention duration. Compared to an unmitigated scenario, optimised age-specific mitigation was predicted to avert over 1 million deaths across the six countries. The optimised scenarios assuming persistent immunity resulted in comparable hospital occupancies to that experienced during the March-April European wave. However, if immunity was short-lived, high burdens were expected without permanent contact mitigation. Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that age-selective mitigation strategies can reduce the mortality impacts of COVID-19 dramatically even when significant transmission occurs. The stringency of the required restrictions in some groups raises concerns about the practicality of these strategies. If post-infection immunity was short-lived, solutions based on a mitigation period designed to increase population immunity should be accompanied with ongoing contact mitigation to prevent large epidemic resurgence.","Ragonnet, R.; Briffoteaux, G.; Williams, B.

Accurate information on the specific circumstances of death and whether patients died from or with SARS-CoV-2 is scarce. To distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 deaths, we performed a systematic review of 735 SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in Hamburg, Germany, from March to December 2020, using conventional autopsy, ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy, postmortem computed tomography and medical records. Statistical analyses including multiple logistic regression were used to compare both cohorts. 84.1% (n = 618) were classified as COVID-19 deaths, 6.4% (n = 47) as non-COVID-19 deaths, 9.5% (n = 70) remained unclear. Median age of COVID-19 deaths was 83.0 years, 54.4% were male. In the autopsy group (n = 283), the majority died of pneumonia and/or diffuse alveolar damage (73.6%; n = 187). Thromboses were found in 39.2% (n = 62/158 cases), pulmonary embolism in 22.1% (n = 56/253 cases). In 2020, annual mortality in Hamburg was about 5.5% higher than in the previous 20 years, of which 3.4% (n = 618) represented COVID-19 deaths.

The chapter begins with a review of sample collection and preparation, and a description of commonly measured parameters and analytical techniques. The reference values, sources of variation, and unique characteristics are then presented for each species, as available. Many variables affect the parameters of clinical biochemistry and hematology including methods of sample collection and preparation, equipment, reagents, and methods of analysis, as well as the age, sex, breed, and environment of the animals being sampled. Values obtained from a clinical case are usually compared with reference values that are either produced in the same laboratory or in a similar group of animals, or cited in the literature. Optimal sites for blood collection vary between laboratory animals and are described in this chapter for each species for which information is available. Total blood volume of the rabbit is discussed in the Hematology section of the chapter. The rabbit is recognized as a valuable model for human disturbances in lipid metabolism, such as the metabolic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia leading to atherosclerosis.

Given the utility of these devices in the field, we investigated the feasibility and safety of using the ID NOW and Sofia assays in the public health response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and in future public health emergencies. METHODS: A combination of utilization and contamination testing in addition to a review of instrument workflows was conducted. RESULTS: Utilization testing demonstrated that both tests are intuitive, associated with high user test success (85%) in our study, and could be implemented by staff after minimal training. Contamination tests revealed potential biosafety concerns due to the open design of the ID NOW instrument and the transfer mechanisms with the Sofia. When comparing the workflow of the ID NOW and the Sofia, we found that the ID NOW was more user-friendly and that the transfer technology reduces the chance of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The ID NOW, Sofia, and other emerging point-of-care tests should be used only after careful consideration of testing workflow, biosafety risk mitigations, and appropriate staff training.","Hahn, Megan; Olsen, Aaron; Stokes, Kindra; Fowler, Randal C; Gu, Rui; Semple-Lytch, Shellanne; DeVito, Andrea; Kurpiel, Philip; Hughes, Scott; Rakeman, Jennifer L",Am J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqab081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302455/,611

It involves the contribution both to a social good—herd immunity—and to one’s own well-being. It is informed by social influence, personal experience, education, and mass media. In our work, we investigate a situation in which individuals make their choice based on how social neighbourhood responded to previous epidemics. We do this by proposing a minimalistic model using components from game theory, network theory and the modelling of epidemic spreading, and opinion dynamics. Individuals can use the information about the neighbourhood in two ways—either they follow the majority or the best-performing neighbour. Furthermore, we let individuals learn which of these two decision-making strategies to follow from their experience. Our results show that the flexibility of individuals to choose how to integrate information from the neighbourhood increases the vaccine uptake and decreases the epidemic severity if the following conditions are fulfilled. First, the initial fraction of individuals who imitate the neighbourhood majority should be limited, and second, the memory of previous outbreaks should be sufficiently long. These results have implications for the acceptance of novel vaccines and raising awareness about vaccination, while also pointing to promising future research directions.","Miyoshi, Soya; Jusup, Marko; Holme, Petter",J Comput Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615019/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-021-00105-z,611

However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present study, we explored the impact of SARS-COV-2 infection on the olfactory system in golden Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs. We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored 14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID-19 patient is therefore likely to be linked to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.","Bryche, Bertrand; St Albin, Audrey; Murri, Severine; Lacôte, Sandra; Pulido, Coralie; Gouilh, Meriadeg Ar; Lesellier, Sandrine; Servat, Alexandre; Wasniewski, Marine; Picard-Meyer, Evelyne; Monchatre-Leroy, Elodie; Volmer, Romain; Rampin, Olivier; Le Goffic, Ronan; Marianneau, Philippe; Meunier, Nicolas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.151704,611

Multiple cytokines have been implicated in CRS, but levels of tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (TNFSF14) (LIGHT) have not been previously measured in this setting. In this study, we observed significantly elevated serum LIGHT levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared to healthy age- and gender-matched control patients. The assay detected bioavailable LIGHT unbound to the inhibitor Decoy receptor-3 (DcR3). Bioavailable LIGHT levels were elevated in patients both on and off ventilatory support, with a trend toward higher levels in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In hospitalized patients over the age of 60, who exhibited a mortality rate of 82%, LIGHT levels were significantly higher (P = 0.0209) in those who died than in survivors. As previously reported, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were also elevated in these patients, with significantly (P = 0.0076) higher levels observed in patients who died than in survivors, paralleling the LIGHT levels. Although attempts to block IL-6 binding to its receptor have shown limited success in COVID-19 CRS, neutralization of LIGHT may prove to be more effective owing to its more central role in regulating antiviral immune responses. The findings presented here demonstrate that LIGHT is a cytokine which may play an important role in COVID-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and CRS and suggest that LIGHT neutralization may be beneficial to COVID-19 patients.","Perlin, David S.; Zafir-Lavie, Inbal; Roadcap, Lori; Raines, Shane; Ware, Carl F.; Neil, Garry A.",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00699-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817460/,611

The XXX decided not to interrupt its service to all the visually impaired children and created a Distance Support Project. It was an online process covering all aspects of support for the children and involving audio-video calls, videos and tailored-made multisensory material created specifically for each child. A questionnaire, carried out after the 5-month project duration, was created to collect feedback from parents and professionals to understand the impact this project had on everyone involved. Overall both parents and professionals indicated high levels of satisfaction, but in a significant number of questions parents reported consistently higher levels of satisfaction. (p-value <0.001). It was shown that parents felt reassured at this otherwise very difficult time because their children were able to continue their treatment, even if in a very different way. This fact encourages us to consider enriching our existing programmes of support and care, integrating this online approach when necessary. At the same time, it seems clear that the responses of the professionals indicate their belief that the benefits of the traditional ways of working remain of unquestionable importance for children with sight deprivation.","Battistin, Tiziana; Mercuriali, Elena; Zanardo, Vincenzo; Gregori, Dario; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Nasato, Laura; Reffo, Maria Eleonora",Res Dev Disabil,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422220302481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33271446/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891422220302481; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103816,611

METHODS: The proportion of COVID‐19‐related deaths occurring in people with dementia and the clinical characteristics of deceased individuals according to their dementia status were explored by considering the medical charts of a representative sample of patients deceased in Italian hospitals (n = 2621). RESULTS: A total of 415 individuals with dementia were identified in the study population, accounting for 15.8% of overall COVID‐19‐related deaths. Patients with dementia less frequently presented with cough, had lower chance of receiving supportive therapies and intensive care approaches, and showed a faster clinical worsening as compared with individuals with intact cognition.

However, the distribution, genetic diversity, and zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium, Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Giardia duodenalis in wildlife are poorly understood. Here, we conducted the first molecular epidemiological investigation of these three pathogens in wildlife in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China. Genomic DNAs were derived from 182 individual fecal samples from wildlife and then subjected to a nested polymerase chain reaction–based sequencing approach for detection and characterization. Altogether, 3 (1.6%), 21 (11.5%), and 48 (26.4%) specimens tested positive for Cryptosporidium species, E. bieneusi, and G. duodenalis, respectively. Sequence analyses revealed five known (BEB6, D, MJ13, SC02, and type IV) and two novel (designated SH_ch1 and SH_deer1) genotypes of E. bieneusi. Phylogenetically, novel E. bieneusi genotype SH_deer1 fell into group 6, and the other genotypes were assigned to group 1 with zoonotic potential. Three novel Cryptosporidium genotypes (Cryptosporidium avian genotype V-like and C. galli-like 1 and 2) were identified, C. galli-like 1 and 2 formed a clade that was distinct from Cryptosporidium species. The genetic distinctiveness of these two novel genotypes suggests that they represent a new species of Cryptosporidium. Zoonotic assemblage A (n = 36) and host-adapted assemblages C (n = 1) and E (n = 7) of G. duodenalis were characterized. The overall results suggest that wildlife act as host reservoirs carrying zoonotic E. bieneusi and G. duodenalis, potentially enabling transmission from wildlife to humans and other animals.","Zhang, Yan; Mi, Rongsheng; Yang, Lijuan; Gong, Haiyan; Xu, Chunzhong; Feng, Yongqi; Chen, Xinsheng; Huang, Yan; Han, Xiangan; Chen, Zhaoguo",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447356/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.692837,611
655121,Shut and re-open: the role of schools in the spread of COVID-19 in Europe,2020-06-26,"The use of electronic cigarettes among the young adult and adolescent population has increased over the past decade. Vaping is the process of inhaling an aerosol that is produced by heating a liquid or wax containing substances, such as nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol), flavoring, and additives (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol) using an e-cigarette. A multistate epidemic associated with vaping prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue an official health advisory on e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with no specific diagnostic test. We present a case of EVALI before the COVID-19 pandemic time in a 23-year-old immunocompetent male student with an eight-year history of vaping. He presented to the emergency department with fever, shortness of breath, tachypnea, nausea, and diarrhea. The patient had no past medical history. The patient denied illicit drug abuse or known drug allergies. The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of sepsis and pneumonia. The patient’s urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids with a history of vaping. Community-acquired pneumonia due to Legionella, Pneumococcal, Mycoplasma bacteria was ruled out. Influenza A/B, Parainfluenza, Rhino, and Adenoviruses were negative. A computed tomographyscan of the chest showed bilateral infiltrates. He was treated with high dose steroids, empiric antibiotics, high flow oxygen and managed in ICU for seven days. The patient was discharged on tapering doses of steroid and counseled to quit vaping. EVALI outbreak is strongly linked to vitamin E acetate in vaping products. EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion with a history of vaping and responds well to steroids.","Adhikari, Ramesh; Koritala, Thoyaja; Gotur, Raghavender; Malayala, Srikrishna V; Jain, Nitesh K",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815967/,611

The literature suggests that cancer patients are more prone to be affected by COVID-19 because cancer suppresses the immune system and such patients usually present poor results. The objective of this study is to present all clinical, laboratory, and demographic characteristics of COVID-19 patients with solid tumors. Methodology This study was conducted at the Dow University of Health Sciences for a period of six months from April 2020 to September 2020. In this study, we included a total of 1,519 confirmed patients diagnosed with solid tumors via polymerase chain reaction. The mortality timeline within 30 days of contracting the virus was considered, and the median age of the included individuals was 61 years, with a range of 20-95 years. Of the patients included in the study, 49.4% (750) were men; moreover, 3.15% of our study population had prostate cancer, 10.20% had colorectal cancer, 2.76% had breast cancer, and 10.46% had lung cancer. Of the patients, 25.93% presented with at least one comorbidity. For 73% of the patients, at least one direct therapy for COVID-19 was included in the treatment; 56.6% of the patients were hospitalized, and 11.32% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Results The mortality rate was 4.74% in the first 30 days after diagnosis, where 72 patients died. The findings of the first multi-variation model showed that males at older ages who were diabetic and going through cytotoxic therapy were prone to die within the first 30 days. However, the 30-day mortality rate was lower in patients diagnosed with prostate and breast cancer. The second set incorporated laboratory factors, where we found that higher values of leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia were correlated with higher rates of mortality within 30 days. Conclusions We conclude that there is a higher mortality rate of COVID-19 in patients with solid tumors than in the general population. However, it was found to be lower in the Pakistani population compared with the Chinese and Western populations. Intensive care can decrease mortality rates in COVID-19 and cancer patients.","Farooque, Imran; Farooque, Umar; Karimi, Sundas; Syed, Muhammad Usman Shah; Nadeem, Zubia; Zulfiqar, Arif; Mustafa, Sufyan; Farooque, Rizwan; Sultan, Ayyaz A; Hassan, Syed Adeel",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262803/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15452,611

To investigate whether rates of depression increased in caregivers during COVID-19 and whether the unintended consequences of health protective measures, i.e., social isolation, exacerbated this risk. Another aim was to see if caregivers accessed any online/phone psychological support during COVID. Method: Data (1349 caregivers; 7527 non-caregivers) was extracted from Understanding Society, UK population level dataset. The General Health Questionnaire cut-off scores identifying those with and without depression were our primary outcome. Results: After adjustment for confounding caregivers had a higher risk of having depression compared with non-caregivers, Odds ratio (OR) = 1.22 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.05-1.40)), p=.008 evidenced by higher levels of depression pre-COVID-19 (16.7% vs 12.1%) and during COVID-19 (21.6% vs 17.9%), respectively. Further, higher levels of loneliness increased the risk of depression almost 4-fold risk in caregivers, OR = 3.85 (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.08-4.85)), p<.001), while access to therapy attenuated the risk (47%. While 60% of caregivers with depression reported not accessing any therapeutic support (e.g., online or face to face) during COVID-19. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a negative impact on family caregivers mental health with loneliness a significant contributor to caregivers depression. However, despite these detriments in mental health, the majority of caregivers do not access any online or phone psychiatric support. Reducing feelings of isolation therefore provides an opportunity for psychiatric services and health care professionals to support at-risk caregivers.","Gallagher, S.; Wetherell, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.15.20131532v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.20131532,611
656264,An Innovative Model for Providing Dermatology Services within Primary Care,2020-10-15,"Viral respiratory infections are a common cause of severe disease, especially in infants, people who are immunocompromised, and in the elderly. Neutrophils, an important innate immune cell, infiltrate the lungs rapidly after an inflammatory insult. The most well-characterized effector mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to host defense are largely extracellular and the involvement of neutrophils in protection from numerous bacterial and fungal infections is well established. However, the role of neutrophils in responses to viruses, which replicate intracellularly, has been less studied. It remains unclear whether and, by which underlying immunological mechanisms, neutrophils contribute to viral control or confer protection against an intracellular pathogen. Furthermore, neutrophils need to be tightly regulated to avoid bystander damage to host tissues. This is especially relevant in the lung where damage to delicate alveolar structures can compromise gas exchange with life-threatening consequences. It is inherently less clear how neutrophils can contribute to host immunity to viruses without causing immunopathology and/or exacerbating disease severity. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current understanding of how neutrophils in the lung direct immune responses to viruses, control viral replication and spread, and cause pathology during respiratory viral infections.","Johansson, Cecilia; Kirsebom, Freja C.

The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is highly antigenic and associated with several host-cell interactions. Our previous studies using nuclear magnetic resonance revealed the domain organization of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. RNA has been shown to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD), although recently the C-terminal half of the protein has also been implicated in RNA binding. Here, we report that the C-terminal domain (CTD), spanning residues 248–365 (NP248-365), had stronger nucleic acid-binding activity than the NTD. To determine the molecular basis of this activity, we have also solved the crystal structure of the NP248-365 region. Residues 248–280 form a positively charged groove similar to that found in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, the positively charged surface area is larger in the SARS-CoV construct than in the IBV. Interactions between residues 248–280 and the rest of the molecule also stabilize the formation of an octamer in the asymmetric unit. Packing of the octamers in the crystal forms two parallel, basic helical grooves, which may be oligonucleotide attachment sites, and suggests a mechanism for helical RNA packaging in the virus.","Chen, Chun-Yuan; Chang, Chung-ke; Chang, Yi-Wei; Sue, Shih-Che; Bai, Hsin-I; Riang, Lilianty; Hsiao, Chwan-Deng; Huang, Tai-huang",J Mol Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607002616; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607002616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17379242/,611

This part of the S gene is known to show considerable variation between porcine, canine and feline coronaviruses and is completely deleted from porcine respiratory coronaviruses. The discrimination achieved by nucleotide sequence analysis was compared with that obtained by monoclonal antibody typing. The viruses could be split into several clusters, and recent isolates of TGEV from England, The Netherlands and Belgium showed the greatest differences compared to earlier reference types. However, not all viruses with unique isolation histories were distinct, suggesting either genetic stability over many years, laboratory cross-contaminations or repeated introductions of similar viruses into the field. Firm conclusions on evolutionary trends cannot be drawn without obtaining a larger number of isolates, preferably from outbreaks with known epidemiological links. The sequences of some field isolates from the 1980s contained both nucleotide deletions and insertions. The latter included a short sequence of fourteen nucleotides with identity to a region of the TGEV polymerase gene.","Paton, D.; Lowings, P.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9672630/,611

Without triage, there is a risk that patients will be admitted to the ICU in the sequence that they present, disadvantaging those who either present later or have poorer access to healthcare. Moreover, if the patients with the best prognosis are not allocated life support, there is the possibility that overall mortality will increase. Before formulating criteria, principles such as maximizing lives saved and fairness ought to have been agreed upon to guide decision-making. The triage process is subdivided into three parts, i.e., having explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria for ICU admission, prioritization of patients for allocation to available beds, and periodic reassessment of all patients already admitted to the ICU. Multi-dimensional criteria offer more holistic prognostication than only using age cutoffs. Appointed triage officers should also be enabled to make data-driven decisions. However, the process does not merely end with an allocation decision being made. Any decision has to be sensitively and transparently communicated to the patient and family. With infection control measures, there are challenges in managing communication and the psychosocial distress of dying alone. Therefore, explicit video call protocols and social services expertise will be necessary to mitigate these challenges. Besides symptom management and psychosocial management, supportive care teams play an integral role in coordination of complex cases.

This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on Internet addiction (IA) prevalence and analyzed the correlated factors during quarantine and pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was generated, comprising of a sociodemographic section, Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (KDAI), Symptoms Checklist-90, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The hyperlink was disseminated through social media, companies, and universities. Overall, 4,734 adults, (mean age 31.84 ± 7.73 years old and 55.2% males) representing all 34 provinces of Indonesia, gave valid responses. RESULTS: Point prevalence of IA during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.4% in Indonesian adults. Online duration increased by 52% compared to before the pandemic. Physical distancing was not established as a risk of IA. Increased daily online duration, specific motivations, types of application, and having confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases within the household were predictive of IA. All subscales of SCL-90 and PSQI were higher in the group with positive/suspect cases of COVID-19 within households and were correlated to higher scores of IA. DISCUSSION: Physical distancing alone was not associated with an increased risk of IA. The prevalence of IA during COVID-19 was higher than the previously proposed rate among Indonesian adults, which might be related to digital activities associated with COVID-19 and the popularity of virtual socializing. Furthermore, psychopathologies and sleep disruptions were related to IA occurrences and especially prevalent in groups with proximity to COVID-19. Fear of COVID-19 contraction and rampant misinformation of COVID-19 probably contributed to these factors, which potentially harbor long-term consequences. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrated a high point prevalence of IA and identified several preventable factors predictive of IA during home-quarantine and COVID-19, especially in adults with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases within the household. However, physical distancing did not increase the odds of IA.

Basilar artery occlusion is a type of posterior circulation stroke associated with a high risk of disability and mortality. Despite its proven efficacy in ischaemic stroke more generally, alteplase only achieves rapid reperfusion in ~4% of basilar artery occlusion patients. Tenecteplase is a genetically modified variant of alteplase with greater fibrin specificity and longer half-life than alteplase, which can be administered by intravenous bolus. The single-bolus administration of tenecteplase vs. an hour-long alteplase infusion is a major practical advantage, particularly in “drip and ship” patients with basilar artery occlusion who are being transported between hospitals. Other practical advantages include its reduced cost compared to alteplase. The EXTEND-IA TNK trial demonstrated that tenecteplase led to higher reperfusion rates prior to endovascular therapy (22 vs. 10%, non-inferiority p = 0.002, superiority p = 0.03) and improved functional outcomes (ordinal analysis of the modified Rankin Scale, common odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.0–2.8, p = 0.04) compared with alteplase in large-vessel occlusion ischaemic strokes.

The outbreaks depend on different social and demographic factors based on human mobility structured with the help of mathematical models for vector-borne disease transmission. In Dec 2019, an infectious disease is known as “coronavirus” (officially declared as COVID-19 by WHO) emerged in Wuhan (Capital city of Hubei, China) and spread quickly to all over the china with over 50,000 cases including more than 1000 death within a short period of one month. Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. Objectives: The main objective of this proposed hybrid computing technique are as follows: The innovative design of the NAR-RBFs neural network paradigm is designed to construct the SITR epidemic differential equation (DE) model to ascertain the different features of the spread of COVID-19. The new set of transformations is introduced for nonlinear input to achieve with a higher level of accuracy, stability, and convergence analysis. Methods: Multimodal modeling of robust dynamics system is a complex, challenging and fast growing area of the research. In this research bimodal spread of COVID-19 is investigated with hybrid model based on nonlinear autoregressive with radial base function (NAR-RBFs) neural network for SITR model. Chaotic and stochastic data of the pandemic. A new class of transformation is presented for the system of ordinary differential equation (ODE) for fast convergence and improvement of desired accuracy level. The proposed transformations convert local optimum values to global values before implementation of bimodal paradigm. Results: This suggested NAR-RBFs model is investigated for the bi-module nature of SITR model with additional feature of fragility in modeling of stochastic variation ability for different cases and scenarios with constraints variation. Best agreement of the proposed bimodal paradigm with outstanding numerical solver is confirmed based on statistical results calculated from MSE, RMSE and MAPE with accuracy level based on mean square error up to 1E-25, which further validates the stability and consistence of bimodal proposed model. Conclusions: This computational technique is shown extraordinary results in terms of accuracy and convergence. The outcomes of this study will be useful in forecasting the progression of COVID-19, the influence of several deciding parameters overspread of COVID-19 and can help for planning, monitoring as well as preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Shoaib, Muhammad; Raja, Muhammad Asif Zahoor; Sabir, Muhammad Touseef; Bukhari, Ayaz Hussain; Alrabaiah, Hussam; Shah, Zahir; Kumam, Poom; Islam, Saeed",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.105973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33610034/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260721000481; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721000481?v=s5,611

The race is on globally to repurpose drugs for COVID-19 and develop a safe and effective vaccine against the disease. There is an urgent need to search for effective remedies against COVID-19 from the rich and extensive flora of Africa and the world. A literature search was conducted to obtain information on drugs with the potential for effectiveness in the treatment of COVID-19 based mostly on outcomes of preclinical studies and a few clinical investigations. This was considered important to this perspective as some of the identified mechanisms of action may be related to potential anti-COVID-19 actions of phytomedicines. The findings from the literature search were also used to establish the need for exploration of phytomedicines in the fight against COVID-19. This perspective identifies the need to preserve the rich tradition of herbal medicine in Africa, repositioning it by inculcating all aspects of discovery, development, and chemical evaluation of pharmaceuticals from medicinal plants for effective management of prevalent diseases. The identified mechanisms of action of current drugs under consideration for the treatment of COVID-19 include preventing fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with human cells; decrease acidity in endosomes, cell membrane-derived vesicles for transportation of the virus within the host cell and within which the virus can replicate; and blockade of the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Phytomedicines may possibly elicit either one or a combination of these effects. The case for the exploration of phytomedicines against COVID-19 is strengthened by the emergence of a number of conventional drugs from medicinal plants and the emergence of botanicals with proven efficacy for some medical conditions. Caution against indiscriminate use of medicinal plants in the guise of treating COVID-19 has been highlighted and the need for reliable preclinical and clinical studies.","Akindele, Abidemi J.; Agunbiade, Foluso O.; Sofidiya, Margaret O.; Awodele, Olufunsho; Sowemimo, Abimbola; Ade-Ademilua, Omobolanle; Akinleye, Moshood O.; Ishola, Ismail O.; Orabueze, Ifeoma; Salu, Olumuyiwa B.; Oreagba, Ibrahim A.; Asekun, Olayinka T.; Odukoya, Olukemi",Nat Prod Commun,https://doi.org/10.1177/1934578x20945086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191921/,611

Recent studies have shown that high doses of repeated task-specific practice can be effective at improving upper-limb function at the chronic stage. Providing at-home telerehabilitation services with therapist supervision may allow higher dose interventions targeted to this population. Additionally, muscle biofeedback to train patients to avoid unwanted simultaneous activation of antagonist muscles (co-contractions) may be incorporated into telerehabilitation technologies to improve motor control. Here, we present the development and feasibility of a low-cost, portable, telerehabilitation biofeedback system called Tele-REINVENT. We describe our modular electromyography acquisition, processing, and feedback algorithms to train differentiated muscle control during at-home therapist-guided sessions. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of low-cost sensors for our training task with two healthy individuals. Finally, we present the results of a case study with a stroke survivor who used the system for 40 sessions over 10 weeks of training. In line with our previous research, our results suggest that using low-cost sensors provides similar results to those using research-grade sensors for low forces during an isometric task. Our preliminary case study data with one patient with stroke also suggest that our system is feasible, safe, and enjoyable to use during 10 weeks of biofeedback training, and that improvements in differentiated muscle activity during volitional movement attempt may be induced during a 10-week period. Our data provide support for using low-cost technology for individuated muscle training to reduce unintended coactivation during supervised and unsupervised home-based telerehabilitation for clinical populations, and suggest this approach is safe and feasible.

670009,Communication with Healthcare Workers Regarding Healthcare Associated Exposure to Coronavirus 2019: A Checklist to Facilitate Disclosure,2020-05-07,"Background. The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, uses the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), a physiological inhibitor of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), as a cellular receptor to infect cells. Since the RAAS can induce and modulate pro-inflammatory responses, it could play a key role in the pathophysiology of Covid-19. Thus, we aimed to determine the levels of plasma renin and aldosterone as indicators of RAAS activation in a series of consecutively admitted patients for Covid-19 in our clinic. Methods. Plasma renin and aldosterone levels were measured, among the miscellaneous investigations needed for Covid-19 management, early after admission in our clinic. Disease severity was assessed using a seven-category ordinal scale. Primary outcome of interest was the severity of patients’ clinical courses. Results. Forty-four patients were included. At inclusion, 12 patients had mild clinical status, 25 moderate clinical status and 7 severe clinical status. In univariate analyses, aldosterone and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at inclusion were significantly higher in patients with severe clinical course as compared to those with mild or moderate course (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). In multivariate analyses, only aldosterone and CRP levels remained positively associated with severity. We also observed a positive significant correlation between aldosterone and CRP levels among patients with an aldosterone level greater than 102.5 pmol/L. Conclusions. Both plasmatic aldosterone and CRP levels at inclusion are associated with the clinical course of Covid-19.

The Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery, with its effects extending to delivery of HBOT. During the pandemic, paediatric patients in our geographic region who were referred for HBOT faced challenges as centres temporarily closed or were unprepared to treat younger patients. Our monoplace HBOT centre modified existing practices to allow for treatment of these patients. This study aims to outline the steps necessary to adapting a pre-existing HBOT centre for the safe treatment of paediatric patients. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed to identify patients 18 years of age or younger referred for HBOT during 2020. Patient characteristics, referral indications and HBOT complications were collected. Changes implemented to the HBOT centre to accommodate the treatment of paediatric patients were documented. RESULTS: A total of seven paediatric patients were evaluated for HBOT and six were treated. The mean patient age was four years (range: 1-11 years). Referral diagnoses included sudden sensorineural hearing loss, skin flap or graft compromise, and radiation-induced soft tissue necrosis. All patients tolerated HBOT treatment in monoplace chambers without significant complications noted. Enhancements made to our clinical practice to facilitate the safe and effective treatment of paediatric patients included ensuring the availability of acceptable garments for paediatric patients, maintaining uninterrupted patient grounding (in relation to fire safety), and enhancing social support for anxiety reduction.

Cytokine profiles observed in COVID-19 patients have revealed increased levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α and increased NF-κB pathway activity. Recent evidence has shown that the upregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway is associated with inflammation, resulting in a cytokine storm in ARDS (acute respire distress syndrome) and especially in COVID-19 patients. Several studies have shown that the WNT/β-catenin pathway interacts with PPARγ in an opposing interplay in numerous diseases. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the interesting role of PPARγ agonists as modulators of inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs through the targeting of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV2 infection presents a decrease in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated with the upregulation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. SARS-Cov2 may invade human organs besides the lungs through the expression of ACE2. Evidence has highlighted the fact that PPARγ agonists can increase ACE2 expression, suggesting a possible role for PPARγ agonists in the treatment of COVID-19.

RESULTS: we compared 55 cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with 69 asymptomatic PLWHIV negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR and/or serology. There was no significant difference between SARS‐CoV‐2 positive or negative patients for age distribution, gender, time with HIV infection, nadir CD4‐cell counts, type and number of co‐morbidities, current CD4 and CD8 counts and type of anti‐HIV therapy. Positive patients presented with a median of 3 symptoms (IQR 1‐3). Most common symptoms were fever (76%), dyspnoea (35%), anosmia (29%) non‐productive cough (27%), fatigue 22%) and ageusia (20%). Ten patients (18%) were completely asymptomatic. Four (7.2%) subjects died of COVID‐19. Factors significantly (P<0.05) associated with death included age and number of co‐morbidities, while time from HIV infection and lower current CD4 counts were significant only in univariate analysis.

The most prevalent viruses detected during exacerbations are the rhinoviruses. Despite the burden of disease associated with exacerbations, little is known about the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations of airway diseases. Exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation in patients with both asthma and COPD, but many questions remain unanswered regarding the key inflammatory cells and mediators involved.

678483,Toward a Better Understanding of the Intention to Use mHealth Apps: Exploratory Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients with Covid-19 experience symptoms beyond 3–4 weeks. Patients call this “long Covid”. We sought to document such patients’ lived experience, including accessing and receiving healthcare and ideas for improving services. METHODS: We held 55 individual interviews and 8 focus groups (n = 59) with people recruited from UK-based long Covid patient support groups, social media and snowballing. We restricted some focus groups to health professionals since they had already self-organised into online communities. Participants were invited to tell their stories and comment on others’ stories. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded using NVIVO. Analysis incorporated sociological theories of illness, healing, peer support, clinical relationships, access, and service redesign. RESULTS: Of 114 participants aged 27–73 years, 80 were female. Eighty-four were White British, 13 Asian, 8 White Other, 5 Black, and 4 mixed ethnicity. Thirty-two were doctors and 19 other health professionals. Thirty-one had attended hospital, of whom 8 had been admitted. Analysis revealed a confusing illness with many, varied and often relapsing-remitting symptoms and uncertain prognosis; a heavy sense of loss and stigma; difficulty accessing and navigating services; difficulty being taken seriously and achieving a diagnosis; disjointed and siloed care (including inability to access specialist services); variation in standards (e.g. inconsistent criteria for seeing, investigating and referring patients); variable quality of the therapeutic relationship (some participants felt well supported while others felt “fobbed off”); and possible critical events (e.g. deterioration after being unable to access services). Emotionally significant aspects of participants’ experiences informed ideas for improving services. CONCLUSION: Suggested quality principles for a long Covid service include ensuring access to care, reducing burden of illness, taking clinical responsibility and providing continuity of care, multi-disciplinary rehabilitation, evidence-based investigation and management, and further development of the knowledge base and clinical services.

SARS-CoV-2 shares almost 80% of the genome with SARS-CoV-1 and 50% with MERS-CoV. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 proteins share a high degree of homology (approximately 95%) with SARS-CoV-1 proteins. Hence, the mechanisms of SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 infection are similar and occur via binding to ACE2 protein, which is widely distributed in the human body, with a predominant expression in endocrine tissues including testis, thyroid, adrenal and pituitary. PURPOSE: On the basis of expression pattern of the ACE2 protein among different tissues, similarity between SARS-Cov-1 and SARS-Cov-2 and the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease, we aimed at discussing, after almost one-year pandemic, about the relationships between COVID-19 infection and the endocrine system. First, we discussed the potential effect of hormones on the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection; second, we examined the evidences regarding the effect of COVID-19 on the endocrine system. When data were available, a comparative discussion between SARS and COVID-19 effects was also performed. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search within Pubmed was performed. This review has been conducted according to the PRISMA statements. RESULTS: Among 450, 100 articles were selected. Tissue and vascular damages have been shown on thyroid, adrenal, testis and pituitary glands, with multiple alterations of endocrine function. CONCLUSION: Hormones may affect patient susceptibility to COVID-19 infection but evidences regarding therapeutic implication of these findings are still missing. SARS and COVID-19 may affect endocrine glands and their dense vascularization, impairing endocrine system function. A possible damage of endocrine system in COVID-19 patients should be investigated in both COVID-19 acute phase and recovery to identify both early and late endocrine complications that may be important for patient’s prognosis and well-being after COVID-19 infection.","Piticchio, T.; Le Moli, R.; Tumino, D.; Frasca, F.",J Endocrinol Invest,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-020-01486-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583003/,611
679253,"Cognitive Impairment and Associated Factors Among Adult Hypothyroid Patients in Referral Hospitals, Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study",2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection causes an acute enteric tract infectious disease characterized by vomiting, anorexia, dehydration, weight loss and high mortality in neonatal piglets. During PEDV infection, the spike protein (S) is a major virion structural protein interacting with receptors and inducing neutralizing antibodies. However, the neutralizing B-cell epitopes within PEDV S protein have not been well studied. METHODS: To accurately identify the important immunodominant region of S1, the purified truncated S1 proteins (SA, SB, SC, SD and SE) were used to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare polyclonal antibodies. The antisera titers were determined by indirect ELISA, western blot and IFA after four immunizations to find the important immunodominant region of S1, and then purified the immunodominant region of S1 protein and immunized mice to generate the special antibodies, and then used recombinant peptides to determine the B-cell epitopes of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Five antisera of recombinant proteins of the spike protein region of PEDV were generated and we found that only the polyclonal antibody against part of the S1 region (signed as SE protein, residues 666–789) could recognize the native PEDV. Purified SE protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice and generate mAb 2E10. Pepscan of the SE protein demonstrated that SE16 ((722)SSTFNSTREL(731)) is the minimal linear epitope required for reactivity with the mAb 2E10. Further investigation indicated that the epitope SE16 was localized on the surface of PEDV S protein in the 3D structure. CONCLUSIONS: A mAb 2E10 that is specifically bound to PEDV was generated and identified a specific linear B-cell epitope (SE16, (722)SSTFNSTREL(731)) of the mAb. The epitope region of PEDV S1 localized in the different regions in comparison with the earlier identified epitopes. These findings enhance the understanding of the PEDV spike protein structure for vaccine design and provide a potential use for developing diagnostic methods to detect PEDV.","Kong, Ning; Meng, Qiong; Jiao, Yajuan; Wu, Yongguang; Zuo, Yewen; Wang, Hua; Sun, Dage; Dong, Sujie; Zhai, Huanjie; Tong, Wu; Zheng, Hao; Yu, Hai; Tong, Guangzhi; Xu, Yongjie; Shan, Tongling",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01305-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245493/,611

It affected almost every age group all over the world with a disease named COVID-19, declared as a global pandemic by WHO in early 2020. Due to the high transmission and moderate mortality rate of this virus, it is also regarded as the panic-zone virus. This potentially deadly virus has pointed up the significance of COVID-19 research. Due to the rapid transmission of COVID-19, early detection is very crucial. Presently, there are different conventional techniques are available for coronavirus detection like CT-scan, PCR, Sequencing, CRISPR, ELISA, LFA, LAMP. The urgent need for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective detection and the requirement to cut off shortcomings of traditional detection methods, make scientists realize to advance new technologies. Biosensors are one of the reliable platforms for accurate, early diagnosis. In this article, we have pointed recent diagnosis approaches for COVID-19.

However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the ability to mutate and develop variants, which can modify epidemiological properties and the potentially also the effectiveness of vaccines. The widespread deployment of highly effective vaccines may rapidly exert selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus directed towards mutations that escape the vaccine induced immune response. This is particularly concerning whilst infection is widespread. By developing and analysing a mathematical model of two population groupings with differing vulnerability and contact rates, we explore the impact of the deployment of vaccine amongst the population on R, cases, disease abundance and vaccine escape pressure. The results from this model illustrate two insights (i) vaccination aimed at reducing prevalence could be more effective at reducing disease than directly vaccinating the vulnerable; (ii) the highest risk for vaccine escape can occur at intermediate levels of vaccination. This work demonstrates a key principle that the careful targeting of vaccines towards particular population groups could reduce disease as much as possible whilst limiting the risk of vaccine escape.","Gog, J.

Public health measures and private behaviour are based on reported numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Some argue that testing influences the confirmed number of infections. OBJECTIVES/METHODS. Do time series on reported infections and the number of tests allow one to draw conclusions about actual infection numbers? A SIR model is presented where the true numbers of susceptible, infectious and removed individuals are unobserved. Testing is also modelled. RESULTS. Official confirmed infection numbers are likely to be biased and cannot be compared over time. The bias occurs because of different reasons for testing (e.g. by symptoms, representative or testing travellers). The paper illustrates the bias and works out the effect of the number of tests on the number of reported cases. The paper also shows that the positive rate (the ratio of positive tests to the total number of tests) is uninformative in the presence of non-representative testing. CONCLUSIONS. A severity index for epidemics is proposed that is comparable over time. This index is based on Covid-19 cases and can be obtained if the reason for testing is known.","Waelde, K.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212431; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.20212431v1?rss=1,611

However, the molecule also has many other biological properties that are unrelated to the oncotic activity. The purpose of this review is to examine the hemodynamic and systemic effects of albumin administration in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Besides plasma expansion, albumin appears to act against inflammation, facilitate immunocompetence, and improve cardiac and endothelial function, thus antagonizing critical steps in the pathophysiological cascade underlying decompensated cirrhosis. SUMMARY: Increasing knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, as well the pleiotropic properties of the molecule, provides the rationale for considering albumin as a multi-target disease-modifying agent in decompensated cirrhosis. Both oncotic and non-oncotic properties likely concur with the clinical benefits of long-term albumin administration recently demonstrated in these patients.","Tufoni, Manuel; Baldassarre, Maurizio; Zaccherini, Giacomo; Antognoli, Agnese; Caraceni, Paolo",Curr Hepatol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837825/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11901-020-00521-1,611

Association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with defensins has not been investigated till date. In this study, we have investigated the expression of defensin genes in the buccal cavity during COVID-19 infection. Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal swab samples collected for screening SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed for the expression of major defensin genes by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR. 40 SARS-CoV-2 infected positive and 40 negative swab samples were selected for the study. Based on the RT-PCR analysis involving gene specific primer for defensin genes, 10 defensin genes were found to be expressed in the Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal cavity. Six defensin genes were further found to be significantly downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients as against the control, negative samples based on differential expression analysis. The genes significantly downregulated were defensin beta 4A, 4B, 106B, 107B, 103A and defensin alpha 1B. Downregulation of several defensin genes suggests that innate immunity provided by defensins is or may be compromised in SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in progression of the disease caused by the virus.

688527,"The psychological effects of COVID-19 on frontline healthcare workers and how they are coping: a web-based, cross-sectional study from Pakistan",2020-06-05,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Fellow Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Tocilizumab is a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody and inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptors, associated with Th17 and Th22 cell differentiation which is critical for anti-mycobacterial activity. It is commonly used in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, tocilizumab has been widely used in severe COVID-19 infection with elevated markers of systemic inflammation. We report a case of active tuberculosis after the use of tocilizumab for COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE PRESENTATION: An 80-year-old Asian female with hypertension, coronary artery disease presented to the emergency department(ED) due to a one-day duration of fever, cough, and altered mental status. About three months prior to presentation, she had COVID-19 pneumonia requiring prolong hospitalization which was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome. She received tocilizumab, remdesivir, steroids and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 infection. Following the hospital stay, she was discharged to a long-term acute care facility, and then went home. She is originally from China and moved to the United States 50 years ago. In the ED she was febrile (100.4°F) and hypoxemic, subsequently placed on 4L of nasal cannula. The laboratory data was remarkable for leukocytosis and lactic acidosis. The chest radiograph showed bilateral reticular nodular patchy opacities. The patient was admitted and empiric antibiotics were started for possible pneumonia. Despite this treatment, her respiratory status deteriorated and she was intubated on day 4, with CT chest (figure1) revealing innumerable bilateral micronodules with centrilobular distribution and tree-in-bud opacities. There were also 2 large cavitary lesions in the right upper lobe. The sputum specimen was sent, which returned positive for Acid-Fast Bacillus. In addition, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR on sputum was positive. Therefore, the first-line anti-tuberculosis agents including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex was isolated on sputum 3 weeks later. DISCUSSION: The data from clinical trials indicate that the use of tocilizumab is associated with a very low or absent risk of tuberculosis reactivation. However, this case highlights the judicious use of tocilizumab in patients who are at high risk of exposure or reactivation such as immigrants from endemic regions, IV drug users and health care workers, etc. In our case, the patient had other factors including severe COVID-18 infection, use of steroids, prolonged hospital stay, and malnutrition which might compromise the immune system, and predispose to active tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that tests be performed to rule out latent tuberculosis in selected patients prior to tocilizumab use and monitor all patients for active tuberculosis during treatment.

With an increase in awareness regarding the virus, the behavior of general population has changed dramatically. As activities such as driving and hospital presentation patterns have changed, our study aimed to assess the differences in trauma case variables before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Trauma data for the period of March 1st-June 15th were compared for the years 2015-2019 (pre-COVID) and 2020 (COVID). The data were analyzed across the following categories: injury severity score, injury mechanism, motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) vs. other blunt injuries, alcohol involvement, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The median injury severity score pre-COVID and during COVID was 9, representing no change. There was no difference in overall distribution of mechanism of injury; however, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of MVCs pre-COVID (36.39%) vs. COVID (29.6%, P < .05). Alcohol was significantly more likely to be involved in trauma during COVID-19 (P < .05). The mean hospital stay increased from 3.87-5.4 days during COVID-19 (P < .05). DISCUSSION: We saw similar results to prior studies in terms of there being no change in trauma severity. Our observation that motor vehicle collisions have decreased is consistent with current data showing decreased use of motor vehicles during the pandemic. We also observed an increase in alcohol-related cases which are consistent with the reported changes in alcohol consumption since the pandemic began.","Devarakonda, Aditya K.; Wehrle, Chase J.; Chibane, Fairouz L.; Drevets, Peter D.; Fox, Elizabeth D.; Lawson, Andrew G.",Am Surg,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820973715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231483/,611

SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by utilizing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of an envelope homotrimeric spike (S) glycoprotein to interact with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We thoroughly studied the differences between the two RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 when they bind with ACE2 through molecular dynamics simulations. The peculiarities of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are obvious in several aspects such as fluctuation of the binding interface, distribution of binding free energy on residues of the receptor-binding motifs, and the dissociation process. Based on these peculiarities of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by simulations, we proposed a strategy of destroying the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 by employing enzymatic digestion. This unique strategy is promising for developing a skin-friendly, nontoxic, and convenient disinfectant to protect people from infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Cao, Yufei; Ge, Jun",Langmuir,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512172/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02911,611

Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were clinical and paraclinical data and meeting diagnostic criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Relevant neurological and cardiopulmonary morbidity was excluded. Results: The median age was 36.5, range 22-62, 29 patients were female and 13 male. At six months post acute COVID-19 all patients had fatigue (Chalder Fatigue Score median 25 of 33, range 14-32), the most frequent other symptoms were post exertional malaise (n=41), cognitive symptoms (n=40), headache (n=38), and muscle pain (n=35). Most patients were moderately to severely impaired in daily live with a median Bell disability score of 50 (range 15-90) of 100 (healthy) and Short Form 36 (SF36) physical function score of 63 (range 15-80) of 100. 19 of 42 patients fulfilled the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These patients reported more fatigue in the Chalder Fatigue Score (p=0.006), more stress intolerance (p=0.042) and more frequent and longer post exertional malaise (PEM) (p= 0.003), and hypersensitivity to noise (p=0.029), light (p=0.0143) and temperature (0.024) compared to patients not meeting ME/CFS criteria. Handgrip force was diminished in most patients compared to healthy control values, and lower in CCS/CFS compared to non-CFS CCS (Fmax1 p=0.085, Fmax2, p=0.050, Fmean1 p=0.043, Fmean2 p=0.034, mean of 10 repeat handgrips, 29 female patients). Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency was observed frequently (22% of all patients) and elevated IL-8 levels were found in 43% of patients. Conclusions: Chronic COVID-19 Syndrome at months 6 is a multisymptomatic frequently debilitating disease fulfilling diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS in about half of the patients in our study. Research in mechanisms and clinical trials are urgently needed.","Kedor, C.; Freitag, H.; Meyer-Arndt, L.-A.; Wittke, K.; Zoller, t.; Steinbeis, F.; Haffke, M.; Gordon, R.; Heidecker, B.; Volk, H.

689780,Editor's Introduction,2021,"CONTEXT: Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is a rare condition with potentially life-threatening consequences as acute adrenal insufficiency. Early adrenal axis testing, as well as directed imaging, is crucial for immediate diagnosis and treatment. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with coagulopathy and thromboembolic events. CASE DECRIPTION: A 66-years-old woman presented with acute COVID-19 infection and primary adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH). She had also a renal vein thrombosis. Her past medical history revealed primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS). 4 weeks after discharge she had no signs of COVID-19 infection and her PCR test for COVID-19 was negative, but she still needed glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. The combination of APLS and COVID-19 was probably responsible of the adrenal event as a ""two-hit"" mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection is associated with coagulopathy and thromboembolic events, including BAH. Adrenal insufficiency is life threatening, therefore we suggest to consider performing early adrenal axis testing for COVID-19 patients with clinical suspicion of adrenal insufficiency.","Frankel, Meir; Feldman, Itamar; Levine, Michal; Frank, Yigal; Bogot, Naama R; Benjaminov, Ofer; Kurd, Ramzi; Breuer, Gabriel S; Munter, Gabriel",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738040/,611
690695,Psychosocial and Behavioral Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Population: A Cross-Sectional Study Protocol,2021,"An epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) led to the identification of an associated coronavirus, SARS-CoV. This virus evades the host innate immune response in part through the expression of its non-structural protein (nsp) 1, which inhibits both host gene expression and virus- and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling. Thus, nsp1 is a promising target for drugs, as inhibition of nsp1 would make SARS-CoV more susceptible to the host antiviral defenses. To gain a better understanding of nsp1 mode of action, we generated and analyzed 38 mutants of the SARS-CoV nsp1, targeting 62 solvent exposed residues out of the 180 amino acid protein. From this work, we identified six classes of mutants that abolished, attenuated or increased nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression and/or antiviral signaling. Each class of mutants clustered on SARS-CoV nsp1 surface and suggested nsp1 interacts with distinct host factors to exert its inhibitory activities. Identification of the nsp1 residues critical for its activities and the pathways involved in these activities should help in the design of drugs targeting nsp1. Significantly, several point mutants increased the inhibitory activity of nsp1, suggesting that coronaviruses could evolve a greater ability to evade the host response through mutations of such residues.","Jauregui, Andrew R.; Savalia, Dhruti; Lowry, Virginia K.; Farrell, Cara M.; Wathelet, Marc G.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23658627/,611
690759,"How does COVID‐19 impact psoriasis practice, prescription patterns, and healthcare delivery for psoriasis patients? A cross‐sectional survey study",2021-04-03,"Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) are competency-based training programs aiming to strengthen the epidemiologic capacity of the public health workforce. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the advanced FETPs in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR) and ascertain whether the expected objectives of the programs are met. A descriptive study was conducted based on Kirkpatrick's model for evaluating training programs. Data were collected from FETP graduates and FETP technical advisers on the practices of FETP graduates, their engagement in key areas of field epidemiology, and their perceived skills and capacity to perform such activities. A total of 166 FETP graduates responded to the online survey. Almost two-thirds of FETP graduates reported that they are often engaged in managing public health surveillance systems (n = 119, 71.7%), analyzing the surveillance data (n = 116, 69.9%), training public health professionals (n = 113, 68.1%), investigations on and response to outbreaks (n = 109, 65.7%), and managing staff and resources (n = 106, 63.9%). However, only 28.3% reported that they are often engaged in writing scientific research articles. More than two-thirds of graduates reported that the FETP helped them to perform most of the field epidemiology activities and rate their skills as good. In conclusion, the FETP graduates in the EMR were well engaged in many field epidemiology activities including managing public health surveillance systems, surveillance data analysis, training public health professionals, and investigations on and response to outbreaks. Therefore, the FETPs should continue supporting the graduates to work toward strengthening surveillance systems and investigating outbreaks and to participate in regional and global efforts as part of the Global Health Security.","Al Nsour, Mohannad; Khader, Yousef; Bashier, Haitham; Alsoukhni, Majd",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368057/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.684174,611
