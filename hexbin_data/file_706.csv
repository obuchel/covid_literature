A reduced number of peripheral Treg cells and decreased suppressive function have been previously reported in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. However, the characteristic role of specific Treg cell subsets and their mechanisms in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma remain unclear. In this study, we examined the proportion of different Treg cell subsets in both healthy subjects and patients with allergic asthma using flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. The migration function of the cells was compared using cell sorting and Transwell experiments. Furthermore, two allergen-challenged mouse models and a cell transfer experiment were used to examine the role of these Treg subsets. We found that the proportion of CD25(+)Foxp3(+)CD127(-) Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with allergic asthma was lower than in those of healthy subjects. Furthermore, the circulating Treg cells expressed lower levels of CCR6 and IL-17 compared with healthy subjects. The chemokine from the airway mucosa, CCL20, was abundantly expressed, and Transwell experiments further proved that this chemokine promoted CCR6(+) Treg cell migration in vitro. A mouse model induced by house dust mite (HDM) revealed that the number of CCR6(+) Treg cells in the lung tissue increased remarkably. The incidence of allergic asthma may be related to an increase in Treg cells secreting IL-17 in the lung tissue. Recruited CCR6(+) Treg cells are likely to differentiate into Th17-like cells under the Th17 environment present in the lungs. IL-17 derived from Th17-like cells could be associated with the pathology of allergic asthma by promoting Th17 responses, thereby favoring HDM-induced asthma exacerbations.","Shen, Xiaokun; Zhang, Huiyun; Xie, Hua; Chen, Liping; Li, Shinan; Zheng, Junjuan; Chai, Ruonan; Wang, Zhao; Zang, Yanyan; He, Shaoheng",Front Immunol,706,5

The specific situation of two factors is primarily analyzed as follows: the supply and demand ratio of enterprise talents and the state of entrepreneurship in the development of new ventures. The results show that the potential demand of future enterprises for big data talents can be obtained by fitting prediction sequences. Based on the Backpropagation–Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model, the post modeling and prediction are carried out, and the coefficient 0.6235 is obtained by substituting the equation of Pearson's correlation coefficient. The analysis results suggest that the matching needs to be strengthened between the cultivation of innovative talents in universities and the demand trend of big data-related positions in enterprises. Moreover, there is a mismatch between the cultivation of innovative talents and the demand for innovative talents. Meanwhile, the mental health level of young entrepreneurs is concerned. The mental health status of young entrepreneurs is compared with the national norm data through the questionnaire survey and statistical data analysis. The results reveal that the mental health level of young entrepreneurs is significantly lower than that of the national norm, and the proportion of anxiety and depression is 29.4% and 27.5%, respectively. Considering the professional characteristics and competitive environment of young entrepreneurs, busy work and the multiple missions given by society to entrepreneurs are the major reasons for their pressure, and mental health problems are serious.","Yu, Xiao; Zhang, Baoge",Front Psychol,706,5

This process may be controlled by cellular receptors of α‐synuclein fibrils, one of which was proposed to be the LAG3 immune checkpoint molecule. Here, we analysed the expression pattern of LAG3 in human and mouse brains. Using a variety of methods and model systems, we found no evidence for LAG3 expression by neurons. While we confirmed that LAG3 interacts with α‐synuclein fibrils, the specificity of this interaction appears limited. Moreover, overexpression of LAG3 in cultured human neural cells did not cause any worsening of α‐synuclein pathology ex vivo. The overall survival of A53T α‐synuclein transgenic mice was unaffected by LAG3 depletion, and the seeded induction of α‐synuclein lesions in hippocampal slice cultures was unaffected by LAG3 knockout. These data suggest that the proposed role of LAG3 in the spreading of α‐synucleinopathies is not universally valid.","Emmenegger, Marc; De Cecco, Elena; Hruska‐Plochan, Marian; Eninger, Timo; Schneider, Matthias M; Barth, Melanie; Tantardini, Elena; de Rossi, Pierre; Bacioglu, Mehtap; Langston, Rebekah G; Kaganovich, Alice; Bengoa‐Vergniory, Nora; Gonzalez‐Guerra, Andrès; Avar, Merve; Heinzer, Daniel; Reimann, Regina; Häsler, Lisa M; Herling, Therese W; Matharu, Naunehal S; Landeck, Natalie; Luk, Kelvin; Melki, Ronald; Kahle, Philipp J; Hornemann, Simone; Knowles, Tuomas P J; Cookson, Mark R; Polymenidou, Magdalini; Jucker, Mathias; Aguzzi, Adriano",EMBO Mol Med,706,5

Understanding the general population’s perspectives regarding dementia risk reduction is key to implementation. This may provide useful insights into more effective and efficient ways to help people change relevant beliefs, motivations and behaviour patterns. We conducted a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative evidence to develop an integrated model of general population dementia risk reduction perspectives and the implications for intervention in research and implementation contexts. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched electronic databases, supplemented by lateral search techniques, to identify studies published since 1995 reporting qualitative dementia risk reduction perspectives of the non-expert general population who do not have dementia. Thematic synthesis, incorporating an expert panel discussion, was used to identify overarching themes and develop an integrated model to guide intervention to support individuals to adopt and maintain dementia risk reduction behaviour patterns. Quality of included studies and confidence in review findings were systematically appraised. We included 50 papers, reflecting the views of more than 4,500 individuals. Main themes were: 1) The need for effective education about a complex topic to prevent confusion and facilitate understanding and empowerment; 2) Personally relevant short- and long-term benefits of dementia risk reduction behaviour patterns can generate value and facilitate action; 3) Individuals benefit from trusted, reliable and sensitive support to convert understanding to personal commitment to relevant behaviour change; 4) Choice, control and relevant self-regulatory supports help individuals take-action and direct their own progress; 5) Collaborative and empowering social opportunities can facilitate and propagate dementia risk reduction behaviour change; 6) Individual behaviour patterns occur in social contexts that influence beliefs through heuristic processes and need to be understood. Findings indicate that, for intervention: 1) education is key, but both content and delivery need to be tailored; 2) complementary interventions to support self-regulation mechanisms and social processes will increase education effectiveness; 3) co-design principles should guide intervention design and delivery processes; 4) all interventions need to be supported by context-specific data. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and thematic synthesis provides a comprehensive, integrated model of the dementia risk reduction perspectives of the general population and intervention approaches to support behaviour change that can be applied in clinical trial and real-world implementation settings. Findings extend existing knowledge and may assist more effective intervention design and delivery.","Curran, Eleanor; Chong, Terence W.

Since the prevalence of this infection in Iran and in the world is not clearly defined, the present study aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical spectrum, and demographic characteristics of PJP among HIV and non-HIV immunocompromised patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) specimens were obtained from 3 groups of immunocompromised patients, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, diabetic patients, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies. All were hospitalized in pulmonary units. The specimens were examined using microscopic methods (Giemsa and calcofluor white staining) and the nested-PCR technique based on mtLSU-rRNA gene. RESULTS: A total of 120 BAL samples were collected. From 12.5% (5 from 40) of HIV-infected patients, 5% (2 from 40) of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapies, and 2.5% (1 from 40) of diabetic patients Pneumocystis jiroveci was isolated. There was not any association between the prevalence of PJP and the patient’s gender (p= 0.557) and age (p= 0.681). Fever and dyspnea (n=7, 87.5%), nonproductive cough and abnormal auscultation sound (n=5, 62.5%), and also chills and weight loss (n=2, 25%) were the documented clinical symptoms of PJP. Also, the results showed that none of the samples had positive results for P. jiroveci with microscopic tests while using the nested-PCR method 8 samples had positive results. CONCLUSION: Since PJP often causes symptoms that are similar to other illnesses, such as the flu or tuberculosis, clinical and laboratory findings should be used simultaneously for making the final decision on drug administration.","Rafat, Zahra; Ashrafi, Keyhan; Hashemi, Seyed Jamal; Sasani, Elahe; Naserani, Alireza; Sarvestani, Hasti Kamali; Hashemi, Farshid",Iran J Microbiol,706,5

METHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort study involving all late TOPs preceded by feticide between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2019 at a tertiary referral hospital in Austria. Outcome variables were retrieved and a time trend assessed between two 8-year intervals (2004–2011 versus 2012–2019). RESULTS: Between January 2004 and December 2019, a total of 209 singleton pregnancies (50.7% male; 46.9% female fetuses, 2.4% no disclosed sex) were terminated medically at a median gestational age of 25(+1) (17(+3)–37(+1)) weeks at our institution. Predominant conditions legally justifying the late medical abortion were abnormaltities of the brain/central nervous system (n = 83; 39.7%), chromosomal aberrations (n = 33; 15.8%), complex malformations (n = 31; 4.8%) and abnormaltities of the musculosceletal system including diaphragmatic hernias (n = 18; 8.6%), as reflected by the ICD-10-categories “Congenital malformation of the central nervous system”, “Other congenital malformations” and “Chromosomal abnormalities”. No changes were observed with regards to maternal age (30.1 ± 5.9 vs. 31.0 ± 6.0 years; p = 0.315) nor frequency of assisted reproductive technologies (7.0% vs. 8.5%; p = 0.550). Despite a 2.5-fold increase in incidence of late TOPs, no epidemiological changes in maternal or fetal characteristics were observed over the last 16 years. CONCLUSION: Population profile and indications for late TOPs followed by feticide remain unchanged over time.","Muin, Dana Anaïs; Otte, Patricia; Scharrer, Anke; Kasprian, Gregor; Husslein, Peter W.; Kiss, Herbert; Bettelheim, Dieter",Arch Gynecol Obstet,706,5

Developing predictive biomarkers that detect the tipping point of mature B cells before lymph node metastasis in CRC is critical to prevent irreversible deterioration. We analyzed B cells in the adjacent tissues of CRC samples from different stages using the dynamic network biomarker (DNB) method. Single-cell profiling of 725 CRC-derived B cells revealed the emergence of a mature B cell subtype. Using the DNB method, we identified stage II as a critical period before lymph node metastasis and that reversed difference genes triggered by DNBs were enriched in the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway involving B cell immune capability. DHX9 (DEAH-box helicase 9) was a specific para-cancerous tissue DNB key gene. The dynamic expression levels of DHX9 and its proximate network genes involved in B cell-related pathways were reversed at the network level from stage I to III. In summary, DHX9 in mature B cells of CRC-adjacent tissues may serve as a predictable biomarker and a potential immune target in CRC progression.","Liu, Huisheng; Zhong, JiaYuan; Hu, JiaQi; Han, ChongYin; Li, Rui; Yao, XueQing; Liu, ShiPing; Chen, Pei; Liu, Rui; Ling, Fei",Mol Ther Oncolytics,706,5

Here, we show that preformed α-syn fibrils (PFF) increase the association between TLR2 and MyD88, resulting in microglial activation. The TLR2-interaction domain of MyD88 (wtTIDM) peptide-mediated selective inhibition of TLR2 reduces PFF-induced microglial inflammation in vitro. In PFF-seeded A53T mice, the nasal administration of the wtTIDM peptide, NEMO-binding domain (wtNBD) peptide, or genetic deletion of TLR2 reduces glial inflammation, decreases α-syn spreading, and protects dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting NF-κB. In summary, α-syn spreading depends on the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and it can be reduced by nasal delivery of wtTIDM and wtNBD peptides.","Dutta, Debashis; Jana, Malabendu; Majumder, Moumita; Mondal, Susanta; Roy, Avik; Pahan, Kalipada",Nat Commun,706,5

METHODS: The records of 123 ambulatory outpatients who had undergone CFS and comprehensive geriatric assessments (CGAs) including measurements for the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) frailty scale and the frailty index (CGA-FI) were analyzed. Correlations between CFS, CHS frailty scale, and CGA-FI were assessed. The ability of CFS to classify frailty status was calculated using the CHS frailty scale and CGA-FI as references. RESULTS: The mean CFS score was 3.2 in the study population, with a mean age of 77.49 years (45.5% men). Individuals with higher CFS scores were older, had a greater burden of chronic diseases, and worse daily functions and cognitive performance. CFS scores positively correlated with CGA-FI (B = 0.78, p < 0.001) and CHS frailty scale (B = 0.67, p < 0.001) scores. For CFS, C-statistics to classify frailty by CGA-FI and CHS scale were 0.905 and 0.826, respectively. The cut-off value of CFS ≥ 4 maximized Youden’s J to classify frailty by both the CHS scale and CGAFI. CONCLUSIONS: The CFS is a valid screening tool to assess the frailty status in outpatients of a geriatric clinic in Korea. As a simple and quick measure, the CFS may facilitate frailty assessments in real-world clinical practice.","Jung, Hee-Won; Jang, Il-Young; Back, Ji Yeon; Park, Seunghyun; Park, Chan MI; Han, Seung Jun; Lee, Eunju",Korean J Intern Med,706,5

How much kidney disease education Latinx immigrants receive and how to improve kidney disease education and outreach among Latinx populations are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To understand the kidney disease educational gaps of Latinx individuals who need but lack access to scheduled outpatient dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used semistructured interviews in a Texas hospital system from March 2020 to January 2021 with 15 individuals who received emergency-only dialysis when they were first diagnosed with kidney failure. Demographic information was collected, and a thematic analysis was performed using the constant comparative method on interviews after they were audio-recorded, translated, and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was performed from April 2020 to February 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Subthemes and themes from semistructured interviews. RESULTS: All 15 persons interviewed (9 male individuals [60%]; mean [SD] age, 51 [17] years) identified as Hispanic, 11 (73%) were born in Mexico, and none reported knowing about their kidney disease more than 6 months before starting dialysis. The themes identified were (1) lack of kidney disease awareness, (2) education provided was incomplete and poor quality, (3) lack of culturally concordant communication and care, (4) elements that Latinx patients receiving emergency-only dialysis want in their education, (5) facilitators of patient activation and coping, and (6) Latinx patient recommendations to improve community outreach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Latinx adults receiving emergency-only dialysis are usually unaware of their kidney disease until shortly before or after they start dialysis, and the education they receive is poor quality and often not culturally tailored. Participants made feasible recommendations on how to improve education and outreach among Latinx communities.","Novick, Tessa K.; Diaz, Santiago; Barrios, Francisco; Cubas, Doris; Choudhary, Kavyaa; Nader, Paul; ElKhoury, Raymonda; Cervantes, Lilia; Jacobs, Elizabeth A.",JAMA Netw Open,706,5

Cells do not rely exclusively on DNA-based evolution to generate new functionality but often utilize membrane encapsulation or formation of membraneless organelles to separate distinct molecular processes that execute complex operations. Applying this principle and the concept of two-dimensional phase separation, we develop film-like synthetic organelles that support protein translation on the surfaces of various cellular membranes. These sub-resolution synthetic films provide a path to make functionally distinct enzymes within the same cell. We use these film-like organelles to equip eukaryotic cells with dual orthogonal expanded genetic codes that enable the specific reprogramming of distinct translational machineries with single-residue precision. The ability to spatially tune the output of translation within tens of nanometers is not only important for synthetic biology but has implications for understanding the function of membrane-associated protein condensation in cells.","Reinkemeier, Christopher D.; Lemke, Edward A.",Cell,706,5

To define the molecular base of the binding, we used a heparin pentasaccharide as representative structure to dock into the 3D‐molecular structure of the cytokines. The results show a discrepancy in K(D) values obtained by SPR analysis and theoretical calculation, pointing to the importance to apply more than one method when describing affinity between proteins and HS. By cluster analysis of the complex formed between the pentasaccharide and cytokines, we have identified several groups in heparin forming strong hydrogen bonds with all four cytokines, which is a significant finding.

The use of non-invasive ventilation, a life-saving technique in many medical conditions, is debated in patients with ARDS since prolonged NIV and delayed intubation may be harmful. Shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators during a respiratory pandemic can trigger a widespread use of early non-invasive ventilation in many hospitals but which is the best way to ventilate patients with severe bilateral pneumonia and severely increased spontaneous ventilation is controversial. Moreover, viral spreading to health-care workers and other hospitalized patients is an issue for any device used to administer oxygen. Even if protective mechanical ventilation is currently the gold standard for the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome, tracheal intubation is not without risks and is associated with delirium, hemodynamic instability, immobilization and post intensive care syndrome. Both invasive and non-invasive ventilation are associated with advantages and limitations that should be carefully considered when patients with COVID-19-ARDS need our attention.

In this study, ECM components were investigated with correlation to corresponding biomechanical properties and loads in aneurysmal arterial wall tissue. METHODS Fifty-four tissue samples from 31 AAA patients (30♂; max. diameter Dmax 5.98 ± 1.42 cm) were excised from the aneurysm sac. Samples were divided for corresponding immunohistological and mechanical analysis. Collagen I and III, total collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans were quantified by computational image analysis of histological staining. Pre-surgical CT data were used for 3D segmentation of the AAA and calculation of mechanical conditions by advanced finite element analysis. AAA wall stiffness and strength were assessed by repeated cyclical, sinusoidal and destructive tensile testing. RESULTS Amounts of collagen I, III, and total collagen were increased with higher local wall stress (p = .002, .017, .030, respectively) and strain (p = .002, .012, .020, respectively). AAA wall failure tension exhibited a positive correlation with collagen I, total collagen, and proteoglycans (p = .037, .038, .022, respectively). α-Stiffness correlated with collagen I, III, and total collagen (p = .011, .038, and .008), while β-stiffness correlated only with proteoglycans (p = .028). In contrast, increased thrombus thickness was associated with decreased collagen I, III, and total collagen (p = .003, .020, .015, respectively), and AAA diameter was negatively associated with elastin (p = .006). CONCLUSIONS The present results indicate that in AAA, increased locally acting biomechanical conditions (stress and strain) involve increased synthesis of collagen and proteoglycans with increased failure tension. These findings confirm the presence of adaptive biological processes to maintain the mechanical stability of AAA wall.","Tanios, F; Gee, M W; Pelisek, J; Kehl, S; Biehler, J; Grabher-Meier, V; Wall, W A; Eckstein, H-H; Reeps, C",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,706,12

These data reveal that individual BP goals determined from CBF autoregulation monitoring are more variable than previously expected. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, for example, the lower limit of autoregulation varied between a MAP of 40 to 90 mm Hg. Studies of CBF autoregulation in sepsis suggest patients frequently manifest impaired CBF autoregulation, possibly a result of BP below the lower limit of autoregulation, particularly in early sepsis or with sepsis-associated encephalopathy. This suggests that the present consensus guidelines for BP management in sepsis may expose some patients to both cerebral hypoperfusion and cerebral hyperperfusion, potentially resulting in damage to brain parenchyma. The future use of novel techniques to study and clinically monitor CBF autoregulation could provide insight into the cerebral pathophysiology of sepsis and offer more precise treatments that may improve functional and cognitive outcomes for survivors of sepsis.","Goodson, Carrie M; Rosenblatt, Kathryn; Rivera-Lara, Lucia; Nyquist, Paul; Hogue, Charles W",Journal of intensive care medicine,706,1

METHODS Fifteen semiprofessional players completed a 90-min simulated soccer match. Before, immediately after, and at 24, 48, and 72 h, participants completed a battery of neuromuscular, physical, and perceptual tests. Perceived fatigue and muscle soreness were assessed via visual analog scales. Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and twitch responses to electrical (femoral nerve) and magnetic (motor cortex) stimulation during isometric knee extensor contractions and at rest were measured to assess central (voluntary activation) and peripheral (quadriceps potentiated twitch force, Qtw,pot) fatigue, and responses to single and paired magnetic stimuli were assessed to quantify corticospinal excitability and short intracortical inhibition, respectively. Countermovement jump, reactive strength index, and sprint performance were assessed to profile the recovery of physical function. RESULTS Simulated match play elicited decrements in MVC that remained unresolved at 72 h (P = 0.01). Central fatigue was prominent immediately postexercise (-9% reduction in voluntary activation) and remained depressed at 48 h (-2%, P = 0.03). Qtw,pot declined by 14% postexercise, remained similarly depressed at 24 h, and had not fully recovered 72 h after (-5%, P = 0.01). Corticospinal excitability was reduced at 24 h (P = 0.047) only, and no change in short intracortical inhibition was observed. Measures of jump performance and self-reported fatigue followed a similar time course recovery to neuromuscular fatigue. CONCLUSION Central processes contribute significantly to the neuromuscular fatigue experienced in the days after soccer match play, but the magnitude and slower recovery of peripheral fatigue indicates that it is the resolution of muscle function that primarily explains the recovery of neuromuscular fatigue after soccer match play.","Thomas, Kevin; Dent, Jack; Howatson, Glyn; Goodall, Stuart",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,706,7

It is a heterogeneous surfactant containing a distribution of fatty acid esters which are subject to hydrolytic degradation, generating free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs can form visible or sub-visible particles in drug product on stability. A previous FFA solubility model, developed by our group, predicts solubility limits for the three most prevalent FFA degradation products of PS20: lauric, myristic and palmitic acid. The model takes into account two formulation parameters, pH and PS20 concentration, and their effect on FFA solubility. This work identifies a third parameter that has an impact on FFA solubility: PS20 ester distribution. When PS20 is hydrolytically degraded, the ester distribution of the remaining surfactant changes on stability. Ester distribution is known to influence the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PS20 such that the mono-esters have a much higher CMC compared to the higher order esters (HOE). We hypothesize that as PS20 degrades, the CMC changes, affecting the proportion of PS20 that is present in micelles and capable of sequestering and solubilizing FFAs in these micelles. Here, PS20 was separated into mono-ester, HOE, and polyol fractions. The mono-ester and HOE fractions were mixed together to generate mock degradation profiles of hydrolytically degraded PS20. FFA solubility was measured as a function of the concentration of these mock-degraded (MD) PS20s. The results indicate that ester distribution does have an impact on FFA solubility, especially at higher MD PS20 concentrations. HOEs solubilize up to 30 μg/mL more lauric acid than an equivalent amount of mono-esters at a MD PS20 level of 0.06% w/v. With the addition of % HOE peak area fraction as a third parameter representing the ester distribution of PS20, the refined FFA solubility model more accurately predicts FFA solubility in protein formulations at 5°C. The refined model suggests that drug products containing trace levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) that preferentially degrade HOEs of PS20 are at a higher risk of particle formation.","Doshi, Nidhi; Martin, Joelle; Tomlinson, Anthony",Molecular pharmaceutics,706,16

A giant magneto-resistive (GMR) sensor was used on which target proteins were fixed and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (diameter: 50 nm) conjugated with drug were used in phosphate buffer, with and without serum. In this study, the following drug-protein pairs were investigated: quercetin and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), Infliximab and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and Bevacizumab and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). For the quercetin and PKA pair, the time profile of the signal from the GMR sensor due to binding between quercetin and PKA clearly changed before and after the addition of serum. Moreover, it was revealed that not only the association process, but also the dissociation process was influenced by the addition of serum, suggesting that the quercetin and PKA complex may partially contain serum proteins, which affect the formation and stability of the complex. For antibody drugs, little effects of serum matrix were observed on both the association and dissociation processes. These clear differences may be attributed to the hydrophobic and electrostatic character of the drug molecule, target protein, and serum proteins. The real-time monitoring of molecular interactions in a biological matrix enabled by the GMR bio-sensing technique is a powerful tool to investigate such complicated molecular interactions. Understanding the molecular interactions that occur in a biological matrix is indispensable for determining the mechanism of action of the drugs and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics inside the body. Additionally, this method can be applied for the analysis of the influence of any kind of third molecule that may have some interaction between two molecules, for example, an inhibitor drug against the interaction between two kinds of proteins.","Saito, Toshiro; Momiyama, Masayoshi; Manri, Chihiro; Yu, Heng; Choudhury, Kalidip; Osterfeld, Sebastian J; Nakasawa, Takashi",Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,706,31

There is a need to broaden the focus on living well with kidney disease and reengagement in life, including emphasis on the patient being in control. The World Kidney Day (WKD) Joint Steering Committee has declared 2021 the year of ""Living Well with Kidney Disease"" in an effort to increase education about and awareness of the important goal of patient empowerment and life participation. This calls for the development and implementation of validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess and address areas of life participation in routine care. It could be supported by regulatory agencies as a metric for quality care or to support labeling claims for medicines and devices. Funding agencies could establish targeted calls for research that address the priorities of patients. Patients with kidney disease and their care partners should feel supported to live well through concerted efforts by kidney care communities, including during pandemics. In the overall wellness program for patients with kidney disease, the need for prevention should be reiterated. Early detection with prolonged course of wellness despite kidney disease, after effective secondary and tertiary prevention programs, should be promoted.

In this context, single-port (SP) access procedures can become an alternative to the conventional laparoscopic approach. METHODS A total of 22 morbidly obese patients were submitted to pure SP Roux-en-Y gastric bypass without additional ports. Selection for this approach was based on distance from the xiphoid to the umbilicus less than 28 cm, body mass index (BMI) lower than 50 kg/m(2), and preferably peripheral obesity. Access to the cavity was obtained through a single transverse, transumbilical incision, with placement of a SILS Port device. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 41 ± 8.98 years, and 95 % of the patients were women. The mean BMI of the series was 42.68 ± 2.28 kg/m(2), and the mean body weight was 111.34 ± 10.66 kg. Surgery was performed successfully in all cases through a transumbilical incision with a mean length of 26.68 ± 5.27 mm. The mean surgical time was 114.05 ± 21 min, and the mean hospital stay was 3.27 ± 1.01 days. No intraoperative or immediate postoperative deaths or complications occurred. The median postoperative BMI during a mean follow-up period of 12 months was 28 kg/m(2) (range, 18-35 kg/m(2)). The median weight loss was 39 kg, and the percentage loss of excess body weight was 86 %. In relation to improvement of the comorbidities, two of the three patients with arterial hypertension showed normalization of their blood pressure values. Likewise, the blood glucose levels were corrected in two of the three diabetic patients, as well as in the patient with altered fasting blood glucose. CONCLUSIONS Single-port Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery seems to be a safe, viable, and reproducible technique, but randomized studies involving larger patient series and longer follow-up periods are needed to compare the SP access and the multiple-port laparoscopic approach.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Rubio-Manzanares Dorado, Mercedes; Barranco, Antonio; Alarcón, Isaías; Pereira, José Luis; García-Luna, Pedro Pablo; Socas, María",Surgical endoscopy,706,31

Through a genomic epidemiology study based on 250 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from different Amazonas municipalities sampled between March 2020 and January 2021, we reveal that the first exponential growth phase was driven mostly by the dissemination of lineage B.1.195, which was gradually replaced by lineage B.1.1.28 between May and June 2020. The second wave coincides with the emergence of the variant of concern (VOC) P.1, which evolved from a local B.1.1.28 clade in late November 2020 and replaced the parental lineage in <2 months. Our findings support the conclusion that successive lineage replacements in Amazonas were driven by a complex combination of variable levels of social distancing measures and the emergence of a more transmissible VOC P.1 virus. These data provide insights to understanding the mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 epidemic waves and the risk of dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 VOC P.1 in Brazil and, potentially, worldwide.","Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Nascimento, Valdinete; de Souza, Victor Costa; Corado, André de Lima; Nascimento, Fernanda; Silva, George; Costa, Ágatha; Duarte, Débora; Pessoa, Karina; Mejía, Matilde; Brandão, Maria Júlia; Jesus, Michele; Gonçalves, Luciana; da Costa, Cristiano Fernandes; Sampaio, Vanderson; Barros, Daniel; Silva, Marineide; Mattos, Tirza; Pontes, Gemilson; Abdalla, Ligia; Santos, João Hugo; Arantes, Ighor; Dezordi, Filipe Zimmer; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Wallau, Gabriel Luz; Resende, Paola Cristina; Delatorre, Edson; Gräf, Tiago; Bello, Gonzalo",Nature medicine,706,1

In Germany, nationwide protective measures to halt the spread of the virus were implemented in mid-March for 6 weeks. METHODS In May, the impact of the pandemic was assessed in the German National Cohort (NAKO). A total of 113 928 men and women aged 20 to 74 years at the time of the baseline examination conducted 1 to 5 years earlier (53%) answered, within a 30-day period, a follow-up questionnaire on SARS-CoV-2 test status, COVID-19- associated symptoms, and self-perceived health status. RESULTS The self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test frequency among the probands was 4.6%, and 344 participants (0.3%) reported a positive test result. Depressive and anxiety-related symptoms increased relative to baseline only in participants under 60 years of age, particularly in young women. The rate of moderate to severe depressive symptoms increased from 6.4% to 8.8%. Perceived stress increased in all age groups and both sexes, especially in the young. The scores for mental state and self-rated health worsened in participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared with those who were not tested. In 32% of the participants, however, self-rated health improved.

This study aimed at evaluating antiepileptic drug entry into developing brain. Methods: Anaesthetised pregnant, non-pregnant adult females, postnatal and fetal rats were injected intraperitoneally with different doses, single or in combinations, of valproate and lamotrigine, all within clinical range. Injectate included 3H-labelled drug. After 30min, CSF, blood and brain samples were obtained; radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Some animals were also exposed to valproate in feed throughout pregnancy and into neonatal period. Drug levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results are given as CSF or tissue/plasma% as index of drug entry. Results: Entry of valproate into brain and CSF was higher at E19 and P4 compared to adult but was not dose-dependent; placental transfer increased significantly at highest dose of 100mg/Kg. Lamotrigine entry into the brain was dose dependent only at E19. Chronic valproate treatment, or combination of valproate and lamotrigine had little effect on either drug entry, except for reduced valproate brain entry in adult brain with chronic treatment. Placental transfer decreased significantly after chronic valproate treatment. LC-MS measurement of valproate in adults confirmed that rat plasma values were within the clinical range and CSF/plasma and brain/plasma ratios for LC-MS and 3H-valproate were similar. Conclusion: Results suggest that entry of valproate may be higher in developing brain, the capacity of barrier mechanism is mostly unaffected by doses within the clinical range, with or without addition of lamotrigine. Chronic valproate exposure may result in upregulation in cellular mechanisms restricting its entry into the brain. Entry of lamotrigine was little different at different ages and was not dose dependent.","Toll, Samuel J; Qiu, Fiona; Huang, Yifan; Habgood, Mark D; Dziegielewska, Katarzyna M; Nie, Shuai; Saunders, Norman R",F1000Research,706,7

The identity of these rMCs is still elusive. Among them, Axin2Pos mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), which are expressing Fgf7, have been previously described. We propose that an additional population of rMCs, expressing Fgf10 (called rMC-Sca1Pos Fgf10Pos ) are equally important to maintain AT2 stem cell proliferation. The alveolosphere model, based on the AT2-rMC co-culture in growth factor reduced Matrigel, was used to test the efficiency of different rMC subpopulations isolated by FACS from adult murine lung to sustain the proliferation and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. We demonstrate that rMC-Sca1Pos Fgf10Pos cells are efficient to promote the proliferation and differentiation of AT2 stem cells. Co-staining of adult lung for Fgf10 mRNA and Sftpc protein respectively, indicate that 28% of Fgf10Pos cells are located close to AT2 cells. Co-ISH for Fgf7 and Fgf10 indicate that these two populations do not significantly overlap. Gene arrays comparing rMC-Sca1Pos Axin2Pos and rMC-Sca1Pos Fgf10Pos support that these two cell subsets express differential markers. In addition, rMC function is decreased in obese ob/ob mutant compared to WT mice with a much stronger loss of function in males compared to females. In conclusion, rMC-Sca1Pos Fgf10Pos cells play important role in supporting AT2 stem cells proliferation and differentiation. This result sheds a new light on the subpopulations of rMCs contributing to the AT2 stem cell niche in homeostasis and in the context of pre-existing metabolic diseases. © AlphaMed Press 2021 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mesenchyme is still a black box. It contains many subpopulations which remain to be characterized.

We have used a robust and reproducible flow cytometry strategy associated with the alveolosphere assay to characterize further this subpopulation. Our results indicate that rMC-Sca1PosFgf10Pos-LIFs support AT2 stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. We have also compared this subpopulation to the previously described rMC-Sca1PosAxin2Pos cells. Our results indicate that they are two distinct populations.

The most significant increase was found among the older adults aged 65 or above. METHODS Poisson Regression Models were used to examine impact of the SARS epidemic on older adults suicides in Hong Kong. A complete set of the suicide statistics for the period 1993-2004 from the Coroners' Court were made available for the analysis. Chi-square test was used to compare the profile of the older adult suicide cases in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. RESULTS It showed an excess of older adults suicides in April 2003, when compared to the month of April of the other years. A trough, instead of the usual summer peak, was observed in June, suggesting some of the older adults suicides might have been brought forward. On a year basis, the annual older adult's suicide rates in 2003 and 2004 were significantly higher than that in 2002, suggesting the suicide rate did not return to the level before the SARS epidemic. Based on the Coroners' suicide death records, overall severity of illness, level of dependency and worrying of having sickness among the older adult suicides were found to be significantly different in the pre-SARS, peri-SARS and post-SARS periods. CONCLUSION The SARS epidemic was associated with an increase in older adults' suicide rate in April 2003 and some suicide deaths in June 2003 might have been brought forward. Moreover, an increase in the annual older adults' suicide rate in 2003 was observed and the rate in 2004 did not return to the level of 2002. Loneliness and disconnectedness among the older adults in the community were likely to be associated with the excess older adults' suicides in 2003. Maintaining and enhancing mental well being of the public over the period of epidemic is as important as curbing the spread of the epidemic. Attention and effort should also be made to enhance the community's ability to manage fear and anxiety, especially in vulnerable groups over the period of epidemic to prevent tragic and unnecessary suicide deaths.","Cheung, Y T; Chau, P H; Yip, Paul S F",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,706,31

FFU temporarily improves participants' food security, increases the availability of fresh, local food in pantries, and provides product outlets for farmers. Utah has seen a 300% increase in the need for food assistance since the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020. Additionally, processing shortages and market losses have left many Utah farmers without a market for their products. FFU provides a food system change that connects families in need to fresh, local food. FFU is targeted towards food insecure families and struggling farmers. Families experiencing intergenerational poverty are given priority at the food distribution events. Locations for FFU events are identified by need, based on increases in unemployment and SNAP enrollment. FFU is a partnership between the Miracle of Agriculture Foundation, Utah Farm Bureau, and Utah's SNAP-Ed program, Create Better Health. Individual and corporate donations are collected to purchase nutrient-dense, locally produced foods to distribute to those in need. FFU collects outcome data at the distribution events, including the household size of those reached and effective marketing strategies. Additionally, the number of farmers and food pantries supported by the program and pounds of food donated are collected. To date, FFU has held 8 food distributions across the state of Utah, including in the Navajo Nation. Over 1.1 million pounds of food, including produce, meat, poultry, eggs, nuts, and live sheep, have been distributed to over 21,000 families and 25 food pantries. The program has supported 27 Utah farmers. While FFU was developed in response to COVID-19, the need for food system changes to better connect individuals experiencing food insecurity with local products will remain beyond the pandemic.

This study proposes a dynamic co-evolution of knowledge management and business model transformation based on a comparative analysis of the focal firms' BMs and their main partners in two e-commerce ecosystems in China. Design/methodology/approach The open data of listed companies regarding the introduction of emerging topics on the transformation tendency of BMs in the post-COVID-19 business world is qualitatively analysed. The theoretical foundation is based on a critical review of the literature. Findings Three aspects of the co-evolution between knowledge management and business model transformation are introduced. These three aspects are as follows: knowledge integration helps with multi-system business integration and decision-making collaborations;knowledge sharing helps to enhance cognitive ability and network value based on businesses;and the creation of new knowledge helps enrich the knowledge base and promote the transformation of BMs. Research limitations/implications Solely attributing a firm's ability to cope with environmental uncertainties to its business model weakens the importance of its knowledge management. This study argues that the co-evolution between knowledge management and business model transformation also plays a key role in a firm's response to issues post-COVID-19. Originality/value This study calls for the development of a normative theory of co-evolution between knowledge management and business model transformation, implying uncharted territories of knowledge management based on interaction with business model designs in e-business ecosystems.","Li, H.

As part of the EU H2020 project GoJelly, stakeholders were brought together to explore their perceptions on considering jellyfish mucus as a new resource to contribute to reducing plastic pollution from entering the marine environment. The study was conducted in the spring of 2019, in a context directly after the European Union (EU) announced its Directive to ban the most commonly used single-use plastic (SUP) items. The study applied the snowball method as a methodological choice to identify relevant stakeholders. Systems thinking was utilized as a participatory modelling approach, which allowed for the creation of conceptual mind maps from the various workshops and interviews, to understand consumers’ consciousness, and to map out ideas on plastic pollution reduction. Plastic pollution takes place on a global scale and stakeholders discussed their individual perceptions of national and international solutions that could be put in place to solve it, including the opportunities around utilizing jellyfish mucus to filter and capture micro- and nanoplastic. We found that industry stakeholders in both case areas were generally more accepting of policy and increased innovation moving forward, but placed weight on the scientific community to conduct more research on the pollution issue and propose solutions. Future generation stakeholders (youth aged 14–18), however, put emphasis on consumer behavior and buying patterns of single-use products fueling the plastic crisis.","Cowan, Emily Booth Andy M.; Misund, Andreas Klun Katja Rotter Ana Tiller Rachel",Environments,706,1

It triggered the enormous challenges for the global health system, forcing doctors and patients to adapt to new realities and the field of rheumatology was not an exclusion. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze articles covering interconnection between COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases;to investigate the common features of papers in this category and indicate the most influential among them;to determine which rheumatic nosologies were most represented. Methods: For retrieving of literature data, we applied the bibliometric database Scopus and conducted our search on 12th of January using following keywords: “rheumatoid arthritis” OR “systemic lupus erythematosus” OR “systemic sclerosis” OR “vasculitis” OR “myositis” OR “rheumatology” AND “COVID-19”. All selected articles were analyzed according to various aspects: type of document, authorship, journal, citations score, rheumatology field, country of origin, language, and keywords. We have built the visualizing keywords network (Figure 1) with the help of software tool VOSviewer version 1.6.15 (the minimum keyword occurrence threshold was set at 5). Results: A total of 844 literature items were obtained. After screening of title, abstract and keywords we excluded 106 records as they were not emphasized the rheumatological perspective on COVID-19 and as a result were inapplicable for this study. The 738 retrieved articles were mostly (86.8%) open access publications. The top five journals that contributed most to the coverage of this topic were: Annals Of The Rheumatic Diseases (n=59), Clinical Rheumatology (n=41), Lancet Rheumatology (n=24), Arthritis And Rheumatology (n=20) and Rheumatology International (n=19). The origin of most studies was not surprisingly from those countries, which belong to the top ten according to the total cases of COVID-19 [1] (USA -167;Italy -148;UK -76;India -60 and Spain -58). Most items were written in English but articles in German (n=12), Spanish (n=11), Russian (n=5) and Chinese (n=2) could also be found. Analyzed studies were designed in the form of Original Articles (41.2%), Reviews (23.7%), Letters (21.8), Notes (6.9%), Editorials (5.1%). According to the citations scores, articles of highest interest were dedicated to clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune pathologies. The other highly cited studies were about cytokine storm and perspective usage of biological drugs for severe cases of COVID-19. Our analysis of keywords showed that the most widely discussed rheumatic disease in the view of COVID-19 was systemic lupus erythematosus (n=188), followed by vasculitis (n=132), rheumatoid arthritis (n=90), systemic sclerosis (n=32) and psoriatic arthritis (24). The liveliest discussion about disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in COVID-19 revolved around hydroxychloroquine (n=305), corticosteroids (n=161), tocilizumab (n=83), methotrexate (n=46) and anakinra (n=34). Conclusion: As far as we know, it is the first bibliometric overview of studies dedicated to interrelation between COVID-19 and rheumatic pathology. The high number of open access items contributes to the increase of research visibility in this emergently developing research field and facilitates the process of scientific data sharing. The conducting of bibliographic studies may provide a valuable guide through this area of knowledge.","Doskaliuk, B.; Yatsyshyn, R.; Stoika, I.; Fedorovych, K.; Drogomeretska, O.; Hotsaniuk, O.; Delva, Y.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,706,1

Commitment to perform duties and responsibilities are bounded in coping with the situation, emotional state, and the support from the organization. Objective: To analyze and understand the presumed interrelationship of modeled variables, such as the coping style, anxiety level, organizational support, and work commitment of educators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: It is a mixed-methods study through an explanatory sequential approach. The path analysis technique was applied for quantitative with 116 educators as sample respondents guided by selection criteria. Digital immigrant educators with extreme responses were identified and asked permission for an interview. Open-access adapted questionnaires used were Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Perceived Organizational Support (POS), Allen and Meyer's Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ). Data were processed and analyzed using SPSS and AMOS for descriptive and inferential statistics. A four-domain semi-structured questionnaire served as a guide in interviewing participants in the context of coping, anxiety, support, and work commitment. Thematic analysis was performed to generate themes. Results: This study shown that educators often used coping style (1.87 +/- 0.84;Mean +/- SD), have a low level of anxiety (0.58 +/- 0.69;Mean +/- SD), have perceived uncertainty related to organizational support (4.03 +/- 1.37;Mean +/- SD), and neither agree nor disagree in terms of their work commitment (3.02 +/- 0.93;Mean +/- SD). The presumed model through path analysis has significantly predicted 28% plausibility (R-2 = 0.28) with only organizational support that shown significant influence towards educators' work commitment (beta = 0.22). The themes that emerged are challenging adjustment, predestined situation, fear of getting infected, difficulty teaching effectively, technologically challenged, psychosocial assistance, uncertainty, and willingness to explore. Conclusion: Educators during the COVID-19 pandemic were able to cope and control their anxiety through the test of time, seamless work commitment, and presence of support. This study can be considered a framework for situational analysis of nurse educators in the academic realm in times of emergency and disaster.","Aragasi, N. A.; Pangandaman, H.

We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of mechanically stapled vs. hand-sutured anastomosis by comparing wound healing in an animal model of bacterial peritonitis. Male Sprague-Dawley (n=48) rats underwent cecal ligation and puncture. After 24 h, rats were divided into two groups: the stapler group (cecal resection with mechanical stapler, n=24) and the hand-sutured group (cecal resection and stump closure with surgical absorbable suture, n=24). Anastomotic segments were excised and as indicators of wound healing, anastomotic bursting pressure (ABP) and tissue hydroxyproline concentration were determined over time. After harvesting, anastomotic segments were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine relative expression of transforming growth factor-β(1) (TGF-β(1)) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) normalized to that of a constitutive gene. The operative time was significantly shorter in the stapler vs. the hand-sutured group. Both groups showed progressive increases in ABP over the postoperative period. ABP was significantly higher in the stapler vs. the hand-sutured group on postoperative days (PODs) 0 and 3. Tissue hydroxyproline concentration increased from POD 7 in both groups, but between-group difference was not significant. Both groups showed progressive increases in TGF-β(1) and VEGF expression during the 7-day postoperative period. On POD 5, TGF-β(1) gene expression was higher in the stapler vs. the hand-sutured group. VEGF gene expression was identical in both groups. In conclusion, anastomosis by stapler is safer and more effective than that by hand suturing in bacterial peritonitis, since it requires less operating time and creates stronger anastomoses in the early postoperative period.","Tajima, Masaaki; Kono, Yohei; Ninomiya, Shigeo; Amin, Nwar Tawfik; Inomata, Masafumi; Shiraishi, Norio; Kitano, Seigo",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,706,9

MATERIAL AND METHODS This research study was conducted using the database of the National Survey of Violence against Women that consisted of the responses of a total of 26 042 female users of health care services provided by the Mexican government health agencies. The Personal Health Scale (ESP per its initials in Spanish) was used to assess emotional distress. To measure violence a 19-item scale which explores different types of violence as well as severity was used. The relationship between emotional distress and gender violence was determined through a binary logistic regression model, as were economic status and demographic variables. RESULTS One of the most important findings of this study is the high prevalence of emotional distress (15.3%) among women seeking health care services from the public sector and the relationship of such emotional distress with the experience of marital physical, psychological, and sexual violence. Factors associated with emotional distress among female users of health care services were age (26 and older); activity (laborer); working hours (71 hours a week or more); alcohol intake (greater intake); abuse during childhood (frequency and types of abuse); severity of marital violence (severe violence); socioeconomic status (very low SES); and type of dwelling (urban). CONCLUSIONS The principal predictor of emotional distress was intimate partner abuse, especially in severe expression. The next predictor was violence in childhood. Taking into consideration these predictors it is recommended to use screening instruments to identify emotional distress and gender violence in health setting. It is important to design and implement attention and reference programs in public health services for women suffering from emotional distress and gender violence.","Valdez-Santiago, Rosario; Juárez-Ramírez, Clara; Salgado-de Snyder, V Nelly; Agoff, Carolina; Avila-Burgos, Leticia; Híjar, Martha C",Salud publica de Mexico,706,1

While COVID-associated anosmia is well-described, knowledge of parosmia (olfactory distortions) and phanthosmia (olfactory hallucinations) is relatively lacking. We undertook a clinical study of the parosmia/phanthosmia phenotype, aiming to support improved prediction and management of these symptoms. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In a cross-sectional study between September 2020 and May 2021, we recruited 187 COVID-19 patients with parosmia/phanthosmia via social media and a matched healthy control group from neurologists. The patients received an online video-consultation with a neurologist trained in olfactory research and completed a questionnaire to assess the nature of their subjective olfactory disorder. RESULTS In the acute period of COVID-19 parosmia/phanthosmia, patients often experienced comorbid manifestations such as fatigue, fever, headache, myalgia, and ""brain fog"". Isolated phanthosmia was observed in 13.9% of acute COVID-19 patients, as compared to 34.2% in the long term. Parosmia was described in 89.8% of patients in the long-term course of the disease. COVID-associated parosmia/phanthosmia was more common in women (81.3%) than men (18.7%). Almost all parosmia/phanthosmia patients had an acute history of anosmia, which often progressed to hyposmia. A third of the patients had a history of taste disturbance The long-term COVID-19 sequelae such as fatigue, brain fog, and dizziness are significantly more common among patients with parosmia/phanthosmia, as were autonomic symptoms such as awareness of heartbeat and rapid pulse. The incidence of migraine with aura was significantly higher in the parosmia/phanthosmia group than in the control group (8% versus 0.9%). The allergy was reported significantly more frequent in the study group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS Qualitative olfactory disorders occur frequently in COVID-19 patients. Those with the parosmia/phanthosmia phenotype have a higher risk for other symptoms, notably headache (including migraine with aura), fatigue, brain fog, dizziness, and cardiovascular/autonomic manifestations, as well as allergy. We suppose that further investigation of this phenomenon will reveal phenotypic variants depending on particular symptoms cluster; improved nosology of qualitative olfactory disorders in COIVD-19 is a prerequisite for establishing appropriate treatments.","Kopishinskaia, Svetlana; Lapshova, Daria; Sherman, Mikhail; Velichko, Ivan; Voznesensky, Nikolai; Voznesenskaia, Vera",Psychiatria Danubina,706,19

In cases with leakage, a refractory fistula (RF) is sometimes recognized after esophagectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk factors for RF after esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. METHODS This study enrolled 244 consecutive esophageal cancer patients who had undergone esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction. RF was defined as a noncurative anastomotic site-cutaneous fistula that had been present for more than 2 months. We evaluated the risk factors for RF. RESULTS AL occurred in 30 patients (12.3%). There was one mortality case (0.4%) due to mediastinitis caused by AL in the present series. A multivariate analysis revealed that the subcutaneous route was an independent risk factor for AL (OR 4.42, 95% CI 1.42-13.8, p = 0.01), and that the subcutaneous route was an independent risk factor for RF (OR 13.30, 95% CI 2.50-71.30, p = 0.0024). CONCLUSION The results of this retrospective study suggest that subcutaneous route was associated with an increased risk of RF after esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction.

Clinical and epidemiologic evidence supports this association. The application of molecular diagnostic methods has improved understanding of viral epidemiology and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in viral induced acute asthma. This article reviews publications since October 2002 for an update of the role of viruses in exacerbations of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS Respiratory viruses are present in most patients hospitalized for life-threatening asthma and acute non life-threatening asthma. Rhinovirus is the most common, but coinfection with other viruses may be important. Patients with asthma are not more susceptible to upper respiratory tract rhinovirus infections than healthy people but suffer from more severe consequences of the lower respiratory tract infection. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that viruses provoke asthma attacks by additive or synergistic interactions with allergen exposure or with air pollution. An impaired antiviral immunity to rhinovirus may lead to impaired viral clearance and hence prolonged symptoms. Respiratory viral infections cause asthmatic exacerbations by triggering recruitment of Th2-type cells into the lungs. There is no specific antiviral strategy for prevention of respiratory-triggered asthma exacerbations, although clinical trials of potential antiviral agents are ongoing. Indirect prevention strategies focus on the reduction of overall airway inflammation to reduce the severity of the host response to respiratory viral infections. SUMMARY Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in asthma. There is a lack of specific antiviral strategies in the prevention or reduction of viral-triggered asthma exacerbations. Recent advances in understanding of the epidemiology and immunopathogenesis of respiratory viral infection in asthma provide opportunities or identification of specific targets for antiviral agents and strategies for management and prevention.","Tan, Wan C",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,706,11

Given that little was known about this new emergent IBV strain we have characterized the four isolates by sequencing the entire S1 part of the spike protein gene and have compared them with many reference IBV serotypes. In addition, cross-virus neutralization assays were conducted with the main IBV serotypes present in Europe. The four Spanish field strains and the Italy 02 S1 sequence from the NCBI database were established as a new genotype that showed maximum amino acid identities with the 4/91 serotype (81.7% to 83.7%), the D274 group that included D207, D274 and D3896 strains (79.8% to 81.7%), and the B1648 serotype (79.3% to 80%). Furthermore, on the basis of these results, it was demonstrated that the Italy 02 genotype had been circulating in Spain since as early as 1997. Based on the average ratio of synonymous:non-synonymous (dS/dN) amino acid substitutions within Italy 02 sequences, no positive selection pressures were related with changes observed in the S1 gene. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene suggested that the Italy 02 genotype has undergone a recombination event. Virus neutralization assays demonstrated that little antigenic relatedness (less than 35%) exists between Italy 02 and some of the reference IBV serotypes, and indicated that Italy 02 is likely to be a new serotype.","Dolz, Roser; Pujols, Joan; Ordóñez, German; Porta, Ramon; Majó, Natàlia",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,706,19

We have created a generic protocol for detection of pathogen RNA and/or DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse dot-blot for detection (RDB) and processed automatically in a microfluidic device. In particular, we describe how a microfluidic assay to detect HIV viral RNA was converted to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA. We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop isothermal amplification device. Then we implemented the assay in a microfluidic device that will allow analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction to detection by RDB technique. Preliminary data using saliva samples spiked with ZIKV showed that our diagnostic system detects ZIKV RNA in saliva. These results will be validated in further experiments with well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva. The described strategy and methodology to convert the HIV diagnostic assay and platform to a ZIKV RNA detection assay provides a model that can be readily utilized for detection of the next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease.","Sabalza, Maite; Yasmin, Rubina; Barber, Cheryl A.; Castro, Talita; Malamud, Daniel; Kim, Beum Jun; Zhu, Hui; Montagna, Richard A.; Abrams, William R.",PLoS One,706,1

With over 35,000 cases and 2900 deaths reported in the month of March in Italy, it is necessary to stimulate epidemic trend to understand the behavior of COVID-19 in Italy. By S.E.I.R. simulation, we estimated the most representative epidemic parameters occurred from March 1 to 14, 2020, thus being able to evaluate the consistency of the containment rules and identify possible Sars-Cov-2 local mutations. Our estimations are based on some assumptions and limitations exited.","Rovetta, Alessandro; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth",,706,28

A 55-year-old previous healthy woman, who consumed half a bottle of alcohol daily, presented with respiratory failure after one week of upper respiratory infection symptoms. Radiography revealed bilateral, diffuse ground glass opacity with patchy consolidation in the whole lung field; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis indicated that rhinovirus was the causative organism. After five days of conservative support, the symptoms and radiographic findings began to improve. We report this rare case of rhinovirus pneumonia in an otherwise healthy host along with a review of references.","Kim, Kiwook; Song, Yeon Han; Park, Joo-Hyun; Park, Hye Kyeong; Kim, Su Young; Jung, Hun; Lee, Sung-Soon; Koo, Hyeon-Kyoung",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),706,1
