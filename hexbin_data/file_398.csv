3252,"Forecasting influenza epidemics by integrating internet search queries and traditional surveillance data with the support vector machine regression model in Liaoning, from 2011 to 2015",2018-06-25,"BACKGROUND: Influenza epidemics pose significant social and economic challenges in China. Internet search query data have been identified as a valuable source for the detection of emerging influenza epidemics. However, the selection of the search queries and the adoption of prediction methods are crucial challenges when it comes to improving predictions. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model in merging search engine query data and traditional influenza data. METHODS: The official monthly reported number of influenza cases in Liaoning province in China was acquired from the China National Scientific Data Center for Public Health from January 2011 to December 2015. Based on Baidu Index, a publicly available search engine database, search queries potentially related to influenza over the corresponding period were identified. An SVM regression model was built to be used for predictions, and the choice of three parameters (C, γ, ε) in the SVM regression model was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) during the model construction process. The model’s performance was evaluated by the evaluation metrics including Root Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. RESULTS: In total, 17 search queries related to influenza were generated through the initial query selection approach and were adopted to construct the SVM regression model, including nine queries in the same month, three queries at a lag of one month, one query at a lag of two months and four queries at a lag of three months. The SVM model performed well when with the parameters (C = 2, γ = 0.005, ɛ = 0.0001), based on the ensemble data integrating the influenza surveillance data and Baidu search query data. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the feasibility of using internet search engine query data as the complementary data source for influenza surveillance and the efficiency of SVM regression model in tracking the influenza epidemics in Liaoning.","Liang, Feng; Guan, Peng; Wu, Wei; Huang, Desheng",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022725/,398
5244,Reinvention of interorganizational systems: A case analysis of the diffusion of a bio-terror surveillance system,2009-04-03,"This article analyzes the current situation in the field of construction and production of pandemic influenza vaccines. The main task of protecting the population against influenza pandemics requires state-of-the-art approaches to the construction of influenza vaccines to be based on reassortment and genetic engineering techniques, including the analysis of primary structures of influenza viral genes, synthesis and cloning of the main viral genes, reverse genetics techniques, and banks of plasmids bearing basic viral genes. Reassortant technologies are now giving way to new approaches for objective reasons. The state-of-the-art technologies provide safety not only at the laboratories where vaccine viruses are constructed but also make the production process wholly safe. We are using the following approaches to the development of industrial production: use of nanoparticles and nanoemulsions as functional adjuvants, construction of totally-safe strains for live attenuated influenza vaccines with deletions of molecular determinants of pathogenicity, application of protein and chemical chaperones to provide self-assembly of haemagglutinin molecules of the H1N1v-2009 virus, and impregnation of whole-virion preparations with nanoparticles to enhance antigenicity.","Kiselev, O.

5324,Sustainability science: an ecohealth perspective,2006-12-14,"Scientific research is subject to a number of regulations which impose incidental (time, place), rather than substantive (type of research), restrictions on scientific research and the knowledge created through such research. In recent years, however, the premise that scientific research and knowledge should be free from substantive regulation has increasingly been called into question. Some have suggested that the law should be used as a tool to substantively restrict research which is dual-use in nature or which raises moral objections. There are, however, some problems with using law to restrict or prohibit certain types of scientific research, including (i) the inherent imprecision of law for regulating complex and rapidly evolving scientific research; (ii) the difficulties of enforcing legal restrictions on an activity that is international in scope; (iii) the limited predictability of the consequences of restricting specific branches of scientific research; (iv) inertia in the legislative process; and (v) the susceptibility of legislators and regulators to inappropriate factors and influence. Rather than using law to restrict scientific research, it may be more appropriate and effective to use a combination of non-traditional legal tools including norms, codes of conduct, restrictions on publication, and scientist-developed voluntary standards to regulate problematic scientific research.","Marchant, Gary E.; Pope, Lynda L.",Sci Eng Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088679/,398
5429,Nanotechnology for the Food and Bioprocessing Industries,2010-02-19,"Human B cell lymphomas are suitable targets for immunotherapy. Clinical trials with mouse-human chimeric B cell-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have already shown promising results. However, limitations for their use in clinical trials can be the lack of sufficient amounts and high production costs. Expression of mAbs in the mammary gland of transgenic animals provides an economically advantageous possibility for production of sufficient quantities of a promising antibody for clinical trials and beyond. In this paper, we show the feasibility of this approach, by generating transgenic mice expressing mouse-human chimeric anti-CD19 mAbs in their milk. Mouse anti-CD19 variable (V) region genes were combined with human IgG1 heavy (H) and kappa light (L) chain constant (C) region genes and fused to the bovine β-lactoglobulin (BLG) promoter in two separate expression cassettes. Co-injection resulted in five transgenic lines. In one of these lines completely assembled chimeric mAbs were secreted into the milk, at an approximate level of 0.5mg/ml. These mAbs were able to bind specifically to the CD19 surface antigen on human B cells.","van Kuik-Romeijn, Petra; de Groot, Nanda; Hooijberg, Erik; de Boer, Herman A.",Transgenic Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089348/,398
5780,8th international symposium on neurovirology: Speakers,2007,"The COBATEST Network links community-based voluntary counselling and testing (CBVCT) services in the European region and collects testing data using standardised data collection tools. This study aims to describe the population being screened for anti-HCV antibodies in the COBATEST Network and identify risk factors associated with a reactive HCV screening test result in the period 2014–2018. Clients aged > 16 screened for HCV in the period 2014–2018 at one of the Network’s CBVCT services were included in the study. In the 5 year period, 7426 clients were screened for HCV in 22 centres in 10 countries and anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 113 (1.5%). The majority of people screened were aged 25–44, men who have sex with men (MSM), not HIV+ , not reporting a history of injecting drug use or sex work. Detection of anti-HCV antibodies was associated with being HIV + MSM (aOR 9.1, 95% CI 3.8; 21.8 compared to HIV-clients) and being a person who injects drugs (PWID, aOR 28.1, 95% CI 17.6; 45.0, compared to people with no history of injecting drug use). This study demonstrates that HIV-MSM with no history of injection drug use are using CBVCT services for HCV screening, but reactive screening test is associated with being HIV+ or PWID. The integration of HCV screening into the CBVCT service model may widen access to testing for populations that may otherwise not be tested.

6339,Genomics and a Scientifically Responsible Ethics,2006-03-13,"Although defined more broadly, exposure science has mainly focused on exposures to environmental chemicals and related stressors, such as airborne particulate matter. There is an opportunity for exposure science to contribute more substantially to improving public health by devoting more attention to microorganisms as key stressors and agents in exposure. The discovery that pathogenic microbes cause disease in humans precipitated a revolution in public health science and disease prevention. With a continued global urgency to address spread of pathogenic microbes, contributions of microorganisms to both infectious and noninfectious processes merit more attention from the exposure science community. Today, discoveries of the importance of the human microbiome as a determinant of health and disease are precipitating a second revolution. Emerging knowledge creates a major opportunity to expand the scope of exposure science to incorporate the human microbiome as a target and modulator of exposure. A study committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has defined a research strategy to address health risks that pertain to the interaction of environmental chemicals with the human microbiome. Some aspects of this strategy pose important challenges and opportunities for the exposure science community.","Nazaroff, William W",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100090/,398

Mathematically, the modelling of such systems is done on the level of stochastic master equations, giving likelihood functions for real live data. We show in a case study of meningococcal disease, that the observed large fluctuations of outbreaks of disease among the human population can be explained by the theory of accidental pathogens, leading the system towards a critical state, characterized by power laws in outbreak distributions. In order to make the extremely difficult parameter estimation close to a critical state with absorbing boundary possible, we investigate new algorithms for simulation of the disease dynamics on the basis of winner takes all strategies, and combine them with previously developed parameter estimation schemes.","Stollenwerk, Nico",AIP Conf Proc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108766/,398
10885,Backbone reconstruction in temporal networks from epidemic data,2019-10-15,"In recent years, many variants of percolation have been used to study network structure and the behavior of processes spreading on networks. These include bond percolation, site percolation, [Formula: see text]-core percolation, bootstrap percolation, the generalized epidemic process, and the Watts threshold model (WTM). We show that—except for bond percolation—each of these processes arises as a special case of the WTM, and bond percolation arises from a small modification. In fact “heterogeneous [Formula: see text]-core percolation,” a corresponding “heterogeneous bootstrap percolation” model, and the generalized epidemic process are completely equivalent to one another and the WTM. We further show that a natural generalization of the WTM in which individuals “transmit” or “send a message” to their neighbors with some probability less than 1 can be reformulated in terms of the WTM, and so this apparent generalization is in fact not more general. Finally, we show that in bond percolation, finding the set of nodes in the component containing a given node is equivalent to finding the set of nodes activated if that node is initially activated and the node thresholds are chosen from the appropriate distribution. A consequence of these results is that mathematical techniques developed for the WTM apply to these other models as well, and techniques that were developed for some particular case may in fact apply much more generally.","Miller, Joel C.",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217504/,398

It is commonly believed, but scarcely investigated, that product shelf life depends on the oxidative status of the lipid ingredients. In this study, the influence of oxidation degree of the ingredient sunflower oil on cracker oxidative stability and hence shelf life was investigated. To this aim, oil with increasing peroxide values (PVs) (5, 11, and 25 mEqO(2)/kg(oil)) was used to prepare crackers. Just after production, crackers presented similar peroxide and rancid odor intensity, probably due to the interactive pathways of oxidative and Maillard reactions. Crackers were packed and analyzed for PV and rancid odor during storage at 20, 40, and 60 °C. Rancid odor well discriminated cracker oxidative status. Relevant oxidation rates were used to develop a shelf life predictive model based on the peroxide value of the ingredient oil. It was estimated that an oil PV from 5 to 15 mEqO(2)/kg(oil) shortens cracker Shelf Life (SL) by 50%, independently of storage temperature. These results demonstrate the critical impact of ingredient quality on product performance on the market.","Manzocco, Lara; Romano, Giulia; Calligaris, Sonia; Nicoli, Maria Cristina",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7353518/,398

Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, allow us to fight infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria and create specific, cheap, and stable sensors for bacteria detection. Here, we summarize the recent developments in the field of phage-based methods for bacteria detection. We focus on works published after mid-2017. We underline the need for further advancements, especially related to lowering the detection (below 1 CFU/mL; CFU stands for colony forming units) and shortening the time of analysis (below one hour).

RNA sequencing was used to analyze the overall transcriptional levels of the upregulated cells by STAU1 and control cells, and select alternative splicing (AS). It was determined that the high expression of STAU1 led to changes in the expression levels of a variety of inflammatory and immune response genes, including IFIT2, IFIT3, OASL, and CCL2. Furthermore, STAU1 was revealed to exert a significant regulatory effect on the AS of genes related to the ‘nerve growth factor receptor signaling pathway’. This is of significant importance for neuronal survival, differentiation, growth, post-damage repair, and regeneration. In conclusion, overexpression of STAU1 was associated with immune response and regulated AS of pathways related to neuronal growth and repair. In the present study, the whole transcriptome of STAU1 expression was first analyzed, which laid a foundation for further understanding the key functions of STAU1.","Zhong, Yi; Hu, Zhengchao; Wu, Jingcui; Dai, Fan; Lee, Feng; Xu, Yangping",Oncol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551455/,398
13475,Modeling Product Manufacturing Reliability with Quality Variations Centered on the Multilayered Coupling Operational Characteristics of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems,2020-10-05,"Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of observed incident cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimizing p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimizes p so that R and N estimates properly and meaningfully adapt to available data. It also outperforms comparable Akaike and Bayesian information criteria on several classification problems, given minimal knowledge of the parameter space, and exposes statistical similarities among renewal, skyline, and other models in biology. Rigorous and interpretable model selection is necessary if trustworthy and justifiable conclusions are to be drawn from piecewise models.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis and associated risk factors in a representative Korean population. METHODS: This cross-sectional nation-wide study analysed the data set acquired from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2008–2012. A total of 8218 children aged 3–18 years were included. The prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis, defined as a margin reflex distance (MRD) of < 2 mm in either eye, was estimated, and the risk factors were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 11.3 ± 0.1 years, and 52.8 ± 0.6% were boys. The overall prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis in Korea was 8.0% (95% CI, 6.9–9.1%). Boys exhibited a higher prevalence of blepharoptosis than girls at most of ages. Levator function increased with age in the normal general population. The proportion of subjects exhibiting MRD1 ≥ 4.0 mm also increased significantly with age (p < 0.001). Male gender, higher body mass index, and urban residency were significantly associated with childhood blepharoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of childhood blepharoptosis is higher in urban obese boys. The increase of levator function with age should be considered in evaluations of childhood ptosis.","Cho, Bum-Joo; Choi, Youn Joo; Shin, Min Chul; Yang, Suk-Woo; Lee, Min Joung",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608270/,398

15079,"Predictive study of tuberculosis incidence by time series method and Elman neural network in Kashgar, China",2021-01-21,"Cardiovascular pathologies are often induced by inflammation. The associated changes in the inflammatory response influence vascular endothelial biology; they complicate the extent of ischaemia and reperfusion injury, direct the migration of immune competent cells and activate platelets. The initiation and progression of inflammation is regulated by the classical paradigm through the system of cytokines and chemokines. Therapeutic approaches have previously used this knowledge to control the extent of cardiovascular changes with varying degrees of success. Neuronal guidance proteins (NGPs) have emerged in recent years and have been shown to be significantly involved in the control of tissue inflammation and the mechanisms of immune cell activation. Therefore, proteins of this class might be used in the future as targets to control the extent of inflammation in the cardiovascular system. In this review, we describe the role of NGPs during cardiovascular inflammation and highlight potential therapeutic options that could be explored in the future.","Keller, Marius; Mirakaj, Valbona; Koeppen, Michael; Rosenberger, Peter",Basic Res Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7843241/,398
16084,A Framework for the Computational Linguistic Analysis of Dehumanization,2020-08-07,"IMPORTANCE: National organizations recommend that medical schools train students in the social determinants of health. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a longitudinal health equity curriculum that was integrated into third-year clinical clerkships and provided experiential learning in partnership with community organizations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study was conducted from June 2017 to October 2020 to evaluate the association of the curriculum with medical students’ self-reported knowledge of social determinants of health and confidence working with underserved populations. Students from 1 large medical school in the southeastern US were included. Students in the class of 2019 and class of 2020 were surveyed at baseline (before the start of their third year), end of the third year, and graduation. The class of 2018 (No curriculum) was surveyed at graduation to serve as a control. Data analysis was conducted from June to September 2020. EXPOSURES: The curriculum began with a health equity simulation followed by a series of modules. The class of 2019 participated in the simulation and piloted the initial 3 modules (pilot), and the class of 2020 participated in the simulation and the full 9 modules (full). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate the change in the self-reported knowledge and confidence scores over time (potential scores ranged from 0 to 32, with higher scores indicating higher self-reported knowledge and confidence working with underserved populations). In secondary analyses, a Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to compare graduation scores between the no, pilot, and full curriculum classes. RESULTS: A total of 314 students (160 women [51.0%], 205 [65.3%] non-Hispanic White participants) completed at least 1 survey, including 125 students in the pilot, 121 in the full, and 68 in the no curriculum classes. One hundred forty-one students (44.9%) were interested in primary care.

17100,Hybrid Basketball Game Outcome Prediction Model by Integrating Data Mining Methods for the National Basketball Association,2021-04-17,"Breast cancer (BRCA) is one of the most complex diseases and involves several biological processes. Members of the L-antigen (LAGE) family participate in the development of various cancers, but their expressions and prognostic values in breast cancer remain to be clarified. High-throughput methods for exploring disease progression mechanisms might play a pivotal role in the improvement of novel therapeutics. Therefore, gene expression profiles and clinical data of LAGE family members were acquired from the cBioportal database, followed by verification using the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to explore correlations between expressions of LAGE family members and prognoses of breast cancer patients. MetaCore, GlueGo, and GluePedia were used to comprehensively study the transcript expression signatures of LAGEs and their co-expressed genes together with LAGE-related signal transduction pathways in BRCA. The result indicated that higher LAGE3 messenger (m)RNA expressions were observed in BRCA tissues than in normal tissues, and they were also associated with the stage of BRCA patients. Kaplan-Meier plots showed that overexpression of LAGE1, LAGE2A, LAGE2B, and LAGE3 were highly correlated to poor survival in most types of breast cancer. Significant associations of LAGE family genes were correlated with the cell cycle, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions as indicated by functional enrichment analyses.

The purpose of this study was to identify useful prognostic factors for patients with colorectal perforation. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients undergoing emergency surgery for colorectal perforation from January 2012 to December 2019. The primary outcome was combined 30 day and in-hospital mortality. Patient- and disease-related factors obtained perioperatively were evaluated for mortality prediction. A scoring system was developed to enhance clinical utility. RESULTS: Overall, 146 patients were included and 20 (14%) died after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression identified five predictive factors: age, hemodialysis, uncommon perforation etiology, plasma albumin level, and decreased platelet count. The area under the receiver operating curve for the scoring system using these parameters was 0.894 (95% CI 0.835–0.952). Patients at high-risk of mortality were classified by the proposed score with a sensitivity of 90.0% and negative predictive value of 98.0%. CONCLUSION: This study identified five perioperative factors significantly associated with mortality of patients with colorectal perforation. Although these parameters predict mortality of patients with colorectal perforation using a score with high discrimination, further study is required to confirm these findings.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether attachment style and emotion regulation strategies are associated with distress in persons who present for predictive testing for a neurogenetic disorder, and whether these psychological traits predict distress after receiving test results. Self-report scales were used to assess attachment insecurity (anxiety and avoidance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing) in adults at 50 % risk for Huntington’s Disease (HD), Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), and Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage With Amyloidosis - Dutch type (HCHWA-D), when they presented for predictive testing. Distress was measured before testing and twice (within 2 months and between 6 and 8 months) after receiving test results. Pearson correlations and linear regression were used to analyze whether attachment style and emotion regulation strategies indicated distress. In 98 persons at risk for HD, CADASIL, or HCHWA-D, attachment anxiety and catastrophizing were associated with distress before predictive testing. Attachment anxiety predicted distress up to 2 months after testing. Clinicians may consider looking for signs of attachment anxiety and catastrophizing in persons who present for predictive testing, to see who may be vulnerable for distress during and after testing.","van der Meer, Lucienne B.; van Duijn, Erik; Giltay, Erik J.; Tibben, Aad",J Genet Couns,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564439/,398
20167,A machine learning approach to predict extreme inactivity in COPD patients using non-activity-related clinical data,2021-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) have been associated with a greater risk of poor functional outcome after ischemic stroke. We assessed the relations between WML burden and radiological and clinical outcomes in patients treated with endovascular treatment in routine practice. METHODS: We analyzed data from the MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischaemic Stroke in the Netherlands)—a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of patients treated with endovascular treatment in the Netherlands. WMLs were graded on baseline noncontrast computed tomography using a visual grading scale. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included early neurological recovery, successful reperfusion (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b), futile recanalization (modified Rankin Scale score ≥3 despite successful reperfusion), and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess associations between WML severity and outcomes, taking the absence of WML on noncontrast computed tomography as the reference category. RESULTS: Of 3180 patients included in the MR CLEAN Registry between March 2014 and November 2017, WMLs were graded for 3046 patients and categorized as none (n=1855; 61%), mild (n=608; 20%), or moderate to severe (n=588; 19%). Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2) was achieved in 838 patients (49%) without WML, 192 patients (34%) with mild WML, and 130 patients (24%) with moderate-to-severe WML. Increasing WML grades were associated with a shift toward poorer functional outcome in a dose-dependent manner (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.13–1.60] for mild WML and 1.67 [95% CI, 1.39–2.01] for moderate-to-severe WML; P(trend), <0.001). Increasing WML grades were associated with futile recanalization (P(trend), <0.001) and were inversely associated with early neurological recovery (P(trend), 0.041) but not with the probability of successful reperfusion or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

20331,A data assimilation framework that uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence,2021-08-26,"SUMMARY: In this retrospective cohort study of 6604 adults, 65 years or older, admitted with seasonal influenza at Swedish hospitals, and 330,200 age- and sex-matched controls from the general population admitted for other reasons, were included. Patients with influenza had increased risk of fall injuries and fractures compared to controls. INTRODUCTION: Fractures and fall injuries often lead to disability, increased morbidity, and mortality. Older adults are at higher risk of influenza-related complications such as pneumonia, cardiovascular events, and deaths, but the risk of fractures and fall injuries is unclear. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the risk of fractures and fall injuries in older patients after admission with seasonal influenza. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study of 6604 adults, 65 years or older, admitted with seasonal influenza at Swedish hospitals (from December 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017) and 330,200 age- and sex-matched controls from the general population and admitted for other reasons, the risk of fracture or fall injury was investigated. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 6604 influenza patients was 80.9 (8.1) years and 50.1% were women. During the first year after hospital discharge, there were 680 (10.3%) patients suffering from a fracture or fall injury among the patients with influenza, and 25,807 (7.8%) among the controls, corresponding to incident rates of 141 (95% CI, 131–152) and 111 (95% CI, 110–112) fractures or fall injuries per 1000 person-years respectively, translating to a significantly increased risk of fracture or fall injury in a Cox regression model (hazard ratio (HR) 1.28 (95% CI, 1.19–1.38)), a risk that was maintained after multivariable adjustment (HR 1.22 (95% CI 1.13–1.31)). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults admitted with influenza diagnosis have an increased risk of fracture or fall injury during the first year after discharge.

20420,Causal Information Rate,2021-08-21,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: AML is a common form of blood cancer in adults. This study was undertaken to evaluate if AML patients who have failed the available standard treatment options could tolerate and potentially benefit from a new form of therapy. This new therapy activates patients’ own immune system against AML cells. The findings from this research may provide the foundation for a potentially more effective future form of standard therapy that is less likely to fail. ABSTRACT: APVO436 is a recombinant T cell-engaging humanized bispecific antibody designed to redirect host T cell cytotoxicity in an MHC-independent manner to CD123-expressing blast cells from patients with hematologic malignancies and has exhibited single-agent anti-leukemia activity in murine xenograft models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this first-in-human (FIH) multicenter phase 1B study, we sought to determine the safety and tolerability of APVO436 in R/R AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients and identify a clinically active recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) level for its further clinical development. A total of 46 R/R AML/MDS patients who had failed 1–8 prior lines of therapy received APVO436 as weekly intravenous (IV) infusions at 10 different dose levels, ranging from a Minimum Anticipated Biological Effect Level (MABEL) of 0.3 mcg to 60 mcg. APVO436 exhibited a favorable safety profile with acceptable tolerability and manageable drug-related adverse events (AEs), and its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached at a weekly dose of 60 mcg. The most common APVO436-related AEs were infusion-related reactions (IRR) occurring in 13 (28.3%) patients and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurring in 10 (21.7%). The single dose RP2D level was identified as 0.2 mcg/kg. Preliminary efficacy signals were observed in both AML and MDS patients: Prolonged stable disease (SD), partial remissions (PR), and complete remissions (CR) were observed in R/R AML patients as best overall responses to APVO436 at the RP2D level. Three of six evaluable MDS patients had marrow CRs. The safety and preliminary evidence of efficacy of APVO436 in R/R AML and MDS patients warrant further investigation of its clinical impact potential.","Uckun, Fatih M.; Lin, Tara L.; Mims, Alice S.; Patel, Prapti; Lee, Cynthia; Shahidzadeh, Anoush; Shami, Paul J.; Cull, Elizabeth; Cogle, Christopher R.; Watts, Justin",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8394899/,398
20431,Predicting Depression in Community Dwellers Using a Machine Learning Algorithm,2021-08-07,"Nitrofurantoin is an antimicrobial agent obtained through the addition of a nitro group and a side chain containing hydantoin to a furan ring. The interactions of the antibiotic with human serum albumin (HSA) have been investigated by fluorescence, UV-VIS, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy, and protein-ligand docking studies. The fluorescence studies indicate that the binding site of the additive involves modifications of the environment around Trp214 at the level of subdomain IIA. Fluorescence and UV-VIS spectroscopy, displacement studies, and FTIR experiments show the association mode of nitrofurantoin to HSA, suggesting that the primary binding site of the antibiotic is located in Sudlow’s site I. Molecular modeling suggests that nitrofurantoin is involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with Trp214, Arg218, and Ser454, and is located in the hydrophobic cavity of subdomain IIA. Moreover, the curve-fitting results of the infrared Amide I’ band indicate that the binding of nitrofurantoin induces little change in the protein secondary structure. Overall, these data clarify the blood transportation process of nitrofurantoin and its rapid transfer to the kidney for its elimination, hence leading to a better understanding of its biological effects and being able to design other molecules, based on nitrofurantoin, with a higher biological potential.","Calderaro, Antonella; Maugeri, Alessandro; Magazù, Salvatore; Laganà, Giuseppina; Navarra, Michele; Barreca, Davide",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8395721/,398
20867,Statistical Inference under Censored Data for the New Exponential-X Fréchet Distribution: Simulation and Application to Leukemia Data,2021-08-29,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lower limb ischemia develops earlier and more frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes remains the main cause of lower-extremity non-traumatic amputations. Current medical treatment, based on antiplatelet therapy and statins, has demonstrated deficient improvement of the disease. In recent years, research has shown that it is possible to improve tissue perfusion through therapeutic angiogenesis. Both in animal models and humans, it has been shown that cell therapy can induce therapeutic angiogenesis, making mesenchymal stromal cell-based therapy one of the most promising therapeutic alternatives. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of cell therapy based on mesenchymal stromal cells derived from adipose tissue intramuscular administration to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with critical limb ischemia and without possibility of revascularization. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial has been designed. Ninety eligible patients will be randomly assigned at a ratio 1:1:1 to one of the following: control group (n = 30), low-cell dose treatment group (n = 30), and high-cell dose treatment group (n = 30). Treatment will be administered in a single-dose way and patients will be followed for 12 months. Primary outcome (safety) will be evaluated by measuring the rate of adverse events within the study period. Secondary outcomes (efficacy) will be measured by assessing clinical, analytical, and imaging-test parameters. Tertiary outcome (quality of life) will be evaluated with SF-12 and VascuQol-6 scales. DISCUSSION: Chronic lower limb ischemia has limited therapeutic options and constitutes a public health problem in both developed and underdeveloped countries. Given that the current treatment is not established in daily clinical practice, it is essential to provide evidence-based data that allow taking a step forward in its clinical development. Also, the multidisciplinary coordination exercise needed to develop this clinical trial protocol will undoubtfully be useful to conduct academic clinical trials in the field of cell therapy in the near future.

21812,Analysis of EPID Transmission Fluence Maps Using Machine Learning Models and CNN for Identifying Position Errors in the Treatment of GO Patients,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: A delay in admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been associated with an increased mortality. Decisions regarding interventions and eligibility for immune modulatory therapy are often made at the time of admission to the ICU. The primary aim of this study was to compare the host immune response measured upon ICU admission in CAP patients admitted immediately from the emergency department (direct ICU admission) with those who were transferred within 72 h after admission to the general ward (delayed ICU admission). METHODS: Sixteen host response biomarkers providing insight in pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in sepsis and blood leukocyte transcriptomes were analysed in patients with CAP upon ICU admission in two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Of 530 ICU admissions with CAP, 387 (73.0%) were directly admitted and 143 (27.0%) had a delayed admission. Patients with a delayed ICU admission were more often immunocompromised (35.0 versus 21.2%, P = .002) and had more malignancies (23.1 versus 13.4%, P = .011). Shock was more present in patients who were admitted to the ICU directly (46.6 versus 33.6%, P = .010). Delayed ICU admission was not associated with an increased hospital mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 0.89–1.78, P = .20). The plasma levels of biomarkers (n = 297) reflecting systemic inflammation, endothelial cell activation and coagulation activation were largely similar between groups, with exception of C-reactive protein, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and angiopoietin-1, which were more aberrant in delayed admissions compared to direct ICU admissions. Blood leukocyte transcriptomes (n = 132) of patients with a delayed ICU admission showed blunted innate and adaptive immune response signalling when compared with direct ICU admissions, as well as decreased gene expression associated with tissue repair and extracellular matrix remodelling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Blood leukocytes of CAP patients with delayed ICU admission show evidence of a more immune suppressive phenotype upon ICU admission when compared with blood leukocytes from patients directly transferred to the ICU.

Accordingly, this study discussed the severity of PM, which plays a key role in causing air quality issues, and classified the factors for perceived risk of PM into physical, psychological, financial, functional, and time risks to verify its effect on consumers’ emotional response and willingness to visit. Data collection for empirical analysis took place in April 2021 for two weeks. A total of 285 significant data points were obtained on tourists with travel experience in the past year. The demographic characteristics were confirmed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM, New York, NY, USA) and AMOS 22.0 (IBM, New York, NY, USA), and the measurement and structural models were verified through a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, respectively. The empirical analysis showed that the perceived risk of PM has a negative effect on trust in the tourism destination and desire for it, and the behavioral intention of customers. Furthermore, alternative attractiveness was found to play a significant moderating role. The results of this study proved the negative effect of PMs on tourism destinations and provided implications and insights to present a meaningful strategy for minimizing PMs’ perceived risk.","Yu, Jongsik; Lee, Kyeongheum; Ariza-Montes, Antonio; Vega-Muñoz, Alejandro; Han, Heesup",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507652/,398

23412,Opportunities From the Center for Perioperative Education,2006-08-23,"BACKGROUND: Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a potentially fatal disease caused by a tick-borne virus from the Bunyaviridae family. Cytokines plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral, bacterial, and immunologic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the role of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma levels in the severity of infection and clinical outcome of patients with CCHF. METHODS: Patients with confirmed CCHF were divided into two groups (severe cases: Patients who exhibited hemorrhage during their hospital stay, and mild/moderate cases: Patients who displayed no hemorrhage during their hospital stay). Demographic characteristics, laboratory tests on admission of all patients with CCHF were investigated, and serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma levels were measured. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients with confirmed CCHF were investigated. Forty-six (29.9%) of these patients were in the severe group. In patients with severe CCHF, significantly higher serum levels of TNF-alpha (68.2 ± 23.5; P = 0.008) and IL-6 (73.1 ± 41.6; P = 0.003) were detected, compared with cytokine levels in patients who mild/moderate CCHF (Table 1). No differences in serum IL-10 and IFN-gamma levels between patients who severe CCHF and those who mild/moderate CCHF were detected (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators function in a manner, acting on many different cell types to regulate the host’s immune response. When cytokines present in high concentrations, they might toxic or even lethal effects. In accordance with this view, we have detected increased serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 levels in the patients with severe CCHF.

We evaluated outcomes associated with the use of OR compared with AR in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective review of all HCT recipients with RSV infection treated with OR or AR during three RSV seasons (September 2014 – February 2017). An established immunodeficiency Scoring Index (ISI) was applied to identify patients at high risk for progression and death based on host risk factors. Mortality, progression to lower respiratory infection (LRI), and need for ICU admission was compared among recipients of AR and OR. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were treated with OR (n = 42, 39%) or AR (n = 65, 61%). Recipients of AR and OR were equally likely to be high-risk by ISI scoring (11% vs. 10%, P = 1.00). Fifty-three patients (50%) presented with upper respiratory infection (URI) of whom 13 (25%) progressed to LRI. There was no difference in the rate of progression to LRI between patients who received AR and OR (28% vs. 19%, P = 0.53). No difference was found in 30-day mortality rates based on treatment strategy (8% AR vs. 5% OR, P = 0.70). Interestingly, 90-day mortality was found to be significantly lower among patients who received OR vs. AR (20% vs. 5%, P = 0.04). No differences in rates of ICU admission and requirement for mechanical ventilation were found between the two groups. For the 99 inpatients at time of diagnosis, median (interquartile range) length of stay was 7 (5 – 19) days, and was similar for patients on either treatment modality. Eight patients were treated for RSV on an outpatient basis and all received OR. CONCLUSION: HCT patients with RSV had similar outcomes when treated with AR and OR. OR may be a safe and effective alternative to AR for prevention and treatment of RSV in HCT patients with significantly reduced cost. DISCLOSURES: R.

Despite great advances in synthetic organic chemistry, one fourth of present-day drugs have still a botanical origin, and we are currently living a revival of interest in new pharmaceuticals from plant sources. Modern biotechnology has defined the potential of plants to be systems able to manufacture not only molecules naturally occurring in plants but also newly engineered compounds, from small to complex protein molecules, which may originate even from non-plant sources. Among these compounds, pharmaceuticals such as vaccines, antibodies and other therapeutic or prophylactic entities can be listed. For this technology, the term plant molecular farming has been coined with reference to agricultural applications due to the use of crops as biofactories for the production of high-added value molecules. In this perspective, edible plants have also been thought as a tool to deliver by the oral route recombinant compounds of medical significance for new therapeutic strategies. Despite many hurdles in establishing regulatory paths for this “novel” biotechnology, plants as bioreactors deserve more attention when considering their intrinsic advantages, such as the quality and safety of the recombinant molecules that can be produced and their potential for large-scale and low-cost production, despite worrying issues (e.g. amplification and diffusion of transgenes) that are mainly addressed by regulations, if not already tackled by the plant-made products already commercialized. The huge benefits generated by these valuable products, synthesized through one of the safest, cheapest and most efficient method, speak for themselves. Milestone for plant-based recombinant protein production for human health use was the approval in 2012 by the US Food and Drug Administration of plant-made taliglucerase alfa, a therapeutic enzyme for the treatment of Gaucher’s disease, synthesized in carrot suspension cultures by Protalix BioTherapeutics. In this review, we will go through the various approaches and results for plant-based production of proteins and recent progress in the development of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) for the prevention and treatment of human diseases.

24997,Flourishing,2020-03-01,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a chicken Gammacoronavirus, is a major poultry pathogen, and is probably endemic in all regions with intensive poultry production. Since IBV was first described in 1936, many serotypes and variants of IBV have been isolated worldwide. IBV isolates are capable of infecting a large range of epithelial surfaces of the chicken, involving the respiratory, renal, and reproductive systems; however, the clinical signs are usually not specific for differential diagnoses. Virus isolation is commonly used for diagnosis of IBV infection, which was achieved through passage of clinical materials via the allantoic route of embryos. Currently, more sensitive molecular approaches for the detection of avian pathogens have been developed, including reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR, which are more suitable for use in diagnostic laboratories. In this chapter, we describe a one-step RT-PCR which can be used for detecting most of IBV serotypes in the IBV-infected allantoic fluid and has been used routinely in our laboratories for detection of IBVs.","Sun, Junfeng; Liu, Shengwang",Animal Coronaviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121479/,398

25426,Automated Knowledge Extraction from Internet for a Crisis Communication Portal,2005,"Conflict between people and wildlife is a major issue in both wildlife conservation and rural development. In African rangelands, species such as African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) may kill livestock and are therefore themselves killed by local pastoralists. Such conflict has led to the extirpation of these species from many areas, and also impacts the livelihoods of local livestock farmers. To investigate the possibilities for coexistence of people, livestock, and large predators in community rangelands, we measured the effectiveness of traditional livestock husbandry in reducing depredation by wild carnivores, using a case–control approach. Different measures were effective against different predator species but, overall, the risk of predator attack by day was lowest for small herds, accompanied by herd dogs as well as human herders, grazing in open habitat. By night, the risk of attack was lowest for herds held in enclosures (‘bomas’) with dense walls, pierced by few gates, where both men and domestic dogs were present. Unexpectedly, the presence of scarecrows increased the risks of attack on bomas. Our findings suggest that improvements to livestock husbandry can contribute to the conservation and recovery of large carnivores in community rangelands, although other measures such as prey conservation and control of domestic dog diseases are also likely to be necessary for some species.","Woodroffe, Rosie; Frank, Laurence G.; Lindsey, Peter A.; ole Ranah, Symon M.

26163,Continuities and Change in IPE at the Start of the Twenty-first Century,2018-12-20,"As obligate cellular parasites, viruses do not have their own metabolism; therefore, they must infect cells for reproduction. The virus particles must be able to recognize specific receptor molecules on the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell and to bind to them. This process is known as attachment. In enveloped viruses, this interaction is mediated by proteins that are embedded within the viral envelope. This is the case in influenza viruses as well as retroviruses and herpesviruses. Binding of viral envelope proteins to cellular surface structures is to some extent very specific: this is the case for the interaction between the surface protein gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the CD4 receptor, a polypeptide that occurs almost exclusively in the cytoplasmic membrane of T-helper cells and macrophages (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18).

26449,Application of Service Robots for Disinfection in Medical Institutions,2017-11-04,"This chapter summarizes the state-of-the-art approach to several critical aspects of pediatric emergency care. While the field of pediatric emergency medicine is much broader, we have chosen some key topics which are essential for every physician providing care to children. The resuscitation section highlights the challenges and the particularities of pediatric airway management as well as the correct technique for effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation and vascular access. The sepsis section stresses that the key to a successful outcome is early recognition; it outlines the clinical spectrum of sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response and the pathophysiology of septic shock, with emphasis on early clinical signs, airway management, volume resuscitation, vasoactive support and antibiotic therapy. In the last decade, attention to pediatric pain management has resulted in increasing awareness of assessment tools and pharmacologic as well as non-pharmacologic strategies for pain control and anxiolysis. The pain section updates these important aspects of pediatric care and includes management of procedural sedation. Although the general principles of trauma care in children are similar to those of adults, the trauma section highlights the key differences, with respect to anatomy and physiology, and how these impact on early recognition of hemorrhagic shock, susceptibility to specific injuries, indications for imaging (no pan-CTs!) and the more prevalent non-surgical management. Healthcare providers must also know how to safely transport a child who requires additional resources or an escalation in level of care. The regionalization of pediatric intensive care units and trauma services has made it imperative for pediatricians to understand the general principles of transport medicine outlined in this chapter. The overview of pediatric inter-facility transport discusses choice of transport team and modality, emphasizes patient stabilization prior to transport and outlines required medications and supplies.","Principi, Tania; Schonfeld, Deborah; Weingarten, Laura; Schneeweiss, Suzan; Rosenfield, Daniel; Ernst, Genevieve; Schuh, Suzanne; Scolnik, Dennis",Update in Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123355/,398

METHODS: Patients aged 6 to 11 years were included in a randomised controlled study with two parallel groups. Both groups received standard treatment including Weber’s douche and symptomatic medicine on therapeutic grounds. Isotonic sea salt solution was applied four times daily for 10 days. The intervention group received Sinupret® syrup three times daily as add-on therapy. Using a five-point scale (0–4 points) the physicians evaluated the following symptomatic parameters within four successive visits (Day 0, 5, 7, and 10): nasal congestion, nasal discharge, post-nasal drip, headache, and facial pain. Using a 11 -point scale (0–10 points), each patient gave a daily self-assessment of the following parameters from Day 1 to Day 10: rhinorrhoea, headache, and facial pain. RESULTS: In total, 184 patients (mean age 8.1 years) were included. In accordance with physicians’ assessment compared to saline irrigation alone, significant improvements were detected in three out of five symptomatic parameters under combined treatment including Sinupret® syrup as assessed by the physicians. The between-group differences in the severity of facial pain and headache were insignificant. The Sinupret® group also showed a trend to an antibiotic-sparing effect (2.17% in the Sinupret® group vs. 5.26% in the control group). Further, the frequency of the transition of viral rhinosinusitis to the post-viral phase tended to decrease (1.08% in the Sinupret® group vs. 5.26% in the control group). No adverse reactions to the herbal medicine occurred during the study period. CONCLUSION: The complex herbal medicine Sinupret® syrup alleviates effectively the symptoms of acute viral rhinosinusitis in children. Furthermore, the prescription of antibiotics was also reduced.","Popovich, Vasyl I.; Beketova, Halyna V.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149158/,398

It is particularly efficient in cases where labeling the training data is expensive and tedious, naturally linking it to the semi-supervised learning paradigm. In this work, we propose a new semi-supervised time series classification model that leverages features learned from the self-supervised task on unlabeled data. The idea is to exploit the unlabeled training data with a forecasting task which provides a strong surrogate supervision signal for feature learning. We draw from established multi-task learning approaches and model forecasting as an auxiliary task to be optimized jointly with the main task of classification. We evaluate our proposed method on benchmark time series classification datasets in semi-supervised setting and are able to show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.","Jawed, Shayan; Grabocka, Josif; Schmidt-Thieme, Lars",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206263/,398

First, we reveal that [Formula: see text] can be computed by a depth-two threshold circuit of size significantly smaller than a folklore construction of size [Formula: see text]. Namely, we give a construction of such a circuit (denoted by [Formula: see text] circuit) of size [Formula: see text]. We also give an upper bound of [Formula: see text] for the case that the weights of the top threshold gate are polynomially bounded (denoted by [Formula: see text] circuit). Second, we give new lower bounds on the size of depth-two circuits of some special form; the top gate is an unbounded weight threshold gate and the bottom gates are symmetric gates (denoted by [Formula: see text] circuit).

32705,Axalta Schedules 1Q 2020 Results Conference Call,2020-05-20,"The genome of influenza A virus consists of eight single-stranded negative-polarity RNA segments. The eighth segment (NS) encodes the anti-interferon protein NS1 (27 kDa) and the nuclear export protein NEP (14 kDa) via the classic negative-sense strategy. It also contains an additional positive-sense open reading frame that can be directly translated into the negative strand protein 8 (NSP8; 18–25 kDa in different strains). The existence of three or more genes of the opposite polarity in the same locus of a single-stranded RNA appears to be a unique (“economical”) type of gene architecture in living organisms. In silico analysis of genomes of human and animal influenza A viruses revealed that the NSP8 gene had emerged in the influenza A virus population about 100 years ago (“young” gene) and is highly evolutionary variable. The obtained experimental data suggest that NSP8 gene is expressed in the infected animals, which strengthens the concept of bipolar (ambisense) strategy of the influenza A virus genome. The high variability of the NSP8 protein suggests that the “young” NSP8 gene is in the process of functional optimization. Further accumulation of mutations may alter the functions of mature NSP8 protein and lead to the emergence of mature bipolar influenza A virus with unexpected properties that would be threatening for humans and animals.","Zhirnov, O.

Nevertheless, the discovery of bat herpesviruses is geographically uneven. Of the various bat species tested to date, only a few were from the New World. Seeking to investigate the distribution and diversity of herpesviruses circulating in neotropical bats, we carried out molecular screening of 195 blood DNA samples from 11 species of three bat families (Phyllostomidae, Mormoopidae, and Molossidae). Using polymerase chain reaction amplification, with degenerate consensus primers targeting highly conserved amino acid motifs of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase and Glycoprotein B genes, we characterized novel viral sequences from all tested species. BLAST searches, pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, as well as phylogenetic analyses confirmed that they all belonged to the Herpesviridae family, of the Beta- and Gammaherpesvirinae subfamilies. Fourteen partial DNA polymerase gene sequences, of which three beta- and 11 gamma-herpesviruses, were detected. A total of 12 partial Glycoprotein B gene sequences, all gamma-herpesviruses, were characterized. Every sequence was specific to a bat species and in some species (Desmodus rotundus, Carollia perspicillata, and Pteronotus rubiginosus) multiple viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses of beta- and gammaherpesvirus sequences led to the identification of bat-specific clades. Those composed of sequences obtained from different bat species belonging to distinct subfamilies follow the taxonomy of bats. This study confirms the astonishing diversity of bat herpesviruses and broadens our knowledge of their host range. Nevertheless, it also emphasizes the fact that, to better appreciate the evolutionary history of these viruses, much remains to be done at various taxonomic levels.","James, Samantha; Donato, Damien; de Thoisy, Benoît; Lavergne, Anne; Lacoste, Vincent",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7244429/,398
32985,SchemaTree: Maximum-Likelihood Property Recommendation for Wikidata,2020-05-07,"The ongoing global pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is in the crucial stage. The vaccine is still at the developing stage. Currently, the only way to check the spreading of this virus is self-isolation. It is reported that a good number of health workers are infected while treating patients suffering from COVID 19. Therefore, an effort is made to develop a system that can enhance safety and check unwanted viruses. Although the complete specification of the SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be evaluated, the present work considers the characteristic of SARS-CoV-1, which closely relates to that of SARS-CoV-2. The proteins are one of the most important structural and functional molecules of the virus; therefore, few properties of a protein are considered. In this work, we propose a sanitization procedure of the personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and masks, before and after the use, by employing high voltage charge generator (30 kV) from a very low DC source of 5 V to eliminate the virus from the surface of PPE. The positive output is connected to a metallic surface coated with carbon nanotubes (CNT) or a metallic surface ablated using lithography to achieve desired nano-grooves of 200 nm. At the tip of these nano-grooves, a very high electric field is generated which readily ionises the air in the vicinity of the tip. The high electric field alters the induced dipole of the protein of the virus, causing permanent damage in terms of electroporation. Further positive salt ions diffuse into the protein of the viruses, causing it inactive and disintegrate.","Kashyap, Uddip; Saha, Sandip K.",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7244939/,398
33022,Employees recruitment: A prescriptive analytics approach via machine learning and mathematical programming,2020-04-03,"BACKGROUND: Suicidal behavior is a prevalent psychiatric emergency in HIV-infected adults. Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18–65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firth’s penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. RESULTS: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/μl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation (M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count < 500 cells/μl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5–123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02–24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.","Ophinni, Youdiil; Adrian; Siste, Kristiana; Wiwie, Martina; Anindyajati, Gina; Hanafi, Enjeline; Damayanti, Reza; Hayashi, Yoshitake",BMC Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7245986/,398
33143,Elk nadeel heeft zijn voordeel,2020-06-12,"Entity resolution is one of the central challenges when integrating data from large numbers of data sources. Active learning for entity resolution aims to learn high-quality matching models while minimizing the human labeling effort by selecting only the most informative record pairs for labeling. Most active learning methods proposed so far, start with an empty set of labeled record pairs and iteratively improve the prediction quality of a classification model by asking for new labels. The absence of adequate labeled data in the early active learning iterations leads to unstable models of low quality which is known as the cold start problem. In our work we solve the cold start problem using an unsupervised matching method to bootstrap active learning. We implement a thresholding heuristic that considers pre-calculated similarity scores and assigns matching labels with some degree of noise at no manual labeling cost. The noisy labels are used for initializing the active learning process and throughout the whole active learning cycle for model learning and query selection. We evaluate our pipeline with six datasets from three different entity resolution settings using active learning with a committee-based query strategy and show it successfully deals with the cold start problem. Comparing our method against two active learning baselines without bootstrapping, we show that it can additionally lead to overall improved learned models in terms of [Formula: see text] score and stability.","Primpeli, Anna; Bizer, Christian; Keuper, Margret",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250605/,398

This article analyzes related risk factors and literature review from perioperative ventilation, circulation and other aspects of management. CASE PRESENTATION: A neonate diagnosed as congenital bronchobiliary fistula combined with severe chemical pneumonia, consolidation of the lungs, and infection was facing the risk of anaesthesia under thoracoscopy exploration surgery, who experiened more than 20 days diagnostic period before operation. Many risk factors have led to conversion from minimally invasive surgery to thoracotomy, including persistent hypoxemia, hypercapnia, difficult surgical exposure and extremly difficulty of intraoperative ventilation management. Anesthesia maintenance after conversion to open access remained problematic. Fortunately the patient showed no sign of any adverse CNS effects after 4 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The most prominent anesthesia challenges are hypoxemia, increased airway resistance, impaired ventilation, and the risk of metabolic acidosis. Close cooperation among the entire neonatal medical team is the key factors in successful management of this rare case.","Yin, Hong; Zhao, Guangyi; Du, Yingjie; Zhao, Ping",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7265160/,398

This paper focuses on weak transitivity. Weak transitivity has been defined for additive preference relations. We extend this definition to multiplicative preference relations and further introduce a generalized version called generalized weak transitivity. We show that for reciprocal additive and multiplicative preference relations weak transitivity is equivalent to generalized weak transitivity, and we also illustrate generalized weak transitivity for preference relations that are neither additive nor multiplicative. Finally, we show how a total order (ranking of the options) can be constructed for any generalized weak transitive preference relation.","Runkler, Thomas A.",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274326/,398

The aim of the study was to assess the cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α) and biomarkers (vWF, CC-16) in patients of thoracic trauma and correlate it with TTSS and patient’s outcome. This was a prospective observational study. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected from chest trauma patients. TTSS was calculated in all patients. Suitable controls for serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample were selected. The outcome parameters included patient discharge or death, duration of hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Forty-three patients were included. There was no significant correlation between the measured cytokines and biomarkers and TTSS. The mean TTSS of patients who had a fatal outcome was significantly higher than the patients who recovered. Patients with a high TTSS score had a significant prolonged ICU stay. Patients with a prolonged hospital stay had lower values of CC-16. TTSS is a useful tool to predict severity of chest trauma and prolonged ICU stay. Lower levels of CC-16 in BAL fluid of chest trauma patients were associated with prolonged hospital stay suggestive of its protective role in the airway.

Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Methods: Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs. Results: Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV). Conclusion: There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future. Cite this as Gülsen A, Wedi B, Jappe U.

Resveratrol is commercially available polyphenol that exerts beneficial effects in wide array of cardiovascular diseases including cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully elucidated. Since resveratrol is a well-known CYP1B1 inhibitor, the purpose of this study is to test whether resveratrol attenuates angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cellular hypertrophy through inhibition of CYP1B1/mid-chain HETEs mechanism. RL-14 and H9c2 cells were treated with vehicle or 10 μM Ang II in the absence and presence of 2, 10 or 50 μM resveratrol for 24 h. Thereafter, the level of mid-chain HETEs was determined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Hypertrophic markers and CYP1B1 gene expression and protein levels were measured using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Our results demonstrated that resveratrol, at concentrations of 10 and 50 μM, was able to attenuate Ang-II-induced cellular hypertrophy as evidenced by substantial inhibition of hypertrophic markers, β-myosin heavy chain (MHC)/α-MHC and atrial natriuretic peptide. Ang II significantly induced the protein expression of CYP1B1 and increased the metabolite formation rate of its associated mid-chain HETEs. Interestingly, the protective effect of resveratrol was associated with a significant decrease of CYP1B1 protein expression and mid-chain HETEs. Our results provided the first evidence that resveratrol protects against Ang II-induced cellular hypertrophy, at least in part, through CYP1B1/mid-chain HETEs-dependent mechanism.","Shoieb, Sherif M.; El-Kadi, Ayman O.

RESULTS: A total of 34 neonates with NGIP were included in this study. The median age at presentation was (15.8 ± 7.0 SD) days. The median interval between presentation and surgical interference was (2.0 ± 1.1 SD).Necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC] was the commonest cause of neonatal gastro-intestinal perforation. The commonest site of perforation was the colon [11cases]. The overall mortality rate was 11 cases [32.4%]. The main cause of mortality was neonatal NEC [6 cases]. Eight cases [40 %] died out of 20 cases which the interval between the presentation and interference were more than one day. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal gastro-intestinal perforations are still associated with high mortality rate in our institutions, and delayed diagnosis with increased interval between the presentation and surgical intervention are associated with increased mortality. In our locality, although NEC is the commonest cause of NGIP, the iatrogenic cause is relatively higher than reported.","Abo-Halawa, Nezar Abd Elrouf; Negm, Mohamed Ahmed; Fathy, Mohamed",Ann Pediatr Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314571/,398
36181,Explainable Agents as Static Web Pages: UAV Simulation Example,2020-06-04,"Online programming courses have become widely available and host thousands of learners every year. In these courses, participants must solve programming exercises by submitting partial solutions and checking the outcome. The sequence of partial solutions submitted by a student constitutes the programming trajectory followed by the student. In our work, we define a supervised machine learning algorithm that takes as input these programming trajectories and predicts whether a student will successfully complete the next exercise. We have validated our model with two different datasets: the first one is a set of problems from the online learning platform Robomission with over one hundred thousand exercises submitted. The second one comprises one hundred thousand exercises submitted to the Hour of Code challenge. The results obtained indicate that our model can accurately predict the future performance of the students. This work provides not only a new method to represent students’ programming trajectories but also an efficient approach to predict the students’ future performance. Furthermore, the information provided by the model can be used to select the students that would benefit from an intervention.","Rubio, Miguel A.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334679/,398

The article discusses the results of an experiment aimed at answering the following question: are eye tracking based measures related to the intrinsic cognitive load (ICL) connected with program comprehension? Thirty one students of computer science took part in the experiment. They analyzed two program codes written in the C++ language to search for (1) logical errors (LER) and (2) syntax errors (SER). ICL was measured by subjective rating of the difficulty of each task. There were significant differences found for the subjective measures of intrinsic load, the effectiveness and the time of tasks performance, and the values of eye tracking parameters: fixation duration average (FDA) and saccade amplitude average (SAA) in two experiment conditions. Longer fixation and shorter saccades were associated with higher ICL. The results obtained suggest that FDA and SAA are eye tracking measures sensitive of intrinsic cognitive load.","Andrzejewska, Magdalena; Skawińska, Agnieszka",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334692/,398

Machine learning models have been applied to predict relatedness between LOs. These models are trained on examples of LO-relationships annotated by experts. However, medical curricula are periodically reviewed and revised, resulting in changes to the structure and content of LOs. This work addresses the problem of model adaptation under curriculum drift. First, we propose heuristics to generate reliable annotations for the revised curriculum, thus eliminating dependence on expert annotations. Second, starting with a model pre-trained on the old curriculum, we inject a task-specific transformation layer to capture nuances of the revised curriculum.

36213,Detecting Overlapping Communities Using Distributed Neighbourhood Threshold in Social Networks,2020-06-10,"Game-based learning environments hold significant potential for supporting K-12 computer science (CS) education by providing CS learning experiences embedded within engaging virtual worlds. However, many game-based learning environments do not adaptively support individual students based on their specific knowledge and skills. Often, this is because creating game levels is highly labor-intensive, which limits the number of levels created to support student learning. Procedural content generation (PCG) is a promising direction for addressing this challenge by dynamically creating game levels that address specific student needs without requiring extensive development effort. In this paper, we investigate a PCG framework driven by answer set programming (ASP), a variant of logic programming that utilizes well-formed logical rules to express constraints for valid game levels. We demonstrate how variations in CS learning objectives and game-playing skills can be incorporated into ASP-based rules to generate learner-adaptive levels in a middle-grades CS game-based learning environment. Evaluations of the generated levels suggest that the ASP-based level generator not only reliably generates desired CS educational game levels but also synthesizes a large set of diverse game levels. The findings suggest that the ASP-based PCG approach has considerable promise for creating highly engaging and adaptive game-based learning experiences for K-12 CS education.","Park, Kyungjin; Mott, Bradford; Min, Wookhee; Wiebe, Eric; Boyer, Kristy Elizabeth; Lester, James",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334711/,398

A CAD solution helps teachers get instant feedback on their pedagogical instructions. However, CAD is very challenging because (1) classroom conversations contain many conversational turn-taking overlaps between teachers and students; (2) the CAD model needs to be generalized well enough for different teachers and students; and (3) classroom recordings may be very noisy and low-quality. In this work, we address the above challenges by building a Siamese neural framework to automatically identify teacher and student utterances from classroom recordings. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world educational datasets. The results demonstrate that (1) our approach is superior on the prediction tasks for both online and offline classroom environments; and (2) our framework exhibits robustness and generalization ability on new teachers (i.e., teachers never appear in training data).","Li, Hang; Wang, Zhiwei; Tang, Jiliang; Ding, Wenbiao; Liu, Zitao",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334716/,398

For this reason, researchers are increasingly interested in the study of gamification. There are many papers related to the impact that this methodology has on the student’s motivation, engagement or satisfaction. The aim of this paper is to analyze four aspects: “Pressure/tension”, “Perceived choice”, “Perceived competence” and “Effort/importance”. The first part of the study analyzes the aspects at two weeks between a test group and a control group. The second part is even more novel, because it analyzes the aspects when the test group is no longer gamified. Most studies focus on what happens when gamifying, but not when a group of students stops gamifying.

Our method uses an IRT model to estimate the test-taker’s ability from his/her true-false responses to objective questions that are offered with a target short-answer question in the same test. Then, the target short-answer score is predicted by jointly using the ability value and a distributed short-answer representation, which is obtained from an intermediate layer of a DNN-ASAG model.","Uto, Masaki; Uchida, Yuto",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334733/,398

We picked the case study of Euclidean geometry as it can be easily visualized, has simple logic, and yet potentially offers many high-school problems of various difficulty levels. To make the environment user friendly, we abandoned strict logic required by ITPs, allowing to infer topological facts from pictures.

Machine learning methods can be employed to support automated screening of a large number of radio signals for pulsars. This is however a challenging task since training these methods is affected by an inherent imbalance in the acquired data with signals relating to actual pulsars being in the minority. In this paper, we demonstrate that ensemble classification methods that are dedicated to imbalanced classification problems can be successfully employed for pulsar identification. Classifier ensembles combine several individual classifiers to yield more robust and improved classification, while class imbalance can be addressed through careful sampling or through cost-sensitive classification. Experimental results, based on HTRU2 data, show that the investigated ensembles outperform methods that do not consider class balance, and suggest their use for other applications in astrophysics.","Holewik, Jakub; Schaefer, Gerald; Korovin, Iakov",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354782/,398

The study included 100 mechanically ventilated COPD patients with RF. Patients were classified into group 1, mechanically ventilated COPD patients with type 2 RF who developed AKI, and group 2, mechanically ventilated COPD patients with type 2 RF, who did not develop AKI. RESULTS: The age of the studied group ranged between 46 and 80 years, and serum creatinine on admission was within normal. There is a significant difference in a serum creatinine level after 2 days and after 1 week of MV in an intensive care unit (ICU) among AKI cases. There is a significant difference in weaning success between AKI and non-AKI patients with much higher weaning success in non-AKI group. Also, there is a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in AKI patients after 48 h of admission.

However, very young infants fail to respond optimally to most vaccines currently in use, especially neonates. In 2005, Stanley Plotkin proposed that new delivery systems would spur a new revolution in pediatric vaccinology, just as attenuation, inactivation, cell culture of viruses, genetic engineering, and adjuvantation had done in preceding decades. Recent advances in the field of immunoengineering, which is evolving alongside vaccinology, have begun to increasingly influence vaccine formulation design. Historically, the particulate nature of materials used in many vaccine formulations was empiric, often because of the need to stabilize antigens or reduce endotoxin levels. However, present vaccine delivery systems are rationally engineered to mimic the size, shape, and surface chemistry of pathogens, and are therefore often referred to as “pathogen-like particles”. More than a decade from his original assessment, we re-assess Plotkin’s prediction. In addition, we highlight how immunoengineering and advanced delivery systems may be uniquely capable of enhancing vaccine responses in vulnerable populations, such as infants.

HIV stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed to promote and protect the health of persons living with HIV (PLWH). Resilience has been identified as a potential leverage to mitigate the impact of HIV-related stigma among PLWH. METHODS: We examined whether two resilience measures (i.e., social support and resilience assets and resources [RAR]) moderated the relationship between experienced HIV stigma and the HIV care continuum as well as how they moderated the relationship between the consequences of experienced HIV stigma (CES) and the HIV care continuum among 300 PLWH in Louisiana. Separate bootstrapping analyses were conducted to test for evidence of moderated moderation. RESULTS: Most participants were Black (79%) and had been living with HIV for 10 years or more. A relatively high sample of men who have sex with men (MSM) were enrolled (37%). The most common CES were depression (67%). The most common manifestation of experienced HIV stigma was being gossiped about (53%). Participants reported moderate levels of social support. In terms of RAR, most participants (71%) reported that they knew of groups that could support them in responding to experienced HIV stigma. After adjusting for potential covariates, social support and RAR both significantly moderated the relationship between experienced HIV stigma and length of time since their last HIV care visit, B(SE) = .003(.001), p = .03. At high levels of RAR and high levels of social support, those with higher levels of experienced HIV stigma reported a longer length of time since their last HIV care visit than those who reported lower levels of experienced HIV stigma (B(SE) = .17(.04), p < .001). RAR moderated the relationship between social support and HIV care, B(SE) = .01(.004), p < .001. Those who experienced greater CES reported a longer length of time since their last doctor’s visit B(SE) = .04(.02), p < .05. Experienced HIV stigma was not significantly associated with viral load results. However, social support significantly moderated the relationship between experienced stigma and viral load results. At higher levels of social support, those who experienced lower levels of stigma were more likely to report an undetectable viral load than those who had higher levels of stigma, B(SE) = − .13(.03), p < .001. Finally, both RAR and social support moderated the relationship between CES and viral load results. Those who reported higher levels of RAR B(SE) = − .07(.02), p < .001, and social support, B(SE) = − .02(.01), p < .05, also reported having an undetectable viral load at most recent HIV care visit. CES was not significantly related to reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .61). CONCLUSIONS: Enrolled PLWH already have some level of resilience which plays an important protective role within the context of the HIV care continuum up to a certain extent. Interventions to enhance the RAR and social support components may be useful especially among MSM and persons who have been living with HIV for a shorter period of time.","Brewer, Russell; Hood, Kristina B.; Hotton, Anna; Moore, Mary; Spieldenner, Andrew; Daunis, Christopher; Mukherjee, Snigdha; Sprague, Laurel; Schneider, John A.; Smith-Davis, Meta; Brown, Gina; Bowen, Brandi",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7676401/,398

However, the assumption of local linearity in a neighborhood does not always hold true. Hence, the Euclidean distance based affinity that determines the graph edges may fail to represent the true connectivity strength between data points. Moreover, the affinity between data points is influenced by the distribution of the data around them and must be considered in the affinity measure. In this paper, we propose two techniques, CCGA(L) and CCGA(N) that use cross-covariance based graph affinity (CCGA) to represent the relation between data points in a local region. CCGA(L) also explores the additional connectivity between data points which share a common local neighborhood. CCGA(N) considers the influence of respective neighborhoods of the two immediately connected data points, which further enhance the affinity measure. Experimental results of manifold learning on synthetic datasets show that CCGA is able to represent the affinity measure between data points more accurately. This results in better low dimensional representation. Manifold regularization experiments on standard image dataset further indicate that the proposed CCGA based affinity is able to accurately identify and include the influence of the data points and its common neighborhood that increase the classification accuracy. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art manifold regularization methods by a significant margin.","Yadav, Rakesh Kumar; Abhishek; Verma, Shekhar; Venkatesan, S",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677445/,398

The current interventional trial aimed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with oleoylethanolamide (OEA) in combination with weight loss intervention on some atherogenic indices as well as hematological parameters in patients newly diagnosed with NAFLD. Methods: In this triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 76 obese patients with NAFLD confirmed by ultra-sonographic findings were randomly assigned to receive a weight reduction diet plus either 250 mg OEA (n=38) or placebo (n=38) for 12 weeks. Atherogenic factors including total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C, triglyceride (TG)/HDL-C, non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratios and non-HDL-C level, as well as hematological parameters were assessed before and after intervention. Results : After adjustment for potential confounding factors, between group analyses demonstrated a significantly lower LDL-C/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratios in the OEA group compared to the placebo, post-intervention (95% confidence interval [CI]:0.06 to 0.85, P = 0.024; 95% CI: -2.06 to -0.05, P = 0.039; 95% CI: -1.05 to -0.02, P = 0.042,respectively). Additionally, OEA supplementation could significantly decrease the levels of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) compared to the placebo at the endpoint after considering potential confounding variables (95% CI: -0.56 to -0.003, P = 0.041). No significant differences were found between the two study groups in terms of other hematological parameters. Conclusion: The results of the current study indicated that OEA supplementation had beneficial effects on LDL-C/HDL-C, TG/HDL-C, and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratios as well as RDW in obese patients with NAFLD.

Moreover, recognition of the huge potential and challenges for vaccines to control disease outbreaks and protect the older population, together with the availability of an array of new technologies, make it the perfect time for immunologists to be involved in designing the next generation of powerful immunogens.

In Asia's current medical system, numerous herbal formulas have been repeatedly verified to confirm their effectiveness in different periods, which is a great resource for drug innovation and discovery. Through the mining of these clinical effective formulas by network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis, important biologically active ingredients derived from these natural products might be discovered. As modern medicine requires a combination of multiple drugs for the treatment of complex diseases, previously clinical formulas are also combinations of various herbs according to the main causes and accompanying symptoms. However, the herbs that play a major role in the treatment of diseases are always unclear. Therefore, how to rank each herb's relative importance and determine the core herbs, is the first step to assisting herb selection for active ingredients discovery. To solve this problem, we built the platform FangNet, which ranks all herbs on their relative topological importance using the PageRank algorithm, based on the constructed symptom-herb network from a collection of clinical empirical prescriptions. Three types of herb hidden knowledge, including herb importance rank, herb-herb co-occurrence, and associations to symptoms, were provided in an interactive visualization. Moreover, FangNet has designed role-based permission for teams to store, analyze, and jointly interpret their clinical formulas, in an easy and secure collaboration environment, aiming at creating a central hub for massive symptom-herb connections.

These discussions about replication and “questionable research practices” have only started to reach the educational sciences. At the same time, parts of the educational sciences are prone to the same problems as related disciplines. Therefore, it may only be a matter of time before these controversies also arise in the educational sciences. Against this backdrop, we argue how Open Science can contribute to increasing the robustness of educational sciences’ findings. In particular, we suggest three Open Science practices: Pre-registration, Open Materials and Open Data. We present these practices and examine how researchers can implement these Open Science practices in the educational sciences. We discuss the specific conditions of the educational sciences in comparison to related disciplines and address the limitations and particularities of the educational sciences.

New drug development in thrombosis treatment is still in great demand. According to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, thrombosis belongs to the syndrome of blood stasis. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge and Ligusticum striatum DC. are two common TCM herbs with long-term documented function in promoting blood circulation and inhibiting thrombosis, especially when used together. Guanxinning Tablet, a modern Chinese drug which contains extracts of the two herbs, also showed strong therapeutic effects in coronary heart disease. However, the pharmacological mechanism is still lacking for the compatibility of the two herbs. Here, through zebrafish-based in vivo fluorescence screening, we demonstrated the synergistic effects between S. miltiorrhiza Bunge and L. striatum DC. in regulating endogenous thrombosis. Moreover, combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the main compounds of the botanical drugs were analyzed and screened in our model system. Interestingly, cryptotanshinone and senkyunolide I, two representative compounds, respectively derived from the two herbs, also showed synergistic antithrombotic effects. Further analysis suggested that they may regulate thrombi formation at different levels via multiple signaling pathways, including oxidative stress, platelet activation and coagulation cascade. Taken together, our findings provided solid biological supports toward the drug compatibility theory of TCM, and suggested cryptotanshinone and senkyunolide I as promising drug candidates in thrombosis management.","Li, Jun; Liu, Hao; Yang, Zhenzhong; Yu, Qingqing; Zhao, Lu; Wang, Yi",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7841298/,398

However, thus far, most assessment studies have focused on either cross-sectional or longitudinal performance. This study aims to develop a proactive and preliminary safety assessment method using a fluid dynamics (FD) approach by integrating longitudinal contractor performance with cross-sectional safety conditions. To this end, an FD framework was first developed using three processes: (a) identifying the connections between FD principles and safety analogs, (b) incorporating the Darcy-Weisbach equation into the framework, and (c) modifying FD equations for construction safety assessment. Subsequently, two case studies were investigated, and the results obtained were compared and verified with one existing assessment results. The results indicate that the state of safety at a construction site incorporates both the occurrence of hazards and conservation of energy. Thus, the proposed FD approach can be used to preliminarily assess and predict safety conditions by combining safety-related measures with the dynamic characteristics of construction processes. The approach considers a comprehensive range of indicators and parameters, which enables the comparison of safety performance between projects or assessment periods by independently changing parameters.","Liu, Mei; Chong, Heap-Yih; Liao, Pin-Chao",KSCE J Civ Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7881301/,398

Digital transformation can be a key driver of changes in governments if they want to enhance transparency, accountability and efficiency. E-government facilitates integrated policies and public services to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection. E-government contributes to efficient resource management, and so can help to improve namely natural resource usage in the present to avoid damage to their usage in the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of e-government on sustainable development. Using a logit model, for a sample of 103 countries in the period 2003–2018, the results suggest that e-government development is a positive determinant for a country to attain sustainable development, proxied by adjusted net savings, that embraces a country’s economic, social and environmental development. This study provides evidence that e-government increases the probability to attain sustainable development mostly in developing and transition economies. The results also suggest that economic growth and gross national income per capita are significant positive influences in sustainable development in the whole sample and that countries with lower age dependency and natural resource rents are more likely to have sustainable development.

The system combines microfluidics with a wide field of view lensless imaging technology. Highly specific antibodies are functionalized to a glass slide inside a microchip to capture HIV-1 virions. The captured virions are then bound by antibody-conjugated microbeads, which have a higher refraction index. The microbeads—HIV-1 virions complexes generate diffraction patterns that are detected with a custom-built imaging setup and rapidly and accurately quantified by computational analysis. This platform technology enables fast nanoscale virus imaging and quantification from biological samples and thus can play a significant role in the detection and management of viral diseases.","Sher, Mazhar; Coleman, Benjamin; Caputi, Massimo; Asghar, Waseem",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7961362/,398

However, even now there are some problems. The study is devoted to analyzing one of them. The purpose of the study was to highlight the problematic aspects of training and retraining of legal personnel for healthcare institutions that provide telemedicine services. To do this, we have analyzed and summarized the factors that affect the requirements to lawyers who provide legal support of telemedicine services. The article highlights the areas of knowledge, necessary for lawyers that provide services in the field of telemedicine technologies. The result of the research will be the development of a proposal to reform the educational process of training lawyers in the field of telemedicine.","Sidorova, A.; Kalashnikova, E.","Digital Economy and the New Labor Market: Jobs, Competences and Innovative HR Technologies",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971614/,398

And now, it may plausibly be suggested, the twenty-first century is presenting massive challenges which the PhD - in its present format - is entirely unable to address. A new framework is due, therefore, so as to resituate the PhD. Suggested here is an ecological approach, ‘ecological’ being extended beyond its customary associations with the natural environment, and seized upon for its suggestions of interconnectedness, systems, fragility, sustainability and humanity’s responsibilities for the world. This new PhD would be a trans-disciplinary voyage of discovery, a wisdom-doctorate, synoptic and far-reaching, of societal and even global value, and yielding moments of large insight as well as personal self-discovery on the part of the student. Such a programme calls for personal maturity on the part of candidates but it calls also for nimble footwork on the part of institutions, as they allow the student to draw on resources from beyond his/her discipline. The institution, the PhD programme, the supervisor(s) and the student would all become ecologically adept.","Barnett, Ronald",The PhD at the End of the World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971667/,398

It is not surprising that this endeavour is growing. Parliaments reproduce the contemporary gender order in their policies, practices, symbols, and leadership. This book focuses on the fascinating institutional arena of the UK House of Commons, drawing on extensive field research conducted in the 2010–2015 parliament. This introductory chapter outlines the book’s contribution to studying the operation of gender in parliaments and situates it amongst contemporary gender and legislative studies approaches. The chapter sets out parliamentary ethnography as a promising approach to explore parliaments as gendered workplaces. This is because parliamentary ethnography can thicken explorations of inequalities and how power is exercised at the capillaries of parliaments. Parliamentary ethnography also reduces the risk of over-generalisation when identifying possibilities for agency in institutional arenas. The chapter finally introduces the structure and chapters that comprise the book and combine to produce a thick analysis of the operation of gender ‘beneath the spectacle’ in the UK House of Commons.","Miller, Cherry M.",Gendering the Everyday in the UK House of Commons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971671/,398
47357,Analyzing Data,2020-07-17,Quick Sort is considered as the fastest sorting algorithm among all the sorting algorithms. The idea of selecting a pivot was introduced in classical Quick Sort in 1962. This sorting algorithm takes favorably less time compared to other methods. It needs a complex time O([Formula: see text] ) for the best case and O([Formula: see text] ) for worst-case which occurs when the input array is already sorted or reversely sorted. To reduce the worst-case complexity we provide a strong algorithm where it makes fewer comparisons and the time complexity after using this algorithm becomes a function of logarithm O([Formula: see text] ) for worst-case complexity. We experimentally evaluate our algorithms and compare them with classical algorithms and with other papers. The algorithm presented here has profound implications for future studies of handling worst-case complexity and may one day help to solve this occurrence of the fastest sorting method.,"Hossain, Md.

47361,Why Cloud?,2021-03-17,"A common scenario found in experimentation is to synchronize events, such as breaks between visual stimulus, with the video record taken of an experiment made of participants as they undertake the task. In our case, we recently synchronized a protocol of stimulus presentations shown on a laptop display, with webcam video made of participants’ (who were two year old children) facial and eye movements as they were shown trials of stimulus containing moving dots (a random dot kinematogram or RDK). The purpose was to assess eye movements in response to these RDK stimulus as a part of a potential neurological assessment for children. The video contained audio signals such as “beeps” and musical interludes that indicated the start and end of trials, thereby providing a convenient opportunity to align these audio events with the timing of known events in the video record. The process of alignment can be performed manually, but this is a tedious and time consuming task when considering, for example, large databases of videos. In this paper, we tested two alternate methods for synchronizing known audio events using: 1) a deep learning based model, and a 2) standard template matching algorithm. These methods were used to synchronize the known protocol of stimulus events in videos by processing the audio contents of the recording. The deep learning approach utilized simple mel-spectrum audio signal feature extraction, whilst we adopted a cross-correlation algorithm that detected an audio template in the time domain. We found that whilst correlation was not effective as a means of beep detection; but our machine learning-based technique was robust with 90% accuracy in the testing dataset and did not the same amount of remediation required of the correlation approach.","Norouzifard, Mohammad; Nemati, Ali; Mollaee, Saeed; GholamHosseini, Hamid; Black, Joanna; Thompson, Benjamin; Turuwhenua, Jason",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971777/,398
47418,Rural Territories of Russia: Realities and Prospects,2021-02-17,"Today’s digital libraries consist of much more than simple 2D images of manuscript pages or paintings. Advanced imaging techniques – 3D modeling, spectral photography, and volumetric x-ray, for example – can be applied to all types of cultural objects and can be combined to create complex digital representations comprising many disparate parts. In addition, emergent technologies like virtual unwrapping and artificial intelligence (AI) make it possible to create “born digital” versions of unseen features, such as text and brush strokes, that are “hidden” by damage and therefore lack verifiable analog counterparts. Thus, the need for transparent metadata that describes and depicts the set of algorithmic steps and file combinations used to create such complicated digital representations is crucial. At EduceLab, we create various types of complex digital objects, from virtually unwrapped manuscripts that rely on machine learning tools to create born-digital versions of unseen text, to 3D models that consist of 2D photos, multi- and hyperspectral images, drawings, and 3D meshes. In exploring ways to document the digital provenance chain for these complicated digital representations and then support the dissemination of the metadata in a clear, concise, and organized way, we settled on the use of the Metadata Encoding Transmission Standard (METS). This paper outlines our design to exploit the flexibility and comprehensiveness of METS, particularly its behaviorSec , to meet emerging digital provenance metadata needs.","Chapman, Christy; Parker, Seth; Parsons, Stephen; Seales, W.

Thus, to realize regional head elections with integrity, the implementation must be free from various types of violations such as election malpractice. One of the election violations that often appear in every regional head election is the practice of money politics. This paper intends to explain the election supervisory body in preventing money politics in regional head election contestation. This research’s data sources included: website, Twitter, and previous research related to money politics. The data were obtained using the Ncapture feature in the Nvivo 12 plus where the Ncapture feature is a web browser extension developed to capture web content in the form of the website content, social media, and other document content such as scientific articles and a collection of opinions from observers about money politics in Indonesia. This paper reveals that social media is a new transformation for election supervisory bodies to disseminate and prevent money politics. The authors also need to emphasize that this time is money politics itself because democracy/general election parties in any part of the world require money/capital both by the organizers and election participants themselves, so a common understanding is needed. What and how money politics can be categorized as an action. Election violations and even fall into the category of election crimes.

Furthermore, the investigation of travel reason is useful for the aforementioned selection, also correlating with the different age groups and gender. There is a growing need for young people to access university campuses but the transport supply is often not adapted to student needs. This problem involves compromising not only accessible status but also sustainability and therefore the environmental, economic and social aspect. In this way, it emerges that is necessary to adapt to the growing transport services with student economic availability, travel distance and waiting times. This work explored the accessibility of a university campus (school node), through interviews considering a current transport offer and home–school reason. It was also linked to the availability of parking lots adjacent to the campus and the occupancy rates of the various neighbouring car parks were also calculated, monitoring the aforementioned areas for about a month using video cameras and sensors. The research investigated both travel distances in Euclidean and network terms and both travel times through the use of a micro-simulation tool and a linear equation. The study shows as a first research step that the shared mobility solution saves time but also highlights the critical issues of the service that should be better adapted to the students’ needs in terms of rate, type of car and subscription.","Canale, Antonino; Campisi, Tiziana; Tesoriere, Giovanni; Sanfilippo, Luigi; Brignone, Alberto",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978553/,398

However, the behavior of the system is determined based on the actual data, so if an attacker changes the data, a critical problem can occur on the system. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of real data, many researchers have studied data management platforms that use security management technology. In the proposed platform, the pre-manufacturing phase of the cement manufacturing process attempted to ensure the reliability of the generated data by having data produced using blockchain techniques through the distributed ledger of blockchain. In the manufacturing phase, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), also known as digital certificates, is also used to establish encrypted connections between the browser or user’s computer and the server or website. SSL connections protect sensitive data exchanged in each session from interference from unauthorized users. Design a management platform that can verify the integrity of stored data over proposed SSL and block chain. Testers collected in real time from the system provide integrity for the calculation of carbon emissions.

48696,The Comeback of the Old Theological Narratives During the Coronavirus Crisis: A Critical Reflection,2021-03-20,"Quality of products is the most important factor in manufacturing. Machine vision is a technique that mainly performs human cognitive judgment in the industrial field or performs a task that is generally difficult for a human. However the detection of traditional methods of scanning with human eyes has many difficulties due to repetitive tasks. Recently, an artificial intelligence machine vision has been studied to improve these problems. Using the vision inspection system, it is possible to collect information such as the number of products, defect detection, and types without human intervention, which maximizes the operation-al efficiency of a company such as productivity improvement, quality improvement, and cost reduction. Most of the vision inspection systems currently in use are single-sided images, which collect and inspect one image of the product. However, in the actual manufacturing industry, products that are valid for single-sided image inspection are limited to some product groups, and most require multi-sided image inspection. In addition, the inspection system used in the field must meet the production speed required by the actual manufacturing site and inspect the defects of the product. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based vision inspection system that satisfies the multi-sided image inspection and fast production speed of products. By implementing seven cameras and optical technology, multi-sided images of the product are collected simultaneously, and a defect in the product can be quickly detected in real time using a PANet (Path Aggregation Network) model. Through the proposed system, it is possible to inspect product defects at the level required at the manufacturing site, and the information obtained in the inspection process will be used as a very important data to evaluate and improve product quality.","Han, Yohan; Jeong, Jongpil",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978580/,398

One case study example is universities who are increasingly behind the curve when it comes to the digital revolution and its ability to transform operations. Similarly the NHS case study demonstrates it has a vast and complicated supply chain but the service lacks the up-to-date knowledge of logistics and supply chain management required.

However, the industry is sensitive to external shocks such as natural and/or human-induced disasters. This book documented the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global tourism industry. This chapter (also serving as a policy brief) presents emerging key findings and conclusions, as well as policy recommendations that are embedded within the Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and management. Drawing from past disasters, the emphasis is placed on building back better (BBB) global tourism systems post-COVID-19. The decision to pivot the chapter on the DRR and management framework that embraces the BBB concept is informed by the inevitable new global normal. The new global normal is characterised by increasing and more intense disasters across all spatial levels, from a local to a global scale, which normally results in severe negative impacts on all economic sectors as experienced during the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami in 2004 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019/2020. This orientation is further informed by the futuristic thinking that incorporates matters of building resilience and adaptation to disaster risks within the tourism industry. Therefore, the chapter provides the tourism industry and its key stakeholders with both immediate ideas for quick and big wins post-COVID-19 recovery pathways and future ideas to build resilience that permits adaptation of the tourism industry to future disasters. The development of globally accepted protocols enhancing health and safety, especially for the tourist and those working in the tourism and related industries, is recommended. Should these measures be fully upheld, then international travel, which is critical in the tourism sector, may resume sooner rather than later, with spill over effects on exciting domestic tourism too.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980006/,398

Etiology includes infectious triggers, autoimmune response, genetically susceptible host response, windborne agents. Diagnosis of classical KD is made based on the presence of ≥5 days of fever and presence of ≥4 of the 5 principal clinical features, which include conjunctival injection, oropharynx changes, peripheral extremity changes, diffuse erythematous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy. In addition, serum markers of acute inflammation such CRP and ESR are also elevated. Patients without sufficient clinical findings are known to have incomplete or atypical KD. Prompt diagnosis is essential, and treatment should be initiated with intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG). Early detection and follow-up of evolving coronary artery changes should be performed by serial echocardiograms and appropriate thromboprophylaxis should be initiated in a timely fashion. Risk stratification for long-term management is based primarily on coronary changes. Patients with coronary aneurysms require lifelong cardiology follow-up. In the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, pediatric patients may present with atypical KD or acute toxic shock like features called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Most of them present with myocardial dysfunction and gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to atypical KD features. Although, the true mechanism is not completely understood, the proposed hypothesis for myocardial injury is due to “cytokine storm” from the proinflammatory and regulatory T cells.

The physical space consists of the bee populations, their beekeepers who are part of a beekeeping community, non-beekeepers who consume honey, organisational actors shaping rules and regulations and the environment. The virtual space is a multi-agent model, where autonomous agents can take actions and make decisions in partially observed Markov processes. To tie the physical and the virtual space, we embedded bee hives in an IoT environment and implemented an online documentation tool as a web application, where beekeepers take short notes about their work and observations. Bee hives are equipped with sensors, such as humidity, pressure and temperature sensors and a scale. Additionally, we pull data from the German weather service (Deutscher Wetter Dienst, DWD). In our system architecture, multiple levels on data fusion are performed, beginning with raw data quality estimation and sensor failure detection. On higher levels, states of entities are estimated, such as the health of a bee colony, and assessment made whether a state is normal or to be considered an anomaly. Finally on the highest level, we deal with the desires of our agents, how actions should be chosen in order to achieve or maintain desirable and rewarding world states. We hope to be able to refine our digital twin into a decision support tool for small-scale (bee) farmers and communal political actors that helps to reach desirable world states by predicting and simulating the effects of actions within the complex system of urban beekeeping.","Johannsen, Carolin; Senger, Diren; Kluss, Thorsten",Advances and New Trends in Environmental Informatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980971/,398

However, it is unclear whether these challenges stem from the lack of technical know-how, scarce resources, or plain resistance to change. The COVID-19 epidemic has necessitated the hasty implementation of virtual learning platforms to support students’ learning by many of these late adopters. The observations from these implementation activities in most developing countries suggest that a holistic understanding of the implementation activities and processes is conspicuously missing. Consequently, the Actor-network theory (ANT) is applied to study the institutional implementation of e-learning in Ghanaian University. Using a qualitative research approach, the direct content analysis is employed to explore date from multiple sources. The results reveal uncertainties in the identity of the focal actor, and the extent to which the proposed solution could be implemented beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the continual existence of the network. This is because the ANT lens reveals the lack of structure, organization, and commitment in the implementation process.

The leader is the person in the group that possesses the combination of personality and leadership skills that makes others want to follow his or her direction. Leadership implies formal and informal power distribution. The Tannenbaum–Schmidt Leadership Continuum is a model showing the relationship between the level of authority you use as a leader and the freedom this allows your team (Tannenbaum & Schmidt, 2009). At one end of the continuum are managers who simply tell their employees what to do. At the other end of the continuum are managers who are completely hands off. As you move from one end of the continuum to the other, the level of freedom you give your team will increase and your use of authority will decrease. Most managers and leaders will lie somewhere in the middle between these two extremes. The Leadership Continuum was developed by Robert Tannenbaum and Warren Schmidt in their 1958 Harvard Business Revie (HBR) article: “How to Choose a Leadership Pattern”. Tannenbaum was an organizational psychologist and Professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Schmidt was also a psychologist who taught at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Most leadership models ringfence a leadership style and analyse it in isolation from other leadership styles. However, in practice, a single leadership style is not appropriate for all situations. Sometimes you might want to borrow elements of another leadership style to use with an individual within your team. Other times you might completely change your style if the situation requires it. Tannenbaum and Schmidt argued that there are certain questions to be considered when selecting a leadership style (Figs. 6.1 and 6.2):","Helmold, Marc","New Work, Transformational and Virtual Leadership",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980989/,398

In the university and college sector, institutions have been forced to close the doors to their campuses. Students studying practical courses have had to put their learning on hold. Those studying theoretical courses have had to shift to learning at home, with teaching moving online (IAU, 2020). This is a level of disruption the likes of which we have never seen before. Many scientists and experts believe that degree of online classes at universities and colleges will increase in the future even more. The questions is, what will the coronavirus pandemic mean for higher education in the coming years? For historical and functional reasons, universities are at odds with social developments. On the one hand, universities have a decisive influence on these developments; on the other hand, they are also shaped by them, but must not simply adapt to them. By generating and imparting knowledge, universities provide the chance that the problem horizons of the societies around them generated by everyday theory are exceeded. They do justice to their role as actors in the dialogue that builds on this, especially when they prospectively take up the foreseeable changes in social framework conditions. At present, modernization processes can already be observed or foreseen, which pose considerable challenges to the ability of societies and states to cope with social change. The challenges result from the fact that societies can only adapt to the upcoming changes through mobilization long unnecessary resources of conflict management, differentiation and innovation processing will succeed. The dimensions of these modernization processes are knowledge society, globalization, Europeanization, regionalization and demographic developments. The mobilization of appropriate coping resources requires democratization processes, changes in state tasks and developments in labour markets and work requirements.

A trend towards greater privatization or partial privatization of education at all educational levels is an expression of education and training that is more focused on application and practical relevance, as well as the simultaneous limitation of state funding in Europe. Companies set up their own educational institutions or cooperate specifically with state educational institutions. Private schools of all levels are gaining popularity compared to state schools. Private financing shares are increasing. Financial stress is an issue in all systems of tertiary education. The answers to this are, on the one hand, the search for efficiency reserves, and on the other hand, the shifting of costs to the demand for education. A distinction must be made between financing the educational processes themselves and financing. At universities e.g. the educational process is 85% publicly funded and 15% privately; In the case of livelihood it is the other way round: 78% are financed privately and only 22% by the state.","Helmold, Marc","New Work, Transformational and Virtual Leadership",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981022/,398
49689,Inputs and Outputs: Data Science and the Role of Media,2020-08-28,"This chapter introduces the discipline of applied ethics. The moral relevance of context, systemic power imbalances, and perspective are considered. Consultation, involving diverse voices in ethical decision-making, is emphasized. Readers are given an opportunity to identify their values and consider how these values influence their opinions about technology. Deontological, teleological, and virtue ethics theories are summarized. Building on the basics introduced, three ways of defining radical human enhancement are discussed: the therapy—enhancement continuum and how we make ourselves better, choice, and justice. Each of these three ways are considered through application of a religiously informed lens. The three ways of defining the issue are considered throughout the textbook. A hybrid precautionary and proactionary approach to radical human enhancement ethics is explored.","Mercer, Calvin; Trothen, Tracy J.",Religion and the Technological Future,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981027/,398

A best practice is a technique or methodology that is generally accepted as superior to any alternative because, through experience and research, it has proven to be reliable leading to a desired result through evidence-based approach. Despite the fact that data and research are very important, it is simplistic to conclude that they are sufficient to improve practice. Expertise and intuition, as claimed in the previous chapter, are fundamental to reach the best solution to the problem. As a matter of fact, evidence-informed for policymaking has been borrowed from medicine and we hope it can still be borrowed from medicine, but with a more mature awareness to move faster from theory to practice on the ground.","Galluccio, Mauro",Science and Diplomacy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981031/,398

After being used in grass-roots activism for more than a decade, during 2018, the symbol tainted in green color the massive mobilizations during the first parliamentary debate on abortion legalization and was adopted in several Latin American countries. In this chapter, I analyze this process of symbolic “contagion” in Chile and Argentina considering the role of emotions and affects. The green scarf was key for the creation of “attunement” and intense affective atmospheres in public protest. Also, in both countries, feminist artistic activism reinvented the symbol and took its affective force and significance even further.

We argue that the visible presence of Latin Americans in London is under threat due to global corporate real estate developments.

This study was conducted to investigate the impact of lockdown on the environmental parameters measured over agricultural ecosystems in the Himalayan foothills [Saharanpur Flux Site (SFS) and Palampur Flux Site (PFS)], India. The UV–Aerosol Index obtained from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite falls drastically after imposing lockdown particularly in both the agricultural regions. It reached up to −3.082 and −3.522 during the first lockdown in SFS and PFS, respectively. Furthermore, due to the lesser availability of aerosols into the atmosphere, the availability of direct radiant energy increased, thus led to warming the earth’s surface. Improvement in direct radiant energy and normalized difference vegetation index positively increases the gross primary productivity in SFS and PFS.","Pokhariyal, Shweta; Patel, N. R.; Rana, R.

The materials prepared for students who regularly attended the classes were the same as for distance learning students, with adapted lectures and other forms of interaction. Since the pandemic of the COVID-19 has arisen all over the world, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, the classical form of teaching has been transformed into distance learning. The experience of the university staff in the distance learning providing now has been applied to all university students. The authors of this paper analyzed the effectiveness of the distance learning system in terms of emergencies and the manner and speed of adjustment of students, who have previously studied in the classical way, on methods of distance learning. The most appropriate indicators for measuring the degree of adaptation of distance learning are selected. Data for two semesters in 1 school year were monitored throughout the university. In the winter semester, classical classes were conducted, and in the summer semester, classes followed the distance learning model.

Pattern-based detection of specific analytes using affinity-regulated receptors is one of the potential alternatives to specific antigen–antibody-based detection. In this report, we have schemed a sensor array by using various functionalized two-dimensional (2D)-MoS(2) nanosheets and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the receptor and the signal transducer, respectively. Two-dimensional MoS(2) has been used as a promising candidate for recognition of the bioanalytes because of its high surface-to-volume ratio compared to those of other nanomaterials. Easy surface tunability of this material provides additional advantages to analyze the target of interest. The optimized 2D-MoS(2)–GFP conjugates are able to discriminate 15 different proteins at 50 nM concentration with a detection limit of 1 nM. Moreover, proteins in the binary mixture and in the presence of serum were discriminated successfully. Ten different proteins in serum media at relevant concentrations were classified successfully with 100% jackknifed classification accuracy, which proves the potentiality of the above system. We have also implemented and discussed the implication of using different machine learning models on the pattern recognition problem associated with array-based sensing.","Behera, Pradipta; Singh, Krishna Kumar; Pandit, Subhendu; Saha, Diptarka; Saini, Deepak Kumar; De, Mrinmoy",ACS Appl Nano Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8043198/,398

A quick progression to severe disease might decrease the chance for successful therapy. Therefore, more release of danger-associated molecular patterns and more cytokine responses are expectable in the case of higher infectious doses.

Patients and Methods: Forty-eight consecutive patients with neovascular AMD received 3 intravitreal bevacizumab injections (1 mg) every 30–40 days. Subjects were followed for a period of 4 months and were examined at baseline, 1 day and 1 month after each injection. A control group comprised of 19 neovascular AMD patients waiting to begin anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Anterior chamber (AC) inflammation was evaluated with biomicroscopy and laser flare photometry. Results: None of the subjects treated with bevacizumab had detectable ocular inflammation during follow-up. An analysis for variance (ANOVA) of the mixed-effects model has shown neither an effect between treatment and control group (p = 0.921), nor over the time course of the follow-up (p = 0.773). Before treatment, median AC inflammation was 6.7 photons/ms (range: 3.5–18.2 photons/ms). One month after the first, second, and third injections, median laser flare was 6.4, 6.8, and 6.6 photons/ms, respectively, none of which were significantly different from baseline (all p > 0.05). Blood-aqueous barrier permeability did not change between injections and was not different from the control group. Conclusion: Inflammation induced by intravitreal bevacizumab was not detected by examination or flare photometry. This suggests that monthly bevacizumab dosing seems to be safe. The absence of AC inflammation could also reflect the known anti-inflammatory properties of anti-VEGF agents.","Dolar-Szczasny, Joanna; Bucolo, Claudio; Zweifel, Sandrine; Carnevali, Adriano; Rejdak, Robert; Załuska, Wojciech; Czarnek-Chudzik, Aleksandra; Toro, Mario Damiano",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121376/,398

An urban transport system is one of the most critical infrastructures for urban development. Impacts of a poor urban transport are manifested in terms of congestion, delays, pollution, accidents, high-energy consumption, low productivity of resources, community severances and inadequate access to the service. In urban areas, despite the construction of flyovers and roads, the roads continue to face traffic congestion, environmental pollution and lack of mass transportation facility resulting in heavy shift of commuters to intermediate and private vehicle ownership. Therefore, it is necessary to make transport system attractive and user friendly in terms of safety, reliability, travel time and comfort, which can be achieved using intelligent transportation system (ITS). This study has been intended to develop a methodology for development and operation of intelligent transportation system namely Presto ITS mobile application. The Android application, Presto ITS, developed works along with the Urban Traffic Data Management Centre to help reduce the congestion on the road networks by allowing the users to make informed decisions about route choices. This helps in reducing further inflow of vehicles in an already congested road network and thus allowing distribution of vehicles among the different routes resulting in lesser overall congestion. This system when installed on an overall city wide basis will drastically help in reducing the congestion and evenly distributed traffic.","Jain, Sourabh; Jain, S.

Today, relevant oral and dental health services research activities can be found at 12 medical faculties in Germany and nine large-scale projects are funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) or the Innovation Fund of the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). However, the demand for high-level research in this field exceeds the current capacities of university and non-university dentistry; structured and methodically competent research networks that are cross-linked within the dental and public health services are required.

Therefore, it takes stock of existing research activities and infrastructure (including educational and funding opportunities). Knowledge obtained from dental and oral health services research in Germany can be pioneering for other countries, while researchers in Germany may be able to adopt and adapt servicing strategies from other countries and health systems for Germany. To achieve these aims, dental and oral health services researchers should professionalize and network.

54817,The Second Digital Revolution,2021-06-25,"The past decade has profoundly reshaped the fiscal governance system of the Eurozone. Supranational prerogatives vis-à-vis State budgets have been significantly expanded, thereby redefining the nature of Union action in the field of fiscal policy and transforming the dynamics between the Union and its Member States. In spite of its overhaul and the practical effects that Eurozone fiscal governance now produces on the ground, the paper shows that overall, this regulatory system still formally qualifies as soft law. This results in a deep disconnect between the form and substance of Eurozone fiscal surveillance in the Eurozone, which raises a number of constitutional challenges. The paper shows that the source of this disconnect is to be found in the strict apprehension of the hard law/soft law divide and the narrow understanding of bindingness attached to it, which currently prevails in the legal discipline, but no longer corresponds to the realities of the EU’s regulatory practice. From there on, the paper offers an alternative approach towards the distinction between hard and soft law, based on a renewed, more open and contextual, understanding of the concepts of bindingness and legal effects, which might reconcile the form and the reality of Eurozone fiscal governance nowadays.","Dermine, Paul",J Bank Regul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8214385/,398

Policy implications include potential rate impacts as a result of fixed charges spread over a smaller rate base, the potential use of electricity data as a real-time economic indicator during the pandemic, and a call to arms to make electricity data across all Canadian provinces more readily available.","Leach, Andrew; Rivers, Nic; Shaffer, Blake",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231073/,398
55246,Earnings management in state-owned enterprises: bringing publicness back in,2021-07-01,"Opioid overdose deaths continue to rise with fatalities involving synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and its derivatives, increasing sharply in 2020 and accelerating further during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Many lives have been saved by administering naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression, the fatal effect of opioids; however, these effects of fentanyl derivatives are reportedly more difficult to reverse with naloxone than those of other opioids like heroin. The current study examined the ability of naloxone to reverse ventilatory depression produced by fentanyl and 2 of its derivatives. Minute volume (V(E)) was measured using head plethysmography in 4 rhesus monkeys breathing air. On separate occasions, monkeys received saline or naloxone (0.032 mg/kg) 30 min after administration of the smallest dose of fentanyl, 3‐methylfentanyl or carfentanil that decreased V(E) to <70% of control. Fentanyl and its derivatives dose‐dependently decreased ventilation, although their potency varied markedly; carfentanil was 10‐fold more potent than 3‐methylfentanyl and 100‐fold more potent than fentanyl. For each opioid, the dose that decreased V(E) varied slightly across individual monkeys (fentanyl: 17.8‐56 µg/kg; 3‐methylfentanyl: 3.2‐5.6 µg/kg; carfentanil: 0.32‐0.56 µg/kg), although those doses reliably decreased ventilation within 30 min such that V(E) ranged from 57‐63% of control. Ventilatory depression was evident for at least 90 min. Naloxone reversed the ventilatory‐depressant effects of fentanyl and 3‐methylfentanyl with the mean V(E) increasing to 112% and 120% of control, respectively, within 15 min; however, this attenuation by naloxone did not last long, beginning to wane 30 min after its administration. In contrast, naloxone was not as effective in reversing the ventilatory‐depressant effects of carfentanil; V(E) was <70% of control 15 min after naloxone and remained <90% at all time points. Thus, reversal of the ventilatory‐depressant effects of fentanyl and 3‐methylfentanyl was similar to each other and to that obtained previously with heroin, supporting the effectiveness of naloxone in attenuating ventilatory depression involving these opioids. Differences between carfentanil and pharmacologically equivalent doses of other opioids suggest that naloxone is not equally potent, and might not be equally effective, in reversing all opioids and underscores the importance of developing novel treatment options for opioid overdose.","Gerak, Lisa; France, Charles",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239748/,398

There is as yet no specific or disease-modifying treatment. Clinical deficits in PSP are numerous, involve the entire neuraxis, and present as several discrete phenotypes. They center on rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, gait freezing, supranuclear ocular motor impairment, dysarthria, dysphagia, incontinence, sleep disorders, frontal cognitive dysfunction, and a variety of behavioral changes. CBS presents with prominent and usually asymmetric dystonia, apraxia, myoclonus, pyramidal signs, and cortical sensory loss. The symptoms and deficits of PSP and CBS are amenable to a variety of treatment strategies but most physicians, including many neurologists, are reluctant to care for patients with these conditions because of unfamiliarity with their multiplicity of interacting symptoms and deficits. CurePSP, the organization devoted to support, research, and education for PSP and CBS, created its CurePSP Centers of Care network in North America in 2017 to improve patient access to clinical expertise and develop collaborations. The directors of the 25 centers have created this consensus document outlining best practices in the management of PSP and CBS. They formed a writing committee for each of 12 sub-topics. A 4-member Steering Committee collated and edited the contributions. The result was returned to the entire cohort of authors for further comments, which were considered for incorporation by the Steering Committee. The authors hope that this publication will serve as a convenient guide for all clinicians caring for patients with PSP and CBS and that it will improve care for patients with these devastating but manageable disorders.","Bluett, Brent; Pantelyat, Alexander Y.; Litvan, Irene; Ali, Farwa; Apetauerova, Diana; Bega, Danny; Bloom, Lisa; Bower, James; Boxer, Adam L.; Dale, Marian L.; Dhall, Rohit; Duquette, Antoine; Fernandez, Hubert H.; Fleisher, Jori E.; Grossman, Murray; Howell, Michael; Kerwin, Diana R.; Leegwater-Kim, Julie; Lepage, Christiane; Ljubenkov, Peter Alexander; Mancini, Martina; McFarland, Nikolaus R.; Moretti, Paolo; Myrick, Erica; Patel, Pritika; Plummer, Laura S.; Rodriguez-Porcel, Federico; Rojas, Julio; Sidiropoulos, Christos; Sklerov, Miriam; Sokol, Leonard L.; Tuite, Paul J.; VandeVrede, Lawren; Wilhelm, Jennifer; Wills, Anne-Marie A.; Xie, Tao; Golbe, Lawrence I.",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8284317/,398

We used the Adolescent Pathological Internet Use Scale, General Functioning Scale, Trait Hope Scale, and Social Withdrawal Scale to measure internet use in 1223 middle school students. The results showed that (1) pathological internet use was negatively correlated with family functioning and hope, and positively correlated with social withdrawal; family functioning was positively correlated with hope, and negatively correlated with social withdrawal; hope was negatively correlated with social withdrawal; (2) family functioning could not only directly predict pathological internet use, but also indirectly predict pathological internet use through hope; and (3) the mediating effect of family functioning on pathological internet use was moderated by social withdrawal, which was stronger for individuals with low social withdrawal but not significant for individuals with high social withdrawal. This study revealed the internal mechanism of the relation between family functioning and adolescents’ pathological internet use, which has theoretical significance for improving adolescents’ hope and reducing their pathological internet use.","Li, Xing-Kai; Zhan, Pei-Shan; Chen, Shu-Dan; Ren, Jie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8306270/,398
56302,A hybrid analytical model for an entire hospital resource optimisation,2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Videos relating to suicide are available on YouTube, but their characteristics and impacts have seldom been examined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine YouTube videos posted in response to a sudden spate of student suicides in Hong Kong during the 2015-2016 school year and evaluate the impacts of those videos. METHODS: Keyword search was performed on YouTube, and relevant videos were identified. Video typology was examined through content analysis, specifically grouping the videos by who uploaded the videos, what presentation formats were used in the videos, whether the videos were originally created by the uploaders, and whether the videos disclosed the uploaders’ personal experiences with suicide. Impacts of the videos were assessed in terms of reach (measured by view count), engagement (measured by comment count), and insights (measured as to what extent the comments to each video could reveal personal suicide risk and attitude toward help-seeking). Statistical analysis was conducted to compare the impacts of different types of videos. The 7 most impactful videos that were originally created by the YouTubers were selected for further analysis. They were compared with 7 videos uploaded by the same YouTubers right before the student suicide videos and 7 right after the student suicide videos. The comparison focused on their impacts and the network structure of the comments to those videos. RESULTS: A total of 162 relevant YouTube videos were identified. They were uploaded by 7 types of stakeholders, and the most common format was one person talking to the camera. A total of 87.0% (141/162) of the videos were originally created by the uploaders and only 8.0% (13/162) of the videos disclosed uploader personal experiences with suicide. The uploader profiles being popular or top YouTubers and the video containing disclosure of the uploader’s personal experiences were found to be significantly correlated with greater impacts (P<.001). Focusing on the 7 most impactful original videos, it is found that those videos generated more engagement, especially more interactions between the viewers, and more insights than regular videos uploaded by the same YouTubers. CONCLUSIONS: When responding to a youth suicide crisis, videos made by key opinion leaders on YouTube sharing their own experiences of overcoming suicide risks could generate significant positive impacts. These types of videos offer a precious opportunity to craft online campaigns and activities to raise suicide prevention awareness and engage vulnerable youth.","Cheng, Qijin; Lui, Carrie; Ip, Flora Wai Lam; Yip, Paul Siu Fai",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8277376/,398
56469,Dynamical Systems: From Classical Mechanics and Astronomy to Modern Methods,2021-08-06,"Reimagining neglected urban space offers the potential for social cohesion, integration, and connectivity. The intimate, interstitial or fractional spaces of a city represent a key component of social infrastructure in a neighbourhood. The smallest of interventions in urban space adds value and complexity to urban life. However, fractional, yet deeply transformative, urban space is often unrecognised and undocumented. Transformative practice seeks to accommodate, anticipate and represent inclusive public life but requires discovering new content and definitions on public space to decode emerging processes of incremental place-making in an African context. The narrative focuses on a network of place-making intervention projects as part of an urban upgrading programme in Lotus Park informal settlement, located in Gugulethu, Cape Town. A set of tracings, integrated with theoretical frames, reveal the impact of upgraded urban space through firstly, emerging centres and the (re)making of place on the periphery; secondly, disrupting edges and the co-production process involved in the negotiation of space; and lastly, crafting shadows and interpreting traces of micro-interventions. The purpose is to explore urban space as continually adapting to the intrusions in the city grid to translate (1) innovative modes of spatial production; (2) dynamic forms of local agency; (3) marginal ways of operating; and (4) interconnected and multi-scalar urban processes of everyday place-making. The practice of co-producing and (re)making urban space in Gugulethu uncovers alternate mechanisms for governance, partnerships and operations.","Ewing, Kathryn",Urban Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8325039/,398
56634,Application of Artificial Intelligence in Food Industry—a Guideline,2021-08-09,"Statins, which are functionally known as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) inhibitors, are lipid-lowering compounds widely prescribed in patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Several biological and therapeutic functions have been attributed to statins, including neuroprotection, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and anticancer effects. Pharmacological characteristics of statins have been attributed to their involvement in the modulation of several cellular signaling pathways. Over the past few years, the therapeutic role of statins has partially been attributed to the induction of autophagy, which is critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis and accounts for the removal of unfavorable cells or specific organelles within cells. Dysregulated mechanisms of the autophagy pathway have been attributed to the etiopathogenesis of various disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders, malignancies, infections, and even aging. Autophagy functions as a double-edged sword during tumor metastasis. On the one hand, it plays a role in inhibiting metastasis through restricting necrosis of tumor cells, suppressing the infiltration of the inflammatory cell to the tumor niche, and generating the release of mediators that induce potent immune responses against tumor cells. On the other hand, autophagy has also been associated with promoting tumor metastasis. Several anticancer medications which are aimed at inducing autophagy in the tumor cells are related to statins. This review article discusses the implications of statins in the induction of autophagy and, hence, the treatment of various disorders.","Gorabi, Armita Mahdavi; Kiaie, Nasim; Aslani, Saeed; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349293/,398

In the past, citizen participation processes were subject to numerous challenges, but e‑participation offers opportunities to combine them with modern technologies that enable low-threshold participation. In the research project Take Part, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, innovative forms of citizen participation in urban and construction planning are being researched using augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR). The main goal is to create new incentives to motivate citizens to participate and to reduce the possible conflict in construction projects. With the help of the application developed within Take Part, citizens can discuss construction projects, give feedback or vote on them, and at the same time have the object of participation vividly presented in AR and VR. Furthermore, initiators can configure the participation ecosystem to find combinable applications for participation in the respective construction project and purchase suitable services, such as 3D modeling. This paper will present the concrete technological developments (incl. outdoor AR tracking and spatially anchored discussions), as well as the participation ecosystem (service development and implementation platform). For the first time, the developed prototype will be presented in detail. The challenge of developing an e‑participation app that offers the chance to integrate the interaction concepts of different technologies and at the same time provides a compelling user experience will also be described. Finally, the potential of such a solution for digital participation in local government will be discussed, especially in regard of the increased power of imagination and motivation to participate for the user and additionally put into the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Fegert, Jonas; Pfeiffer, Jella; Reitzer, Pauline; Götz, Tobias; Hariharan, Anuja; Pfeiffer-Leßmann, Nadine; Renner, Patrick; Pfeiffer, Thies; Weinhardt, Christof",HMD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8390026/,398
57646,"Emerging IoT domains, current standings and open research challenges: a review",2021-08-16,"PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with a complex inflammatory regulatory network. Resistin-like molecule β (RELMβ) is highly expressed in the lungs of COPD patients. We aimed to investigate the proinflammatory effect of RELMβ on airway epithelial cells in COPD. METHODS: First, a GEO dataset was used to analyze the expression of the RELMβ gene in the COPD and control groups as well as the protein levels of RELMβ in the sera of outpatients with COPD and normal control subjects in our hospital. We also stimulated 16HBE bronchial epithelial cells with recombinant RELMβ protein and analyzed the expression of IL-8 and IL-1β. We upregulated and downregulated the gene expression of RELMβ in 16HBE cells and analyzed the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β. In addition, we also examined the mechanism by which the p38 MAPK signaling pathway contributed to the regulation of IL-8 and IL-1β expression by RELMβ. RESULTS: RELMβ expression was increased in COPD tissues in different data sets and in the serum of COPD patients in our hospital. IL-8 and IL-1β expression was also increased in COPD tissues with high RELMβ gene expression in different data sets. The RELMβ gene was mainly related to inflammatory factors and inflammatory signaling pathways in the PPI regulatory network. Experiments at the cellular level showed that RELMβ promoted the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β, and this regulation was mediated by the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: RELMβ can promote the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β in bronchial epithelial cells of patients with COPD and exert inflammatory effects. RELMβ may be a potential target for the treatment of COPD.","Che, Li; Yu, Chao; Chen, Guangshu; Lin, Jiaxin; Xie, Zhefan; Xia, Tingting; Luo, Wenzhi; Cai, Xingdong; Liu, Shengming",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421257/,398

This study aimed to explore the presence and potential increase in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and anxiety since the beginning of the pandemic for patients in opioid substitution therapy (OST). Methods: This cross-sectional survey study evaluated a clinical sample of patients in OST (N = 123). Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed by an adapted version of the impact of event scale (IES-R), resulting in two subgroups of low and high risk for PTSD. The depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) was applied to collect data on the respective symptoms, and changes since the onset of the pandemic were reported on separate scales. Sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors, as well as data on craving, consumption patterns, concomitant use, and the drug market were further assessed. Results: A binary logistic regression analysis confirmed the impact of self-perceived higher burden by psychological and economic factors on the elevated risk for PTSD due to the pandemic. The high-risk PTSD group also showed higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as a more pronounced deterioration in these symptoms since the pandemic. While reported levels of craving did not differ between the two groups, the high-risk PTSD group indicated a significantly higher increase in craving since the crisis, when compared to the low-risk group. Discussion: Our findings demonstrate elevated levels of clinical symptoms among patients in OST, with more than a quarter of patients found at risk for PTSD due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, about 30–50% of our patients reported concerning levels of depression, anxiety, or stress. Special attention should be drawn to these findings, and potential deterioration of the situation should be addressed by health care facilities. Particularly, psychological, and financial burden due to the crisis were identified as factors increasing the risk for PTSD. These factors can easily be evaluated during routine anamneses, and might be a valuable source of information, when special attention is needed.","Fuchs-Leitner, Isabella; Yazdi, Kurosch; Gerstgrasser, Nikolas W.; Tholen, Matthias G.; Graffius, Sophie-Therés; Schorb, Alexander; Rosenleitner, Jan",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514667/,398

Bilateral myringotomy and tube (BMT) placement is performed due to persistent effusion with associated symptoms such as decreased hearing. With the COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory stay at home orders (MSHO), children were quarantined at home and many remained home after MSHO. We reviewed the prevalence of middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of BMT during similar time periods in the year before, during and after MSHO in this pandemic year.

Several factors may contribute to this observation, including the effect of lockdown, social distancing, lower humidity, lower air pollution, and potential changes in the intrinsic pathogenicity of the virus. In this regard, the clinical severity of COVID-19 could be attenuated by mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome that decrease its virulence, as well as by lower virus inocula. Methods In this pilot study, we compared the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification profile of 100 nasopharyngeal swabs consecutively collected in April, during the peak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, to that of 100 swabs collected using the same procedure in May. Results The mean Ct value of positive samples collected in May was significantly higher than that of samples collected in the previous period (ORF 1a/b gene: 31.85 ± 0.32 vs. 28.37 ± 0.5, p<0.001; E gene: 33.76 ± 0.38 vs. 29.79 ± 0.63, p<0.001), suggesting a lower viral load at the time of sampling. No significant differences were observed between male and females in the two periods, whilst higher viral loads were found in (i) patients over 60-years old, and (ii) patients that experienced severe COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic. Conclusions This pilot study prompts further investigation on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 load and different clinical manifestation of COVID-19 during different phases of the pandemic.

Internationally, women face significant barriers and times to diagnosis. The prolonged time without a diagnosis may result in treatment delay, with clinical implications of chronic pain and an unknown effect on fertility outcomes. As delays in diagnosis extend, those suffering from endometriosis incur more cost and frequently experience a reduction in quality of life. The scoping review described in this protocol will (1) map current international scientific peer-reviewed and grey literature investigating pathways, timing, and delay of diagnosis of endometriosis, (2) define common concepts used in the literature, and (3) identify gaps for future examination and intervention development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol outlines a scoping review to investigate the current research focused on pathways, timing, and delays in endometriosis diagnosis. The scoping review uses the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology. The researchers applied the Population, Concept, Context approach to form the research questions. A search string of key terms and Medical Subject Headings will be used to systematically search the PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. We will also search ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature sources. The original search was performed in July 2020, and it will be rerun prior to the manuscript submission. Finally, the reference lists of included works will be reviewed for additional studies. The search results will be screened and reviewed according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data will be extracted from the studies identified for final inclusion using a predetermined tool. The resulting data will be analysed to report the state of the science. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The proposed scoping review does not require review or approval by an ethical board. The researchers will disseminate the study results via conference presentations and publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","Cromeens, Martha Grace; Carey, Erin T; Robinson, Whitney R; Knafl, Kathleen; Thoyre, Suzanne",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168034/,398
65049,Relational Modeling for Robust and Efficient Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation in CT Scans.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVES A high rate of thrombotic events has been reported in COVID-19 population. The study aims to assess the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in COVID-19 patients admitted to a single tertiary hospital. METHODS From April 2nd to April 18th, 2020, hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened by lower limb duplex ultrasound (DUS). Patients were on (low molecular weight heparin) LMWH prophylaxis in medical wards, and on therapeutic anticoagulation in intensive care unit (ICU). DVT risk factors, reported by the Padua prediction score and blood tests, were retrieved from institutional electronic charts. The study primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT in the in-hospital COVID-19 population and its association with clinical and laboratory risk factors. The secondary endpoint was the association of DVT with mortality. RESULTS Two hundred patients (median age 62 years, 72% male, 40 in ICU) received DUS screening. DVT was observed in 29 patients (14.5%), with proximal extension in 16 patients, and in association with symptoms in four patients. The DVT rate was similar in ICU (12.5%) and non-ICU patients (15%). Eighty-seven patients underwent a computed tomography angiography (CTA) that showed pulmonary embolism in 35 patients (40.2%) not associated with DVT in 25/35 cases (71.4%). DVT in the ten patients with pulmonary embolism were symptomatic in four and with a proximal localization in eight cases. A D-dimer level ≥5 mg/l at admission was predictive of DVT (OR 1.02; IC95% 1.03-1.16; p = .003). At the multivariate analysis in-hospital mortality was predicted by age (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.02-1.15; p = .004) and by being an ICU patient (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.30-2.25; p = .01). CONCLUSIONS Despite LMWH prophylaxis or full anticoagulant therapy, the incidence of DVT, mainly asymptomatic, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 14.5%.

Methodologies used to assess the anti-demineralization effect included Micro-Computed Tomography, Polarized Light Microscopy and Hardness Testing (Knoop and Berkovich). All seven articles confirmed the superior remineralization effect of BAG orthodontic bonding resins compared to their non-BAG counterparts. A proportional relationship was proved between BAG concentrations and increased anti-demineralization effect. The addition of antibacterial agents to BAG does not necessarily improve its anti-demineralization effect. Although studies have confirmed the effectiveness of BAG orthodontic bonding resins on enamel remineralization, there was a degree of heterogeneity across studies due to the lack of an in vitro studies standardized protocol.","Alamri, Abdulaziz; Salloot, Zainah; Alshaia, Alaa; Ibrahim, Maria Salem",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25112495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471284/,398
66834,"Artificial Intelligence: Promise, Pitfalls, and Perspective.",2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND The drawback of the delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy (DSG) in totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) is the presence of intraoperative duodenal injury and postoperative anastomotic stenosis, which can occur due to a relatively short duodenal bulb diameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS From June 2013 to June 2019, 35 patients with gastric cancer underwent TLDG with a modified DSG consisting of linear stapling and single-layer hand suturing in our institution. All anastomotic procedures were performed by the right hand of the operator positioned between the patient's legs. Linear stapling of the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and duodenum without creating a gap was performed using a 45-mm linear stapler, considering the prevention of intraoperative duodenal injury. The stapler entry hole was closed using a single-layer full-thickness hand suturing technique with knotted sutures and a knotless barbed suture. We described the clinical data and outcomes in the present retrospective patient series. RESULTS No intraoperative duodenal injury occurred in any of the 35 patients. The median staple length at linear stapling of the posterior walls of the remnant stomach and duodenum was 41.7 ± 4.2 (30-45) mm, and 2 patients (5.7%) had a staple length of 30 mm. There were no incidences of postoperative anastomotic stenosis. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that a modified DSG consisting of linear stapling and single-layer hand suturing performed by an operator positioned between the patient's legs can be one option for B-Ⅰ reconstruction following TLDG because it can aid in preventing both intraoperative duodenal injury and postoperative anastomotic stenosis.","Tokuhara, Takaya; Nakata, Eiji; Tenjo, Toshiyuki; Kawai, Isao; Kondo, Keisaku; Hatabe, Shigeru",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142547/,398
67033,A step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management life cycle assessment studies.,2020-07-17,"Ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like (Ubl) modifier interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) participate in the host defence of viral infections. Viruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome human coronavirus (SARS hCoV), have co-opted Ub-ISG15 conjugation pathways for their own advantage or have evolved effector proteins to counter pro-inflammatory properties of Ub-ISG15-conjugated host proteins. In the present study, we compare substrate specificities of the papain-like protease (PLpro) from the recently emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) hCoV to the related protease from SARS, SARS PLpro. Through biochemical assays, we show that, similar to SARS PLpro, MERS PLpro is both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and a deISGylating enzyme. Further analysis of the intrinsic DUB activity of these viral proteases revealed unique differences between the recognition and cleavage specificities of polyUb chains. First, MERS PLpro shows broad linkage specificity for the cleavage of polyUb chains, whereas SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains. Secondly, MERS PLpro cleaves polyUb chains in a 'mono-distributive' manner (one Ub at a time) and SARS PLpro prefers to cleave Lys48-linked polyUb chains by sensing a di-Ub moiety as a minimal recognition element using a 'di-distributive' cleavage mechanism. The di-distributive cleavage mechanism for SARS PLpro appears to be uncommon among USP (Ub-specific protease)-family DUBs, as related USP family members from humans do not display such a mechanism. We propose that these intrinsic enzymatic differences between SARS and MERS PLpro will help to identify pro-inflammatory substrates of these viral DUBs and can guide in the design of therapeutics to combat infection by coronaviruses.","Békés, Miklós; Rut, Wioletta; Kasperkiewicz, Paulina; Mulder, Monique P C; Ovaa, Huib; Drag, Marcin; Lima, Christopher D; Huang, Tony T",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20141170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25764917/,398

70634,Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge with grease trap sludge and municipal solid waste as co-substrates.,2017,"Objectives The Council of Residency Directors (CORD) in Emergency Medicine (EM) has recommended that all residency programs should conduct virtual interviews for the 2020 to 2021 application cycle due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While factors such as geographical region, city, program size, or hospital affiliation are not modifiable, EM residencies can bridge the information gap created by a lack of face-to-face interaction by representing themselves digitally. Measuring usability provides an objective method for EM residencies to improve their Web presence and effectively represent themselves to applicants. Methods Our sample set included 55 U.S. EM residency program websites. Using methodology replicated from previous literature on health care website usability, we divided usability into four categories for quantifiable analysis: accessibility, marketing, content quality, and technology. Analysis was performed on each website and scored in all four categories. A ""general usability"" score was calculated for each website using a composite of the key factors within the four categories. Using a weighted percentage across all of the factors, an overall score was calculated. Results Content quality was the overall highest scoring category (mean ± SD = 5.4, SE = 0.33). The overall lowest performing category was technology (mean ± SD = 0.8 ± 0.09, SE = 0.01). Conclusions Measuring usability can help EM residency programs identify ways to improve their Web presence. To effectively promote their programs, residencies need quality content that communicates their key features. Our recommendation is for all residency programs to periodically perform website audits and apply the usability measures outlined to improve their digital presence, especially during times when face-to-face interactions will be limited.","Fundingsland, Edwin; Fike, Joseph; Calvano, Joshua; Raja, Ali; Lai, Deborah; Silacci, Sara; Haas, Mary; Chan, Teresa; He, Shuhan",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124531/,398

To further investigate these cases, CDC interviewed vaccination site staff members to gather additional information about the reported events and vaccination site practices. Four of the five sites temporarily closed while an investigation took place. Overall, 64 anxiety-related events, including 17 reports of syncope (fainting), an anxiety-related event, among 8,624 Janssen COVID-19 vaccine recipients, were reported from these sites for vaccines administered during April 7-9. As a follow-up to these interviews, CDC analyzed reports of syncope shortly after receipt of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the vaccine safety monitoring program managed by CDC and FDA. To compare the occurrence of these events with those reported after receipt of other vaccines, reports of syncopal events after influenza vaccine administered in the 2019-20 influenza season were also reviewed. Syncope after Janssen COVID-19 vaccination was reported to VAERS (8.2 episodes per 100,000 doses). By comparison, after influenza vaccination, the reporting rate of syncope was 0.05 episodes per 100,000 doses. Anxiety-related events can occur after any vaccination. It is important that vaccination providers are aware that anxiety-related adverse events might be reported more frequently after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine than after influenza vaccination and observe all COVID-19 vaccine recipients for any adverse reactions for at least 15 minutes after vaccine administration.","Hause, Anne M; Gee, Julianne; Johnson, Tara; Jazwa, Amelia; Marquez, Paige; Miller, Elaine; Su, John; Shimabukuro, Tom T; Shay, David K",MMWR.

This study compared the complications of nasal vs. oral vs. nasal + oral intubations performed by first responder crews in facial trauma patients. Our objective was to assess patient outcomes and complications to determine the risk of nasal intubation in facial trauma patients in the prehospital setting. METHODS Patients with facial trauma between 2008 and 13 were abstracted from the Miami Valley Hospital trauma registry: 50 were nasal only (n), 27 nasal + oral (no), and 135 oral only (o) intubation. Analysis of variance with the post-hoc Least Significance Difference Test and the chi square test were used in the analysis. RESULTS The oral group was older [41.1 ± 17.6 (o) vs. 36.2 ± 14.1 (n) vs. 33.0 ± 15.7 (no), p = 0.032] and had a higher facial abbreviated injury severity (AIS) mean score (1.8 ± 0.6 vs. 1.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.5 ± 0.5, p < 0.001). The three groups did not differ in mortality (n = 20% vs. o = 18% vs. no = 30%, p = 0.37). The n + o group was intubated longer (p < 0.001) and had longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay (p = 0.015 and p = 0.023). The three groups did not differ on the composite of any pulmonary complication - i.e., any one of sinusitis, pneumonia, atelectasis, and respiratory failure - 44% (no) vs. 24% (o) vs. 30% (n), p = 0.10). However, nasal + oral patients were more likely to have one or more of the eight complication studied [63% (no) vs. 28% (o) vs. 34% (n), p = 0.002], and have a longer ICU and HLOS. CONCLUSIONS Prehospital nasal intubation is a viable short-term alternative to oral intubation in patients with facial trauma and warrants further research.","Jazayeri-Moghaddas, Omeed Payam; Tse, Wayne; Herzing, Karen A; Markert, Ronald J; Gans, Alyssa J; McCarthy, Mary C",American journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2016.11.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863722/,398

OBJECTIVES: To (1) understand the perspectives of formulary decision makers on challenges to optimal schizophrenia population management and (2) identify best practices and recommendations for mitigating these challenges. METHODS: This mixed-methods study, conducted in a double-blind manner, comprised in-depth telephone interviews with formulary decision makers from February through May 2020, and a web-based follow-on survey that was sent to all participants in October 2020. US-based formulary decision makers were recruited if they were directly involved in schizophrenia drug formulary or coverage decision making for national or regional payers, health systems, or behavioral health centers. Formulary decision makers' perceptions of challenges, policies, and programs related to schizophrenia population health management were assessed generally and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 19 formulary decision makers participated in the interviews and 18 (95%) completed the survey. Participants reported a spectrum of patient- and payer-driven challenges in schizophrenia population health management, including medication nonadherence, high pharmacy and medical costs, and frequent hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Participants noted that COVID-19 had worsened all identified challenges, although patient unemployment (mean score of 2.00 on a scale of 1 [made much worse] to 5 [made much better]) and reduced access to psychiatric care (mean score, 2.12) were most negatively affected. The most common strategies implemented in order to improve schizophrenia population health management included case management (89%), telemedicine (83%), care coordination programs (72%), strategies to mitigate barriers to accessing medication (61%), and providing nonmedical services to address social determinants of health (56%). Participants noted that, ideally, all treatments for schizophrenia would be available on their formularies without utilization management policies in place in order to increase accessibility to medication, but cost to the health plans made that difficult. Whereas 61% of respondents believed that long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) were currently underused in their organizations, only 28% represented organizations with open access policies for LAIs. Participants believed that among patients with schizophrenia, LAIs were most beneficial for those with a history of poor or uncertain adherence to oral medications (mean score of 4.50 on a scale of 1 [not at all beneficial] to 5 [extremely beneficial]) and those with recurring emergency department visits and inpatient stays (mean score, 3.94). Study participants reported slightly increased use of LAIs (mean score of 3.17 on a scale of 1 [negatively impacted] to 5 [positively impacted]) among their patients with schizophrenia in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 29% of participants reported easing access restrictions for LAIs. CONCLUSIONS: Participants described persisting challenges and various approaches intended to improve schizophrenia population health management. They also recommended strategies to optimize future health management for this population, including expanding programs to address social determinants of health and mitigating barriers to accessing treatment.

Objective To develop and validate a clinical score at hospital admission for predicting which patients with COVID-19 will develop critical illness based on a nationwide cohort in China. Design, Setting, and Participants Collaborating with the National Health Commission of China, we established a retrospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions as of January 31, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables ascertained at hospital admission were screened using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-GRAM). The score provides an estimate of the risk that a hospitalized patient with COVID-19 will develop critical illness. Accuracy of the score was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Data from 4 additional cohorts in China hospitalized with COVID-19 were used to validate the score. Data were analyzed between February 20, 2020 and March 17, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, critical illness was defined as the composite measure of admission to the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, or death. Results The development cohort included 1590 patients. the mean (SD) age of patients in the cohort was 48.9 (15.7) years; 904 (57.3%) were men. The validation cohort included 710 patients with a mean (SD) age of 48.2 (15.2) years, and 382 (53.8%) were men and 172 (24.2%). From 72 potential predictors, 10 variables were independent predictive factors and were included in the risk score: chest radiographic abnormality (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.38), age (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05), hemoptysis (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 1.36-15.15), dyspnea (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.18-3.01), unconsciousness (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.39-15.98), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.27-2.00), cancer history (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.23-13.43), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), lactate dehydrogenase (OR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001-1.004) and direct bilirubin (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24). The mean AUC in the development cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). The score has been translated into an online risk calculator that is freely available to the public (http://118.126.104.170/).

These measures have been associated with reduced incidence of other respiratory illnesses such as influenza. It is currently unclear what effect these measures have on non-respiratory communicable diseases. The incidence of notifiable non-respiratory communicable diseases within the NT, from 15 March to 15 May 2020, the period of most restrictive physical distancing, was monitored and is here compared with two control periods: (i) the 4 months immediately prior and (ii) the same two-month period from the preceding 5 years. During the study period, there was a decline in incidence of communicable enteric illnesses, particularly in shigellosis and rotavirus where person-to-person spread is the main transmission route. There was an increase in chlamydial conjunctivitis in areas with endemic trachoma, which is under further investigation. There was no observed increase in conditions associated with crowding, such as those related to group A streptococcal infection.","Xie, Ouli; Markey, Peter G; Draper, Anthony D K; Krause, Vicki L",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.90; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278872/,398

80118,Update of Pediatric Heart Failure.,2020-10-01,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus with suspected bat origins, highlights a critical need for heightened understanding of the mechanisms by which bats maintain potentially zoonotic viruses at the population level and transmit these pathogens across species. We review mechanistic models, which test hypotheses of the transmission dynamics that underpin viral maintenance in bat systems. A search of the literature identified only twenty-five mechanistic models of bat-virus systems published to date, derived from twenty-three original studies. Most models focused on rabies and related lyssaviruses (eleven), followed by Ebola-like filoviruses (seven), Hendra and Nipah-like henipaviruses (five), and coronaviruses (two). The vast majority of studies has modelled bat virus transmission dynamics at the population level, though a few nested within-host models of viral pathogenesis in population-level frameworks, and one study focused on purely within-host dynamics. Population-level studies described bat virus systems from every continent but Antarctica, though most were concentrated in North America and Africa; indeed, only one simulation model with no associated data was derived from an Asian bat-virus system. In fact, of the twenty-five models identified, only ten population-level models were fitted to data - emphasizing an overall dearth of empirically derived epidemiological inference in bat virus systems. Within the data fitted subset, the vast majority of models were fitted to serological data only, highlighting extensive uncertainty in our understanding of the transmission status of a wild bat. Here, we discuss similarities and differences in the approach and findings of previously published bat virus models and make recommendations for improvement in future work.","Gentles, Anecia D; Guth, Sarah; Rozins, Carly; Brook, Cara E",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2020.1833161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185145/,398

Prescriber education would likely reduce deaths through a reduction in patient access to pharmaceutical opioid analgesics. CONCLUSIONS The system dynamics approach may have potential for opioid-related policy evaluation. However, metrics must be carefully selected, and trade-offs may be involved. For example, it may be difficult to limit negative outcomes associated with pharmaceutical opioids without adversely affecting chronic pain patients' access to pharmaceutical treatment. Ultimately, a combination of metrics and value judgments will be needed to properly evaluate mitigation strategies.","Wakeland, Wayne; Schmidt, Teresa; Gilson, Aaron M; Haddox, J David; Webster, Lynn R",Pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-4637.2011.01127.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668757/,398

Early and ongoing diagnosis and treatment is required for this progressive disease. Lifestyle modifications can prevent or delay disease progression and improve symptoms. Limb-sparing endovascular interventions can restore circulation based on appropriate diagnostic testing to pinpoint vascular targets, and intervention must occur as early as possible to ensure optimal clinical outcomes. An algorithm for the diagnosis and management of PAD was developed to enable a collaborative approach between the family practice and primary care physician or internist and various specialists that may include a diabetologist, endocrinologist, smoking cessation expert, hypertension and lipid specialist, endovascular interventionalist, vascular surgeon, orthopedist, neurologist, nurse practitioner, podiatrist, wound healing expert, and/or others. A multidisciplinary team working together has the greatest chance of providing optimal care for the patient with PAD and ensuring ongoing surveillance of the patient's overall health, ultimately resulting in better quality of life and increased longevity for patients with PAD.","Walker, Craig M; Bunch, Frank T; Cavros, Nick G; Dippel, Eric J",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s79355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26203234/,398

Sixty-three COVID-19 patients and 43 non-COVID-19 patients with similar clinical phenotypes and/or imaging findings were enrolled to test the levels of KL-6 using chemiluminescent immunoassay. In addition, the blood gas, imaging and lymphocyte factors tests were collected from all participants. The data was finally analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were higher than those in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). Moreover, the KL-6 levels in severe and critically severe patients were significantly upregulated compared with patients with mild and common type (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the imaging evaluation showed a significant correlation between KL-6 and pulmonary lesion area (P < 0.05). KL-6 was also found to be significantly correlated with oxygenation index and oxygen partial pressure difference of alveolar artery (PA-aDO2) (Both P < 0.01). In conclusion, KL-6 could be an indicator to evaluate the progression of COVID-19, which is parallel to the level of lung injury and inflammation in patients. Moreover, it can also reflect the pulmonary ventilation function.","Xue, Mingshan; Zheng, Peiyan; Bian, Xiqing; Huang, Zhifeng; Huang, Huimin; Zeng, Yifeng; Hu, Haisheng; Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhou, Luqian; Sun, Baoqing; Wu, Jian-Lin; Zhong, Nanshan",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32565512/,398

The ICD may interpret electromagnetic signals as a tachyarrhythmia and deliver an inappropriate shock to the patient. Magnet placement is often used to avoid this problem since a magnet will often deactivate an ICD's tachyarrhythmia therapy. We report a case in which magnet placement over an ICD failed to suspend tachyarrhythmia therapy because of imprecise magnet positioning. This case demonstrates the possibility for error when relying on a magnet to suspend tachyarrhythmia therapies.,"Gajendran, Vishal K; Contractor, Tahmeed; Tone, Ryan C; Mascetti, Carin R; McCabe, Melissa D",A&A practice,https://doi.org/10.1213/xaa.0000000000001465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999010/,398
83339,Antioxidant and Nutritional Properties of Domestic and Commercial Coconut Milk Preparations.,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) is a novel framework for diagnosing malnutrition and requires evaluation in wide-ranging clinical settings. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malnutrition and its phenotypic characteristics among lung transplantation (LTx) candidates comparing GLIM to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria. METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of all adult patients assessed for LTx in a one-year period. Phenotypic criteria included body mass index (BMI), unintentional loss of weight (LOW) over a 12-month period and fat-free mass index (FFMI) using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Systemic inflammation associated with severe end-stage lung disease met GLIM's etiological criterion. Diagnosis of malnutrition, and its severity, were classified according to each of GLIM and ICD-10. RESULTS Of 130 patients, 112 (86%) had all data to classify malnutrition. Malnutrition prevalence according to GLIM was 59%, which was markedly greater than using ICD-10 criteria (26%). Half of the LTx patients were moderately malnourished using GLIM, compared to 19% using ICD-10. A similar proportion were severely malnourished using GLIM (9%) and ICD-10 (7%). Fat-free mass (FFM) depletion (47% of all patients) was a major contributor to GLIM-malnutrition. Over 60% of LTx patients with GLIM-malnutrition were not detected as malnourished using ICD-10 criteria. CONCLUSION Malnutrition diagnosis using GLIM was higher than using ICD-10 in LTx patients, primarily attributable to the incorporation of quantitative evaluation of FFM depletion. This highlights the utility of the GLIM framework and the importance of including body composition in malnutrition assessment.","Emsley, Christie; King, Susannah; Nyulasi, Ibolya; Snell, Gregory",Clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.02.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932798/,398

Children have a less severe presentation and better prognosis compared to adults. However, little is known regarding the spectrum of COVID-19 infection in children and adolescents with underlying autoimmune disorders necessitating solid organ transplant and long-term immunosuppressive therapy. Case Report. An adolescent male developed end-stage kidney disease secondary to microscopic polyangiitis requiring a living-donor kidney transplant. Six years later, he developed antibody-mediated rejection of his kidney transplant. During his rejection treatment course, he contracted SARS-CoV-2 and developed new-onset nephrotic syndrome with severe acute kidney injury. Kidney transplant biopsy revealed de novo collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on a background of chronic active antibody mediated rejection. Immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 on the biopsy specimen demonstrated positive staining of the proximal tubular epithelium consistent with intra-renal viral infection. Pulse corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and temporary reduction of anti-metabolite therapy resulted in successful recovery with return of graft function back to pre-infection baseline. This case highlights the clinical conundrum of treating kidney transplant recipients with active rejection in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric kidney transplant recipients can develop severe COVID-19-related kidney complications. Judicious immunosuppression modulation is necessary to balance infection and rejection risk.","Levenson, Emma; Shepherd, Tara N; Aviles, Diego; Craver, Randall; Ehlayel, Abdulla; Love, Gordon L; Simms, K'Joy; Straatmann, Caroline; Ashoor, Isa F",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.14013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773007/,398

Current treatment options for MLL include percutaneous drainage and open irrigation and debridement. A few cases of suction-assisted lipectomy (SAL) have been described for subacute and chronic MLL of the lower extremity. We present the first case report of using a closed SAL system to treat an acute MLL of the upper extremity. A 78-year-old female with right forearm MLL presented after blunt force trauma while on apixaban. After inpatient monitoring and anticoagulant drug clearance, a closed system SAL was performed to evacuate the hematoma and prevent ischemia of overlying soft tissues. Treatment outcomes were measured by clinical exam and CT imaging. Pre-operative diagnostic CT scan demonstrated a 4.8 x 6.6 x 13 cm fluid collection between fascial layers of the right forearm. SAL resulted in the evacuation of 300 cc of coagulated blood. Post-operative CT imaging of the right upper extremity did not show any measurable fluid collection. Clinical exam demonstrated resolution of swelling and soft tissue compromise. The patient reported significant pain reduction, resumed her anticoagulation, and was discharged home. There were no notable complications at her three month post-operative visit. Consideration of a constant low-pressure SAL system can successfully treat MLL in the acute period. This system is relatively minimally invasive, results in faster healing times compared to open debridement, and still results in effective hematoma evacuation.","Patel, Anooj; Wee, Corinne; Ng, Mitchell K; Kumar, Anand; Harvey, Donald",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642352/,398

The COVID-19 pandemic pushed telemedicine from small and pilot programs to widespread practice at an unprecedented rate. With the rapid implementation of telemedicine, it is important to consider how to create a telehealth system that provides both good care for patients and families while maintaining an excellent education environment for trainees of all levels. To this end, we developed telemedicine educational milestones to describe novel skills required to provide high quality telemedicine care, and allow trainees and clinical educators a metric by which to assess trainee progress. We also created methods and tools to help trainees learn and families feel comfortable in their new role as virtual collaborators. We envision a time when safety does not set the venue; instead the needs of the patient will dictate whether a virtual or in-person visit is the right choice for a family. We expect that pediatric medical genetics and metabolism groups across the country will continue to set a standard of a hybrid care system to meet the unique needs of each individual patient, using telemedicine technology.","Cohen, Andrea J; Shur, Natasha; Starin, Danielle; MacLeod, Erin; Roshan Lal, Tamanna; Leon, Eyby; Regier, Debra S","American journal of medical genetics.

However, the small body of applied psychology literature on large-scale disruptive events has paid insufficient attention to this important topic. Further, different from acute events (e.g., disasters), the ongoing pandemic poses an additional challenge for organizations as they seek to effectively protect employees' job engagement from health and safety threats in the workplace. To address these gaps, we drew from job reattachment research and investigated it as an important antecedent of job engagement for employees returning to work. Moreover, we incorporated leader safety commitment as a moderator that can strengthen the effectiveness of job reattachment in enhancing job engagement. We further linked engagement to work withdrawal, use of personal protective equipment (e.g., wearing a mask), and task performance to underscore the downstream implications of job reattachment. To test our research model, we collected multiwave, multisource data from the original epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic-Wuhan, China-where many employees were returning to work. The results provide strong support for our model. In addition to extending research on large-scale disruptive events, the current study has important implications for organizations and employees in the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result there has been considerable research into differential diagnostics, with some researchers indicating there is a need for new vaccines containing different strains of CPV-2. In this study we investigated whether vaccination with a CPV-2b containing vaccine would induce cross-reactive antibody responses to the other CPV-2 variants. Two studies where dogs were vaccinated with a multivalent vaccine, subsequently challenged with CPV-2b and sera samples analysed are presented. Six week old pups with defined serological status were vaccinated twice, three weeks apart and challenged either 5 weeks (MDA override study) or one year after vaccination (duration of immunity study). Sera samples were collected before each vaccination and at periods throughout each study. In each study the antibody profiles were very similar; serological responses against CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c were higher than those for CPV-2. Nevertheless, responses against CPV-2 were well above levels considered clinically protective. In each study dogs also showed a rapid increase in antibody titres following vaccination, reached a plateau following second vaccination with a slight decline to challenge after which rapid anamnestic responses were seen. Evaluation of the serological responses suggests vaccination with CPV-2b would cross-protect against CPV-2a and CPV-2c, as well as against CPV-2 which is now extinct in the field. In conclusion we have demonstrated that vaccination of minimum aged dogs with a multivalent vaccine containing the CPV-2b variant strain will induce serological responses which are cross-reactive against all currently circulating field strains, CPV-2a and CPV-2c, and the now extinct field strain CPV-2.","Wilson, Stephen; Illambas, Joanna; Siedek, Elisabeth; Stirling, Catrina; Thomas, Anne; Plevová, Edita; Sture, Gordon; Salt, Jeremy",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25148778/,398

During mitotic entry, the PCM matrix increases in size and nucleating capacity in a process called centrosome maturation. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited to centrosomes and phosphorylates PCM matrix proteins to drive their self-assembly, which leads to PCM expansion. Here, we show that in addition to controlling PCM expansion, PLK1 independently controls the generation of binding sites for γ-tubulin complexes on the PCM matrix. Selectively preventing the generation of PLK1-dependent γ-tubulin docking sites led to spindle defects and impaired chromosome segregation without affecting PCM expansion, highlighting the importance of phospho-regulated centrosomal γ-tubulin docking sites in spindle assembly. Inhibiting both γ-tubulin docking and PCM expansion by mutating substrate target sites recapitulated the effects of loss of centrosomal PLK1 on the ability of centrosomes to catalyze spindle assembly.","Ohta, Midori; Zhao, Zhiling; Wu, Di; Wang, Shaohe; Harrison, Jennifer L; Gómez-Cavazos, J Sebastián; Desai, Arshad; Oegema, Karen F",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202009083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399854/,398

Although the mechanisms behind HS are not fully understood, it is known that dietary factors play important roles in flare frequency and severity. We hypothesize that the high fat diet (HFD) causes dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in susceptible individuals, which subsequently elevate inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). This increase in dysbiosis-led inflammation coupled with a dysregulation of the 1-carbon metabolism results in an increase in matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, MMP-8, and MMP-9 along with tissue matrix remodeling in the development and maintenance of the lesions and tracts. This manuscript weaves together the potential roles played by the gut microbiome, HHcy, MMPs, and the 1-carbon metabolism toward HS disease causation in susceptible individuals.","Molnar, Jack; Mallonee, Carissa Jo; Stanisic, Dragana; Homme, Rubens P; George, Akash K; Singh, Mahavir; Tyagi, Suresh C",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973741/,398

Patients with resectable cancers are commonly treated by either a Whipple procedure or distal pancreatectomy (DP) based on the location of the tumor. Central pancreatectomy (CP) is a less commonly performed operation that has recently been utilized for resection of these now more frequently diagnosed low-grade and benign lesions located in the mid pancreas. Lesions that may have a relatively more indolent nature include branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMNs), mucinous cystic neoplasms, neuroendocrine tumors, and solid pseudopapillary tumors. The goal of a CP is complete extirpation of the lesion, while preserving pancreatic parenchyma to reduce the risks of developing diabetes and exocrine insufficiency (EI). Although open CP has been shown to be safe and efficacious, the outcomes of a minimally invasive approach are still relatively underreported and therefore unknown.

This variability has a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality and limits the generalizability of clinical trial results. This review aims to highlight recent studies that have proposed new innovative approaches to decipher this heterogeneity, in particular, by attempting to optimize disease classification. RECENT FINDINGS The historical dichotomy limited/diffuse subsets based on cutaneous involvement has been challenged by studies highlighting an underestimated heterogeneity between these two subtypes and showing that presence of organ damage and autoantibody profiles markedly influenced survival beyond skin extension. Advanced computational methods using unsupervised machine learning analyses of clinical variables and/or high-throughput omics technologies, clinical variables trajectories modelling overtime or radiomics have provided significant insights on key pathogenic processes that could help defining new subgroups beyond the diffuse/limited subsets.

RESULTS Concurrent pancreatectomy or splenectomy was performed on 48 patients. The median operation time was 230 min, and the median number of lymph nodes harvested per patient was 60.5. The TNM stages of the tumor were Ib in 9 patients (9.6 %), IIa in 16 (17 %), IIb in 7 (7.4 %), IIIa in 16 (17 %), IIIb in 17 (18.1 %), IIIc in 25 (26.6 %), and IV in 4 (4.3 %). Major morbidity (≥ grade IIIa) occurred in 9 patients (9.6 %) without postoperative mortality. At last follow-up, tumor recurrence had occurred in 13 patients with a median follow-up time of 12.77 months. CONCLUSIONS The acceptable rate of major morbidity in our series suggested that laparoscopic total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is applicable to AGC. Long-term follow-up is mandatory to validate long-term outcome.","Lee, Ju-Hee; Ahn, Sang-Hoon; Park, Do Joong; Kim, Hyung-Ho; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Yang, Han-Kwang",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-012-1669-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22674092/,398

We investigated the impact of acute and chronic changes in carbon supply on inter-guild competition in two moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR), operated with (R1) and without (R0) external organic carbon supply. The microbial and nitrifying community composition of the reactors differed significantly. Interestingly, acute increases in the dissolved organic carbon inhibited nitrification in R1 ten times more than in R0. A sustained increase in the carbon supply decreased nitrification efficiency and increased denitrification activity to a greater extent in R1, and also increased the proportion of potential denitrifiers in both bioreactors. The findings suggest that autotrophic biofilms subjected to increases in carbon supply show higher nitrification and lower denitrification activity than carbon-fed biofilms. This has significant implications for the design of nitrifying bioreactors. Specifically, efficient removal of organic matter before the nitrification unit can improve the robustness of the bioreactor to varying influent quality. Thus, maintaining a low C/N ratio is important in nitrifying biofilters when acute carbon stress is expected or when anoxic activity (e.g. denitrification or H2S production) is undesirable, such as in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS).","Navada, Sharada; Knutsen, Maja F; Bakke, Ingrid; Vadstein, Olav",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64027-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346018/,398
105424,Title A Knowledge Graph to Understand Nursing Big Data: Case Example for Guidance.,2021-04-03,"There is a shred of evidence of environmental degradation in the form of carbon emissions to behave differently when tested with different macroeconomic variables. This paper aims to examine the long-run and short-run association between natural resource rent, financial development, and urbanization on carbon emission from the context of the USA during 1995-2015 with the help of a contemporary and innovative approach named quantile autoregressive distributed lagged model (QARDL). The stated approach is applied due to the fact that non-linearity is observed for the study variables. The findings indicated that the higher financial development (0.304), natural resource rent (0.102), and urbanization (0.489) have a positive impact on the environmental degradation in the region of USA during long-run estimation in the stated quantiles of the study. This would indicate that higher financial development, urbanization, and natural resources are putting more environmental pressure on the economy of the USA. Similarly, the findings under short-run estimation confirm that past and lagged values of carbon emission, financial development, natural resource rent, and urbanization are significantly determining the current values of the carbon emission. For this reason, it is suggested that the government requires some immediate steps of the USA to control the harmful effect of such financial development, more urbanization, and higher natural resource rent as well. This would indicate the reflection of some green strategies in all three explanatory variables to generate some fruitful environmental outcomes.","Huang, Shi-Zheng; Sadiq, Muhammad; Chien, Fengsheng",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16818-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652619/,398

Amidst significant regional variations in COVID-19, lung transplantation (LTx) remains a critical life-saving operation. Our LTx practice during the early pandemic may provide a blueprint for managing LTx in an era of continued community prevalence. Patients who underwent LTx at our institution between March 1 and May 20, 2020 were included. Recipient, operative, and donor characteristics were compared to those from our program in 2019, and COVID-19 testing practices were evaluated for March, April, and May to understand how our practice adapted to the pandemic. Our program performed 36 LTx, 33% more than the same period in 2019. Recipient, operative, and donor characteristics during COVID-19 were similar to those in 2019. By April 1, all donors and recipients underwent pre-transplant COVID-19 testing, all returning negative results. To date, no recipients have developed post-transplant COVID-19. At our institution, pre-transplant COVID-19 testing, use of local donor lungs, and avoidance of donors from areas of increased community penetration supported a safe and effective LTx practice during the early COVID-19 pandemic.

(2020).",2021-03-08,"Predatory hunting is an important approach for animals to obtain valuable nutrition and energy, which critically depends on heightened arousal. Yet the neural substrates underlying predatory hunting remain largely undefined. Here, we report that basal forebrain (BF) GABAergic neurons play an important role in regulating predatory hunting. Our results showed that BF GABAergic neurons were activated during the prey (cricket)-hunting and food feeding in mice. Optogenetic activation of BF GABAergic neurons evoked immediate predatory-like actions to both artificial and natural preys, significantly reducing the attack latency while increasing the attack probability and the number of killed natural prey (crickets). Similar to the effect of activating the soma of BF GABAergic neurons, photoactivation of their terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) also strongly promotes predatory hunting. Moreover, photoactivation of GABAergic BF - VTA pathway significantly increases the intake of various food in mice. By synchronous recording of electroencephalogram and electromyogram, we showed that photoactivation of GABAergic BF - VTA pathway induces instant arousal and maintains long-term wakefulness. In summary, our results clearly demonstrated that the GABAergic BF is a key neural substrate for predatory hunting, and promotes this behavior through GABAergic BF - VTA pathway.","Cai, Ping; Chen, Li; Guo, Yu-Rou; Yao, Jing; Chen, Hui-Yun; Lu, Yi-Ping; Huang, Sheng-Nan; He, Peng; Zheng, Ze-Hong; Liu, Ji-Yuan; Chen, Jian; Hu, Li-Huan; Chen, Shang-Yi; Huang, Le-Tong; Chen, Guo-Qiang; Tang, Wei-Tao; Su, Wei-Kun; Li, Huang-Yuan; Wang, Wen-Xiang; Yu, Chang-Xi",Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2020.108299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916145/,398

We explored the efficacy and safety of ≥ 12-month DAPT among MMACS patients. METHODS In this sub-analysis of the optimal antiplatelet therapy for Chinese Patients with Coronary Artery Disease study (NCT01735305), clinical outcomes among MMACS patients were compared between the < 12-month and ≥ 12-month DAPT groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Safety endpoints included the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 2-5, BARC 3-5, and all bleeding events. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare baseline characteristics between the < 12-month and ≥ 12-month DAPT groups. RESULTS In this cohort of ACS patients (n = 10,016), MMACS patients (n = 2967) were less likely to use DAPT at 12 (31.64% vs. 67.47%, P < 0.0001) and 24 (13.82% vs. 18.71%, P < 0.0001) months and experienced more ischemic events at 12 (4.55% vs. 3.40%, P = 0.006) and 24 (6.88% vs. 5.08%, P = 0.0004) months than those treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 7049). Among MMACS patients, the rate of primary efficacy endpoint occurring within the second year was significantly higher in the < 12-month DAPT group than in the ≥ 12-month group both before (2.88% vs. 1.60%, P = 0.040) and after (3.19% vs. 1.71%, P = 0.045) PSM. After PSM, no significant differences in all bleeding, BARC 2-5, and BARC 3-5 bleeding were found between the groups. CONCLUSION MMACS patients with insufficient DAPT management experienced relatively more ischemic events. DAPT for at least 1 year may be beneficial to this special population without significantly increasing the bleeding risks.

In this study, we examined the ability of nicotinamide (NA) to potentiate the activity of different classes of antibiotics against Burkholderia thailandensis persister cells. Here we demonstrate that addition of NA in in vitro models of B. thailandensis infection resulted in a significant depletion of the persister population in response to various classes of antibiotics. We applied microfluidic bioreactors with a continuous medium flow to study the effect of supplementation with an NA gradient on the recovery of B. thailandensis persister populations. A coculture of human neutrophils preactivated with 50 µM NA and B. thailandensis resulted in the most efficient reduction in the persister population. Applying single-cell RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and quantitative PCR, we found that NA inhibited gene expression of the stringent response regulator relA, implicated in the regulation of the persister metabolic state. We also demonstrate that a therapeutic dose of NA (250 mg/kg of body weight), previously applied as immunoprophylaxis against antibiotic-resistant bacterial species, produced adverse effects in an in vivo murine model of infection with the highly pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, indicating that therapeutic dose and metabolite effects have to be carefully evaluated and tailored for every case of potential clinical application.","Micheva-Viteva, Sofiya N; Ross, Brittany N; Gao, Jun; Adikari, Samantha; Zhang, Pengfei; Mourant, Judith R; Wu, Terry H; Werner, James H; Torres, Alfredo G; Hong-Geller, Elizabeth",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00592-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30323029/,398

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients with cam-type FAI who underwent hip arthroscopy in our institute from January 2018 to June 2019. All hip arthroscopic procedures were performed by one experienced surgeon in the same manner, except the fashions of capsulotomy. Fifty six patients with mean age of 39.1 and mean body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 were categorized into two groups according to the fashions of capsulotomy. Twenty six cases with longitudinal outside-in capsulotomy were categorized into Group L, and 30 cases with transversal interportal capsulotomy were categorized into Group T as the control group. The demographic parameters were retrieved from medical documents and compared between the two groups. Surgical outcome including overall surgical time, traction time, complications, visual analogue score (VAS), and intraoperative radiation exposure were compared to investigate the security and feasibility. Radiographic assessment, and functional outcome were compared between the two groups to determine the clinical efficacy of the longitudinal capsulotomy. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the demography and duration of follow-up between the two groups. The overall surgical time demonstrated no significant difference between Group L and Group T (130.8 ± 16.6 min and 134.0 ± 14.7 min, P = 0.490). Significantly decreased traction time was found in Group L (43.2 ± 8.4 min and 62.2 ± 8.6 min, P < 0.001) compared to Group T. The Median of the fluoroscopic shot was 1 and 3 (P < 0.001). No major complications and reoperation were reported in both groups. The case of intraoperative iatrogenic injure was 0 (0%) and 6 (20%) in Group L and Group T respectively (P = 0.035), and the case of postoperative neurapraxia was 0 (0%) and 8 (26.6%) in Group L and Group T respectively (P = 0.017). The Median of postoperative VAS was 2 and 3 in Group L Group T (P = 0.002). The postoperative α angle was 42.3° ± 3.4° and 44.4° ± 3.5° in group L and group T respectively (P = 0.001). The postoperative iHOT-12 score at final follow-up was 79.3 ± 6.7 and 77.0 ± 7.9 respectively (P = 0.141). CONCLUSION Longitudinal outside-in capsulotomy with less radiation exposure, reduced traction time, and reduced complications could be a safe and feasible procedure in arthroscopic treatment for cam FAI.

METHODS Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of all elderly COVID- 19 patients treated in Changsha Public Health Treatment Center from January 17, 2020 to March 15, 2020, which included basic diseases, symptoms, test results, and other clinical characteristics, and prognostic indicators such as severity of illness, length of hospital stay, virus shedding time and mortality rate. The differences in clinical characteristics and prognostic indicators between elderly, middle-aged, and young COVID-19 patients were also analyzed. Logistic regression model was used to conduct univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for developing severe events in elderly COVID-19 patients; receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the prediction efficacy. RESULTS Of the 230 COVID-19 adult patients, 34 were young patients (14.8%), 136 were middle-aged patients (59.1%), and 60 were elderly (26.1%). Among the 60 elderly patients, 23 were male (38.3%) and 37 were female (61.7%), with a medium age of 66 years old. Common symptoms were fever (66.7%), cough (50.0%), and fatigue (41.7%). C reactive protein (CRP) was increased significantly. The proportion of severe cases was 31.7%, and mortality was 1.7%. The median length of hospitalization and median virus shedding time were 18.5 days and 21 days, respectively. Compared with the young and the middle-aged patients, the elderly had a higher proportion of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, more common shortness of breath, higher proportions of pneumonia and severe cases (all P<0.05), and the decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage (both P<0.05), as well as higher CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels (both P<0.05). Compared with non-severe cases, severe elderly patients demonstrated higher CRP and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (all P<0.05), the reduced lymphocyte count (P<0.05), and the prolonged length of hospitalization and virus shedding duration (both P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the lymphocytes proportion, CRP and AST levels were significantly correlated with the risk for developing severe events in elderly COVID-19 patients (all P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression found that severe events in elderly patients with COVID-19 were significantly correlated with CRP level (OR=1.041, P=0.013). ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for CRP to diagnose severe events in elderly COVID 19 patients was 0.851. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of severe cases in elderly COVID-19 patients is higher than that in young and middle-aged patients. CRP level has a good predictive value for the possibility of severe events in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Guyi; Wu, Chenfang; Zhang, Quan; Yu, Bo; LÜ, Jianlei; Zhang, Siye; Wu, Guobao; Wu, Ying; Zhong, Yanjun",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

117921,Chronic stress in practice assistants: An analytic approach comparing four machine learning classifiers with a standard logistic regression model.,2021,"BACKGROUND In a rural Irish hospital, a simple clinical score (SCS) determined at the time of admission enabled stratification of acute general medical admissions into five categories that were associated incrementally with patients' immediate and 30-day mortality. The aim of this study was to examine the representative performance of this SCS in predicting the outcomes of general medical admissions to an Australian teaching hospital. METHODS A retrospective chart review was undertaken of a representative sample from 480 admissions in 2007 to an urban university teaching hospital in Australia. The SCS was calculated and related to that patient's outcome in terms of mortality, length of stay, nursing home placement on discharge, the occurrence of medical emergency team call and intensive care unit transfer. These data were compared, where possible, with the outcomes reported in the Irish hospital. RESULTS Four hundred and seventeen complete sets of data allowed calculation of the SCS. There were significant linear correlations of the SCS (divided into quintiles) and patients' in-hospital and 30-day mortality, their length of stay and their discharge to a nursing home. There was no association of the SCS and the patients' readmission rate, intensive care unit transfer rate or likelihood of a medical emergency team call. The significant trends replicated those from the Irish hospital. CONCLUSION The SCS can predict significant outcomes for general medical admissions in an Australian hospital despite obvious differences to the hospital of its derivation. A wider study of Australasian hospitals and the performance of the SCS as a predictor of general medical admission outcomes is underway.","Li, J Y Z; Yong, T Y; Hakendorf, P; Roberts, S; O'Brien, L; Sharma, Y; Ben-Tovim, D; Thompson, C H",Internal medicine journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02498.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21470353/,398

This study compares wound related complications, patient satisfaction, and functional outcome following open carpal tunnel decompression in patients undergoing wound closure with either of two common absorbable and nonabsorbable suture types. MATERIALS AND METHODS 53 patients underwent CTD with either 4/0 polypropylene (ProleneTM, n = 28) or 4/0 polyglactin (Vicryl RapideTM, n = 25) for skin closure. QuickDASH, VAS satisfaction scores, and Southampton wound scores were assessed preoperatively and at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS At 6 weeks the mean QuickDASH scores postoperatively were 18.54 and 17.70 for absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures, respectively, (P = 0.86). The mean VAS scores were 0.61 and 0.42 (P = 0.91), respectively. All patients achieved a Southampton wound score of 0 by 6 weeks except one, who achieved 1C in the nonabsorbable group, equivalent to mild erythema. There were no complications in either group. CONCLUSION Both suture types are safe and effective materials for CTD, and we recommend surgeons to choose according to personal preference, handling properties, and resources available for suture removal.","MacFarlane, Robert J; Donnelly, Thomas D; Khan, Yousaf; Morapudi, Syam; Waseem, Mohammad; Fischer, Jochen",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/270137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25165693/,398

Our objective was to report on a new technique to solve this problem. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS We describe our experience with the use of cryopreserved iliac artery grafts for right renal vein extension. Two renal grafts from living donors with a short right renal vein were subjected to an extension with a cryopreserved external iliac artery allograft. There were no perioperative or postoperative complications. There were also no changes in ischemia times. The renal implantation was performed easily and conveniently using our standard technique. For the first and second procedures, at 3 and 3.5 years after surgery, respectively, both vascular grafts maintain good patency, and the renal function of both recipients is optimal. CONCLUSION Tissue-banked cryopreserved cadaveric vessels can be a useful tool in renal transplant surgery. The use of a cryopreserved iliac artery for renal vein extension is a simple and effective new technique that can be added to the pool of surgical solutions for a short renal vein in living-donor kidney transplantation.

Case study: Co-combustion in peaking power plant.,2018,"Summary We describe the case of a 56 year-old woman with the almost simultaneous appearance of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) and a carotid body paraganglioma. Of interest, 6 years earlier, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid carcinoma and, in the meantime, she was submitted to mastectomy to treat an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. In order to explain these lesions, an extensive genetic study was performed. Results showed positivity for the presence of the tumor suppressor gene PALB2, whose presence had already been detected in a niece with breast cancer. The patient underwent different procedures to treat the lesions and currently she is symptom-free over 2 years of follow-up.

A growing body of evidence now shows that eukaryotic translation elongation factors (eEFs), predominantly eEF1A, acting in partially characterized complexes sometimes involving additional eEFs, facilitate virus replication. The functions of eEF1A as a protein chaperone and an RNA- and actin-binding protein enable its ""moonlighting"" roles as a virus replication cofactor. A diverse group of viruses, from human immunodeficiency type 1 and West Nile virus to tomato bushy stunt virus, have adapted to use eEFs as cofactors for viral transcription, translation, assembly, and pathogenesis. Here we review the mechanisms used by viral pathogens to usurp these abundant cellular proteins for their replication.","Li, Dongsheng; Wei, Ting; Abbott, Catherine M; Harrich, David",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00059-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23699257/,398
124435,Introducing the Zoom interview: tips for job hunting during the coronavirus pandemic.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES Optimal selection of pretransplant conditioning is crucially vital for improving survival and quality-of-life of patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), particularly in those with high-risk diseases. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of recently-developed reduced-toxicity myeloablative regimen that combines fludarabine, intravenous busulfan, and melphalan (FBM). METHODS We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 39 patients (23 with myeloid neoplasms and 16 with lymphoid neoplasms), with a median age of 50 (range, 17-68) years, who underwent their first allo-HCT using the FBM regimen. Graft types were bone marrow in 11, peripheral blood in 11, and cord blood in 17 patients. Cyclosporine- or tacrolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was administered. The primary end point of the study was the overall survival rate at 2-year after transplantation. RESULTS After a median follow-up of 910 days for the surviving patients, 2-year overall survival was 62% for the entire cohort; 73% in the low-to-intermediate-risk group and 44% in the high-to-very high-risk group classified by the refined CIBMTR Disease Risk Index. Cumulative incidences of engraftment, grade II-IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, and non-relapse mortality were 95%, 56%, 56%, 31%, and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSION These results suggest that our FBM regimen can be applied to allo-HCT using various graft types and yields acceptable outcomes with relatively low non-relapse mortality in both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Also, we observed a promising survival in the group of patients with high-risk diseases, warranting more accumulation of patients and longer follow-up.","Edahiro, Taro; Kawase, Takakazu; Nagoshi, Hisao; Fujino, Keita; Toishigawa, Kayo; Miyama, Takahiko; Mino, Tatsuji; Yoshida, Tetsumi; Morioka, Takehiko; Hirata, Yuji; Noma, Mitsunori; Fujii, Teruhisa; Nishizawa, Masatoshi; Fukushima, Noriyasu; Ichinohe, Tatsuo",Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078454.2021.1881228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594942/,398

In the present study, we performed a comprehensive in silico screening for 16,776 potential molecules from recently established drug libraries based on two important pharmacophores (3-amino-4-phenylbutan-2-ol and piperazine). Based on initial assessment, 4042 molecules were obtained suitable as drug candidates, which were following Lipinski's rule. Molecular docking implemented for the analysis of molecular interactions narrowed this number of compounds down to 19. Subsequent to screening filtering criteria and considering the critical parameters viz. docking score and MM-GBSA binding free energy, 1-(4-((2S,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyl)piperazin-1-yl)-3-phenylurea (compound 1) was accomplished to score highest in comparison to the remaining 18 shortlisted drug candidates. Notably, compound 1 displayed higher docking score (-8.069 kcal/mol) and MM-GBSA binding free energy (-49.56 kcal/mol) than the control drug, remdesivir triphosphate, the active form of remdesivir as well as adenosine triphosphate. Furthermore, a molecular dynamics simulation was carried out (100 ns), which substantiated the candidacy of compound 1 as better inhibitor. Overall, our systematic in silico study predicts the potential of compound 1 to exhibit a more favourable specific activity than remdesivir triphosphate. Hence, we suggest compound 1 as a novel potential drug candidate, which should be considered for further exploration and validation of its potential against SARS-CoV-2 in wet lab experimental studies.Communicated by Ramasawamy H.

After aerosol infection, most people experience mild respiratory infection with cold symptoms such as cough and fever, and healing within two weeks. In about 5% of those infected, however, a severe course develops with the occurrence of multiple sub pleural bronchopulmonary infiltrates and even death as a result of respiratory failure. The corona virus pandemic has multiple impacts on social life that have not been seen before. For example, the government adopted measures to curb the exponential spread of the virus, which included a significant reduction in social contacts. Furthermore, the specialist societies recommended that no elective treatments be carried out during the pandemic period.

130823,A comparison of regularized logistic regression and random forest machine learning models for daytime diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.,2020-08-17,"A higher incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been observed after haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (h-HSCT) with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) as a source of graft. Moreover, combining PTCY with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may help to reduce GVHD incidence. In this study, early immune reconstitution, especially of T and NK cell compartments, was compared after both types of transplant (PTCY versus PTCY + ATG) investigate their influence on patient outcomes. This retrospective study included 58 adults who received a reduced intensity conditioning to PBSC h-HSCT with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetyl + PTCY (n = 32) or PTCY + ATG (n = 26) as GVHD prophylaxis. Both groups shared similar characteristics except for the median number of CD3+ T cells infused, significantly higher for PTCY + ATG patients. Blood samples from all patients were collected three times a week from day 0 until day 30 then at day 60 and day 90/100 to evaluate T and NK cells reconstitution by flow cytometry. The results show that PTCY + ATG versus PTCY alone significantly limits the occurrence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD after reduced intensity conditioning PBSC h-HSCT, perhaps because of the combined effect of T and NK cell reconstitution. Indeed, although a slower T cell reconstitution with PTCY + ATG may limit GVHD occurrence, the quicker reconstitution of some NK cell subtypes may help with avoiding relapse. Larger prospective studies are needed to better determine which NK cell subsets may influence the incidence of relapse after h-HSCT and optimize donor selection.","Makanga, Dhon Roméo; Guillaume, Thierry; Willem, Catherine; Legrand, Nolwenn; Gagne, Katia; Cesbron, Anne; Gendzekhadze, Ketevan; Peterlin, Pierre; Garnier, Alice; Le Bourgeois, Amandine; Béné, Marie C; Chevallier, Patrice; Retière, Christelle",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747504/,398

This paper determinates the radiographic features of COVID-19 based on an initial national cohort of patients. METHODS This is a retrospective review of swab-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to four different hospitals in Singapore between 22 January and 9 March 2020. Initial and follow-up CXR were reviewed by three experienced radiologists to identify the predominant pattern and distribution of lung parenchymal abnormalities. RESULTS In total, 347 CXR of 96 patients were reviewed. Initial CXR were abnormal in 41 out of 96 patients (42.7%). The mean time from onset of symptoms to CXR abnormality was 5.3 (range 1-21) days. The predominant pattern of lung abnormality was ground-glass opacity on initial CXR (51.2%) and consolidation on follow-up CXR (51.0%). Multifocal bilateral abnormalities in mixed central and peripheral distribution were seen in 63.4% and 59.2% of abnormal initial and follow-up CXR, respectively. The lower zones were involved in 90.2% of the initial CXR and 93.9% of the follow-up CXR. CONCLUSION In a cohort of swab-positive patients, including those identified from contact tracing, we found the incidence of CXR abnormality to be lower than previously reported. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity or consolidation, but mixed central and peripheral involvement was more common than peripheral involvement alone.","Khoo, Hau Wei; Hui, Terrence Chi Hong; Haja Mohideen, Salahudeen Mohamed; Lee, Yeong Shyan; Liew, Charlene Jin Yee; Kok, Shawn Shi Xian; Young, Barnaby Edward; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Tan, Seow Yen; Loh, Jiashen; Chan, Lai Peng; Poh, Angeline Choo Choo; Wong, Steven Bak Siew; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David Chien; Kaw, Gregory Jon Leng; Tan, Cher Heng",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047143/,398

We find that the route from molten, but only marginally-overlapping single crystals to the equilibrium state must pass over a free-energy barrier that becomes large at high molecular weights. The penalty arises from elastic distortions of the entanglement network as the chains diffuse. A critical molecular weight arises naturally from the competition of elastic distortion and the free-energy of confinement. We calculate the barrier and critical molecular weight at both a simple single-chain level, and at a ""one-loop"" level of co-operative motion, finding that many-chain effects alter the physics quantitatively, but not qualitatively.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary academic center. A national survey of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was administered. Descriptive analyses were performed to determine how telehealth was employed in otolaryngologists' practices. Results: A total of 184 surveys were completed. Telehealth technology was used by 50% of otolaryngologists surveyed. Regions with the largest percentage of physicians using telehealth were the Mid-Atlantic region (84%) and West Coast (67%). Most otolaryngologists indicated that they were familiar with telehealth or any of its components and how it is used in practice (52-83%), they had heard of telehealth or any of its components but were unsure what the terms specifically entailed (17-42%); 53% were satisfied with their current use of telehealth and electronic medical record (EMR); and 72% were comfortable utilizing smart devices for patient care. Most otolaryngologists (65%) indicated reimbursement as the biggest limitation to implementing telehealth, and 67% believed that typing was a hindrance to EMR utility. Conclusion: Half of the surveyed otolaryngologists used some form of telehealth at the time of the survey. The most commonly cited obstacle to physician adoption of telehealth was reimbursement. Although the adoption of telehealth technology was still limited in the field of otolaryngology based on this study, we are now seeing significant change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, James C; Elson, Nora C; Epperson, Madison V; Doarn, Charles R; Altaye, Mekibib; Tabangin, Meredith E; Patil, Reena Dhanda; Patil, Yash J",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028286/,398

Ed Margerrison.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), known also as myositis, represent challenging group of heterogeneous muscle disorders characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness and evidence of muscle inflammation. The purpose of this review is to provide important updates on cytokines and inflammatory mediators related to myositis. RECENT FINDINGS In the past 5 years, multiple studies brought a fresh insight into the pathogenesis of myositis by introducing new factors or further characterizing the role of the well established mediators in myositis. Among the mediators reviewed in this article, special attention was paid to interferons, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, interleukin-18 and the IL23/Th17 axis. Some of the recent work has also focused on the nontraditional cytokines, such as adipokines, myokines, S100 proteins, High Mobility Group Box 1 or B-cell activating factor and on several anti-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, microRNAs and their potential to reflect the disease activity or to regulate the inflammatory processes in myositis have recently been subject of intensive investigation. Some of the above-mentioned mediators have been proposed as promising clinical biomarkers or therapeutic targets for myositis. SUMMARY Several recent studies contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of myositis and highlighted the clinical significance of certain inflammatory mediators. Application of these new findings may help to develop innovative approaches for patients' phenotyping, disease activity monitoring and potentially novel therapies.","Cerezo, Lucie Andrés; Vencovský, Jiří; Šenolt, Ladislav",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941247/,398

Patients, families, and caregivers have many unmet medical and social needs leading to extraordinary psychosocial and economic burdens. Efforts to improve diagnostic capabilities and to develop therapies for an estimated 7000 rare diseases have met with considerable success. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is one affecting fewer than 200,000 people. In the European Union (EU) a rare disease is any disease affecting fewer than 5 people in 10,000 (less than1 in 2000 people).However, more than 90 percent of rare diseases have no effective treatments available . A need exists to expand awareness, advocacy, and outreach to everyone including those with low incomes, poor literacy, minority ethnic status, and living in underserved and marginalized populations in urban and rural areas as well as in developing nations throughout the world. The acceptance of patients as research partners complements the increased research emphasis and major regulatory initiatives leading to expedited review and approval programs for products for serious or life-threatening conditions. The pipeline of new therapies provides hope to untreated patients. Advances in medical bioinformatics, Artificial Intelligence, and machine learning with access to big data continue to identify novel therapeutics for screening and evaluation. Advanced analytics can identify patterns of disease occurrence, predict disease progression, identify patient response to treatments, establish optimal care guidelines and generate research hypotheses with narrowly identified research patient populations.","Groft, Stephen C; Posada, Manuel; Taruscio, Domenica",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105798/,398
138859,Would you like another pretzel? Water? We make progress in donor reactions.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Venous leg ulcers represent the worst extreme within the spectrum of chronic venous disease. Affecting up to 3% of the adult population, this typically chronic, recurring condition significantly impairs quality of life, and its treatment places a heavy financial burden upon healthcare systems. The current mainstay of treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy, which has been shown to enhance ulcer healing rates. Open surgery on the veins in the leg has been shown to reduce ulcer recurrence rates, but it is an unpopular option and many patients are unsuitable. The efficacy of the newer, minimally-invasive endovenous thermal techniques has been established in uncomplicated superficial venous disease, and these techniques are now beginning to be used in the management of venous ulceration, though the evidence for this treatment is currently unclear. It is hypothesised that, when used with compression, ablation may further reduce pressures in the leg veins, resulting in improved rates of healing. Furthermore, since long-term patient concordance with compression is relatively poor, it may prove more popular, effective and cost-effective to provide a single intervention to reduce recurrence, rather than life-long treatment with compression. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of superficial endovenous thermal ablation on the healing, recurrence and quality of life of people with active or healed venous ulcers. SEARCH METHODS In August 2013 we searched Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions on the language of publication but there was a date restriction based on the fact that superficial endovenous thermal ablation is a comparatively new medical technology. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised clinical trials comparing endovenous thermal ablative techniques with compression therapy alone for venous leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. Trials had to report on at least one objective measure of ulcer healing (primary outcome) such as proportion of ulcers healed at a given time point, time to complete healing, change in ulcer size, proportion of ulcers recurring over a given time period, or at a specific point, and ulcer-free days. Secondary outcomes sought included patient-reported quality of life, economic data and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Details of potentially eligible studies were extracted and summarised using a data extraction table. Data extraction and validity assessment were performed independently by two review authors, and any disagreements resolved by consensus or by arbitration of a third review author. MAIN RESULTS No eligible randomised controlled trials were identified. There is an absence of evidence regarding the effects of superficial endovenous thermal ablation on ulcer healing, recurrence or quality of life of people with venous leg ulcer disease. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The review identified no randomised controlled trials on the effects on ulcer healing, recurrence or quality of life, of superficial endovenous thermal ablation in people with active or healed venous leg ulcers. Adequately-powered, high quality randomised controlled trials comparing endovenous thermal ablative interventions with compression therapy are urgently required to explore this new treatment strategy. These should measure and report outcomes that include time to ulcer healing, ulcer recurrence, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.","Samuel, Nehemiah; Carradice, Daniel; Wallace, Tom; Smith, George E; Chetter, Ian C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009494.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24096603/,398
139239,Comparison of accuracy of different intraocular lens power calculation methods using artificial intelligence.,2021-02-17,"Our group has recently described a novel technique for clean endolumenal bowel resection, in which abdominal and transanal approaches were used. In the current study, 2 modifications of this procedure were tested for feasibility in a porcine model. A laparoscopic approach to the peritoneal cavity was employed in rectal mobilization; this was followed by a transanal rectorectal intussusception and pull-through (IPT). IPT was established in a stepwise fashion. First, the proximal margin of resection was attached to the shaft of the anvil of an end-to-end circular stapler with a ligature around the rectum. Second, this complex was pulled transanally to produce IPT. Once IPT was established, a second ligature was placed around the rectum approximating the proximal and distal resection margins. This was followed by a purse string suture through 2 bowel walls, encircling the shaft of the anvil just proximal to the ligatures. The specimen was resected and extracted by making a full-thickness incision through the 2 bowel walls distal to the previously placed purse string suture and ligatures. The anastomosis was achieved by applying the stapler. The technique was found to be feasible. Peritoneal samples, collected after transanal specimen extraction, did not demonstrate bacterial growth. Although, this is a novel and evolving procedure, its minimally invasive nature, as well as aseptic bowel manipulation during endolumenal rectal resection, has the potential to limit the complications associated with abdominal wall incision and surgical site infection.","Kvasha, Anton; Hadary, Amram; Biswas, Seema; Szvalb, Sergio; Willenz, Udi; Waksman, Igor",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350614540812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057141/,398

The effects of these endogenous modulators on pre- and post-synaptic processes are discussed. The contribution of purines to the processes of quantal and non-quantal secretion of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, as well as the influence of the postsynaptic effects of ATP and adenosine on the functioning of cholinergic receptors, are evaluated. As usual, the P2-receptor-mediated influence is minimal under physiological conditions, but it becomes very important in some pathophysiological situations such as hypothermia, stress, or ischemia. There are some data demonstrating the same in neuromuscular transmission. It is suggested that the role of endogenous purines is primarily to provide a safety factor for the efficiency of cholinergic neuromuscular transmission.","Ziganshin, Ayrat U; Khairullin, Adel E; Hoyle, Charles H V; Grishin, Sergey N",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899290/,398

This study aimed to examine stress levels and causal stressors for perceived stress and generalized anxiety in the Indian population related to the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A total of 300 adults were invited to participate in the online study via snowball and virtual snowball sampling. They were requested to complete electronic survey forms for assessing perceived stress and anxiety, and questions related to psychosocial stressors. Frequency and percentage were used for categorical variables. Unpaired t-test was applied to compare responses based on gender, level of education, employment, and place of residence. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: In total, 257 out of the 300 invited, responded and completed the survey. Men accounted for 58% (n=149) of the respondents. Overall, 84% (n=217) of participants had moderate to severe levels of perceived stress and 88% (n=228) had moderate to severe levels of anxiety. Women, as well as those not employed, reported significantly higher perceived stress and anxiety, urban residents reported higher perceived stress, while level of education had no difference in terms of perceived stress as well as anxiety. Fear of contracting COVID-19 was the highest stressor followed by difficulties in executing a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future. Conclusion: The psychosocial impact of the nationwide lockdown on the Indian population has been high. Vulnerable groups for increased stress and anxiety include women, younger ages, and the unemployed. The stressors recognized include fear of contracting COVID-19, inability to execute a routine exercise schedule and worry about the future.","Wakode, Naina; Wakode, Santosh; Santoshi, John",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26371.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367620/,398
147101,An introduction and overview of machine learning in neurosurgical care.,2018,"Interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is an ubiquitin-like protein whose expression and conjugation to targets (ISGylation) is induced by infection, interferon (IFN)-α and -β, ischemia, DNA damage and aging. Attention has historically focused on the antiviral effects of ISGylation, which blocks the entry, replication or release of different intracellular pathogens. However, recently, new functions of ISGylation have emerged that implicate it in multiple cellular processes, such as DNA repair, autophagy, protein translation and exosome secretion. In this Review, we discuss the induction and conjugation of ISG15, as well as the functions of ISGylation in the prevention of infections and in cancer progression. We also offer a novel perspective with regard to the latest findings on this pathway, with special attention to the role of ISGylation in the inhibition of exosome secretion, which is mediated by fusion of multivesicular bodies with lysosomes. Finally, we propose that under conditions of stress or infection, ISGylation acts as a defense mechanism to inhibit normal protein translation by modifying protein kinase R (PKR, also known as EIF2AK2), while any newly synthesized proteins are being tagged and thus marked as potentially dangerous. Then, the endosomal system is re-directed towards protein degradation at the lysosome, to effectively 'lock' the cell gates and thus prevent the spread of pathogens, prions and deleterious aggregates through exosomes.","Villarroya-Beltri, Carolina; Guerra, Susana; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco",Journal of cell science,https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.205468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28842471/,398

Specifically, the use of Zn2+ as a therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on several findings: 1) the possible role of the anti-inflammatory activity of Zn2+ on the aberrant inflammatory response triggered by COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19), 2) properties of Zn2+ in modulating the competitive balance between the host and the invading pathogens, and 3) the antiviral activity of Zn2+ on a number of pathogens, including coronaviruses. Furthermore, Zn2+ has been found to play a central role in regulating brain functioning and many disorders have been associated with Zn2+ deficiency, including neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain injuries. Within this context, we carried out a narrative review to provide an overview of the evidence relating to the effects of Zn2+ on the immune and nervous systems, and the therapeutic use of such micronutrients in both neurological and infective disorders, with the final goal of elucidating the possible use of Zn2+ as a preventive or therapeutic intervention in COVID-19. Overall, the results from the available evidence showed that, owing to its neuroprotective properties, Zn2+ supplementation could be effective not only on COVID-19-related symptoms but also on virus replication, as well as on COVID-19-related inflammation and neurological damage. However, further clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of Zn2+ as a nonpharmacological treatment of COVID-19 are required to achieve an overall improvement in outcome and prognosis.","Cereda, Guido; Ciappolino, Valentina; Boscutti, Andrea; Cantù, Filippo; Enrico, Paolo; Oldani, Lucio; Delvecchio, Giuseppe; Brambilla, Paolo",Advances in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmab110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634109/,398

The fundamental effect appears when two independent and indistinguishable photons are superimposed on a beam splitter, which achieves a complete suppression of coincidences between the two output ports. Much less studied, however, is when the fields share coherence (continuous-wave lasers) or mode envelope properties (pulsed lasers). In this case, we expect the existence of two distinct and concurrent HOM interference regimes: the traditional HOM dip on the coherence length time scale, and a structured HOM interference pattern on the pulse length scale. We develop a theoretical framework that describes HOM interference for laser fields having arbitrary temporal waveforms and only partial overlap in time. We observe structured HOM interference from a continuous-wave laser via fast polarization modulation and time-resolved single photon detection fast enough to resolve these structured HOM dips.","Agne, Sascha; Jin, Jeongwan; Kuntz, Katanya B; Miatto, Filippo M; Bourgoin, Jean-Philippe; Jennewein, Thomas",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.396183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680144/,398

150547,Sixty seconds on . . . dog bites.,2021-04-19,"In recent years, concerns about the increasing generation of municipal solid waste, together with related health and environmental issues and regulatory changes, have motivated significant alterations in the provision of waste management services, such as the introduction of selective collection (by type of waste). However, these changes may impact on service costs and/or efficiency. The present study was undertaken to analyse the efficiency of the waste management service in Spain, using data from 283 municipalities for the period 2005-2015. The analysis consists of two phases: first, the application of panel data order-m frontiers, that allows to obtain a homogeneous estimation of efficiency based on the input-output relationship at the production process (Surroca et al., 2016), and second, the use of bootstrapped truncated regression, considering different municipal sizes. The results obtained show that cost efficiency is increased with selective collection and by certain political and socio-economic factors of the local governments, concretely with the government by a progressive party, coalition governments, a greater financial independence, a greater tourist and industrial activity and a greater proportion of women and of foreign-born residents in the municipality. We also show that municipal direct provision is the least efficient management form for this service. The main contribution made by this study is to examine the influence of different elements of service output (i.e., selection by type of waste vs. non-selection) on cost efficiency.","Campos-Alba, Cristina María; Garrido-Rodríguez, Juan Carlos; Plata-Díaz, Ana María; Pérez-López, Gemma",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.07.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399206/,398

The Association of American Medical Colleges has established strong recommendations for transitioning to virtual interviews for the 2020-2021 residency application cycle. The transition to virtual interviews is a double-edged sword and is bound to cause anxiety among senior medical students. Although such interviews serve as an opportunity to minimize expenditure and maximize flexibility, convenience, and time utilization, they come at the potential cost of sacrificing the ability to assess applicants and residency programs. Through this article, we discuss the pros and cons of the virtual interview process and offer suggestions for applicants and programs to optimize this experience. We will also elaborate on the possibility of magnified disparity in the number of interviews between applicants as a result of the lack of time and cost limitation. The Association of American Medical Colleges should strongly consider limiting the number of interviews an applicant can attend in each specialty, to avert this imminent effect.","Asaad, Malke; Rajesh, Aashish; Kambhampati, Praneeth V; Rohrich, Rod J; Maricevich, Renata",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252437/,398

During the 7th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH7) hackathon, we performed experiments to explore the use of named-entity-recognition (NER) to improve the classification. We processed the literature with OntoGene's Biomedical Entity Recogniser (OGER) and used the resulting identified Named Entities (NE) and their links to major biological databases as extra input features for the classifier. We compared the results with a baseline model without the OGER extracted features. In these proof-of-concept experiments, we observed a clear gain on COVID-19 literature classification. In particular, NE's origin was useful to classify document types and NE's type for clinical specialties. Due to the limitations of the small dataset, we can only conclude that our results suggests that NER would benefit this classification task.

In this strategy, the detection occurs while an individual is infectious and other susceptible household members are vaccinated without further delay. Expressions are derived for the influence on the reproduction numbers of this vaccination strategy for equal and unequal household sizes. We fit previously estimated parameters from influenza and use household distributions for Sweden and Tanzania census data. The results show that the reproduction number is much higher in Tanzania (6 compared with 2) due to larger households, and that infected individuals have to be detected (and household members vaccinated) after on average 5 days in Sweden and after 3.3 days in Tanzania, a much smaller difference.","Shaban, Nyimvua; Andersson, Mikael; Svensson, Ake; Britton, Tom",Biometrical journal.

The inclusion of components of patient safety in graduate training curricula, followed by adherence to curricula in teaching programs, can improve the quality of health-care services. Objectives To review the existing training curricula for five subgroups of health workforce (Allopathic doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, and nurse midwives) and to document the components and identified variables of patient safety covered. Methods A mixed-methods study was conducted during July 2017-March 2018. Data were collected through desk review, field visits, in-depth interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and focused group discussions (FGDs). A total of 24 variables were identified by the experts to review the training curricula. Results Seven states, 28 institutes, and 42 health-care facilities were visited. A total of 516 staff from different health cadres participated in the study through 54 interviews, 156 self-administered questionnaires, and 24 FGDs. Of 24 patient safety variables considered, 16 were covered in the medical and nursing, 9 in laboratory technician and pharmacist, and 5 in midwives' curricula. The teaching material on the patient safety, for most categories of staff, was not available in consolidated form, and there was no standardization. Conclusion There is a need for the development of comprehensive training material cum operational modules on patient safety, suitably adopted as per the learning needs of different subgroups of health staff. The need for strengthening patient safety has been further underscored as the health workforce is fighting the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The initiatives on patient safety will contribute to improved overall quality of health services, which in turn would advance universal health coverage.","Lahariya, Chandrakant; Gupta, Sanjay; Kumar, Gaurav; De Graeve, Hilde; Parkash, Inder; Das, Jayanta K",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_482_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985430/,398

Hence lockdown may be unsustainable despite the risk of a resurgence of new COVID-19 infections. The repeal and alteration of lockdown policies mark a symbolic transfer of responsibility for epidemic control from state to individual. This has the potential to catalyse fear, blame and judgement within and between populations. We draw on experience from the HIV pandemic to show that this will worsen during later phases of the pandemic if COVID-19 stigma increases, as we fear it could. We suggest policy recommendations for 'lockdown lifting' to limit COVID-19 stigma. We suggest three policy priorities to minimise potential increases in COVID-19 stigma: limit fear by strengthening risk communication, engage communities to reduce the emergence of blaming, and emphasise social justice to reduce judgement. 'Lockdown' policies cannot continue uninterrupted. However, lifting lockdown without unintended consequences may prove harder than establishing it. This period has the potential to see the emergence of fear, blame and judgement, intersecting with existing inequalities, as governments seek to share responsibility for preventing further Sars-Cov-2 transmission. As we have learned from HIV, it is critical that a wave of COVID-19 stigma is prevented from flourishing.","Hargreaves, James R; Logie, Carmen H",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2020.1825771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985374/,398

PATIENTS AND METHODS Single-centre cohort study, retrospectively analysed and prospectively collected consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic liver disease of colorectal carcinoma treated with ablative therapies between 1996 and 2013. Factors associated with survival time were identified using Cox's proportional hazard model with time-dependent covariates. A forward variable selection based on Akaike information criterion was performed. Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals for each factor were calculated. Statistical significance was set as P<.05. RESULTS Seventy-five patients with liver metastases of colorectal cancer, with a mean age of 65.6 (10.3) underwent 106 treatments. Variables selected were good quality of life (RR 0.308, 95% CI 0.150-0.632) and tumour extension (RR 3.070, 95% CI 1.776-5.308). The median overall survival was 18.5 months (95% CI 17.4-24.4). The survival prognosis in median was 13.5 vs. 23.4 months for patients with and without tumour extension, and 23.0 vs. 12.8 months for patients with good and fair or poor quality of life, respectively.

160265,Context for Practice: WOC Specialty Practice at the Front Lines During a Global Pandemic.,2020,"BACKGROUND Multi-pronged malaria elimination strategies are increasingly being considered for accelerating efforts against malaria transmission in Southeast Asia. Two malaria prevention interventions used in in the region are insecticide-treated bed-nets (ITNs) and mass drug administration (MDA). Universal access to ITNs is recommended and high population coverage (e.g. above 80%) is needed during MDA initiatives to maximize the impact of these interventions. However, variability in ITN use and individual MDA participation exists. This systematic review aims to provide a summary and overview of literature discussing factors influencing uptake of these two malaria control strategies in Southeast Asian countries. METHODS A search of OVID Embase, OVID MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, OpenGrey, ProQuest, and Google Scholar was undertaken in February 2020. English-language publications with any study design using data from any of the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were eligible for inclusion. In addition, reference lists of identified articles were manually searched. Websites for relevant international agencies were also searched to identify related grey literature. RESULTS The review identified thirty publications that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most discussed ITN use (n = 18) and were relevant to populations in Myanmar (n = 14). All MDA studies were published after 2016, whereas included ITN studies spanned from 1998 to 2020. Seven main themes emerged across the studies. Knowledge of malaria and attitudes towards ITNs were emphasized as key factors associated with ITN use. For MDA participation, key factors included the importance of positive attitudes towards the program, the influence of indirect costs and incentives, and the tendency for group decision-making. CONCLUSIONS As countries in Southeast Asia continue to work towards becoming malaria-free by 2030, the knowledge and attitudes of local population sub-groups should be assessed and incorporated into the planning and implementation of malaria prevention activities. The role of incentives and group decision making should also be considered particularly as they relate to MDA. There is need for ongoing involvement of health educators, the continuation of implementation research and the prioritization of community engagement efforts alongside malaria interventions in the region.","Cheng, Breagh; Htoo, Saw Nay; Mhote, Naw Pue Pue; Davison, Colleen M",Malaria journal,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12936-021-03733-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879186/,398

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1049 employees using online self-administered questionnaire. Views on workplace policies were measured in term of agreement on its comprehensiveness, timeliness and transparency whereas HRQoL was measured using EQ-5D-5L Hong Kong version. Univariate estimates on the impact of HRQoL from views of measures in workplace was done. Qualitative comments on the suggestions to strengthen workplace measures were collected and presented descriptively. RESULTS Of 1048 respondents, 16% reported that no workplace measures nor guidelines were existed in their company related to the COVID-19 pandemics. Those who reported having workplace policy were not satisfied with the arrangement in term of comprehensiveness (36%), timeliness (38%), and transparency (63%). Regarding to the policy measure, only 68% respondents reported that their workplace supplied face masks to them. The health index was 0897, which was lower than the norm of 0.924. 64% of respondents reported having a health problem in at least 1 of 5 dimension of EQ-5D-5L with the highest proportion of having problem in anxiety/depression (55%). In addition, the workplace policy and measure had a direct effect of 0.131 on health outcome. Perception of infection risk had a direct effect of 0.218 on health outcome and partly mediated the relationship between workplace policy and measure and health outcome (0.066). CONCLUSION The study highlighted the workplace policy and measure is an important mean to minimize infection risk at workplace so as to reduce tremendous stress and health outcome caused by a COVID-19 pandemic. Workplace measures related to COVID-19 pandemic should be further strengthen to mitigate the risk of infection and protect employee's health.","Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi; Ho, Kai-Fai; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan; Cheung, Annie Wai-Ling; Yau, Peter Sen-Yung; Dong, Dong; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772010/,398

These measures raise important ethical considerations, since they prioritise protection of Health Systems and Professionals without seemingly taking cancer patient feelings of stress into consideration. This could lead to an erosion of the physician-patient relationship, which is considered the core element of medical ethics. Moreover, they raise practical concerns about the continuous education of Health Professionals, the status of reference centres and the evaluation of the hitherto cancer treatments.","Melidis, Christos; Vantsos, Miltiadis",Molecular and clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.3892/mco.2020.2075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32754319/,398

Dexmedetomidine is one of the most recently introduced for sedation in the ICU. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on sleep quality of patients without mechanical ventilation in ICU.The patients who were included in this study were divided into two groups. In the sedation group, dexmedetomidine was given by a continuous infusion targeting a sedation level -1 to -2 on the score of RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale). In the no sedation group, the patients slept by themselves. No other sedatives were given. Bispectral Index (BIS) was performed on these hemodynamically stable critically ill patients for 12 consecutive hours. Sleep time and sleep depth were recorded.Twenty patients were studied. Compared to no sedation group, sleep efficiency and sleep time of patients in the sedation group was significantly higher during the night. Moreover, there was no significantly difference between the changes of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.Dexmedetomidine is a clinically effective and safe sedative for the highly selected critically ill patients without endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation in the ICU to increases total sleep time and improve sleep efficiency.","Lu, Weina; Fu, Qinghui; Luo, Xiaoqian; Fu, Shuiqiao; Hu, Kai",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000007081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28591048/,398

All efforts to isolate infectious virus from bats or to generate these viruses by reverse genetics have failed to date. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding the hemagglutinin-like envelope glycoproteins HL17 or HL18 in place of the VSV glycoprotein were generated to identify cell lines that are susceptible to bat influenza A-like virus entry. More than 30 cell lines derived from various species were screened but only a few cell lines were found to be susceptible, including Madin-Darby canine kidney type II (MDCK II) cells. The identification of cell lines susceptible to VSV chimeras allowed us to recover recombinant HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 viruses from synthetic DNA. Both influenza A-like viruses established a productive infection in MDCK II cells; however, HL18NL11 replicated more efficiently than HL17NL10 in this cell line. Unlike conventional influenza A viruses, bat influenza A-like viruses started the infection preferentially at the basolateral membrane of polarized MDCK II cells; however, similar to conventional influenza A viruses, bat influenza A-like viruses were released primarily from the apical site. The ability of HL18NL11 or HL17NL10 viruses to infect canine and human cells might reflect a zoonotic potential of these recently identified bat viruses.","Moreira, Étori Aguiar; Locher, Samira; Kolesnikova, Larissa; Bolte, Hardin; Aydillo, Teresa; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Schwemmle, Martin; Zimmer, Gert",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1608821113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791106/,398

This has resulted in a global close-down of several operations, including education events. This led universities to migrate their education systems from traditional to online systems using e-learning educational platforms. The goal of this paper is to recognize the most relevant challenges and issues the associated with using e-learning as seen through the perspective of university students. It also observers their opinions and measures their level of readiness and satisfaction to adopt the e-learning methods existing in Libya. A descriptive method has been conducted and an online questionnaire was sent to collect data from students to explore the challenges facing them in e-learning during coronavirus pandemic lockdown. The research community consists of students from six faculties at the Libyan International Medical University (LIMU). The statistical analysis of the data was executed by means of SPSS. The mean and standard deviation of all questionnaire items are recorded and analyzed. Through the analysis of the results, the social challenge comes at the forefront with a large percentage, Then there's the issue of students' problems as they relate to e-learning. The challenges that arise from the lecturers are not as effective as social and student challenges. In general, an average of more than or equal to 3.44 was obtained through the four challenges, which are associated with a high degree of acceptance and thus each of them has a substantial influence on e-learning. © 2021 IEEE.","Elberkawi, E.

The sustainability of the improvements could not be assessed given the lack of follow-up.Thematic analysis identified three key themes. For successful QI initiatives, staff needed to be engaged with improvements from an early stage. Staff must also be empowered by leaders to create change, through support and education about QI. Finally, committed and engaged leaders must ensure that QI is prioritised, to ensure that improvement becomes a daily activity in the workplace and staff are supported and encouraged to improve continuously. Ultimately these features result in successful improvement work and initiate culture change for sustainable improvement.ConclusionQI research often focuses on quantitative data.

The aim was to examine relationships between stress, anxiety, and specific time management related factors. Considering possible differences between genders and degree levels, we developed five structural equation models (SEMs) to delineate these relationships. Results of a large-scale study of 502 participants show that students suffered from stress and two types of COVID-19-related anxiety: disease and consequences. Students' preference for organization was the only factor that significantly promoted their perceived control over time, which contributes to reducing stress, hence, anxiety. However, female students reported higher stress and anxiety levels than male students. Graduate students reported higher anxiety levels related to the consequences of the pandemic compared to undergrads. To promote students' preference for organization, we map the three categories of organization to corresponding persuasive strategies which could be used in the design of persuasive interventions. This creates an opportunity for developing technological interventions to improve students' perceived control over time, thus, reduce stress and anxiety.","Alhasani, M.; Alkhawaji, A.; Orji, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.01.21264409v1?rss=1,398

COVID-19 and many other infectious diseases are spread by human movement and contact, but complex transportation networks in 21 century make it difficult to predict disease spread in rapidly changing situations. It is especially challenging to estimate the network of infection transmission in the countries that the traffic and human movement data infrastructure is not yet developed. In this study, we devised a method to estimate the network of transmission of COVID-19 from the time series data of its infection and applied it to determine its spread across areas in Japan. We incorporated the effects of soft lockdowns, such as the declaration of a state of emergency, and changes in the infection network due to government-sponsored travel promotion, and predicted the spread of infection using the Tokyo Olympics as a model. The models used in this study are available online, and our data-driven infection network models are scalable, whether it be at the level of a city, town, country, or continent, and applicable anywhere in the world, as long as the time-series data of infections per region is available. These estimations of effective distance and the depiction of infectious disease networks based on actual infection data are expected to be useful in devising data-driven countermeasures against emerging infectious diseases worldwide.","Yamada, T.; Shi, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.02.21261486v1?rss=1,398

International businesses, multinational AEC organisations, technical professionals, project and portfolio management organisations face global connectivity challenges between business units, especially during the outbreak of novel coronavirus pandemic, to manage construction megaprojects (CMPs). That raises the need to manage global connectivity as a main strategic goal of global organisations. This paper aims to investigate barriers to integrating lean construction (LC) practices and integrated project delivery (IPD) on CMPs towards the global integrated delivery (GID) transformative initiatives and develop future of work (FOW) global initiatives in contemporary multinational AEC organisations. Design/methodology/approach: A two-stage quantitative and qualitative research approach is adopted. The qualitative research methodology consists of a literature review to appraise barriers to integrating LeanIPD&GID on CMPs. Barriers are arranged into six-factor clusters (FCs), with a conceptualisation of LeanIPD&GID, GID strategy placements and FOW global initiatives with multiple validations. This analysis also involved semi-structured interviews and focus group techniques. Stage two consisted of an empirical questionnaire survey that shaped the foundation of analysis and findings of 230 respondents from 23 countries with extensive cosmopolitan experience in the construction of megaprojects. The survey examined a set of 28 barriers to integrating LeanIPD&GID on CMPs resulting from a detailed analysis of extant literature after validation. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were exploited for data analysis, percentage scoring analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and eigenvalues were used to elaborate on clustered factors. Findings: The research conceptualised LeanIPD&GID principles and proposed GID strategy placements for LeanIPD&GID transformative initiatives and FOW global initiatives. It concluded that the most significant barriers to integration of LeanIPD&GID on CMPs are “lack of mandatory building information modelling (BIM) and LC industry standards and regulations by governments”, “lack of involvement and support of governments”, “high costs of BIM software licenses”, “resistance of industry to change from traditional working practices” and “high initial investment in staff training costs of BIM”. PCA revealed the most significant FCs are “education and knowledge-related barriers”, “project objectives-related barriers” and “attitude-related barriers”. Awareness of BIM in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is higher than LC and LC awareness is higher than IPD knowledge. Whilst BIM adoption in the MENA region is higher than LC;the second is still taking its first steps, whilst IPD has little implementation. LeanBIM is slightly integrated, whilst LeanIPD integration is almost not present. Originality/value: The research findings, conclusion and recommendation and proposed GID strategy placements for LeanIPD&GID transformative initiatives to integrating LeanIPD&GID on CMPs.

165521,rdmc: an open source R package implementing convergent adaptation models of Lee and Coop (2017),2020-06-30,"Rapid mutation of airborne pathogenic viruses, e.g., SARS‐CoV‐2, and their similar symptoms with flu or influenza, raises an urgent demand for the development of biomolecule‐less nanosensors capable of rapid, sensitive, specific, and differentiable detection of viruses in a single potential window to distinguish infected people from healthy ones through a precise and prompt manner that do not require highly purified biological receptors. To address this vital requirement, a label‐free, and biomolecule‐less nanosensor is designed and developed based on the modified graphene oxide (GO) with NHS/EDC activated β‐cyclodextrin/8 hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) complex toward rapid (in 1 min) and differentiable detection of betacoronaviruses (viz., SARS‐CoV‐2) and influenza viruses (viz., H1N1 and H3N2) in a single potential window. The outcome of the process shows that the employed process leads to considerable soar in the electrical conductivity, porosity, active surface area, available active sites for trapping viruses, and sensitivity of the nanosensor that leads to rapid, sensitive, specific, and simultaneous detection of selected pathogenic viruses with a superiorly low detection limit (DL) and high sensitivity. Obtained results highlight the potential of the developed nanoplatform as a capable screening tool for quick detection of infected people.

165746,Novel Stability Results for Caputo Fractional Differential Equations,2021,"Fomites can represent a reservoir for pathogens, which may be subsequently transferred from surfaces to skin. In this study we aim to understand how different factors (including virus type, surface type, time since last handwash, and direction of transfer) affect virus transfer rates, defined as the fraction of virus transferred, between fingerpads and fomites. To determine this, 360 transfer events were performed with 20 volunteers using Phi6 (a surrogate for enveloped viruses) and MS2 (a surrogate for non-enveloped viruses), and three clean surfaces (stainless steel, painted wood, and plastic). Considering all transfer events (all surfaces and both transfer directions combined), the mean transfer rates of Phi6 and MS2 were 0.17 and 0.26, respectively. Transfer of MS2 was significantly higher than Phi6 (P<0.05). Surface type was a significant factor that affected the transfer rate of Phi6: Phi6 is more easily transferred to and from stainless steel and plastic than to and from painted wood. Direction of transfer was a significant factor affecting MS2 transfer rates: MS2 is more easily transferred from surfaces to fingerpads than from fingerpads to surfaces. Data from these virus transfer events, and subsequent transfer rate distributions, provide information which can be used to refine quantitative microbial risk assessments. This study is the first to provide a large-scale data set of transfer events with a surrogate for enveloped viruses, which extends the reach of the study to the role of fomites in the transmission of human enveloped viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Importance This study created the first large-scale data set for the transfer of enveloped viruses between skin and surfaces. The data set produced by this study provides information on modelling the distribution of enveloped and non-enveloped virus transfer rates, which can aid in the implementation of risk assessment models in the future. Additionally, enveloped and non enveloped viruses were applied to experimental surfaces in an equivalent matrix to avoid matrix effects, so results between different viral species can be directly compared without confounding effects of different matrices. Our results indicating how virus type, surface type, time since last handwash, and direction of transfer affect virus transfer rates can be used in decision-making processes to lower the risk of viral infection from transmission through fomites.","Anderson, Claire E.; Boehm, Alexandria B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.22.449538,398
165757,3d Modeling of the Cultural Heritage: between Opportunity and Necessity,2020,"Background. Pneumococcal disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children worldwide. The severity of St. pneumoniae diseases determines their high socio-economic significance. Aims — estimate the burden of pneumococcal infection and vaccination coverage in the Russian Federation. Methods. The data was obtained from federal statistical surveillance system. The information obtained was analyzed using descriptive statistics methods. Results. The annual incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in Russia was 491.7/100 000 in 2011–2019. It ranges from 359.8/100 000 among adults of working age to 1505.4/100 000 among children 1–2 years old. The upward trend of incidence is observed throughout the period, most expressive among school-age children (7–17 years old). Total 29.2% of all pneumonia have an identified etiology. 94% of pneumonia with known etiology are bacterial (incidence 142.5/100 000). 8.4% among it are pneumococcal (12.6/100 000). Pneumonia accounts for more than half of all deaths from respiratory diseases among children under five years (57%, mortality 3.7/100 000) and 34% among elderly. The death rate from pneumonia in 2009-2018 tends to decrease. In 2018, 25.5 thousand deaths from pneumonia were registered (17.5/100 000). The highest mortality rate is observed among children under one year old (14.0 /100 000) and elderly (41.2 /100 000). There is a downward trend (annual decline 2.4%) in incidence of acute otitis media among the entire population. The highest level is in children under 14. The incidence was 2612.6/100 000 in 2018, 670 thousand cases was observed. The incidence of bacterial meningitis is 1.4/100 000. Every year 2–3 thousand cases are registered, 43–52% of which are among children (3.04/100 000, maximally in children under one year old, 13.2/100 000). The level of vaccination against pneumococcal infection is increasing annually, but the proportion of children who have received a completed course of vaccination remains insufficient (64.6% in 2019). Coverage among the adult population was 2.3% (3.8% among those over 60). The main contingents of vaccinated adults are conscripts (coverage 67.4%) and people with chronic lung diseases (coverage 15.1%). Conclusions. The socio-economic and epidemiological burden of diseases associated with pneumococcal infection in Russia remains high. Accurate assessment of morbidity and mortality rates caused by St. pneumoniae diseases is not possible due to the insufficient level of their ethological identification. Further efforts are required to achieve a high level of herd immunity against pneumococcal infection through vaccine prevention, especially today, during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

Yet, defying these predictions, Taiwan maintained a considerably low number of confirmed cases and exhibited no sign of community spread. Taiwan’s near-miraculous achievement in controlling the Covid-19 pandemic proved that a democracy can successfully contain the spread of the virus.

166183,Tactical acts from lockdown homes,2021,"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus 2 represents a major challenge for global public health authorities. Coronavirus disease 2019 can be fatal especially in elderly people and those with comorbidities. Currently, several vaccines against coronavirus 2 are under application in multiple countries with emergency use authorization. In the same time, many vaccine candidates are under development and assessment. It is worth noting that the design of some of these vaccines depends on the expression of receptor binding domain for viral spike protein to induce host immunity. As such, blocking the spike protein interface with antibodies, peptides or small molecular compounds can impede the ability of coronavirus 2 to invade host cells by intervention with interactions between viral spike protein and cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2. In this virtual screening study, we have used predictive webservers, molecular docking and dynamics simulation to evaluate the ability of 3000 compounds to interact with interface residues of spike protein receptor binding domain. This library of chemicals was focused by Life Chemicals as potential proteinprotein interactions inhibitor. Here, we report that hit compound 7, with IUPAC name of 3-cyclohexyl-N-(4-{[(1R,9R) -6-oxo-7,11- diazatricyclo [7.3.1.0(2,7)] trideca-2,4-dien-11-yl] sulfonyl} phenyl) propenamide, may have the capacity to interact with interface of receptor binding domain for viral spike protein and thereby reduce cellular entry of the virus.

Based on previous research, we tried to compare the costs arising from teak harvesting during the pandemic. On the other hand, Cost analysis of community teak harvesting aims to analyse the costs incurred by the community at each harvesting process, starting at the felling, skidding, to transportation stages, both in self-managed systems and in wholesale systems. Data were collected through observation and interviews which were then analysed using quantitative descriptive analysis by calculating the costs for each harvesting process. Machine costs are obtained by adding up fixed costs and variable costs incurred, while operating costs are obtained by adding up machine costs with operator and helper wages. The results showed that the total cost for felling group I was IDR 53,837.17 per m3 with an average cutting ability of 0.72 m3 per hour. Meanwhile, the total cost for felling group II was IDR 40,361.69 per m3 with an average cutting capacity of 0.87 m3 per hour.

166277,Machine Learning Classification and Regression Approaches for Optical Network Traffic Prediction,2021,"Repeated emergence of highly contagious and potentially immune-evading variant SARS-CoV-2 is posing global health and socioeconomical threats. For suppression of the spread of the virus infection among people, a procedure to inactivate virus in saliva may be useful, because saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate viral transmission to nearby persons. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly and remarkably inactivated by treatment in vitro with tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Tea catechin-derived compounds including theaflavins (TFs) with (a) galloyl moiety(ies) showed this activity. Although black tea is popularly consumed worldwide, a lot of people consume it with sugar, milk, lemon juice, and so on. But it has not been determined whether these ingredients may influence the inactivation effect of black tea against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has not been revealed whether black tea is capable of inactivating variant viruses such as delta variant. Here we examined the effect of black tea on some variants in the presence or absence of sugar, milk, and lemon juice in vitro. Black tea and galloylated TFs remarkably inactivated alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants. Intriguingly, an addition of milk but not sugar and lemon juice totally prevented black tea from inactivating alpha and delta variant viruses. The suppressive effect was also exerted by milk casein. These results suggest the possibility that intake of black tea without milk by infected persons may result in inactivation of the virus in saliva and attenuation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 to nearby persons through droplets. Clinical studies are required to investigate this possibility.","Ohgitani, Eriko; Shin-Ya, Masaharu; Ichitani, Masaki; Kobayashi, Makoto; Takihara, Takanobu; Saito, Motoki; Kinugasa, Hitoshi; Mazda, Osam",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461930,398

In the first step and to get better insights from the travel behavior of passengers due to the pandemic, an online questionnaire is developed and distributed. Priorities for mode choice before and during the pandemic decrease and increase in the share of different modes and the impact of having a high-risk person in the family is studied. Subway had the most decrease and private cars had the highest increase. Hence, two logit models are developed to explain the variables that affect shifting away from the subway and shifting to private cars.

Kinematics of the process is used to analyze the cut surface topography and derive the uncut chip thickness variation for various modulation parameters. It is found that uncut chip thickness is governed by successive spindle rotations and can be represented in the form of trigonometric functions. The cut and no-cut phase durations are controlled by the modulation frequency and amplitude. Cutting (machining) forces are predicted based on the orthogonal cutting mechanics. The thin shear plane angle is predicted considering oscillations in the cutting velocity, resultant effective rake angle and by employing the well-known Minimum Energy Principle (MEP). In order to accurately predict the shear forces, length of the shear plane is estimated directly from the uncut and cut part surface geometries, which incorporates waviness of the surface. Analytical chip thickness predictions and proposed cutting force models are combined used to predict the specific cutting energy in MAM. Experimental results verify accuracy of developed force models in estimating cutting forces and energy in orthogonal modulated assisted turning of Al6061 T6511.","Eren, Bora; Sencer, Burak",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315237; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315237,398

Despite this, the layer-dependent properties of these tissues have yet to be mechanically characterised using human tissue. In this study, the ex vivo mechanical properties of the passive muscularis propia layer of the human oesophagus were extensively investigated. For this, a series of uniaxial tensile tests were conducted. The results displayed hyperelastic behaviour, while the differences between loading the tissue in both the longitudinal and circumferential directions showcased its anisotropy. The anisotropy of the muscular layer was present at different strain rates, with the longitudinal direction being consistently stiffer than the circumferential one. The circumferential direction was found to have little strain-rate dependency, while the longitudinal direction results suggest pronounced strain-rate-dependent behaviour. The repeated trials showed larger variation in terms of stress for a given strain in the longitudinal direction compared to the circumferential direction. The possible causes of variation between trials are discussed, and the experimental findings are linked to the histological analysis which was carried out via various staining methods. Finally, the direction-dependent experimental data was simulated using an anisotropic, hyperelastic model.","Durcan, Ciara; Hossain, Mokarram; Chagnon, Grégory; Perić, Djordje; Bsiesy, Lara; Karam, Georges; Girard, Édouard",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.18.452813,398

Numerous studies have shown that immune factors have important roles in the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and SLE. In the early stages of COVID-19 and SLE pathogenesis, IFN-α expression is frequently increased, which aggravates the virus infection and promotes SLE development. In addition, increased IL-6 levels, caused by different mechanisms, are observed in the peripheral blood of patients with severe COVID-19 and SLE, stimulating a series of immune cascades that lead to a cytokine storm, as well as causing B cell hyperfunction and production of numerous of antibodies, aggravating both COVID-19 and SLE.

We provide analytical results that accurately predict the expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities, inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact network.

We hypothesized that glucose control would improve due to increased supervision at home. The retrospective study included 96 patients between the ages of 3-22 years who were diagnosed with T1D at least one year earlier. We analyzed CGM data during three time periods: baseline, SIP, and post SIP (06/01/2020 - 07/30/2020) and compared standard CGM metrics controlling for gender (56% male), race (55% White), ethnicity (70% non-Hispanic), age (mean 11 yrs ± 3.9), and insurance type (8.4% public). The mean time in range (70-180 mg/dL: TIR) increased across the three time periods: from 59.9% ± 15.1 at baseline to 62.8% ± 15.9 during SIP (p<0.001) and maintained at 63.5% ± 16.6 during post-SIP period (p=0.23) compared with SIP. Increases in TIR were seen in both privately insured (2.9% ± 6.0) and publicly insured (3.7% ± 6.2) individuals during SIP vs. baseline with no increase in time with hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) in privately insured (0.1% ± 1.4) and publicly insured (-0.08%±1.3).

Particular examples are presented showing the support to the agriculture and food sectors amid Coronavirus and rural responses to the COVID-19 crisis as collected by the European Network for Rural Development (ENRD). Good practices from Bulgaria are also analyzed regarding the initiatives of promoting local food through farmers’ markets and online platforms and new challenges and best solutions. Conclusions focus on the general measures and actions for the effective transition to a fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly agri-food system.","Arabska, Ekaterina",Journal of Life Economics,https://doi.org/10.15637/jlecon.8.1.02,398
169547,Exploring biomedical records through text mining-driven complex data visualisation,2021-03-29,"Purpose This paper aims to examine key obligations of states to persons deprived of liberty (PDLs) under the right to health framework in the context of COVID-19. As a case study, it also describes the state of health in places of detention in the Philippines during the pandemic, with an end view of providing granular recommendations for prison policy reforms. Design/methodology/approach Relevant rules under international human rights law related to places of detention were thematically analyzed to articulate the scope of the right to health of PDLs. To describe the state of places of detention in the Philippines, this paper relied on archival research of news from selected local mainstream and specialized media. Findings The right to health framework provides a foundation for the response to COVID-19 in places of detention. Key concerns include increase in the number of infections, vulnerabilities in physical and mental health, and the spread of infection among correctional staff. Long-standing structural constraints and limited health information compound the threat of COVID-19. The Philippines must comply with its human rights obligations to PDLs to effectively address COVID-19-related concerns. Practical implications Policy reforms in Philippine places of detention must include application of community standards on physical and mental health, implementation of emergency release and application of non-custodial measures for long-term prison decongestion. Originality/value This is one of the few papers to analyze human rights in health care in places of detention during a pandemic, as nuanced in the context of the Philippines.","Yarcia, L. E.

170168,Mapping the landscape of Artificial Intelligence applications against COVID-19,2020,"The all-consuming nature of coronavirus news coverage has made the COVID-19 pandemic a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between audience trust in and engagement with news. This study examines that relationship through 60 Zoom-based qualitative interviews conducted with a diverse sample of US adults during the early phase of the pandemic. We find that how people approach the news stems not only from how they perceive the trustworthiness of individual news outlets, but also from their own self-perceptions. News consumers believe journalism generally suffers from issues of bias, but that they are savvy and independent-minded enough to see through those biases to find the truth. Putting the concept of partisan selective exposure into conversation with folk theories of news consumption, we conclude that people’s approach to and trust in news is as dependent on what they bring to the news as it is on what news brings to them.

There is a huge uncertainty about the management of this disease, many drugs including some older drugs are being tested for efficacy and safety including the medicines from the complementary and alternative system. The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, India's apex body for Ayurvedic research and development under the Ministry of AYUSH, has developed a poly-herbal drug called AYUSH 64 for covid 19 which is considered to be having role in the COVID-19. This study was designed with the aim of assessing the efficacy and safety of AYUSH 64 in mild covid-19 patients as add on therapy with standard treatment. It was an open labelled, comparative, parallel group, Randomized controlled clinical trial. Total 60 stage I (mild) COVID 19 positive subjects were recruited, 30 were assigned to AYUSH 64 as an add on therapy along with the standard treatment and 30 were assigned to standard treatment as per the protocols. RT-PCR test was done as per government guidelines and protocol. Along with the RT-PCR clinical laboratory tests were also performed at screening as well as on the discharge as per the study schedule. Absolute events of negative RT-PCR at day 5 were more in the AYUSH 64 group as compared to control group but it was not statistically significant (70% Vs 54%, p=0.28). There was no significant difference between AYUSH 64 and control group for fever and respiratory symptoms or important lab parameters. No serious adverse event was reported from any group. AYUSH 64 has no significant beneficial effect as compared to control group, this may be because of the less sample size or no actual effect which need to be confirmed by studies with large sample size.","Bhardwaj, P.; Godatwar, P.

170485,Digital Ethnography for Social Design: Challenges and Opportunities in the Pandemic,2021,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic posed unique challenges to healthcare workers, who were required to adapt to a changing environment. This crisis put the spotlight on leadership qualities to provide safe, high-quality care. Furthermore, the NHS adapted from a divisional to ‘command and control’ based leadership that risked staff disengagement and exclusion.AimTo understand how leadership and management across three teaching hospitals in London were handled during the pandemic, and how lessons learnt can be applied to improve future healthcare leadership.MethodsA survey was sent to all anaesthetic trainees across three teaching hospitals in London. This contained 10 questions concerning the quality of leadership and care observed during the pandemic.Results68% of trainees felt more valued during the pandemic. 63% felt more listened to and better able to express concerns. 50% felt less included in decisions made. Only 23% thought NHS England and 14% thought Public Health England exhibited good leadership and communication on how to prepare for and manage the crisis. Locally, 91% reported good leadership within their teams, and 91% agreed that patient care was sufficiently prioritised. Leadership qualities identified during the pandemic included compassion (reported by 86%), difficult decision making (reported by 82%) and staff engagement (reported by 68%).ConclusionsThe results suggest participants felt more valued and listened to than previously, and suggest compassionate leadership was exhibited on a local level. The pressure on leaders during the pandemic highlighted the need for developing leadership and management skills. However the majority of trainees (68%) are not considering a career in leadership and management. We suggest implementing the NHS Leadership Academy’s Healthcare Leadership Model App into anaesthetic training as a platform to engage trainees in developing their leadership skills, and provide the NHS with future healthcare leaders.","Henriksson, Maria Godfrey Jenna Jacqueline Jawaad Saleem Malik Bartlett Rachel",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.135,398

Accurate knowledge of their structure is central to understanding their antigen binding function. The key area for antigen binding and the main area of structural variation in antibodies is concentrated in the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), with the most important for binding and most variable being the CDR-H3 loop. The sequence and structural variability of CDR-H3 make it particularly challenging to model. Recently deep learning methods have offered a step change in our ability to predict protein structures. In this work we present ABlooper, an end-to-end equivariant deep-learning based CDR loop structure prediction tool. ABlooper rapidly predicts the structure of CDR loops with high accuracy and provides a confidence estimate for each of its predictions. On the models of the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, ABlooper makes predictions with an average CDR-H3 RMSD of 2.49Å, which drops to 2.05Å when considering only its 76% most confident predictions.","Abanades, Brennan; Georges, Guy; Bujotzek, Alexander; Deane, Charlotte M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453747,398
170887,"Science,technology and society",2005-07-12,"RELEVANCE The pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains one of the most pressing. The literature discusses the role of iron as a factor supporting inflammatory processes, hypercoagulability and microcirculation crisis in severe COVID-19. THE AIM OF STUDy was to identify changes in iron metabolism in patients with severe COVID-19 and hyperferritinemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, we used a content analysis of available scientific publications and our own observations of the peculiarities of the clinical picture and laboratory parameters in patients with a severe course of COVID-19 who had hyperferretinemia at the height of the disease. The main group consisted of 30 patients hospitalized in the Department of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care of N.A. Semashko City clinical Hospital No. 38 with the diagnosis COVID-19, bilateral polysegmental pneumonia, severe course and hyperferritinemia. The diagnosis of a new coronavirus infection was confirmed by visualization of bilateral viral lung lesions with chest CT-scan, positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and the presence of immunoglobulins to SARS-CoV-2. The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers. The study evaluated the biochemical parameters of iron metabolism, fibrinolysis and markers of inflammation. Changes associated with impaired iron metabolism were assessed by the level of serum iron, transferrin, daily and induced iron excretion in the urine. Statistical processing was carried out using nonparametric methods. RESULTS All patients with severe COVID-19 and hyperferritinemia showed signs of impaired iron metabolism, inflammation and fibrinolysis - a decrease in the level of transferrin (p<0.001), serum iron (p<0.005), albumin (p<0.001), lymphocytes (p<0.001) and an increase in leukocytes (p<0.001), neutrophils (p<0.001), CRP (p<0.005), IL-6 (p<0.001), D-dimer (p<0.005), daily urinary iron excretion (p<0.005) and induced urinary iron excretion (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The study showed that in the pathogenesis of the severe course of COVID-19, there is a violation of iron metabolism and the presence of a free iron fraction. The appearance of free iron can be caused by damage to cells with the “release” of iron from cytochromes, myoglobin, hemoglobin, or violation of the binding of iron to transferrin, which may be the result of a change in the protein structure or violation of the oxidation of iron to the trivalent state. When assessing the degree of viral effect on the body, one should take into account the effect of various regulators of iron metabolism, as well as an assessment of the level of free iron not associated with transferrin. © 2021 Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine.

170994,Flexible machine learning prediction of antigen presentation for rare and common HLA-I alleles,2020-09-19,"Background: RRx-001 is a small molecule immunotherapeutic in Phase 3 for the treatment of SCLC that is associated with M2- M1 tumor associated macrophage (TAM) repolarization with CD47 downregulation, vascular normalization and reversal of chemoresistance. In a controlled, multicenter clinical trial called REPLATINUM that was prematurely halted due to COVID-19, data from 17 patients with third line or beyond SCLC was analyzed. Moving forward, REPLATINUM(restrated) has added SARS-CoV-2 exclusion criteria. Our aim was to explore the efficacy of RRx-001 in REPLATINUM and to assess the statistical assumptions of the REPLATINUM(restrated) trial in order to inform future clinical development in SCLC. Methods: Patients in REPLATINUM were randomized to receive 1 of 2 arms: 1) carboplatin AUC 5 IV on day 1 or cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV on day 1 plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1 through 3 every 21 days for up to 4 cycles or 2) 4 mg of RRx-001 administered sequentially with 4 cycles of a platinum doublet (cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide as outlined above). Progression Free Survival (PFS) was the primary efficacy endpoint based on a blinded independent central review (BICR). Results: The trial was suspended prematurely after 17 patients had been enrolled due to widespread COVID-19 exposure with the plan to restart the trial. The decision to restart the trial has provided an opportunity to examine the data for preliminary evidence of treatment efficacy. At the time that the REPLATINUM trial was halted, there were 11 patients enrolled on the control arm and 6 on the investigational arm. The BICR assessed median PFS was approximately 7.1 months for RRx-001 + platinum doublet and 3.5 months for the platinum doublet alone based on the truncated database. The BICR assessed PFS hazard ratio was approximately 0.5. OS medians were approximately 8.2 and 6.3 months for RRx-001 +platinum doublet and platinum doublet alone, respectively. Additionally, patients on the RRx001 + platinum doublet-treated experimental arm experienced less toxicity than patients on the platinum doublet-treated control arm. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size, preliminary results from REPLATINUM suggest a trend toward a favorable primary outcome and improved safety in RRx-001-treated patients and support the validity of the statistical assumptions that underlie the REPLATINUM(restrated) trial. Pivotal evidence will emerge from REPLATINUM(restrated), which is imminently recommencing.","Chiappori, A.; Fidler, M. J.; Salamat, M. A.; Reid, T. R.; Guo, X.; Wang, X.; Abrouk, N.

171516,Performance Comparison for E-Learning and Tools in Twenty-First Century with Legacy System Using Classification Approach,2021,"Abstract Objectives: To determine the prevalence and predictors of self-reported access to appropriate personal protective equipment (aPPE) for healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK) during the first UK national COVID-19 lockdown (March 2020) and at the time of questionnaire response (December 2020 - February 2021). Design: Two cross sectional analyses using data from a questionnaire-based cohort study. Setting: Nationwide questionnaire from 4th December 2020 to 28th February 2021. Participants: A representative sample of HCWs or ancillary workers in a UK healthcare setting aged 16 or over, registered with one of seven main UK healthcare regulatory bodies. Main outcome measure: Binary measure of self-reported aPPE (access all of the time vs access most of the time or less frequently) at two timepoints: the first national lockdown in the UK (primary analysis) and at the time of questionnaire response (secondary analysis). Results: 10,508 HCWs were included in the primary analysis, and 12,252 in the secondary analysis. 3702 (35.2%) of HCWs reported aPPE at all times in the primary analysis; 6806 (83.9%) reported aPPE at all times in the secondary analysis. After adjustment (for age, sex, ethnicity, migration status, occupation, aerosol generating procedure exposure, work sector, work region, working hours, night shift frequency and trust in employing organisation), older HCWs (per decade increase in age: aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.26, p<0.001) and those working in Intensive Care Units (1.61, 1.38 - 1.89, p<0.001) were more likely to report aPPE at all times. Those from Asian ethnic groups compared to White (0.77, 0.67 - 0.89, p<0.001), those in allied health professional (AHPs) and dental roles (vs those in medical roles; AHPs: 0.77, 0.68 - 0.87, p<0.001; dental: 0.63, 0.49 - 0.81, p<0.001), and those who saw a higher number of COVID-19 patients compared to those who saw none ([≥]21 patients 0.74, 0.61 - 0.90, p=0.003) were less likely to report aPPE at all times in the primary analysis. aPPE at all times was also not uniform across UK regions (reported access being better in South West and North East England than London). Those who trusted their employing organisation to deal with concerns about unsafe clinical practice, compared to those who did not, were twice as likely to report aPPE at all times (2.18, 1.97 - 2.40, p<0.001). With the exception of occupation, these factors were also significantly associated with aPPE at all times in the secondary analysis. Conclusions: We found that only a third of HCWs in the UK reported aPPE at all times during the period of the first lockdown and that aPPE had improved later in the pandemic. We also identified key sociodemographic and occupational determinants of aPPE during the first UK lockdown, the majority of which have persisted since lockdown was eased. These findings have important public health implications for HCWs, particularly as cases of infection and long-COVID continue to rise in the UK.","Martin, C.

The purpose of this study is to interpret the Purpose in Life Test (PIL) and its relationship to physical activity and mental relaxation/meditation in confinement. A survey was conducted in an online form on 533 individuals (39 ± 11 years) using the Purpose in Life Test (PIL) and an ad-hoc questionnaire regarding physical activity time (PA), mental relaxation/meditation time (RM), hours of sleep (HS), number of people in confinement (NPC) and concerns and satisfaction during confinement. The overall mean of the PIL test was 114 ± 16, indicating a strong life purpose, and there were no differences by sex or by levels of physical activity, but for RM and age levels. The scores of the PIL test were positively correlated with the age, PA and time of RM. On the other hand, the main concern is the economy (50%) and health or getting sick by COVID-19 (37%), and what gives the greatest satisfaction is the family (40%) and sharing and spending time with the family (33%). People who perform RM activities at least 30 min/week have significantly higher PIL test scores. Despite the drastic changes caused by confinement, individuals have a strong life purpose.

172138,The challenges of deploying artificial intelligence models in a rapidly evolving pandemic,2020-05-19,"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic during 2020 due to its high contagiousness and the high mobility of the world's population today. In just one year, this virus has caused millions of infections and deaths worldwide. These numbers will continue to grow until the population becomes immune to the virus thanks to an effective vaccine. Until this is possible, the only viable strategy is to try to stop its expansion through preventive measures such as limiting mobility, the use of masks, etc. In order to support these measures, this article presents a service to provide safe navigation solutions to reduce the likelihood of infection by avoiding potential conflict areas in the city. To identify these hotspots, a strategy that combines a rule-based system and a common-sense knowledge base is proposed. Through this strategy, an occupation model and a danger model are inferred. This requires the prior capture of knowledge about the general functioning of the city, its inhabitants and the virus. The proposed service makes decisions from these two models. Finally, a validation process has been carried out through surveys to evaluate the proposed solution. Obtained results demonstrate the potential of the proposed solution as a tool to identify safe routes that allow citizens to move around the city with low exposure to COVID-19.","Cantarero, R.; Rubio, A.; Romero, M.

The impact of this pandemic on education globally has led to a surge in online teaching and the use of various digital technologies and platforms to support instructional practices. However, this world-changing event has foregrounded the limitations of technology in addition to other important indications, particularly as it relates to the notion of value and by extension value creation. Within the context of the Vietnamese higher education ecosystem, what is evident is that a re-evaluation of values is worth considering, in terms of the value of local higher education institutions, in addition to the value creation produced by the same. This article will engage with pertinent implications for the post-COVID realities which offer untold challenges and opportunities in Vietnam and elsewhere. Moreover, the post-COVID realities of late modernity only serve to accentuate the importance of values and value creation in this context as higher education institutions would re-evaluate, rethink, and retool approaches to instructional practices. A focus on questions of value aids in considering the broader conditions and contexts which support some of the fruitful and situated outcomes of higher education which includes human capital development, employment, social mobility and the production of modern social identities.","Felix, J.

172644,The impact of sharing platforms on collaborative design development during emergencies: The case of COVID-19,2020,"With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, scalable and high-throughput diagnostic testing is essential nationwide. Currently, RT-PCR has been the preferred method of viral detection and many manufacturers offer commercial kits for routine clinical diagnostics. In response to the incoming of various kits, there is a need to assess their performance and compatibility of use in clinical laboratories. Kit characteristics impact the testing workflow of these laboratories and some factors can render a kit to perform sub-optimally, leading to false results that are misleading for public safety. Here, we evaluated six commercial kits that are predominantly distributed to appointed testing facilities across Indonesia.

Past research has highlighted the corrosive effects of unemployment on health and health behaviors. This study examines whether the effects of job loss on changes in body mass index (BMI) are moderated by genetic predisposition using data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To improve detection of gene-by-environment (G x E) interplay, we interacted layoffs from business closures (a plausibly exogenous environmental exposure) with whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) that capture genetic contributions to both the population mean (mPGS) and variance (vPGS) of BMI. Results show evidence of genetic moderation using a vPGS (as opposed to an mPGS) and indicate genome-wide summary measures of phenotypic plasticity may further our understanding of how environmental stimuli modify the distribution of complex traits in a population.","Schmitz, L.

However, it is not economical to install multiple high-performance devices with a great recognition model only for mask recognition, and not fast to use the combination of camera shooting devices and cloud computing. Therefore, this paper put forward an edge-cloud computing system, whose purpose is to use the poor computing resources of the edge server to share the computing pressure of the cloud server. In other words, the recognition tasks are assigned not only to the cloud device but also to the edge devices with poor computing power and a simple recognition model. The scheduling optimization problem is solved by reinforcement learning method. In the case of insufficient and imperfect data sets, this system still shows high recognition accuracy and fast response speed.","Yang, D.; Yang, T.; Gao, F.; Shi, P. Q.; Liang, S.

A Community View on Graph Processing Systems,2020-12-11,"Attitudes towards open peer review, open data and use of preprints influence scientists’ engagement with those practices. Yet there is a relatively small number of validated questionnaires that measure these attitudes. The goal of our study was to construct and validate such a questionnaire. Using a sample of Croatian scientists (N=541), from a wide range of disciplines, we developed a questionnaire titled Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP). The questionnaire has 21 item with a four-factor structure (attitudes towards: open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities). Based on the questionnaire, the attitudes of Croatian scientists towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median of 3.3 out of 5 of the total attitude score. Croatian scientist attitudes were lowest for open peer-review in small scientific communities (Md 2.0) and highest for open data (Md 3.9).","Baždarić, K; Vrkić, I; Arh, E; Mavrinac, M; Gligora Marković, M; Bilić-Zulle, L; Stojanovski, J; Malički, M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.395376,398

However, it has not been clarified how the aerosol dispersion, which has been assumed to be the leading transmission factor, could be reduced by masks which are specially designed for singers. Material and Methods: 12 professional singers (10 of the Bavarian Radio-Chorus and two freelancers, 7 females and 5 males) were asked to sing the melody of the ode of joy of Beethovens 9. symphony Freude schoener Goetterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium in D-major without masks and afterwards with five different singers masks, all distinctive in their material and proportions. Every task was conducted after inhaling the basic liquid from an e-cigarette. The aerosol dispersion was recorded by three high-definition video cameras during and after the task. The cloud was segmented and the dispersion was analyzed for all three spatial dimensions. Further, the subjects were asked to rate the practicability of wearing the tested masks during singing activities using a questionnaire. Results: Concerning the median distances of dispersion, all masks were able to decrease the impulse dispersion of the aerosols to the front. In contrast, the dispersion to the sides and to the top was increased. The evaluation revealed that most of the subjects would reject performing a concert with any of the masks. Conclusion: Although, the results exhibit that the tested masks could be able to reduce the radius of aerosol expulsion for virus-laden aerosol particles, there are more improvements necessary to enable the practical implementations for professional singing.","Echternach, M.; Hermann, L.

173708,A Granular Computing-Driving Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Method for Supporting Large-Scale Group Decision Making,2021,"On 14 March 2020, the Spanish Government declared a state of alert for the first time since the reinstatement of democracy, confining millions of people to their homes in effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid emergency situations such as this, people need to be informed (Seeger et al., 2003). In light of this demand for information, the media responded by heightening the attention afforded to the pandemic and its news coverage, a phenomenon which has occurred repeatedly in similar situations (Ducharme, 2020;Pieri, 2018). Based on a survey of over 2,000 Catalan citizens during the period of lockdown, the main aim of this article is to analyse how the pandemic changed their information habits, gauge their perception of the media’s coverage and determine whether this coverage produced information overload. The results show an upsurge in media consumption as well as information overload among virtually half the population. This generates a paradox: despite the increased consumption of information, the media did not help to improve people’s understanding of the pandemic, but instead resulted in information fatigue, thus hindering comprehension. © Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/.","Masip, P.; Caballero, C.

173769,Vessel and Port Efficiency Metrics through Validated AIS data,2021-04-30,"Design/methodology/approach Food waste among consumers remains a great scourge affecting our world today. Scientific data and numerous reports show that food waste is a growing trend that has an impact on all stages of the agri-food chain. Recent studies provide valuable insights into how the Covid-19 pandemic has influenced consumer food habits, routines and wasteful behaviour at household level, appearing to show that increases in food waste ceased during lockdown. The authors propose Design Thinking (DT) not simply as a problem-solving approach but as a creative methodology by which the virtuous practices acquired by individuals to avoid food waste during lockdown might be maintained. This article supports the thesis that by applying DT it is possible to devise awareness-raising solutions aimed at encouraging the final consumer to maintain the good food management practices acquired during lockdown, in the long term. To support this hypothesis, two promising pre-pandemic awareness-raising campaigns put forward by design thinkers and practitioners to reduce food waste at consumer level will be discussed. Both initiatives confirm that the degree of awareness, understanding and assimilation of the ethical attitudes related to food waste can lead to long-term behavioural changes, bringing about a transition to desirable, feasible, viable, sustainable and responsible behaviour. Purpose Food waste has been acknowledged as one of the main issues undermining the sustainability of our world, which is why its reduction has been included among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN's 2030 Agenda. Furthermore, some studies have begun to link the concepts of food waste and food security with sustainable food consumption, suggesting that if individuals reduce their food waste, they can improve their food habits, health and that of the community while contributing to the achievement of several SDGs. However, to date few studies have foregrounded the existence of a concrete connection between food waste initiatives and consumer awareness, and few scholarly articles have focused on design thinking and waste, including food waste during the pandemic, a gap which the present article seeks to fill. Findings The results should inform an improved understanding of how empathy and creativity, two of the main determinants of the design thinking approach, can be used to promote and maintain sustainable food behaviours and ultimately reduce food waste among consumers by designing new food experiences. Originality/value This study has a very original and multi-disciplinary approach. Indeed, in order to reduce food waste, if uses a design thinking approach, for the first time in literature, to enhance the engagement of individuals in fighting food waste.","Massari, Sonia Principato Ludovica Antonelli Marta Pratesi Carlo Alberto",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seps.2021.101143,398
174013,Design for emergency: An open platform to design and implement user-centered solutions in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Deterministic epidemic models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, are immensely useful even if they lack the nuance and complexity of social contacts at the heart of network science modeling. Here we present a simple modification of the SIR equations to include the heterogeneity of social connection networks. A typical power-law model of social interactions from network science reproduces the observation that individuals with a high number of contacts, ``hubs'' or ``superspreaders'', can become the primary conduits for transmission. Conversely, once the tail of the distribution is saturated, herd immunity sets in at a smaller overall recovered fraction than in the analogous SIR model. The new dynamical equations suggest that cutting off the tail of the social connection distribution, i.e., stopping superspreaders, is an efficient non-pharmaceutical intervention to slow the spread of a pandemic, such as COVID-19.","Szapudi, I.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.02.20145490v1?rss=1,398
174491,Resilience: Some Conceptual Considerations in the Case of AI,2021,"BackgroundCapturing the scale of child maltreatment is difficult, but few would argue that it is anything less than a global problem which can affect victims’ health and well‐being throughout their life. Systems of detection, investigation and intervention for maltreated children are the subject of continued review and debate.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness of the formal use of family group decision‐making (FGDM) in terms of child safety, permanence (of child's living situation), child and family well‐being, and client satisfaction with the decision‐making process.Search MethodsBoth published and unpublished manuscripts were considered eligible for this review. Library staff from Scholarly Information (Brownless Biomedical Library) University of Melbourne, conducted 14 systematic bibliographic searches. Reviewers also checked the reference lists of all relevant articles obtained, and reference lists from previously published reviews. Researchers also hand‐searched 10 relevant journals.Selection CriteriaStudy samples of children and young people, aged 0–18 years, who have been the subject of a child maltreatment investigation, were eligible for this review. Studies had to have used random assignment to create treatment and control groups;or, parallel cohorts in which groups were assessed at the same point in time. Any form of FGDM, used in the course of a child maltreatment investigation or service, was considered an eligible intervention if it involved: a concerted effort to convene family, extended family, and community members;and professionals;and involved a planned meeting with the intention of working collaboratively to develop a plan for the safety well‐being of children;with a focus on family‐centred decision‐making.Data Collection and AnalysisTwo review authors independently extracted the necessary data from each study report, using the software application Covidence. Covidence highlighted discrepancies between data extracted by separate reviewers, further analysis was conducted until a consensus was reached on what data were to be included in the review. Two authors also independently conducted analyses of study bias.Main ResultsEighteen eligible study reports were found, providing findings from 15 studies, involving 18 study samples. Four were randomised controlled trials (RCTs;N = 941) the remainder employed quasi‐experimental designs with parallel cohorts. Three of the quasi‐experimental studies used prospective evaluations of nonrandomly assigned comparison groups (N = 4,368);the rest analysed pre‐existing survey data, child protection case files or court data (N = 91,786). The total number of children studied was 97,095. The longest postintervention follow‐up period was 3 years. Only four studies were conducted outside the United States;two in Canada and one in Sweden and one in the Netherlands. The review authors judged there to be a moderate or high risk of bias, in most of the bias categories considered. Only one study referenced a study protocol. Eleven of the fifteen studies were found to have a high likelihood of selection bias (73%). Baseline imbalance bias was deemed to be unlikely in just two studies, and highly likely in nine (60%). Confounding variables were judged to be highly likely in four studies (27%), and contamination bias was judged highly likely in five studies (33%). Researcher allegiance was rated as a high risk in three studies (20%) where the authors argued for the benefits of FGDM within the article, but without supporting references to an appropriate evidence base. Bias from differential diagnostic activity, and funding source bias, were less evident across the evidence reviewed. This review combines findings for eight FGDM outcome measures. Findings from RCTs were available for four outcomes, but none of these, combined in meta‐analysis or otherwise, were statistically significant. Combining findings from the quasi‐experimental studies provided one statistically significant finding, for the reunification of families, f vouring FGDM. Ten effect sizes, from nine quasi‐experimental studies, were synthesised to examine effects on the reunification of children with their family or the effect on maintaining in‐home care;in short, the effect FGDM has on keeping families together. There was a high level of heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 92%). The overall effect, based on the combination of these studies was positive, small, but statistically significant: odds ratio (OR), 1.69 (confidence interval [CI], 1.03, 2.78). Holinshead's (2017) RCT also measured the maintenance on in‐home care and reported a similar result: OR, 1.54 (CI, −0.19, 0.66) not statistically significant. The overall effect for continued maltreatment from meta‐analysis of five quasi‐experimental studies, favoured the FGDM group, but was not statistically significant: OR, 0.73 (CI, 0.48, 1.11). The overall combined effect for continued maltreatment, reported in RCTs, favoured the control group. But it was not statistically significant: OR, 1.29 (CI, 0.85, 1.98). Five effect sizes, from nonrandomised studies, were synthesised to examine the effect of FGDM on the number of kinship placements. The overall positive effect based on the combination of these studies was negligible: OR, 1.31 (CI, 0.94, 1.82). Meta‐analysis was not possible with other outcomes. FGDM's role in expediting case processing and case closures was investigated in six studies, three of which reported findings favouring FGDM, and three which favoured the comparison group. Children's placement stability was reported in two studies: an RCT's findings favoured the control, while a quasi‐experimental study's findings favoured FGDM. Three studies reported findings for service user satisfaction: one had only 30 participants, one reported a statistically significant positive effect for FGDM, the other found no difference between FGDM and a control. Engagement with support services was reported in two studies;neither reported statistically significant findings.Authors' ConclusionsThe current evidence base, in this field, is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of FGDM. These models of child protection decision‐making may help bring about better outcomes for children at risk, or they may increase the risk of further maltreatment. Further research of rigour, designed to avoid the potential biases of previous evaluations, is needed.","McGinn, Tony Best Paul Wilson Jason Chereni Admire Kamndaya Mphatso Shlonsky Aron",Campbell Systematic Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1088,398
174578,Analysing and predicting COVID-19 AI tracking using artificial intelligence,2021,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as a highly promising cell-free bio-therapeutics. While a range of engineering strategies have been developed to functionalize the EV surface, current approaches fail to address the limitations associated with endogenous surface display, pertaining to the heterogeneous display of commonly used EV-loading moieties among different EV subpopulations. Here we present a novel engineering platform to display multiple protein therapeutics simultaneously on the EV surface. As proof-of-concept, we screened multiple endogenous display strategies for decorating the EV surface with cytokine binding domains derived from tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and interleukin 6 signal transducer (IL6ST), which can act as decoys for the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL6, respectively. Combining synthetic biology and systematic screening of loading moieties, resulted in a three-component system which increased the display and decoy activity of TNFR1 and IL6ST, respectively. Further, this system allowed for combinatorial functionalization of two different receptors on the same EV surface. These cytokine decoy EVs significantly ameliorated disease phenotypes in three different inflammatory mouse models for systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and intestinal inflammation. Importantly, significantly improved in vitro and in vivo efficacy of these engineered EVs was observed when compared directly to clinically approved biologics targeting the IL6 and TNFα pathways.","Gupta, Dhanu; Wiklander, Oscar P.B; Görgens, André; Conceição, Mariana; Corso, Giulia; Liang, Xiuming; Seow, Yiqi; Balsu, Sriram; Felldin, Ulrika; Bostancioglu, Beklem; Fiona Lee, Yi Xin; Hean, Justin; Mäger, Imre; Roberts, Thomas C.; Gustafsson, Manuela; Mohammad, Dara K; Sork, Helena; Bäcklund, Alexandra; Edvard Smith, C.I.; Wood, Matthew J.A.; Vandenbroucke, Roosmarijn; Nordin, Joel Z.; Andaloussi, Samir EL",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.149823,398

Methods: Eligible trials randomized hospitalized patients with COVID-19 that compared either interleukin-6 receptor antagonist with usual care or placebo in a recent prospective meta-analysis (27 trials, 10930 patients) or that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab. Data were restricted to patients receiving corticosteroids and either non-invasive or invasive ventilation at randomization. Pairwise associations between tocilizumab, sarilumab and usual care or placebo for all-cause mortality 28 days after randomization were estimated using a frequentist contrast-based network meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs), implementing multivariate fixed-effects models that assume consistency between the direct and indirect evidence. Results: One trial (REMAP-CAP) was identified that directly compared tocilizumab with sarilumab and supplied results on all-cause mortality at 28-days. This network meta-analysis was based on 898 eligible patients (278 deaths) from REMAP-CAP and 3710 eligible patients from 18 trials (1278 deaths) from the prospective meta-analysis. Summary ORs were similar for tocilizumab [0.82 [0.71-0.95, P=0.008]] and sarilumab [0.80 [0.61-1.04, P=0.09]] compared with usual care or placebo. The summary OR for 28-day mortality comparing tocilizumab with sarilumab was 1.03 [95%CI 0.81-1.32, P=0.80]. The P value for the global test for inconsistency was 0.28. Conclusion: Administration of either tocilizumab or sarilumab was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality compared with usual care or placebo.

Food insecure students at a Midwest university during Fall 2020. Previous research has identified a need for IS to be incorporated into nutrition interventions to better address program sustainability at community and institutional levels. A satellite campus food pantry was created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and is located at the university's recreation center. This food assistance program provides free food for students in need and was open 3 hours a day, twice a week from August to December. Pantry staff tracked implementation costs, food waste, and student usage. Pantry clients were invited to take an anonymous online survey to assess their satisfaction and acceptability of the pantry using valid and reliable questionnaires. In 28 service days, there were 353 visits with a total of 475 people served, and 150 different student users. The majority (n = 113, 75.3%) only visited the pantry once or twice, while 24.7% (n = 37) visited the pantry at least once a month. Of students relying on the pantry for monthly visits, only 27% were affected by COVID-19. Thus far, 97% of implementation costs are attributed to staff pay. The majority of landfilled food waste (591.4 pounds) was produce (15.8% fruit, 49.9% vegetables) and 18.2% was from premade items like sandwiches, salads, and pastas. Average student satisfaction (n = 45) was 27.3 out of 30 and acceptability was 13.7 out of 16. The pantry is well accepted by students and results suggest it may be needed beyond pandemic times with limited users being affected by COVID-19. Additionally, while advantageous that the pantry receives premade food from other campus programs, more research is needed to determine if the pantry is the best option for redistributing these food items.

175319,Reacting to the emergency by opening perspectives: Design-driven knit therapy as an adaptable tool to answer the change,2020,"Background: The T2∗ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for the noninvasive quantification of iron overload has significantly improved the survival of patients with hemoglobinopathies by tailoring the chelation therapy. In Italy, the E-MIOT (Extension-Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia) Network, a collaborative project among MRI and hematological centers, has assured high-quality quantification of iron in vital organs such as heart, liver, and pancreas. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare services around the world, also leading to postpone or delete deferable diagnostic evaluations. Aim: We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on MRI services for iron overload quantification in Italy. Methods: The activity of the MRI centers of the E-MIOT Network in the year 2020 was compared to the activity in the same months of 2019. A specific survey was filled out by the MRI operators to evaluate if the availability of MRI slots for patients with hemoglobinothies was reduced and the reasons. Results: In comparison with the year 2019, in 2020 there was a significant reduction in the number of T2∗ MRIs performed (350 vs 656;P < 0.0001). The comparison month by month between the two years highlighted a marked decline (86.9%) in the four-month period March-June 2020, a reduction in the gap between the two years in the three-month period July-September, and a new decline (41.4%) in the three-month period October-December (Figure 1). No patient with hemoglobinopathy could undergo an MRI scan during the Italian lockdown (9 March-10 May 2020). Figure 2 shows the percentage of decline (year 2020 vs 2019) in the number of T2∗MRI scans for each MRI center. If no decline or an increase were present, the vertical axis was set at 0. All centers experienced a significant drop in the number of the T2∗ MRIs in the fourmonth period March-June (from 75 to 100%). In the three-month period July-September only the centers of Pisa and Taranto dropped the number of T2∗ MRIs due to the rescheduling of the other MRI appointments deleted during the lockdown. In the three-month period October-December a reduction of the T2∗ MRI scans was experienced by all centers, except for Campobasso. In the centers of Ferrara and Lamezia Terme the reduction was the consequence of the general reduction in the number of the total MRIs scheduled per day for the sanitation procedures. In the other centers, the availability for T2∗ MRI scans was unchanged in comparison to 2019, but the patients refused the MRI follow up for fear of getting sick of COVID. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a strong negative impact on the quantification of iron overload by MRI, which may seriously worsen the prognosis of patients with hemoglobinopathies. Strategies to ensure proved lifesaving MRI exam and to reassure patients about the health safety of the hospitals are recommended.","Pepe, A.; Pistoia, L.; Restaino, G.; Vallone, A.; Righi, R.; Renne, S.; Fina, P.; Riva, A.; Massei, F.; Argento, C.; Commendatore, F.

175631,Natural language predicts viral escape,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus has infected and affected millions of life across the globe. As the burden of COVID-19 continues to rise, compliance with the use of COVID-19 biosecurity protective items by the public is critical in safeguarding interperson transmissions of the virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive study was carried out from April to May 2020 on a cross-section of 400 adult Nigerians in a rural hospital in eastern Nigeria. Data collection was done using structured, pretested, and researcher-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire elicited information on drivers, barriers, benefits, and perceived dangers of the use of biosecurity protective items (face masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizers). RESULTS: The study participants were aged 18-84 years with a mean age of 53 +/- 11.6 years. There were 214 (53.5%) females. The most common driver of use of COVID-19 biosecurity protective items was government public health legislative directives (400/400) (100.0%). The most common barrier was a denial of the existence of COVID-19 (359/400) (89.8%). The most common benefits were protection from contracting COVID-19 (400/400) (100.0%) and prevent spreading the infection to others (400/400) (100.0%). The most commonly perceived dangers were suffocation (400/400) (100.0%) and hand irritation (377/400) (94.3%) for face masks and hand sanitizers, respectively. CONCLUSION: The most common driver was government public health legislative directives.

An application of artificial neural networks to examine behavioral biases,2021,"Pathogens that are resistant against drug treatment are widely observed. In contrast, pathogens that escape the immune response elicited upon vaccination are rare. Previous studies showed that the prophylactic character of vaccines, the multiplicity of epitopes to which the immune system responds within a host, and their diversity between hosts delay the evolution and emergence of escape mutants in a vaccinated population. By extending previous mathematical models, we find that, depending on the cost of the escape mutations, there even exist critical levels of immune response diversity that completely prevent vaccine escape. Furthermore, to quantify the potential for vaccine escape below these critical levels, we propose a concept of escape depth which measures the fraction of escape mutants that can spread in a vaccinated population. Determining this escape depth for a vaccine could help to predict its sustainability in the face of pathogen evolution.","Bouman, Judith A; Capelli, Céline; Regoes, Roland R",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.14.439790,398

This study aimed to investigate the compliance with personal protective equipment use and identify the factors that may influence users' compliance. The study was designed cross-sectionally, with a self-administered questionnaire. The respondents were non-medical healthcare professionals recruited from covid and non-covid ward at Saiful Anwar General Hospital. The data were collected in November 2020. The questionnaire consists of four questions to assess compliance and eighteen questions to explore factors that may be related to their compliance. This study used the Chi-square test to differentiate the level of compliance between two groups and binary logistic regression to analyze factors that may influence the compliance. Most participants in this study were female (84.8%), with a median age of 33 (23 - 57) years. More than 80 % of participants worked in the non-covid ward. Only one-fifth of participants had work experience of more than 15 years. The compliance with personal protective equipment was 67.3%. From univariate analysis, factors that influenced the compliance were difficulty using, removing, and disposing of personal protective equipment, lack of training and regular monitoring, unsure feeling about the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, discomfort in donning personal protective equipment. Co-workers never reminding themselves to use personal protective equipment also influenced compliance. From multivariate analysis, the difficulty in using, removing, and disposing of personal protective equipment (OR 2.83 (0.730 - 3.478), p=0.025) significantly influenced compliance with personal protective equipment use.","Diana, E.

The SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells and plays a major role in cellular entry leading to infection. High expression of ACE2 has been suggested to be a potential risk factor for virus infection and disease severity. However the profile of ACE2 gene expression in diseases of the upper airways remains poorly understood. We herein investigated ACE2 gene expression in the nasal tissues of a cohort of Swedish patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNPs) using RT-qPCR. ACE2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced in the nasal mucosa of CRSwNP patients compared to that of controls. Moreover, we observed a sex-dependant difference in nasal ACE2 expression, where significantly lower levels of the ACE2 transcript were detected in the nasal mucosa of only female CRSwNP patients. These findings indicate that CRSwNP patients with a decrease in ACE2 gene expression may thereby be less prone to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. These results enhance our understanding on the profile of ACE2 expression in the nasal mucosa of patients with upper airway diseases, and their susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Fowler, P.

This clinical trial aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) on symptoms of pediatric (greater than or equal to 6 years) and adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis. Methods: We conducted an 8-center, multi-national, open-label, rater-blinded Phase IIb study (IB1001-201). Patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidosis were assessed during a baseline period, a 6-week treatment period (orally administered NALL 4 g/day in patients greater than or equal to 13 years, weight-tiered doses for patients 6-12 years), and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. The primary Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) endpoint (based on a 7-point Likert scale) was assessed by blinded, centralized raters who compared randomized video pairs of each patient performing a pre-defined primary anchor test (8-Meter Walk Test or 9Hole Peg Test) during each study periods. Secondary outcomes included cerebellar rating scales (namely Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia), clinical global impression, and quality of life assessments. Results: 30 patients aged 6 to 55 years with a confirmed diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidosis (TaySachs or Sandhoff's disease) were enrolled. 29 patients were included in the primary modified intention-to-treat analysis. NALL met the CI-CS primary endpoint (mean difference 0.71, SD=2.09, 90% CI 0.00, 1.50, p=0.044), as well as secondary endpoints. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: This study showed NALL led to a statistically significant improvement in symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in patients with GM2 gangliosidosis. It is a safe, well-tolerated, easily administered oral therapy, therefore offering a favorable risk/benefit profile for this serious, debilitating disorder. NALL is a new therapeutic option for the treatment of this rare disease that has no other approved therapies worldwide.

Because of different socioeconomic profiles in Tehran's areas, we will provide a clear picture of the pandemic distribution in Tehran's neighbourhoods during the first months of its spread from February to July 2020, employing a spatial-temporal analysis applying the geographical information system (GIS). Disease rates were estimated by location during the 5 months, and hot spots and cold spo s were highlighted.Methods: This study was performed using the COVID-19 incident cases and deaths recorded in the Medical Care Monitoring Centre from February 20, to July 20, 2020. The local Getis-Ord Gi* method was applied to identify the hotspots where the infectious disease distribution had significantly clustered spatially. A statistical analysis for incidence and mortality rates and hot spots was conducted using ArcGIS 10.7 software.Results: The addresses of 43,000 Tehrani patients (15,514 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 27,486 diagnosed as probable cases) were changed in its Geo-codes in the GIS. The highest incidence rate from February to July 2020 was 48 per 10,000 and the highest 5-month incidence rate belonged to central and eastern neighbourhoods. According to the Cumulative Population density of patients, the higher number is estimated by more than 2500 people in the area;however, the lower nu ber is highlighted by about 500 people in the neighborhood. Also, the results from the local Getis-Ord Gi* method indicate that COVID-19 has formed a hotspot in the eastern, southeast, and central districts in Tehran since February. We also observed a death rate hot spot in eastern areas. Conclusion: Because of the spread of COVID-19 disease throughout Tehran's neighborhoods with different socioeconomic status, it seems essential to pay attention to health behaviors to prevent the next waves of the disease.

The CDAI has provider and patient components, whilst the RAPID3 only has patient driven measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine visits relied on RAPID3 as a clinical outcome measure and subsequently was incorporated into all clinical visits in addition to the CDAI. On an ad-hoc basis, discrepancies were noted for the disease activity level generated by these two measures. The purpose of this retrospective study was to formally analyze the relationship between these measures. Objectives: To determine the concordance of the outcome measures RAPID3 with CDAI in patients with established RA as a quality improvement project. Methods: This is a retrospective study of 49 patients that fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis. IRB approval was obtained. The medical records of patients seen between June to October 2020 at the rheumatology department at UF health were reviewed. Data collected included age, gender, race, number of years with RA, Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (CCP Ab) positivity, disease modifying treatments, ESR and CRP as well as CDAI and RAPID3 scores as calculated by clinic staff. The charts were reviewed by the authors and RAPID3 scores were verified. Results: The population ranged from 35-90 years and duration of RA from 1-30 years. CCP Ab was present in 75% of patients and RF in 71%. Patients were on DMARDs either monontherapy (29%), dual therapy (60%) or triple therapy (10%). Antirheumatic medications used were plaquenil, methotrexate, leflunomide, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, tofacitinib, upadacitinib and rituximab. ESR range was 2-110 and CRP 0.2-83.1. The CDAI and RAPID3 concordance was found to be 37% with RAPID3 being higher in 45% of patients. RAPID3 was lower only in 14% of patients. There was incorrect calculation of the RAPID3 26% of the time by clinic staff. Table 1 summarizes this data. Figure 1 shows RAPID3 and CDAI compared in scatterplots. Conclusion: This study shows that RAPID3 may overestimate disease activity level for patients above low disease activity.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 43% of adults aged 60 and above reported experiencing loneliness. People with diabetes (DM) are 2 to 3 times more likely to have depression than those without DM. Loneliness and depression often co-exist and each is likely to worsen DM outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine how loneliness and depression affect A1C levels among middle-aged and older adults with DM. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of data from the Midlife in the United States Refresher (MIDUS-R) survey that included a national sample of U.S. adults aged 25 to 74 years. We conducted correlation analyses and estimated a hierarchical logistic regression to predict people with A1C levels ≤ 7 or > 7 using the following sets of predictors: 1) demographics and physical health (ethnicity, gender, education, age, and comorbidities), 2) family and friends support, and 3) psychological factors (loneliness and depression). Results: The sample was composed of 92 participants with DM and A1C data in the MIDUS-R. Mean age was 57.37±11.83, 51% were male, and 68 % were non-Hispanic Whites;39.1 % had A1C >7. The average level of depression was low (CES-D mean 9.42) and loneliness was moderate (mean 12.43, range 1-28). Loneliness was correlated with A1C (r= .26, p< .05);depressive symptoms (r= .71, p< .001), family and friends support (r=.36, r=.38, respectively, both p<.001). Only loneliness significantly predicted higher A1C levels in this analysis. People with higher levels of loneliness had increased odds of having an A1C >7 (OR = 1.18, p < .05) after controlling for depression and all other variables. Conclusion: Loneliness is more prevalent and had a greater impact than depression on A1C level. Healthcare providers should assess patients for loneliness and reduce adverse health impacts by referring them for psychosocial interventions as needed.","Huang, Ya Ching Garcia Alexandra A.; Cho, Emma S.; Kuo, Hsuanju",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-520-p,398
178482,Energy Security and Portfolio Diversification: Conventional and Novel Perspectives,2021,"COVID-19 is a viral respiratory infectious disease caused by the novel strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M-pro) is associated with viral replication and transcription, thereby making it a potent target for combating COVID-19. Natural compounds from plants are being widely explored for viral inhibitors due to their safety aspect. Therefore, the present study aimed at predicting the antiviral property of red rice phenolic metabolites (RRPM) from three Indian rice varieties against SARS-CoV-2 M-pro through metabolomics and in silico studies. The Indian red rice cultivars, i.e., Veethi vadankan, Samba mosanam and Kuzhiadichan, were subjected to Q-TOF-LC-MS analysis and eighteen abundant polyphenols were selected using hierarchical cluster analysis. The abundant RRPM were virtually screened using Swiss ADME, a web-based tool. All the abundant polyphenols obeyed the Lipinski's rule except for hesperetin 3'-O-glucuronide, thereby exhibiting drug likeliness. Based on ADME analysis, fifteen of the RRPM showed good oral bioavailability, high GI absorption and acceptable overall bioavailability score. The 15 RRPM were further subjected to molecular docking analysis using Auto dock 1.5.6 against SARS-CoV-2M(pro). The analysis revealed 7, 4'-dihydroxy flavone and eriodictyol to have strong binding affinity (>10 kcal/mol) higher than nelfinavir (-8.53 kcal/mol). Eight other compounds also proved to be potential natural inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M-pro.

We examined the effect of prior infection with ancestral (D614G) or Beta variants on Ad26.COV2.S immunogenicity approximately 28 days post-vaccination. We compared healthcare workers who were SARS-CoV-2 naive (n=20), to those infected during the first wave prior to the emergence of Beta (n=20), and those infected in the second wave (n=20), when Beta was the dominant variant. We demonstrate that a priming exposure from infection significantly increased the magnitude of spike binding antibodies, neutralizing antibodies and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity (ADCC) against D614G, Beta and Delta variants. The magnitude of antibody boosting was similar in both waves, despite the longer time interval between wave 1 infection and vaccination (7 months), compared to wave 2 (2 months). ADCC and binding cross-reactivity was similar in both waves. However, neutralization cross-reactivity varied by wave, showing that the antibody repertoire was shaped by the spike sequence of the infecting variant. Robust CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to spike of similar or higher magnitude as those elicited by infection were induced after vaccination. In contrast to antibody responses, prior infection was not required for the generation of high magnitude T cell responses, and T cell recognition of the Beta variant was fully preserved. Therefore, Ad26.COV2.S vaccination following prior infection, even >6 months previously, may result in substantially enhanced protection against COVID-19, of particular relevance in settings of high SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence. Furthermore, the dominant impact of the infecting variant on neutralization breadth after vaccination has important implications for the design of second-generation vaccines based on variants of concern.","Keeton, R.; Richardson, S.

The models work through three steps: image pre-processing, image feature extraction and classification using the models above, and model evaluation. Experimental results show that an in-house CNN structure that we have developed from scratch performs better than the ResNet50 model and is comparable to the performance of the MobileNet-v2 model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hussain, A.; Hosseinimanesh, G.; Naeimabadi, S.; Al Kayed, N.; Alam, R.","Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-82199-9_40,398

179456,Centrality in Epidemic Networks with Time-Delay: A Decision-Support Framework for Epidemic Containment,2021,"The global pandemic COVID-19 has forced traditional teaching pedagogies to meet the new educational demands such as remote learning. The safety measures and regulations of COVID-19, such as social distancing, have challenged all facets of education to transform their pedagogical strategies to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, but the rate has been slow to catch up the lost learning time in Early Childhood Care Education (ECCE). This study, underpinned in critical emancipatory research, responded to two questions: what are the challenges of ECCE in the context of COVID-19 and how ECCE could adapt ways of promoting transformative pedagogical strategies. This article underpins the notion that ECCE practitioners should be equipped with novel technology methodologies that replace traditional face-to-face teaching and learning. However, it is reasonable to believe that face-to-face teaching and learning will not be totally replaced by any other new methodology or fads;it will remain important for some years to come, especially in the lower level classes. A hybrid approach of using both the in-person and distance learning strategies for flexibility and manageability by both learners and practitioners seems promising at the moment. In short, this paper explores the challenges to explore promotion of pedagogical transformation strategies in ECCE, and offers some correctives because this will be an ongoing issue for years to come. There are no easy solutions to be packaged in fancy terminology. We argue that the early promotion of transformative pedagogical strategies will assist the children and make the practitioners' work more flexible and understandable. © Authors.","Thulebona, S.; Zukiswa, N.; Bekithemba, D.","International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research",https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.20.5.10,398

COVID-19 has so far instigated a massive loss of lives globally and even the countries with the most advanced healthcare systems have come under its grasp. Health experts suggest in such case ""Prevention is better than cure"" which includes an appropriate daily lifestyle and a rugged immune system that could help mankind surmount this peril. This review highlights the importance of influential herbs and their medicinal significance. Biomedical articles were explored from PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science for the period of 2010-2021.

Accordingly, this article highlights some of the role of prevalent Ayurvedic herbs in promoting immunity for combating the novel coronavirus. The herbs in combination with drugs could be utilized for the sake of curtailing the side effects as well as the malefic repercussions of strong synthetic drugs used for treating COVID-19 patients, which would be a paramount leap in the field of Ayurveda as well as western-style medicine.

This novel coronavirus not only involves the respiratory system, but also affects the heart, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Arrhythmias in COVID-19 are increasingly being documented and seem to have a prognostic significance, especially in critically ill patients. In patients with COVID-19, a variety of arrhythmias have been reported, ranging from the benign to potentially life-threatening. Multiple mechanisms, such as myocarditis, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances and QT interval-prolonging drugs (e.g. hydroxychloroquine), are responsible for arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19 ranges from 3.6% to 60%, with sinus tachycardia being the most common rhythm abnormality. Other rhythm abnormalities, such as sinus bradycardia, atrial arrhythmias and complete heart block, have also been reported. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with COVID-19 with multiple comorbidities, portend a bad prognosis. Additionally, the use of QT interval-prolonging drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin, increases the risk of torsades de pointes. Hence, there is a need for continuous rhythm monitoring, with prompt recognition of arrhythmias in critically ill patients and those on QT-prolonging medications. Management of these arrhythmias is similar to those in patients without COVID-19, with a focus on correcting reversible causes and maintaining haemodynamic stability.","Parashar, Nitin Kumar Shekhar Kunal Mahla Himanshu Gupta Kashish Pathak Vijay",European Journal of Arrhythmia & Electrophysiology,https://doi.org/10.17925/ejae.2021.7.1.33,398

Specifically, the home range in 2020 decreased to approximately 50% of that in 2019 because of COVID-19 infection control measures, preventing people from traveling far from their homes and only allowing them to step outside for the bare minimum of daily activities and necessities. The results suggest that the emergency reduced people’s home ranges to the neighborhood scale.

We study this impact by considering the following aspects: the number of hospital beds per 100k inhabitants, number of intensive care units per 100k inhabitants, population density, and coloring of their cities. We use official data published by the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador until May 28th and June 12th, 2020, and the Ecuadorian Secretariat for Risk Management (SNGRE). To carry out the analysis, we use multivariate statistical techniques: Cluster Analysis and Canonical Biplot.

Finally, we encountered that the coloring system of the provinces alone does not seem to be a determinant measure in the growth rate of deaths and cases.

We here describe a method for fluorescence labeling of RNAs of any length, via the enzymatic incorporation of the minimally perturbing and intrinsically fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue tCO. Using this approach, we demonstrate incorporation of tCO in up to 100% of all natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). The resulting transcript is fully compatible with both in vitro transcription and subsequent in cell translation. Spectroscopic characterization of the in vitro transcribed mRNA, shows that the incorporation rate of tCO is on par with cytosine, facilitating efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that the tCO-labeled mRNA is efficiently and correctly translated into H2B:GFP upon electroporation as well as lipid-mediated transfection of human Huh-7 cells; correct translation was further confirmed in cell-free systems. Importantly, the spectral properties of the tCO-modified transcripts and their translation product, in this case H2B:GFP, allow for their straightforward and simultaneous visualization in live cells.","Baladi, Tom; Nilsson, Jesper R.; Gallud, Audrey; Celauro, Emanuele; Gasse, Cécile; Levi-Acobas, Fabienne; Sarac, Ivo; Hollenstein, Marcel; Dahlén, Anders; Esbjörner, Elin K.; Wilhelmsson, L.

However, other species have remained relatively understudied, leaving the possibility that well-developed navigational abilities are widespread. Here, we measured short-term space use in non-territorial, non-migratory cane toads (Rhinella marina) in their native range in French Guiana. After establishing home range, we tested their ability to return to home following translocations of 500 and 1000 meters. Toads were able to travel in straight trajectories back to home areas, suggesting map-like navigational abilities similar to those observed in amphibians with more complex spatial behavior. These observations break with the current paradigm of amphibian navigation and suggest that navigational abilities may be widely shared among amphibians.","Shaykevich, Daniel A.; Pašukonis, Andrius; O’Connell, Lauren A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.16.448742,398
182473,COVID-19 Diagnosis with Deep Learning,2022,"Previous studies have shown that neurons exhibit trial-by-trial correlated activity and that such noise correlations (NCs) greatly impact the accuracy of population codes. Meanwhile, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a mainstream approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it remains unclear how NCs between voxels influence MVPA performance. Here, we tackle this issue by combining voxel-encoding modeling and MVPA. We focus on a well-established form of NC, tuning-compatible noise correlation (TCNC), whose sign and magnitude are systematically related to the tuning similarity between two units. We first replicate the classical finding that TCNCs impair population codes in a standard neuronal population. We then extend our analysis to fMRI data, and show that voxelwise TCNCs do not impair and can even improve MVPA performance when TCNCs are strong or the number of voxels is large. We also confirm these results using standard information-theoretic analyses in computational neuroscience. Further computational analyses demonstrate that the discrepancy between the effect of TCNCs in neuronal and voxel populations can be explained by tuning heterogeneity and pool sizes. Our results provide a theoretical foundation to understand the effect of correlated activity on population codes in macroscopic fMRI data. Our results also suggest that future fMRI research could benefit from a closer examination of the correlational structure of multivariate responses, which is not directly revealed by conventional MVPA approaches.","Zhang, Ru-Yuan; Wei, Xue-Xin; Kay, Kendrick",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/592618,398
182526,Open design and 3D printing of face shields: The case study of a UK-China initiative,2020,"Introduction Following completion of chemotherapy with curative intent for DLBCL, for those in remission (CR), numerous national and international guidelines suggest on-going follow-up primarily to detect relapse of disease. For example, the NCCN guidelines suggest that clinical history, examination and blood investigations should be performed every 3-6 months for 5 years and as clinically indicated thereafter. This is essentially a “screening programme” for an at-risk population that continues based on historical routine rather than due to evidence it is of benefit to the patient. Numerous papers have been published suggesting that routine surveillance scans or bloods such as LDH are not useful in this setting. We sought to analyse whether the screening procedures that are performed in the follow-up setting are useful in the detection of relapse in patients followed up in a single centre. Uniquely, we examined each time point separately rather than group all follow-up events together. Methods Data was obtained retrospectively from electronic patient records for all patients in remission following treatment with frontline chemotherapy for DLBCL at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 2005-2016. Screening assessments analysed were symptoms check, clinical examination, LDH >upper limit of normal, lymphocyte: monocyte ratio (LMR) <2.8, routine CT scans. Time-points for analysis of routine clinic appointments were derived from the British guidelines which advise 3 monthly follow up in the first year, 6 months in year 2 and annually up to 5 years. True positives were defined as patients who had a positive result and relapsed within that specified time period or within 6 months, whereas false negatives were only considered for those patients who had a negative test within the time period that they relapsed. Results Complete data from 262 patients who achieved a CR and were followed up was available. Median age was 63 years (17-94) with 59 patients with stage 1 disease, and 100 with stage 4 disease. The relapse rate was 59/261 (23%), with a median time to relapse of 13 months (2-120). Of the 59, 52 had symptoms they had noted prior to clinic, of whom 28 requested an early appointment to clinic and 22 waited until their routine clinic appointment or sought advice from other health professionals initially. Only 7 patients were picked up only on investigations performed at the hospital, 1 with hypercalcemia and 6 on routine scan with no symptoms, 3 at 3-6months, 2 and 9-12months and 1 at 12-18 months. Of these, 4/7 patients achieved a CR with subsequent therapy. The remaining 202 patients had 2853 clinic appointments, median number per patient 13 (1-44). The negative predictive value of clinical history, examination, LDH, LMR and CT scan was consistently very high (>90%) at all time points. However, the positive predictive value was low for symptoms, 0-35% with the higher values being in the first year. Clinical examination had better PPV due to fewer positive results, including both true and false. LDH and LMR were associated with a poor PPV at all time points. PPV for CT scans was variable (Table 1). Conclusions The “screening” of patients who are in remission from DLBCL requires considerable health resources and cost and also leads to increased exposure of the patient to hospitals which during the COVID-19 pandemic is being discouraged. Likelihood of relapse (which decreases with time) has an impact on the effectiveness of a screening programme, the relapse rate in this cohort was 23% in keeping with other published data. Importantly, the majority of patients had symptoms suggestive of relapse and so the screening was not required. In the few that were asymptomatic when relapse was diagnosed, there was insufficient data to know whether this earlier detection led to a better outcome, however this has not been seen in other published cohorts. Finally the effectiveness of the screening is dependent on the predictive value of the “tests” being used and this dataset shows that whilst the negative predictive value is igh, the positive predictive value is very variable and generally poor for all tools used. We propose that educating the patient regarding symptoms of relapse and having patient directed clinical follow-up rather than routine appointments would lead to marked savings in health resources, reduce hospital exposure of patients by eliminating unnecessary visits without compromising the outcome of the patients.

Most scientific debate in the field of human action-stopping currently focuses on two interrelated questions. First: Which mental and neural processes underpin the implementation of inhibitory control, and which reflect the attentional detection of salient stop-signals instead? Second: Why do physiological signatures of inhibition occur at two different latencies after stop-signals (for visual signals, either before or after ∼150ms)? Here, we address both questions via two pre-registered experiments that combined transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromyography, and multi-variate pattern analysis of whole-scalp electroencephalography. Using a stop-signal task that also contained a second type of salient signal that did not require stopping, we found that both signals induced equal amounts of early-latency inhibitory activity, whereas only later signatures (after 175ms) distinguished the two. These findings resolve ongoing debates in the literature and strongly suggest a two-step model of action-stopping.","Tatz, Joshua R.; Soh, Cheol; Wessel, Jan R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.26.433098,398

This article examines the conditions for establishment and long-term population dynamic behavior of pathogens that infect multiple species of hosts. The article attempts to address three major questions in this area: First, under which conditions will increases in the diversity of host species buffer infectious disease outbreaks, and under which conditions will host diversity amplify disease outbreaks? Second, under what conditions is it possible to control an infectious agent by focusing control against only one host species? Third, what role does host species diversity play in maintaining pathogen persistence? The answers to these questions supply some important general insights into the role that biodiversity plays in buffering humans and other species against new and emerging pathogens.","Dobson, Andrew",The American naturalist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15540143/,398
187758,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICAL PRACTICE: REGULATIVE ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES.,2020,"The accumulation of refuse in urban and agricultural areas provides parasitic vermin with new feeding sources and also creates for them partly entirely new biotopes. Vermin transmit both mechanically and biologically the most varied species of pathogens to man, domestic animals and work animals. With respect to the spread of pathogens by vermin via the refuse route, we must distinguish between vermin infesting either the human body, the houses, communities or our environment. Among the human vermin and house species, cockroaches, house gnats and house flies are the most important genera for the spread of pathogens via refuse. Cockroaches transmit bacteria (e.g. Salmonella), viruses (e.g. enterovirus, rota and corona viruses), fungi (e.g. Trichophyton and Candida) and worm eggs (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides). House flies and house gnats take up all infection carriers from refuse and transmit the pathogens, as a rule, purely mechanically. Rats and mice are the most important species among community vermin. These rodents act both as mechanical and biological vehicles of infectious diseases. A case in point is lymphocytic chorio-meningitis and three different types of hemorrhagic fever in man. Among the vermin infesting our environment, the diptera are the most important carriers. Gnats, especially, often act as intermediate hosts (biological transmission) and, as a result, represent an inexhaustible reservoir of pathogen transmitters. More than 50 diseases caused by arbovirus in man and animal are known. Beside the viruses, the field diptera transmit bacteria (e.g. Rickettsiosis) and protozoa (e.g. Leishmaniasis, Trypanosomiasis).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Mayr, A","Zentralblatt fur Bakteriologie, Mikrobiologie und Hygiene. 1.

189838,Modeling Epidemics Spreading on Social Contact Networks.,2015,"Climate change has altered global to local weather patterns and increased sea levels, and it will continue to do so. Average temperatures, precipitation amounts, and other variables such as humidity levels are all rising. In addition, weather variability is increasing, causing, for example, a greater number of heat waves, many of which are more intense and last longer, and more floods and droughts. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks. These risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (for example, heat waves, storms, and floods), infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vectorborne illnesses), and food and water insecurity. These risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist. Most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming. Using an equity lens to move beyond incremental to transformational resilience would reduce vulnerability and improve sustainability for all, but substantial additional funding is required for proactive and effective actions by the health system.","Ebi, Kristie L; Hess, Jeremy J",Health affairs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284705/,398
191136,A Machine Learning Approach to Relationships Among Alexithymia Components.,2020-09-01,"During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, a new laboratory-based virological sentinel surveillance system, the Respiratory DataMart System (RDMS), was established in a network of 14 Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England (PHE)) and National Health Service (NHS) laboratories in England. Laboratory results (both positive and negative) were systematically collected from all routinely tested clinical respiratory samples for a range of respiratory viruses including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). The RDMS also monitored the occurrence of antiviral resistance of influenza viruses. Data from the RDMS for the 2009–2012 period showed that the 2009 pandemic influenza virus caused three waves of activity with different intensities during the pandemic and post pandemic periods. Peaks in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positivity (defined as number of positive samples per total number of samples tested) were seen in summer and autumn in 2009, with slightly higher peak positivity observed in the first post-pandemic season in 2010/2011. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain almost completely disappeared in the second postpandemic season in 2011/2012. The RDMS findings are consistent with other existing community-based virological and clinical surveillance systems. With a large sample size, this new system provides a robust supplementary mechanism, through the collection of routinely available laboratory data at minimum extra cost, to monitor influenza as well as other respiratory virus activity. A near real-time, daily reporting mechanism in the RDMS was established during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Furthermore, this system can be quickly adapted and used to monitor future influenza pandemics and other major outbreaks of respiratory infectious disease, including novel pathogens.","Zhao, H; Green, H; Lackenby, A; Donati, M; Ellis, J; Thompson, C; Bermingham, A; Field, J; Sebastianpillai, P; Zambon, M; Watson, Jm; Pebody, R",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480060/,398

192616,A Sociotechnical Framework for Governing Climate Engineering.,2016,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major human pathogen that chronically infects approximately 350 million people, causing liver disease and liver cancer. HBV virions bud into an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated intracellular compartment, but the mechanisms of HBV assembly, budding, and release remain poorly understood. Budding of retroviruses and some other enveloped RNA viruses from plasma membranes requires host functions involved in protein sorting into late endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVBs). To determine whether budding of DNA-containing HBV virions at intracellular membranes also involves MVB functions, we used immunofluorescence to show that, in human hepatoma cells, HBV envelope protein colocalizes with MVB proteins AIP1/ALIX and VPS4B. We also found that a dominant negative (DN) AIP1 mutant inhibited production and/or release of enveloped virions without significant effects on intracellular nucleocapsid formation, whereas DN VPS4B inhibited both nucleocapsid production and budding. By contrast, DN AIP1 and VPS4 had no effect on the efficiency of release of enveloped, nucleocapsid-lacking HBV subviral particles, which are produced in vast excess over virions, and dramatically increased the release of unenveloped, naked nucleocapsids by an apparently nonlytic route. Thus, host MVB functions are required for efficient budding and release of enveloped HBV virions and may be a valuable target for HBV control. Moreover, HBV enveloped virions, enveloped subviral particles, and unenveloped nucleocapsids are all released by distinct pathways with separate host factor requirements.","Watanabe, Tokiko; Sorensen, Ericka M; Naito, Akira; Schott, Meghan; Kim, Seungtaek; Ahlquist, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17551004/,398
194388,Proteomic data mining using predicted peptide chromatographic retention times.,2007,"Viral diagnosis of respiratory tract infections has so far required sampling by health professionals,hampering large-scale epidemiological studies of virus-specific disease outcomes. As part of a population-based, prospective study of work-related risk factors for transmission of viral infections (SWEDE-I), we developed a scheme for self-sampling with nasal swabs. Random selection from the gainfully employed population of a medium-sized town in central Sweden resulted in a study cohort of 2,237 men and women aged 25 to 63 years. From September 2011 through May 2012, the cohort reported all instances of respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis and participants concomitantly sent self-sampled nasal swabs for analysis using regular mail. Diagnosis of 14 viruses was performed. A total of 1,843 samples were received. The week-wise average delay between disease on set and arrival of the specimens at the laboratory varied between four and six days, and the corresponding median delay was between 3.5 and six days. In line with previous community-based studies, picorna- and coronaviruses dominated in specimens obtained from the self-sampling scheme. The results of self-sampling were contrasted to those from contemporaneous routine clinical sampling, on the same age group, in the adjacent Stockholm county. Although higher proportions of positive samples for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza were observed in the clinical sampling scheme, estimations of seasonality for influenza A and picornaviruses derived from both schemes were similar. Our findings show that nasal self-sampling is feasible in large-scale surveillance of respiratory infections and opens new prospects for population based,virologically verified research on virus spread,burden of disease, and effects of environmental factors or interventions.","Plymoth, A; Rotzen-Ostlund, M; Zweygberg-Wirgart, B; Sundin, C G; Ploner, A; Nyren, O; Linde, A",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811646/,398

The aim is to replace the spike (S) gene of an existing IBV vaccine strain with the S gene of a heterologous strain. CD-61 is an IBV defective RNA (D-RNA) derived from a naturally occurring IBV D-RNA (CD-91). CD-61 D-RNA is being investigated as an RNA vector for the expression of heterologous genes. T7-derived RNA transcripts of CD-61 can be replicated and passaged in the presence of helper virus, following electroporation into IBV-infected cells. CD-61 cDNA was modified by the addition of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme plus T7 terminator downstream of the 3'UTR. This allowed the synthesis of discreet RNA transcripts. The complete cassette was cloned into an FPV transfer vector (pEFL10) for generating recombinant fowlpox viruses. FPV/CD-61 recombinants will be assessed for D-RNA production in IBV-infected cells. The luciferase reporter gene sequence has been inserted into the modified CD-61, under the control of the IBV transcription associated sequence (TAS) from gene 5. Luciferase has been successfully expressed from CD-61 in helper virus-infected cells.","Evans, S A; Stirrups, K; Dalton, K; Shaw, K; Cavanagh, D; Britton, P",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782345/,398

According to Chi-Square test, there existed an insignificant difference (p-value: 0.38649) between smokers and non-smokers in disease severity levels. Smoking is a precursor for countless diseases, but it behaved differently in COVID-19 infected patients, as its prevalence was significantly low.

198966,Analysis of plastic waste reduction and recycling in Taiwan,2021,"We studied the mechanism of in vitro spontaneous lymphokine production by spleen cells from mice injected intraperitoneally with murine coronavirus stain JHM 1 month after infection, when infectious virus had already been cleared from the spleens. Removal of either CD4+ T cells or Ia+ antigen-presenting cells (APC) from the spleen cells abrogated interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. Addition of anti-CD4 or anti-Iad monoclonal antibodies to the culture suppressed IL-2 production. These results suggest that the response involved typical receptor-mediated activation of T cells. Surprisingly, reciprocal mixing experiments with a coculture of T cells from infected mice and APC from either infected or naive mice resulted in the production of IL-2. The absence of viral antigens in spleen cells 1 month after infection, as indicated by their inability to induce the proliferation of T-cell clones specific for the viral antigens, suggest that the T cells from mice 1 month after infection were not responding to the viral antigens. The inoculum components other than the virus did not induce this immune response. We also found that the frequency of self-reactive but not alloreactive IL-2-producing T cells in the spleens of infected mice was 3- to 10-fold higher than that in naive mice. These findings suggest that an increased frequency of self-reactive T cells which secrete IL-2 occurs following murine coronavirus infection. This may have important implications in the development of autoimmunelike phenomena following murine coronavirus infection.","Kyuwa, S; Yamaguchi, K; Toyoda, Y; Fujiwara, K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1848306/,398

Sera were treated with protein G-agarose prior to testing for specific IgM and IgA to eliminate the possibility of false-positive results due to IgM-rheumatoid factor and to remove interisotypic competition due to specific IgG. IgM and IgA absorbance values were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance values of positive reference sera included on each plate (S/P%), and respective positive/negative threshold values of 15.0% and 28.0% were determined. The mean interval between experimental infection of 3 calves and initial detection of specific IgG1 and IgG2 responses was 8.0 and 9.3 days respectively, rising rapidly to an initial plateau 13.7 and 11.0 days postinfection (dpi). Reinfection of these calves at 30 dpi resulted in further rapid increases, with higher plateau values reached 13.0 (IgG1) and 13.7 (IgG2) days later. The mean interval between infection and the first positive IgM and IgA responses was 6.7 and 12.3 days, respectively. IgM S/P% values peaked at 13.0 dpi, with all 3 calves showing a secondary anamnestic response to reinfection, peaking 4.7 days later. The IgA response to initial infection was weak, with only 2 calves showing an obvious peak response at 15.0 dpi. A strong anamnestic IgA response to reinfection occurred in 2 calves, with a peak response 9.5 days later. Apparent biphasic and triphasic IgM and IgA responses were evident in some calves. Acute and convalescent serum samples from 80 calves involved in 17 outbreaks of respiratory disease were tested for specific IgM and IgA. Positive IgM results were detected in 15 outbreaks, with 71 sera from 44 calves testing positive. Although IgA-positive results were detected in the same 15 outbreaks, only 42 sera from 31 calves were positive. In a previous study, seroconversion was detected in 21 of these calves from 10 outbreaks. Thus the diagnostic potential of the assays was in the order IgM > IgA > seroconversion. The correlations between IgM and IgA, IgM and seroconversion, and IgA and seroconversion results for each calf were 73.8%, 58.8% and 62.5%, respectively.","Graham, D A; Mawhinney, K A; German, A; Foster, J C; Adair, B M; Merza, M","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10098683/,398

Since then, it has spread globally causing a global health emergency of inconceivable magnitude, with significant morbidity and mortality. There is the need for clinicians and health care providers to understand and gain knowledge of the different aspects of the disease as it evolves. OBJECTIVE We reviewed existing literature on COVID-19 in order to present a synopsis of current understanding of the disease. METHODS Using PubMed, Embase and Medline, articles published between January and April 2020 on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and resources from World Health Organisation were analyzed in order to have an understanding of the clinical characteristics, transmission dynamics, virology, diagnostic possibilities, prevention, management approach, controversies and impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare workforce. RESULTS Our review revealed that COVID-19 patients present with a myriad of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe respiratory disease, which can often be fatal. The mode of transmission via droplet infections makes it unduly contagious and difficult to control. Currently, antiviral drugs or vaccines are being developed to manage this condition. CONCLUSION There is urgent need for potent antivirals and vaccine to manage those infected with COVID 19 and prevent infection.

No pharmacological therapy has been approved for the treatment of these disorders. Psychostimulants can act as maintenance-like therapies for managing substance use among these patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the literature examining the efficacy and safety of psychostimulant agents for increasing abstinence and treatment retention among patients with amphetamine and methamphetamine use disorders. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL from inception to August 2016. Selection of studies, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. We conducted meta-analyses to provide a pooled summary estimate for included trials and report the review according to PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS We identified and selected 17 studies with 1387 participants. Outcome reporting across trials was inconsistent, and the overall quality of evidence was very low due to high risk of bias and indirectness. A meta-analysis of five trials (642 participants) found no effect of psychostimulants for end-of-study abstinence (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.45). Additionally, the pooled estimate from 14 studies (1184 participants) showed no effect of psychostimulants for treatment retention (odds ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval = 0.91 to 1.58). The incidence of serious adverse events did not differ between intervention and placebo groups based on qualitative reports from trials.

During these unprecedented and challenging times, one institution's Department of Surgery put in place several important initiatives for promoting the well-being of trainees as they were redeployed to provide care to COVID-19 patients. In this article, the authors describe these initiatives, which fall into 3 broad categories: redeploying faculty and trainees, ensuring provider safety, and promoting trainee wellness.The redeployment initiatives are the following: reframing the team mindset, creating a culture of grace and forgiveness, establishing a multidisciplinary wellness committee, promoting centralized leadership, providing clear communication, coordinating between departments and programs, implementing phased restructuring of the department's services, establishing scheduling flexibility and redundancy, adhering to training regulations, designating a trainee ombudsperson, assessing physical health risks for high-risk individuals, and planning for structured deimplementation.Initiatives specific to promoting provider safety are appointing a trainee safety advocate, guaranteeing personal protective equipment and relevant information about these materials, providing guidance regarding safe practices at home, and offering alternative housing options when necessary.Finally, the initiatives put in place to directly promote trainee wellness are establishing an environment of psychological safety, providing mental health resources, maintaining the educational missions, solidifying a sense of community by showing appreciation, being attentive to childcare, and using social media to promote community morale.The initiatives to carry out the department's strategy presented in this article, which were well received by both faculty and trainee members of the authors' community, may be employed in other departments and even outside the context of COVID-19.

204352,Transformation of semantic knowledge into simulation-based decision support,2021,"Increase in thrombotic and microvascular complications is emerging to be a key feature of patients with critical illness associated with COVID-19 infection. While endotheliopathy is thought to be a key factor of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, markers indicative of this process that are prognostic of disease severity have not been well-established in this patient population. Using plasma profiling of patients with COVID-19, we identified circulating markers that segregated with disease severity: markers of angiogenesis (VEGF-A, PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB/BB) were elevated in hospitalized patients with non-critical COVID-19 infection, while markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, FLT-3L, PAI-1) were elevated in patients with critical COVID-19 infection. In survival analysis, elevated markers of endothelial injury (angiopoietin-2, follistatin, PAI-1) were strongly predictive of in-hospital mortality. Our findings demonstrate that non-critical and critical phases of COVID-19 disease may be driven by distinct mechanisms involving key aspects of endothelial cell function, and identify drivers of COVID-19 pathogenesis and potential targets for future therapies.","Pine, Alexander B; Meizlish, Matthew L; Goshua, George; Chang, C-Hong; Zhang, Hanming; Bishai, Jason; Bahel, Parveen; Patel, Amisha; Gbyli, Rana; Kwan, Jennifer M; Won, Christine H; Price, Christina; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Halene, Stephanie; van Dijk, David; Hwa, John; Lee, Alfred I; Chun, Hyung J",Pulm Circ,,398
205944,Transfer Learning for Multi-lingual Tasks -- a Survey,2021-08-28,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an etiological agent of the current rapidly growing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is straining health systems around the world. Disrupting the intermolecular association of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) with its cell surface receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) has been recognized as a promising therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. The association is a typical peptide-mediated interaction, where the hACE adopts an &#945;1-helix, which can form a two-helix bundle with the &#945;2-helix, to pack against a flat pocket on the S protein surface. Here, we demonstrate that the protein context of full-length hACE plays an essential role in supporting the hACE2 &#945;1-helix recognition by viral S protein. Energetic analysis reveals that the &#945;1-helical peptide (&#945;HP) and also the two-helix bundle peptide (tBP) cannot bind effectively to S protein when they are split from the hACE protein. The context contributes moderately and considerably to the direct readout (DR) and indirect readout (IR) of peptide recognition, respectively. Dynamics simulation suggests that the two free peptides exhibit a large intrinsic disorder without the support of protein context, which would incur a considerable entropy penalty upon binding to S protein. To restore the IR effect lost by splitting peptides from hACE, we herein propose employing hydrocarbon stapling and cyclization strategies to constrain the free &#945;HP and tBP peptides into their native ordered conformations, respectively. The stapling and cyclization are carefully designed in order to avoid influencing the peptide DR effect, which has been demonstrated to improve the peptide binding affinity (but not specificity) to S protein. The stapling/cyclization-imposed conformational constraint can effectively minimize the unfavorable IR effect (i) by reducing the peptide flexibility and entropy cost upon their binding to S protein, and (ii) by helping peptide pre-folding into their native state to facilitate the conformational selection by S protein.","Zhou, Peng; Wang, Heyi; Chen, Zheng; Liu, Qian",Mol. omics,,398

Due to the pressure of epidemic control and economic recovery, states in the United States have adopted different policies for mobility limitations. Assessing the impact of these policies on the spatiotemporal interaction of COVID-19 transmission among counties in each state is critical to formulating epidemic policies. (2) Methods: We utilized Moran’s I index and K-means clustering to investigate the time-varying spatial autocorrelation effect of 49 states (excluding the District of Colombia) with daily new cases at the county level from 22 January 2020 to 20 August 2020. Based on the dynamic spatial lag model (SLM) and the SIR model with unreported infection rate (SIRu), the integrated SLM-SIRu model was constructed to estimate the inter-county spatiotemporal interaction coefficient of daily new cases in each state, which was further explored by Pearson correlation test and stepwise OLS regression with socioeconomic factors. (3) Results: The K-means clustering divided the time-varying spatial autocorrelation curves of the 49 states into four types: continuous increasing, fluctuating increasing, weak positive, and weak negative. The Pearson correlation analysis showed that the spatiotemporal interaction coefficients in each state estimated by SLM-SIRu were significantly positively correlated with the variables of median age, population density, and proportions of international immigrants and highly educated population, but negatively correlated with the birth rate. Further stepwise OLS regression retained only three positive correlated variables: poverty rate, population density, and highly educated population proportion. (4) Conclusions: This result suggests that various state policies in the U.S. have imposed different impacts on COVID-19 transmission among counties. All states should provide more protection and support for the low-income population;high-density populated states need to strengthen regional mobility restrictions;and the highly educated population should reduce unnecessary regional movement and strengthen self-protection.","Liu, Lingbo Hu Tao Bao Shuming Wu Hao Peng Zhenghong Wang Ru",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,,398

Here we use sensors deployed on a taxi fleet to explore the air quality in the road network of Nanjing over the course of a year (October 2019–September 2020). Based on GIS technology, we develop a grid analysis method to obtain 50 m resolution maps of major air pollutants (CO, NO2, and O3). Through hotspot identification analysis, we find three main sources of air pollutants including traffic, industrial emissions, and cooking fumes. We find that CO and NO2 concentrations show a pattern: highways &gt; arterial roads &gt; secondary roads &gt; branch roads &gt; residential streets, reflecting traffic volume. The O3 concentrations in these five road types are in opposite order due to the titration effect of NOx. Combined the mobile measurements and the stationary station data, we diagnose that the contribution of traffic-related emissions to CO and NO2 are 42.6 % and 26.3 %, respectively. Compared to the pre-COVID period, the concentrations of CO and NO2 during the COVID-lockdown period decreased for 44.9 % and 47.1 %, respectively, and the contribution of traffic-related emissions to them both decreased by more than 50 %. With the end of the COVID-lockdown period, traffic emissions and air pollutant concentrations rebounded substantially, indicating that traffic emissions have a crucial impact on the variation of air pollutant levels in urban regions. This research demonstrates the sensing power of mobile monitoring for urban air pollution, which provides detailed information for source attribution, accurate traceability, and potential mitigation strategies at the urban micro-scale.","Wang, Shibao Ma Yun Wang Zhongrui Wang Lei Chi Xuguang Ding Aijun Yao Mingzhi Li Yunpeng Li Qilin Wu Mengxian Zhang Ling Xiao Yongle Zhang Yanxu",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,398

In April 2020 at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, one of the three oncologic hubs in Lombardy where the Health Regional Authorities referred all the cancer patients of the region, we implemented a prospective longitudinal study aimed at monitoring the serological response to SARS-Cov-2 in HCP. One hundred and ten HCP answered a questionnaire and were screened by nasopharyngeal swabs as well as for IgM/IgG levels; seropositive HCPs were further screened every 40-45 days using SARS-CoV-2-specific serology. We identified a fraction of HCP with long-term anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, though negative for viral RNA, and thus probably able to safely approach fragile cancer patients. Monitoring asymptomatic HCP might provide useful information to organize the healthcare service in a Cancer Center, while waiting for the effectiveness of the active immunization by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, which will provide protection from infection.","Ciniselli, Chiara Maura; Micali, Arianna; De Cecco, Loris; Notti, Paola; Sinno, Valentina; Luison, Elena; Melani, Cecilia C; Daidone, Maria Grazia; Apolone, Giovanni; Verderio, Paolo; Figini, Mariangela",,,398

Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction pattern reveals that this oxide crystallizes in a cubic quadruple perovskite structure with the 1:3-type ordering of Ce and Cu ions at the A-site. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrates the valence-state transitions in the ACu3Co4O12 series (A = Ca, Y, Ce) from Ca2+Cu3+3Co3.25+4O12 to Y3+Cu3+3Co3+4O12 to Ce4+Cu2.67+3Co3+4O12, where the electrons are doped in the order from B-site (Co3.25+ â Co3+) to A'-site (Cu3+ â Cu2.67+). This electron-doping sequence is in stark contrast to the typical B-site electron doping for simple ABO3-type perovskite and quadruple perovskites CaCu3B4O12 (B = V, Cr, Mn), further differing from the monotonical A'-site electron doping for Na1-xLaxMn3Ti4O12 and A'- and B-site electron doping for AMn3V4O12 (A = Na, Ca, La). The differences in the electron-doping sequences are interpreted by rigid-band models, proposing a wide variety of electronic states for the complex transition-metal oxides containing the multiple valence-variable ions.","Yamada, Ikuya; Odake, Takao; Tanaka, Atsushi; Okazaki, Yuichi; Toda, Fumito; Ishii, Yuta; Taniguchi, Toshifumi; Kawaguchi, Shogo; Hariki, Atsushi",Inorg. chem,,398

216131,A Microscopic Epidemic Model and Pandemic Prediction Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,2020-04-27,"BACKGROUND: An unusual feature of SARS-Cov-2 infection and the COVID-19 pandemic is that children are less severely affected than adults. This is especially paradoxical given the epidemiological links between poor air quality and increased COVID-19 severity in adults and that children are generally more vulnerable than adults to the adverse consequences of air pollution. OBJECTIVES: To identify gaps in knowledge about the factors that protect children from severe SARS-Cov-2 infection even in the face of air pollution, and to develop a transdisciplinary research strategy to address these gaps. METHODS: An international group of researchers interested in children's environmental health was invited to identify knowledge gaps and to develop research questions to close these gaps. DISCUSSION: Key research questions identified include: what are the effects of SAR-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy on the developing fetus and child; what is the impact of age at infection and genetic susceptibility on disease severity; why do some children with COVID-19 infection develop toxic shock and Kawasaki-like symptoms; what are the impacts of toxic environmental exposures including poor air quality, chemical and metal exposures on innate immunity, especially in the respiratory epithelium; what is the possible role of a ""dirty"" environment in conveying protection - an example of the ""hygiene hypothesis""; and what are the long term health effects of SARS-Cov-2 infection in early life. CONCLUSION: A concerted research effort by a multidisciplinary team of scientists is needed to understand the links between environmental exposures, especially air pollution and COVID-19. We call for specific research funding to encourage basic and clinical research to understand if/why exposure to environmental factors is associated with more severe disease, why children appear to be protected, and how innate immune responses may be involved. Lessons learned about SARS-Cov-2 infection in our children will help us to understand and reduce disease severity in adults, the opposite of the usual scenario.","Sly, Peter D; Trottier, Brittany A; Bulka, Catherine M; Cormier, Stephania A; Fobil, Julius; Fry, Rebecca C; Kim, Kyoung-Woong; Kleeberger, Steven; Kumar, Pushpam; Landrigan, Philip J; Lodrop Carlsen, Karin C; Pascale, Antonio; Polack, Fernando; Ruchirawat, Mathuros; Zar, Heather J; Suk, William A",Environ Health,,398

The very rapid global spread has raised the issue whether there are further multi-dimensional consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human behavior, the key of its transmission. During the coronavirus crisis, odd, abnormal, and irresponsible behavior has been reported in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) individuals, particularly in super-spreaders, that is, persons with a high viral load, thus constituting also super-emitters. Indeed, cases of infected persons ignoring self-confinement orders, intentionally disregarding physical distancing and multiplying social interactions, or even deliberately sneezing, spitting or coughing were reported. While it is known that some other viruses, such as rabies and even influenza do change human behavior, this remains unclear for SARS-CoV-2. In this perspective, we highlight the possibility that COVID-19 is facilitated by altered human social behavior that benefits SARS-CoV-2 transmission, through showcasing similar virus-induced changed behavior by other pathogens and relating this to reports from the gray literature.","Bouayed, Jaouad; Bohn, Torsten",J. med. virol,,398

This study assessed the risk perception of COVID-19 and practice of precautionary measures against its spread amongst healthcare workers practicing in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Clinic of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. Methods: this was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted amongst healthcare workers in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Clinic of a tertiary hospital in Nigeria. It employed the use of a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire to obtain data from the participants. Data analysis was done using the IBM SPSS statistics version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) statistical software. Results: there were 49 study participants with all of them aware of COVID-19. Only 11(22.4%) respondents reported receiving training on infection prevention and control against COVID-19. Most of them received training from their workplace/hospital (12.2%), while 10.2% were trained via webinars. More of the respondents had moderate risk perception (n=17, 34.7%) while a majority of them had good practice of precautionary measures against COVID-19 (n=28, 57.1%). Conclusion: most of the study participants had moderate risk perception and good practice of precautionary measures. Risk perception was not a significant predictor of practice of precautionary measures.","Enabulele, Osahon; Esther, Aihevba",Pan Afr Med J,,398

222927,Why human factors science is demonstrably necessary: historical and evolutionary foundations,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Some patients with COVID-19 pneumonia present systemic disease involving multiple systems. There is limited information about the clinical characteristics and events leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). We described the factors associated with the development of AKI and explored the relation of AKI and mortality in Mexican population with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of individuals with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized at the largest third-level reference institution for COVID-19 care in Mexico between March and April 2020. Demographic information, comorbidities, clinical and laboratory data, dates of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and hospitalization, mechanical-ventilator settings and use of vasoactive drugs were recorded. RESULTS: Of 99 patients studied, 58 developed AKI (58.6%). The risk factors for AKI were older age (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.01-1.13, p = 0.024); obesity (OR = 6.58, 95% CI = 1.8-24.05, p = 0.040); and the need for IMV (OR = 6.18, CI = 1.29-29.58, p = 0.023). The risk factors for mortality were obesity (OR = 5.57, 95% CI = 1.48-20.93, p = 0.011); requirement of vasoactive drugs on admission (OR = 5.35, 95% CI = 1.16-24.61, p = 0.031); and AKI (OR = 8.61, 95% CI = 2.24-33.1, p = 0.002). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with AKI stage 3 (79.3%) and AKI stage 2 (68.7%) compared with those with AKI stage 1 (25%; p = 0.004). Fifty-three patients underwent the furosemide stress test (FST) to predict progression to AKI stage 3. Of those, 12 progressed to AKI stage 3 (22%). The ROC curve for the FST had an AUC of 0.681 (p = 0.009); a sensitivity of 81.6% and a specificity of 54.5%. CONCLUSIONS: AKI was common in our cohort of patients with severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity and the need for of IMV on admission. The risk factors for mortality were obesity, requirement of vasoactive drugs on admission and AKI. Mortality was more frequent in patients with AKI stages 2-3. The FST had an acceptable predictive capacity to identify patients progressing to AKI stage 3.","Casas-Aparicio, Gustavo A; León-Rodríguez, Isabel; Alvarado-de la Barrera, Claudia; González-Navarro, Mauricio; Peralta-Prado, Amy B; Luna-Villalobos, Yara; Velasco-Morales, Alejandro; Calderón-Dávila, Natalia; Ormsby, Christopher E; Ávila-Ríos, Santiago",PLoS One,,398

We performed whole-genome sequencing of 27 SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between January 2020 and April 2020. A total of 54 mutations in different genomic regions was found. The D614G mutation, first detected in March 2020, was identified in 18 strains and was more likely associated with a lower cycle threshold (<25) in real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction diagnostic tests than the original D614 (prevalence ratio = 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.38). The integration of sequencing and epidemiological data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 transmission in both quarantine areas and in the community in Vietnam occur at the beginning of the epidemic although the country implemented strict quarantine quite early, with strict contact tracing, and testing.

225324,Lumen: A Machine Learning Framework to Expose Influence Cues in Text,2021-07-12,"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have reported that the quarantine imposed in several countries around the world due to Covid-19 affected the sexual function and relationship quality. On the March 23, 2020 the Greek government imposed a national quarantine to contain the spread of the pandemic. The impact of such conditions on sexual function and relationship quality of couples is unknown. AIM: To investigate sexual function and relationship quality of couples during the quarantine. METHODS: An online anonymous survey was conducted one month post-impose of the quarantine, between the April 21 and the May 3, 2020. Adult respondents in a relationship completed a questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, structured inquiries regarding sexual activity and quality of relationship, anxiety level, and mood during the quarantine, as well as the IIEF and FSFI indices. OUTCOMES: Sexual function was assessed using the Greek versions of the FSFI and IIEF for females and males respectively. Sexual activity using 5 statements regarding frequency of sexual thoughts, masturbation, and intercourse, quality of intercourse and general estimation of the level of sexual function. Participants graded their level of agreement. Relationship quality was assessed using 5 questions regarding communication, company, understanding, tension and general estimation of companionship. Participants graded their level of agreement. Two additional statements were used in order to evaluate mood and the level of anxiety. RESULTS: A sum of 299 adult heterosexual participants in a relationship participated. Little or no negative impact on sexual function was reported. Increased anxiety and deficient mood were reported only for those with no access to their partner. Being in a steady relationship and living with their partner, but only for couples without children, resulted in satisfaction by sexual activity and enhanced emotional security. CONCLUSION: Sexual function and relationship quality appeared as not affected by the quarantine and by the measures of social distancing. Sotiropoulou P, Ferenidou F, Owens D, et al.

226761,The Privacy Implications of Using Data Technologies in a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Forecasting methods rely on trends and averages of prior observations to forecast COVID-19 case counts. COVID-19 forecasts have received much media attention, and numerous platforms have been created to inform the public. However, forecasting effectiveness varies by geographic scope and is affected by changing assumptions in behaviors and preventative measures in response to the pandemic. Due to time requirements for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, evidence is needed to inform short-term forecasting method selection at county, health district, and state levels. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 forecasts keep the public informed and contribute to public policy. As such, proper understanding of forecasting purposes and outcomes is needed to advance knowledge of health statistics for policy makers and the public. Using publicly available real-time data provided online, we aimed to evaluate the performance of seven forecasting methods utilized to forecast cumulative COVID-19 case counts. Forecasts were evaluated based on how well they forecast 1, 3, and 7 days forward when utilizing 1-, 3-, 7-, or all prior-day cumulative case counts during early virus onset. This study provides an objective evaluation of the forecasting methods to identify forecasting model assumptions that contribute to lower error in forecasting COVID-19 cumulative case growth. This information benefits professionals, decision makers, and the public relying on the data provided by short-term case count estimates at varied geographic levels. METHODS: We created 1-, 3-, and 7-day forecasts at the county, health district, and state levels using (1) a naïve approach, (2) Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing, (3) a growth rate approach, (4) a moving average (MA) approach, (5) an autoregressive (AR) approach, (6) an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) approach, and (7) an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) approach. Forecasts relied on Virginia's 3464 historical county-level cumulative case counts from March 7 to April 22, 2020, as reported by The New York Times. Statistically significant results were identified using 95% CIs of median absolute error (MdAE) and median absolute percentage error (MdAPE) metrics of the resulting 216,698 forecasts. RESULTS: The next-day MA forecast with 3-day look-back length obtained the lowest MdAE (median 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.84, P<.001) and statistically significantly differed from 39 out of 59 alternatives (66%) to 53 out of 59 alternatives (90%) at each geographic level at a significance level of .01. For short-range forecasting, methods assuming stationary means of prior days' counts outperformed methods with assumptions of weak stationarity or nonstationarity means. MdAPE results revealed statistically significant differences across geographic levels. CONCLUSIONS: For short-range COVID-19 cumulative case count forecasting at the county, health district, and state levels during early onset, the following were found: (1) the MA method was effective for forecasting 1-, 3-, and 7-day cumulative case counts; (2) exponential growth was not the best representation of case growth during early virus onset when the public was aware of the virus; and (3) geographic resolution was a factor in the selection of forecasting methods.","Lynch, Christopher J; Gore, Ross",J Med Internet Res,,398
226982,Crowdsourced air traffic data from the OpenSky Network 2019–2020,2021,"The current pandemic caused by the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is superimposed on another well-known pandemic in our society, that of overweight and obesity. Obesity represents a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, which may lead to the requirement of a mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICU) and premature death. The underlying mechanisms are multiple: alteration of the respiratory performance, presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea, finally inadequate and excessive immunological and inflammatory responses, possibly aggravated by ectopic intrathoracic fat deposits. Thus, COVID-19 may challenge the so-called “obesity paradox” commonly reported in ICU among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, the presence of obesity increases the risk of worse outcome at a younger age. These findings require reinforced preventive and curative measures among obese patients to limit the risk of progression towards an unfavorable outcome in case of COVID-19.","Scheen, André J.",Med.

Therefore, a global reaction to prepare health care systems is mandatory. Preventing the transmission of this virus during medical and dental procedures producing airborne particles and droplets, could be considered as one of the main venues in prevention of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission in health care facilities. To the best of our knowledge, no intervention has been approved for this purpose, so the major suggestion in this regard is using personal preventive equipment (PPE) and similar measures as well as other sanitizing practices. Since we do not know how long we should face this universal issue, using antecedent pharmacotherapies for reducing oral-respiratory secretions to combat this virus might play a role in this regard. Given that currently there is no definitive cure for COVID-19, so we hypothesize that, considering drug solutions to reduce saliva and droplet production may be helpful in controlling Coronavirus spread during aerosol and respiratory droplet producing procedures.","MohammadSadeghi, Ashkan; Karimzadeh, Iman; Bagheri Lankarani, Kamran; Banakar, Morteza",Med Hypotheses,,398
227446,Efficiency assessment of seaport terminal operators using dea malmquist and epsilon-based measure models,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients are currently overwhelming the world's healthcare systems. This article provides practical guidance to front-line physicians forced to make critical rationing decisions. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search for scientific literature, reviews, and guidance documents related to epidemic ICU triage including from professional bodies. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies, reviews, and guidelines were selected and reviewed by all authors and discussed by internet conference and email. DATA EXTRACTION: References and data were based on relevance and author consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: We review key challenges of resource-driven triage and data from affected ICUs. We recommend that once available resources are maximally extended, triage is justified utilizing a strategy that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of patients. A triage algorithm based on clinical estimations of the incremental survival benefit (saving the most life-years) provided by ICU care is proposed. ""First come, first served"" is used to choose between individuals with equal priorities and benefits. The algorithm provides practical guidance, is easy to follow, rapidly implementable and flexible. It has four prioritization categories: performance score, ASA score, number of organ failures, and predicted survival. Individual units can readily adapt the algorithm to meet local requirements for the evolving pandemic. Although the algorithm improves consistency and provides practical and psychologic support to those performing triage, the final decision remains a clinical one. Depending on country and operational circumstances, triage decisions may be made by a triage team or individual doctors. However, an experienced critical care specialist physician should be ultimately responsible for the triage decision. Cautious discharge criteria are proposed acknowledging the difficulties to facilitate the admission of queuing patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individual institutions may use this guidance to develop prospective protocols that assist the implementation of triage decisions to ensure fairness, enhance consistency, and decrease provider moral distress.","Sprung, Charles L; Joynt, Gavin M; Christian, Michael D; Truog, Robert D; Rello, Jordi; Nates, Joseph L",Crit. care med,,398

228325,Learning to Extrapolate Knowledge: Transductive Few-shot Out-of-Graph Link Prediction,2020-06-11,"Ocean organisms live in competitive environments that demand the production of poisons and toxins. In some cases, these substances have been used in the pharmaceutical industry for human disease treatments. Most fish poisons generally have potent cytolytic activity, probably through cardiovascular and neuromuscular effects. In the case of marine stingrays, the injuries made by their tail venom apparatus are caused by the mechanical penetration of their sting and a subsequent venom release. This study focused on the evaluation of substances with cytotoxic activity in the epithelium that covers the venom apparatus from the marine stingray Hypanus dipterurus. To demonstrate the above, the hemolytic, proteolytic and cytotoxic capacities of H. dipterurus epithelium substances were determined. Discs impregnated with epithelial extract were used on blood agar plates. The proteolytic activity was analyzed using casein as substrate and for gelatin the liquefaction activity test. To determine the cytotoxicity degree of the extracts, the proliferation and cell viability MTT bioassay was implemented on human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa). The results showed that no hemolytic or proteolytic activity existed against casein associated with the epithelial extract, but gelatin hydrolysis and cytotoxic activity against the HeLa cell line were observed. This study concludes that the substances found in the epithelium covering the H. dipterurus stingray venom apparatus are a mixture of various proteins, among which, glycosylated anionic proteins represent a potential source of molecules with cytotoxic and hydrolytic activity.","Marrón-Grijalba, Estrella; Cardona-Félix, César Salvador; Cruz-Escalona, Víctor Hugo; Muñoz-Ochoa, Mauricio; Cabral-Romero, Claudio; Hernández-Delgadillo, René; Rivera-Pérez, Crisalejandra; Aguila-Ramírez, Ruth Noemí",Toxicon,,398
231361,Neural Text Classification and Stacked Heterogeneous Embeddings for Named Entity Recognition in SMM4H 2021,2021-06-10,"In March 2020, the World Health Organisation announced the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement, including delirium occurring in critically ill patients (ICU delirium). Due attention must be paid to this subject in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delirium, the detection of which takes less than two minutes, is frequently underestimated during daily routine ICU care, but it may be a prodromal symptom of infection or hypoxia associated with severe respiratory failure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, systematic delirium monitoring using validated tests (CAM-ICU or ICDSC) may be sacrificed. This is likely to be due to the fact that the main emphasis is placed on organisational issues, i.e. the lack of ventilators, setting priorities for limited mechanical ventilation options, and a shortage of personal protective equipment. Early identification of patients with delirium is critical in patients with COVID-19 because the occurrence of delirium may be an early symptom of worsening respiratory failure or of infectious spread to the CNS mediated by potential neuroinvasive mechanisms of the coronavirus. The purpose of this review is to identify problems related to the development of delirium during the COVID-19 epidemic, which are presented in three areas: i) factors contributing to delirium in COVID-19, ii) potential pathophysiological factors of delirium in COVID-19, and iii) long-term consequences of delirium in COVID-19. This article discusses how healthcare workers can reduce the burden of delirium by identifying potential risk factors and difficulties during challenges associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kotfis, Katarzyna; Williams Roberson, Shawniqua; Wilson, Jo; Pun, Brenda; Ely, E Wesley; Jezowska, Ilona; Jezierska, Maja; Dabrowski, Wojciech",Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther,,398

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of referrals to and eligible donors from an eye bank between March 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, was performed, with the same time period in 2019 as a control. Referrals who were not procured because of Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines and eye bank-specific restrictions were noted. The results of 1 month of routine postmortem testing performed by the eye bank were examined. Analysis of variance tests were performed to assess the change between donors from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in both the number of total referrals to the eye bank (P = 0.044) and donors eligible for surgical transplantation (P = 0.031). Eye Bank Association of America COVID-19 guidelines reduced the number of referrals over this period by 4% to 14%. Of the 266 surgically eligible donors who received postmortem COVID-19 testing in June by the eye bank, 13 resulted positive (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction in referrals and eligible corneal transplant donors at a single eye bank, there was a surplus of surgically suitable corneal tissue during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eye banks should consider routine postmortem COVID-19 testing to identify asymptomatic infected donors although the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from infected donors is unknown.","Ballouz, Dena; Sawant, Onkar B; Hurlbert, Susan; Titus, Michael S; Majmudar, Parag A; Kumar, Ashok; Zhou, Yunshu; Musch, David C; Mian, Shahzad I",Cornea,,398

236084,Applications of Support Vector Machine Learning in Body Mass Index Prediction Based on the Gut Microbial Pattern,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide determining dramatic impacts on healthcare systems. Early identification of high-risk parameters is required in order to provide the best therapeutic approach. Coronary, thoracic aorta and aortic valve calcium can be measured from a non-gated chest computer tomography (CT) and are validated predictors of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. However, their prognostic role in acute systemic inflammatory diseases, such as COVID-19, has not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate the association of coronary artery calcium and total thoracic calcium on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 1093 consecutive patients from 16 Italian hospitals with a positive swab for COVID-19 and an admission chest CT for pneumonia severity assessment were included. At CT, coronary, aortic valve and thoracic aorta calcium were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated separately and combined together (total thoracic calcium) by a central Core-lab blinded to patients' outcomes. RESULTS: Non-survivors compared to survivors had higher coronary artery [Agatston (467.76 â± â570.92 vs 206.80 â± â424.13 âmm2, p â< â0.001); Volume (487.79 â± â565.34 vs 207.77 â± â406.81, p â< â0.001)], aortic valve [Volume (322.45 â± â390.90 vs 98.27 â± â250.74 mm2, p â< â0.001; Agatston 337.38 â± â414.97 vs 111.70 â± â282.15, p â< â0.001)] and thoracic aorta [Volume (3786.71 â± â4225.57 vs 1487.63 â± â2973.19 mm2, p â< â0.001); Agatston (4688.82 â± â5363.72 vs 1834.90 â± â3761.25, p â< â0.001)] calcium values.

239054,Network security model based on active defense and passive defense hybrid strategy,2020,"Guinea, like many other African countries, has been facing an unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, since March 2020. In April 2020, Guinean National agency for health security recorded 1351 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 313 recoveries and 07 deaths. To address this health crisis, some drastic measures were implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those measures might potentially cause some psychological problems among Guineans. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 in the Guinean population. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey among internet users in Guinea. A free e-survey platform was used, and questionnaires were sent to internet users. The study ran from May 1 through May 10 2020. Participation in the study was voluntary. Data collection was based on sociodemographic information and self-reported questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for stress evaluation, Penn state worry questionnaire (PSWQ), and an adapted Social Psychological Measurements of COVID-19. A total of 280 participants took part in the study;responses from 5 participants were deleted because of incompleteness. The average age of participants was 28.9 [95% CI: 28.1;29.6]. Most of participants were male 65.5% [95% CI: 59.5%;71.1%]. Unemployed participants stood for 48.7% [95% CI: 42.7%;54.8%]. IES-R scale for stress evaluation yielded the following findings: 19.6% (mild), 5.23% (moderate) and 9.15% (severe);82.8% and 17.2% of participants had respectively reported low and moderate worry. No significant statistical association was found between sociodemographic variables and traumatic events (IES-R and PSWQ). However, 82% of our participants had to cope with the negative impacts of COVID-19. Although there were few cases of traumatic events, negative impacts of COVID-19 on study participants deserve to be underlined. So, further investigations are necessary to identify and disentangle specific psychosocial problems in different Guinean socio-cultural contexts.","Toure, A. A.; Camara, L. M.; Magassouba, A.

While advanced evidence is needed regarding its clinical features and mechanisms. We aimed to describe two phenotypes of AKI as well as their risk factors and the association with mortality. METHODS: Consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China from 1 January 2020 to 23 March 2020 were included. Patients with AKI were classified as AKI-early and AKI-late according to the sequence of organ dysfunction (kidney as the first dysfunctional organ or not). Demographic and clinical features were compared between two AKI groups. Their risk factors and the associations with in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 4020 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included and 285 (7.09%) of them were identified as AKI. Compared with patients with AKI-early, patients with AKI-late had significantly higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers. Both AKIs were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality, with similar fully adjusted hazard ratios of 2.46 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-4.49] for AKI-early and 3.09 (95% CI 2.17-4.40) for AKI-late. Only hypertension was independently associated with the risk of AKI-early. While age, history of chronic kidney disease and the levels of inflammatory biomarkers were associated with the risk of AKI-late. CONCLUSIONS: AKI among patients with COVID-19 has two clinical phenotypes, which could be due to different mechanisms. Considering the increased risk for mortality for both phenotypes, monitoring for AKI should be emphasized during COVID-19.","Peng, Suyuan; Wang, Huai-Yu; Sun, Xiaoyu; Li, Pengfei; Ye, Zhanghui; Li, Qing; Wang, Jinwei; Shi, Xuanyu; Liu, Liu; Yao, Ying; Zeng, Rui; He, Fan; Li, Junhua; Ge, Shuwang; Ke, Xianjun; Zhou, Zhibin; Dong, Erdan; Wang, Haibo; Xu, Gang; Zhang, Luxia; Zhao, Ming-Hui",Nephrol Dial Transplant,,398

Accurate triage of patients during the pandemic will assign patients to the appropriate level of care, provide the best care for the maximum number of patients, rationally limit personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and mitigate nosocomial exposures. The authors describe an adapted COVID-19 pandemic triage algorithm for emergency departments (EDs) guided by the best available evidence and responses to prior pandemics, with recommendations for clinician PPE use for each level of encounter in the setting of an ongoing PPE shortage. Our algorithm adheres to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and supports discharge of patients with mild symptoms coupled with explicit and strict return precautions and infection control education.","Wallace, Douglas W; Burleson, Samuel L; Heimann, Matthew A; Crosby, James C; Swanson, Jonathan; Gibson, Courtney B; Greene, Christopher",,,398
241814,Experimental Flight Patterns Evaluation for a UAV-Based Air Pollutant Sensor,2020,"The article focuses on effective treatment of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) at early stages and substantiates the requirement for antiviral therapy and for decreasing the viral load to prevent the infection progression. The absence of a specific antiviral therapy for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is stated. The authors analyzed results of early randomized studies using lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, and favipiravir in COVID-19 and their potential for the treatment of novel coronavirus infection. Among the drugs blocking the virus entry into cells, the greatest attention was paid to the antimalaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The article addresses in detail ineffectiveness and potential danger of hydroxychloroquine, which demonstrated neither a decrease in the time of clinical recovery nor any improvement of prognosis for patients with COVID-19. The major objective was substantiating a possible use of bromhexine, a mucolytic and anticough drug, which can inhibit transmembrane serin protease 2 required for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells. Spironolactone may have a similar feature. Due to its antiandrogenic effects, spironolactone can inhibit X-chromosome-related synthesis of ACE-2 receptors and activation of transmembrane serin protease 2. In addition to slowing the virus entry into cells, spironolactone decreases severity of fibrosis in different organs, including the lungs. The major part of the article addresses clinical examples of managing patients with COVID-19 at the University Clinic of the Medical Research and Educational Centre of the M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, including successful treatment with schemes containing bromhexine and spironolactone.

The GRAVID study aimed to describe clinical characteristics, outcomes, and predictors of poor outcome in patients with lung cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective observational study that included medical records of patients with lung cancer and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis across 65 Spanish hospitals. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints were hospitalization and admission to intensive care units (ICU). RESULTS: A total of 447 patients with a mean age of 67.1 ± 9.8 years were analysed. The majority were men (74.3 %) and current/former smokers (85.7 %). NSCLC was the most frequent type of cancer (84.5 %), mainly as adenocarcinoma (51.0 %), and stage III metastatic or unresectable disease (79.2 %). Nearly 60 % of patients were receiving anticancer treatment, mostly first-line chemotherapy. Overall, 350 (78.3 %) patients were hospitalized for a mean of 13.4 ± 11.4 days, 9 (2.0 %) were admitted to ICU and 146 (32.7 %) died. Advanced disease and the use of corticosteroids to treat COVID-19 during hospitalization were predictors of mortality. Hospitalized, non-end-of-life stage patients with lymphocytopenia and high LDH had an increased risk of death. Severity of COVID-19 correlated to higher mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation rates. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rate was higher among patients treated with corticosteroids during hospitalization, while anticancer therapy was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or death. Tailored approaches are warranted to ensure effective cancer management while minimizing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Provencio, Mariano; Mazarico Gallego, José María; Calles, Antonio; Antoñanzas, Mónica; Pangua, Cristina; Mielgo Rubio, Xabier; Nadal, Ernest; Castro, Rafael López; López-Martín, Ana; Del Barco, Edel; Dómine, Manuel; Franco, Fernando; Diz, Pilar; Sandoval, Carmen; Girona, Elia Sais; Sullivan, Ivana; Sala, Mª Ángeles; Ledo, Gema García; Cucurull, Marc; Mosquera, Joaquín; Martínez, Mireia; Chara, Luis Enrique; Arriola, Edurne; Herrera, Beatriz Esteban; Jarabo, José Ramón; Álvarez, Rosa Álvarez; Baena, Javier; Cao, María González",Lung Cancer,,398
243612,Informational content of cosine and other similarities calculated from high-dimensional Conceptual Property Norm data,2020,"BACKGROUND: Full level 1 personal protective equipment (PPE) is used in various domains and contexts. Prior research has shown influences of such equipment on performance, comfort, and contamination levels. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced a pervasive requirement of PPE, with little preparation, rushed deployment, inadequate time for training, and massive use by personnel who are inexperienced or not qualified in its effective use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the key human factors (physical and ergonomic, perceptual and cognitive) that influence the use of level 1 PPE when attending to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: The research approach consisted of a short survey disseminated to health care professionals in two countries, Israel and Portugal, with similar demographics and health care systems. The survey included 10 items with a 5-point Likert scale regarding the key human factors involved in level 1 PPE, as identified in prior research. RESULTS: A total of 722 respondents from Israel and 301 respondents from Portugal were included in the analysis. All the respondents reported using level 1 PPE with patients with COVID-19 in the range of several hours daily to several hours weekly. The Cronbach &#945; was .73 for Israel and .75 for Portugal. Responses showed high levels of difficulty, with medians of 4 for items related to discomfort (n=539/688, 78% in Israel; n=328/377, 87% in Portugal), hearing (n=236/370, 64% in Portugal; n=321/642, 50% in Israel), seeing (n=697/763, 89% in Israel; n=317/376, 84% in Portugal), and doffing (n=290/374, 77% in Portugal; n=315/713, 44% in Israel). A factor analysis showed a set of strongly related variables consisting of hearing, understanding speech, and understanding the situation. This suggests that degradation in communication was strongly associated with degradation in situational awareness. A subsequent mediation analysis showed a direct effect of PPE discomfort on situational awareness (P<.001); this was also influenced (mediated) by difficulties in communicating, namely in hearing and understanding speech. CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is paving the way for updating PPE design. The use of already deployed technology affords ample opportunities to improve, adapt, and overcome caveats. The findings here suggest that the use of level 1 PPE with patients with COVID-19 has perceptual and cognitive effects, in addition to physical and ergonomic influences. Efforts should be taken to mitigate the harmful effects of such influences, both regarding the performance of medical actions and the risk of contamination to health care workers. Such efforts involve the design of PPE; the introduction of technologies to enhance vision, hearing, and communicating during the use of PPE; and training staff in using the equipment and in effective communication and teamwork protocols.","Parush, Avi; Wacht, Oren; Gomes, Ricardo; Frenkel, Amit",J Med Internet Res,,398

ORF3a, a conserved coronavirus protein, is involved in virus replication and release. A set of 70,752 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID databank at the end of August 2020 have been scanned. All ORF3a mutations in the virus genomes were grouped according to the collection date interval and over the entire data set. The considered intervals were: start of collection-February, March, April, May, June, July and August 2020. The top five most frequent variants were examined within each collection interval. Overall, seventeen variants have been isolated. Ten of the seventeen mutant sites occur within the transmembrane (TM) domain of ORF3a and are in contact with the central pore or side tunnels. The other variant sites are in different places of the ORF3a structure. Within the entire sample, the five most frequent mutations are V13L, Q57H, Q57H + A99V, G196V and G252V. The same analysis identified 28 sites identically conserved in all the genome isolates. These sites are possibly involved in stabilization of monomer, dimer, tetramerization and interaction with other cellular components.

Variation in immune responses influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality, and factors shaping this variation at the country level, in addition to other socio-ecological drivers, may be important. Here, we construct spatially explicit Bayesian models that combine data on prevalence of endemic diseases and other socio-ecological characteristics to quantify patterns of confirmed deaths and cases across the globe before mass vaccination. We find that the prevalence of parasitic worms, human immunodeficiency virus and malaria play a surprisingly important role in predicting country-level SARS-CoV-2 patterns. When combined with factors such as population density, our models predict 63% (56-67) and 76% (69-81) of confirmed cases and deaths among countries, respectively. While our findings at this macro-scale are necessarily associative, they highlight a need for studies to consider factors, such as infection by other pathogens, on global SARS-CoV-2 dynamics.

Results: The presence of ANA was not significantly different between COVID19 patients with unfavorable (n=7/33; 21%) and favorable disease course (n=6/32; 19%) (p= 0.804) and controls (n=3/20; 15%). Auto-antibodies against AT1R were significantly increased in unfavorable disease course (median 14.59 U/mL, IQR 11.28 - 19.89) compared to favorable disease course (median 10.67 U/mL, IQR 8.55 - 13.0, p< 0.01). ETAR antibody titers were also significantly increased in unfavorable disease course (median 7.21, IQR 5.0 - 10.45) as compared to favorable disease course (median 4.0, IQR 3.0 - 6.0, p <0.05). Conclusion: Auto-antibodies against AT1R and ETAR are significantly increased in COVID19 patients with an unfavorable disease course.","Miedema, Jelle; Schreurs, Marco; van der Sar-van der Brugge, Simone; Paats, Marthe; Baart, Sara; Bakker, Marleen; Hoek, Rogier; Dik, Willem Arnout; Endeman, Henrik; Van Der Velden, Vincent; van Gammeren, Adriaan; Ermens, Antonius; Aerts, Joachim G; Thüsen, Jan Von Der",Front Immunol,,398

In a survey of 502 online participants, normal-range traits (esp agreeableness and conscientiousness) predicted endorsement of social distancing and hygiene, as well as the appeal of health messages in general. Consistent with the EPPM, conscientiousness and neuroticism had an interaction. Dark traits (esp psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) predicted low endorsement of health behaviors and the intent to knowingly expose others to risk. Most participants preferred a message appealing to compassion (“Help protect the vulnerable…”), but dark traits predicted lower appeal of that message.

Despite the substantial efforts, only few vaccines are currently approved and some are in the different stages of clinical trials. As the disease rapidly spreads, an affordable and effective vaccine is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of plant-produced receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in order to use as a subunit vaccine. In this regard, RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was fused with Fc fragment of human IgG1 and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana by agroinfiltration. The plant-produced RBD-Fc fusion protein was purified from the crude extract by using protein A affinity column chromatography. Two intramuscular administration of plant-produced RBD-Fc protein formulated with alum as an adjuvant have elicited high neutralization titers in immunized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Further it has induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses and vaccine-specific T-lymphocyte responses which was confirmed by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Altogether, our results demonstrated that the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD has the potential to be used as an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2.

The impact of these measures has been inconsistent, with some regions rapidly nearing disease elimination and others seeing delayed peaks or nearly flat epidemic curves. Here we build a stochastic epidemic model to examine the effects of COVID-19 clinical progression and transmission network structure on the outcomes of social distancing interventions. Our simulations show that long delays between the adoption of control measures and observed declines in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in many scenarios. We find that the strength of within-household transmission is a critical determinant of success, governing the timing and size of the epidemic peak, the rate of decline, individual risks of infection, and the success of partial relaxation measures. The structure of residual external connections, driven by workforce participation and essential businesses, interacts to determine outcomes. We suggest limited conditions under which the formation of household ""bubbles"" can be safe. These findings can improve future predictions of the timescale and efficacy of interventions needed to control second waves of COVID-19 as well as other similar outbreaks, and highlight the need for better quantification and control of household transmission.","Nande, Anjalika; Adlam, Ben; Sheen, Justin; Levy, Michael Z; Hill, Alison L",PLoS Comput Biol,,398

256289,Emulated order identification for models of big time series data,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to affect the human microbiome in infected and uninfected individuals, having a substantial impact on human health over the long term. This pandemic intersects with a decades-long decline in microbial diversity and ancestral microbes due to hygiene, antibiotics, and urban living (the hygiene hypothesis). High-risk groups succumbing to COVID-19 include those with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and obesity, which are also associated with microbiome abnormalities. Current pandemic control measures and practices will have broad, uneven, and potentially long-term effects for the human microbiome across the planet, given the implementation of physical separation, extensive hygiene, travel barriers, and other measures that influence overall microbial loss and inability for reinoculation. Although much remains uncertain or unknown about the virus and its consequences, implementing pandemic control practices could significantly affect the microbiome. In this Perspective, we explore many facets of COVID-19-induced societal changes and their possible effects on the microbiome, and discuss current and future challenges regarding the interplay between this pandemic and the microbiome. Recent recognition of the microbiome's influence on human health makes it critical to consider both how the microbiome, shaped by biosocial processes, affects susceptibility to the coronavirus and, conversely, how COVID-19 disease and prevention measures may affect the microbiome.

It is useful to examine the theoretical implications of his work by applying a human development theoretical perspective. Phenomenological variant of ecological systems theory (PVEST) is a strengths-based theoretical framework that engages the variability of resource access and coping strategies that promote positive identity development for diverse children. While skill acquisition is a key focus of human capital theory's engagement of early childhood needs, this article highlights the on-going status of human vulnerability that undergirds identity development over the life course. The authors note that ""inequality presence denial"" combines with high-risk contexts, framed by geography and psychohistoric moments (e.g., The Great Recession, COVID-19), to alter diverse children's developmental pathways. The acknowledgement of ""morbid risk"" motivates the urgency for research that builds upon Zigler's innovations and privileges human development imperatives. The case study explores these concepts by examining the challenges and assets available to mothers in a low-income community. The article's closing notes developments in the field of economics that ameliorate human capital theory's conceptual limitations, underscoring human development's theoretical strength in motivating research and policies that are maximally responsive to children's positive identity development.","Nichols Lodato, Bronwyn; Hall, Jennifer; Spencer, Margaret Beale",Dev Psychopathol,,398
258133,A Case Study on the Development of a Data Privacy Management Solution Based on Patient Information,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infect the human respiratory tract. A prototype thermodynamic equilibrium model is presented here for the probability of the virions getting through the mucus barrier and infecting epithelial cells based on the binding affinity (Kmucin) of the virions to mucin molecules in the mucus and parameters for binding and infection of the epithelial cell. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind strongly to their cellular receptors, DDP4 and ACE2, respectively, and infect very efficiently both bronchus and lung ex vivo cell cultures which are not protected by a mucus barrier. According to the model, mucin binding could reduce the infectivity for MERS-CoV compared to SARS-CoV-2 by at least 100-fold depending on the magnitude of Kmucin. Specifically Kmucin values up to 106 M-1 have little protective effect and thus the mucus barrier would not remove SARS-CoV-2 which does not bind to sialic acids (SA) and hence would have a very low Kmucin. Depending on the viability of individual virions, the ID50 for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be ~500 virions (viral RNA genomic copies) representing 1 to 2 pfu. In contrast MERS-CoV binds both SA and human mucin and a Kmucin of 5 × 109 M-1 as reported for lectins would mop up 99.83% of the virus according to the model with the ID50 for MERS-CoV estimated to be ~295,000 virions (viral RNA genomic copies) representing 819 pfu. This could in part explain why MERS-CoV is poorly transmitted from human to human compared to SARS-CoV-2. Some coronaviruses use an esterase to escape the mucin, although MERS-CoV does not. Instead, it is shown here that ""clustering"" of virions into single aerosol particles as recently reported for rotavirus in extracellular vesicles could provide a co-operative mechanism whereby MERS-CoV could theoretically overcome the mucin barrier locally and a small proportion of 10 µm diameter aerosol particles could contain ~70 virions based on reported maximum levels in saliva. Although recent evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 initiates infection in the nasal epithelium, the thermodynamic equilibrium models presented here could complement published approaches for modelling the physical entry of pathogens to the lung based on the fate and transport of the pathogen particles (as for anthrax spores) to develop a dose-response model for aerosol exposure to respiratory viruses. This would enable the infectivity through aerosols to be defined based on molecular parameters as well as physical parameters. The role of the spike proteins of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binding to SA and heparan sulphate, respectively, may be to aid non-specific attachment to the host cell. It is proposed that a high Kmucin is the cost for subsequent binding of MERS-CoV to SAs on the cell surface to partially overcome the unfavourable entropy of immobilisation as the virus adopts the correct orientation for spike protein interactions with its protein cellular receptor DPP4.","Gale, Paul",Microb Risk Anal,,398

Monensin poisoning is rare in humans, and there is no effective detoxification protocol in clinical treatment. OBJECTIVE: We report here two cases of monensin-induced rhabdomyolysis and hepatotoxicity by oral ingestion. The two patients were a couple and both were admitted to the hospital due to oral ingestion of monensin 5 days prior. Patient 1, with a past history of chronic bronchitis and hypertension, presented with severe rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and hypoxemia. After treatment with fluid replacement and alkalinization of urine, his condition deteriorated the next day and irreversible cardiopulmonary arrest occurred. Patient 2 was diabetic and using oral hypoglycemic drugs and had obvious rhabdomyolysis from the fifth day of admission. After treatment with fluid replacement, urine alkalization, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), the patient recovered and was discharged 1 month later. DISCUSSION: The ingestion of monensin can lead to life-threatening toxicity, with rhabdomyolysis and hepatotoxicity as the main manifestations.

The continuous time Markov Chain (CTMC) through stochastic model approach has been utilized for predicting the impending states with the use of random variables. The proposed study is devoted to investigate a model consist of three exclusive compartments. The first class includes white nose based transmission rate (termed as susceptible individuals), the second one pertains to the infected population having the same perturbation occurrence and the last one isolated (quarantined) individuals. We discuss the model's extinction as well as the stationary distribution in order to derive the the sufficient criterion for the persistence and disease’ extinction. Lastly, the numerical simulation is executed for supporting the theoretical findings.","Din, Anwarud; Khan, Amir; Baleanu, Dumitru",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,398
261969,Fine-Grained Relevance Annotations for Multi-Task Document Ranking and Question Answering,2020-08-12,"Dry eye disease (DED) is among the most common eye diseases and is becoming increasingly prevalent. Its symptoms cause a long-term decline in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). Inconsistencies often occur between the clinical findings and the subjective symptoms of DED. Therefore, a holistic, balanced, and quantitative evaluation of the subjective symptoms and HRQL using patient-reported outcome questionnaires, in addition to clinical findings, is crucial for accurate DED assessment in patients. This paper reviewed the characteristics of current dry eye questionnaires, including their objectives, number of questions, inclusion of HRQL-related items, and whether they were properly evaluated for psychometric properties. Twenty-four questionnaires were identified; among them, the following six questionnaires that included items assessing HRQL and were properly evaluated for psychometric properties are recommended: the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Impact of Dry Eye in Everyday Life, Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-life Score, University of North Carolina Dry Eye Management Scale, Chinese version of Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life, and 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire. Dry eye questionnaires have different objectives and are available in different languages. Therefore, medical practitioners should confirm the characteristics of applicable questionnaires before selecting the most appropriate ones.","Okumura, Yuichi; Inomata, Takenori; Iwata, Nanami; Sung, Jaemyoung; Fujimoto, Keiichi; Fujio, Kenta; Midorikawa-Inomata, Akie; Miura, Maria; Akasaki, Yasutsugu; Murakami, Akira",,,398

COVID-19 rapidly expanded leading to an epidemic in China, followed by a global pandemic during the year 2020. In few weeks Italy was assaulted by a severe health emergency, constraining the Italian government to put in place extraordinary restrictive measures, such as school closures and a strict lockdown extended to the entire country at the beginning of March 2020. Since the beginning of lockdown, the Endocrinology Unit of Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital has recorded a rapid increase of the outpatient consultations for suspected precocious or early puberty. We have now retrospectively analyzed all the consultations recorded in the database of our outpatient clinic from March to September 2020, and compared them with the consultations recorded in the same database from March to September 2019. Our preliminary data suggest a significant increase of precocious puberty cases in girls during the first period of COVID-19 pandemic. Further investigations in larger cohorts of children are needed in order to correlate the observed increase of precocious puberty with specific pathogenic factors.","Verzani, Martina; Bizzarri, Carla; Chioma, Laura; Bottaro, Giorgia; Pedicelli, Stefania; Cappa, Marco",Ital J Pediatr,,398

262717,Questioning the Value of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) in PhD Admissions in Biomedical Engineering,2020,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with high mortality and may overwhelm health care systems, due to the surge of patients requiring advanced respiratory support. Shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds required many patients to be treated outside the ICU despite severe gas exchange impairment. Helmet is an effective interface to provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) noninvasively. We report data about the usefulness of helmet CPAP during pandemic, either as treatment, a bridge to intubation or a rescue therapy for patients with care limitations (DNI). METHODS: In this observational study we collected data regarding patients failing standard oxygen therapy (i.e., non-rebreathing mask) due to COVID-19 pneumonia treated with a free flow helmet CPAP system. Patients' data were recorded before, at initiation of CPAP treatment and once a day, thereafter. CPAP failure was defined as a composite outcome of intubation or death. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included; 42% were deemed as DNI. Helmet CPAP treatment was successful in 69% of the full treatment and 28% of the DNI patients (P < 0.001). With helmet CPAP, PaO2/FiO2 ratio doubled from about 100 to 200 mmHg (P < 0.001); respiratory rate decreased from 28 [22-32] to 24 [20-29] breaths per minute, P < 0.001). C-reactive protein, time to oxygen mask failure, age, PaO2/FiO2 during CPAP, number of comorbidities were independently associated with CPAP failure. Helmet CPAP was maintained for 6 [3-9] days, almost continuously during the first two days. None of the full treatment patients died before intubation in the wards. CONCLUSIONS: Helmet CPAP treatment is feasible for several days outside the ICU, despite persistent impairment in gas exchange. It was used, without escalating to intubation, in the majority of full treatment patients after standard oxygen therapy failed. DNI patients could benefit from helmet CPAP as rescue therapy to improve survival.

262837,CovidGAN: Data Augmentation Using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for Improved Covid-19 Detection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a federal exemption allowed stable and less stable patients greater take-home doses of methadone. We assessed the adoption of increased take-home medication during COVID-19 and whether increased take-home doses is associated with clients' characteristics. METHODOLOGY: We completed a pre-post study of adults receiving methadone for OUD from an OTP in Spokane, Washington. Our outcome was the change in the number of take-home methadone doses three months before and three months after the March 2020 take-home medication exemption. Clients' characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity, education level, homelessness, spatial access to the clinic, and methamphetamine use. RESULTS: The study included 194 clients in treatment for a median of three years. All study participants experienced an average increase in take-home medication of 41.4 in the three-month period after the COVID-19 exemption. In the final adjusted models, clients who reported using methamphetamine in the last 30 days experienced a significantly larger increase in take-home dosage (55.6 days) compare to clients who did not use methamphetamine (p &#8804;0.001). Most of the clients who reported using methamphetamine were also likely to be homeless. All other variables were not associated with a change in take-home doses. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the Spokane OTP quickly expanded take-home medication dosing in response to the COVID-19 exemption and broadly expanded take-home dosing among established clients. Clients with concurrent methamphetamine use were allowed fewer take-home doses prior to COVID-19, but after the exemption the clinic provided them the same number of take-home doses as clients who had not used methamphetamine.","Amram, Ofer; Amiri, Solmaz; Thorn, Emily L; Lutz, Robert; Joudrey, Paul J",J Subst Abuse Treat,,398

Here, we performed a scoping review and meta-analysis including clinical studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with data on AKI assessment and characteristics, and the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated using a random-effects model. We identified 21 articles which passed the search criteria. All were quantitative observational studies which used a cross-sectional, retrospective, case report, or cohort methodology. This showed that aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous chronic disease, and other comorbidities were risk factors of AKI. Although the prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, and increased serum creatinine was reported for up to 60% of the patients with COVID-19, the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated to be 8%. We conclude that although approximately two-thirds of patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of kidney damage, most of these did not meet the diagnostic criteria for AKI. Further studies should be performed to validate biomarkers for improved AKI diagnosis in COVID-19 patients and new treatment options are required to reduce the rate of mortality.","Jafari-Oori, Mehdi; Fiorentino, Marco; Castellano, Giuseppe; Ebadi, Abbas; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Guest, Paul C; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,398

In this article, I provide a more robust definition of what I call institutional religious freedom than a crabbed and merely negative understanding. In addition, I also go beyond a libertarian-style defense of institutional religious freedom as the ecclesiastical equivalent of the “right to be left alone” by suggesting a multitude of reasons why institutional religious freedom in a robust form deserves robust protection. Especially amidst exigent challenges such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, an anemic appeal to an ecclesiastical version of negative liberty on merely jurisdictional grounds will not be enough to defend religious organizations from an increasingly strong temptation and tendency on the part of political authorities—often acting on the basis of understandable intentions—to subject such organizations to sweeping interference even in the most internal matters. In contrast, the article offers an articulation of why both the internal and external freedoms of religious institutions require maximum deference if they are to offer their indispensable contributions—indeed, their “essential services”—to the shared public good in the United States and other countries throughout the world. Underscoring the external and public dimensions of institutional religious freedom, the article follows the work of law and religion scholar W. Cole Durham in that it analytically disaggregates the freedom of religious institutions into three indispensable components: “substantive”, or the right of self-definition;“vertical”, or the right of self-governance;and “horizontal”, or the right of self-directed outward expression and action.","Shah, Timothy Samuel",Religions,,398
264340,Of intelligence oversight and the challenge of surveillance corporatism,2020,"Background: After SARS-CoV-2 reached the Netherlands in February 2020, rapid interventions were taken to mitigate viral spread and optimise care for COVID-19 patients. Lockdowns and downscaling of regular healthcare practices were necessary to scale up COVID-19-related care. The effect of these interventions on HIV care are uncertain. We assessed the impact of the nationwide lockdown in March and May during the first COVID-19 wave on HIV diagnosis and linkage to care. Methods: An observational study was conducted at the Erasmus MC, a regional reference tertiary hospital in the Netherlands. All patients ≥ 18 years presenting with HIV indicator conditions (ICs) were identified in electronic patient records, using an automated identification system for ICD-10 and health insurance codes. Primary outcomes measured were the number of HIV tests performed, number of HIV ICs and corresponding HIV testing rates, and new HIV diagnoses before, during and after lockdown. Results: From January to April, all newly registered diagnoses decreased by 35%, and in patients referred for HIV ICs by 69% (figure 1). The proportion of patients presenting with HIV ICs that were adequately tested for HIV remained relatively stable, especially where HIV testing is standardised, even during lockdown in March, April and May when a cumulative 328 proven or suspected COVID-19 patients were admitted. The absolute number of HIV tests performed during the first half year of 2020 was 13% lower than the same period in 2019, and new HIV patient referrals dropped 67%. The number of HIV IC, HIV testing rates and HIV referrals showed recovery after the lockdown. Conclusion: The first two pillars of the HIV care continuum were affected by the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Standardisation of HIV testing could prevent diagnostic delays to a certain extent. With an eye on subsequent COVID-19 waves, these data indicate that maintaining focus on adequate identification and testing of patients with undiagnosed HIV is essential to prevent unwanted declines affecting the 95-95-95 goals.","Hensley, K.

This study aimed to identify predictive indicators of severe COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data on hospital admission of all patients with severe COVID-19 and a control cohort (1:1) of gender- and hospital-matched patients with mild disease from 13 designated hospitals in the Hebei Province between 22 January and 15 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients (52 with severe COVID-19 and 52 with mild disease) were included. Only age, fever, duration from symptom onset to confirmation, respiratory rate, percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and neutrophilic percentage were independent predictors of severe COVID-19. Age and neutrophilic percentage performed best in predicting severe COVID-19, followed by SpO2 . 'Age + neutrophilic percentage' (the sum of age and neutrophilic percentage) (area under the curve [AUC] 0.900, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.825-0.950, P < .001) and 'age and neutrophilic percentage' (the prediction probability of age and neutrophilic percentage for severe type obtained by logistic regression analysis) (AUC 0.899, 95% CI 0.824-0.949, P < .001) had excellent predictive performance for severe type. The optimal cut-off for 'age + neutrophilic percentage' was >119.1 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 84.6%; Youden index, 0.712). CONCLUSION: The combination of age and neutrophil percentage could effectively predict severe COVID-19.

METHODS: We obtained and analyzed anonymized data on psychiatric admissions (n = 4550) from 12 general hospital psychiatric wards (GHPWs) in different Italian regions (catchment area = 3.71 millions of inhabitants). Using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, we compared admission characteristics across three periods: (a) March 1-June 30, 2018 and 2019; (b) March 1-April 30, 2020 (i.e., lockdown); and (c) May 1-June 30, 2020 (i.e., post-lockdown). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 41% reduction (IRR = 0.59; p < 0.001, CI: 0.45-0.79) in psychiatric admissions in the enrolled GHPWs with respect to the 2018 and 2019 control period. Conversely, admission rates in the post-lockdown period were similar to those observed in the control period. Notably, a consistent and significant reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations of older patients (aged >65 years) was observed in the lockdown (40%; IRR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44-0.82) and post-lockdown (28%; IRR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54-0.96) periods. Long-stay admissions (>14 days) increased (63%; IRR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.32-2.02) during the lockdown and decreased by 39% thereafter (IRR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.75). A significant 35% increase in patients reporting suicidal ideation was observed in the post-lockdown period, compared to the rate observed in the 2018 and 2019 control period (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.01-1.79). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with changes in the number of psychiatric admissions, particularly for older patients and long-stay hospitalizations. Increased admission of patients reporting suicidal ideation in the post-lockdown period merits special attention.

267244,Mobility Data Analysis and Applications: A mid-year 2021 Survey,2021-08-31,"Sphingolipids are important structural membrane components and, together with cholesterol, are often organized in lipid rafts, where they act as signaling molecules in many cellular functions. They play crucial roles in regulating pathobiological processes, such as cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases. The bioactive metabolites ceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and sphingosine have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several microbes. In contrast to ceramide, which often promotes bacterial and viral infections (for instance, by mediating adhesion and internalization), sphingosine, which is released from ceramide by the activity of ceramidases, kills many bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. In particular, sphingosine is an important natural component of the defense against bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tract. Pathologically reduced sphingosine levels in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells are normalized by inhalation of sphingosine, and coating plastic implants with sphingosine prevents bacterial infections. Pretreatment of cells with exogenous sphingosine also prevents the viral spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from interacting with host cell receptors and inhibits the propagation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in macrophages. Recent examinations reveal that the bactericidal effect of sphingosine might be due to bacterial membrane permeabilization and the subsequent death of the bacteria.","Wu, Yuqing; Liu, Yongjie; Gulbins, Erich; Grassmé, Heike",,,398
267508,Exploring data subsets with vtree,2020-10-25,"PURPOSE: To comprehensively evaluate the incidences of abnormal neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19 via a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHOD: PubMed-MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for original articles reporting imaging findings of the brain in adult patients with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020. Abnormal neuroimaging findings were categorized as (1) cerebral microhemorrhages, (2) acute spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), (3) acute to subacute infarcts, and (4) encephalitis or encephalopathy. Pooled incidences of neuroimaging findings were assessed using random-effects modeling. Between-study heterogeneity was explored by using the &#967;2 statistic for pooled incidences and the inconsistency index I2. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. Subgroup meta-regression analysis was performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-one eligible papers, including 2125 patients, were identified. The pooled incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages, acute spontaneous ICH, acute/subacute infarcts, and encephalitis/encephalopathy were 6.9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 4.9 %-8.9 %), 5.4 % (95 % CI, 3.1 %-7.6 %), 24.0 % (95 % CI, 16.1 %-31.8 %), and 3.3 % (95 % CI, 1.9 %-4.7 %), respectively. Substantial heterogeneities were noted for all neuroimaging findings (I2 = 87 %-97 %). Significant publication biases were present in the pooled incidences. In the subgroup meta-regression analysis, patients with mean or median ages over 65 years showed a significantly lower incidence of encephalitis/encephalopathy (P < 0.001). Furthermore, studies reported that patients in ICU had significantly higher incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages (Pâ¯<â¯0.001) and encephalitis/encephalopathy (Pâ¯<â¯0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable incidences of abnormal neuroimaging findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19.

We conducted an observational safety study simulating PAPR failure in a group of nine healthy volunteers, wearing loose-fitting hoods, who were observed for a period of ten minutes, or until they requested the experiment be aborted, with continuous monitoring of gas exchange. Relative to baseline, participants demonstrated median reductions in peripheral oxygen saturation of 3.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -4% to -2%; P = 0.0039) and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.045 (95% CI -0.05 to -0.04; P = 0.0039), and median increases in inspired partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 27 mmHg (95% CI 23.5-32 mmHg; P = 0.0039), end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 11 mmHg (95% CI 7-16 mmHg; P = 0.0039) and minute ventilation of 30 l/min (95% CI 19.4-35.9 l/min; P = 0.0039).

Whilst the degree of rebreathing in this experiment was not sufficient to cause dangerous physiological derangement, the degree of reported thermal discomfort combined with the consequences of entrainment of possibly contaminated air into the hood, pose a risk to wearers in the event of failure.","Miles, Lachlan F; Makar, Timothy; Oughton, Chad W; Peyton, Philip J",Anaesth Intensive Care,,398
268770,Sterilization Technology Using an Ultraviolet-radiation Source,2021,"In late December 2019, patients of atypical pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen which was named SARS-CoV-2. As of 12 February 2020, more than 44 000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in China and continue to expand. Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China have launched first-level response to major public health emergencies one after another from 23 January 2020, which means restricting movement of people among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and to depict the effect of restricting population movement. In this study, Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the day level and SPSS 23.0 was used to analyse the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. We found that since 23 January 2020, Wuhan migration scale index has dropped significantly and since 26 January 2020, Hubei province migration scale index has dropped significantly. New confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Wuhan gradually increased since 24 January 2020, and showed a downward trend from 6 February 2020. New confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Hubei province gradually increased since 24 January 2020, and maintained at a high level from 24 January 2020 to 4 February 2020, then showed a downward trend. Wuhan migration scale index from 9 January to 22 January, 10 January to 23 January and 11 January to 24 January was correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Wuhan from 22 January to 4 February. Hubei province migration scale index from 10 January to 23 January and 11 January to 24 January was correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Hubei province from 22 January to 4 February. Our findings suggested that people who left Wuhan from 9 January to 22 January, and those who left Hubei province from 10 January to 24 January, led to the outbreak in the rest of China. The 'Wuhan lockdown' and the launching of the first-level response to this major public health emergency may have had a good effect on controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. Although new COVID-19 cases continued to be confirmed in China outside Wuhan and Hubei provinces, in our opinion, these are second-generation cases.","Chen, Huijie; Chen, Ye; Lian, Zhiyong; Wen, Lihai; Sun, Baijun; Wang, Ping; Li, Xinghai; Liu, Qiong; Yu, Xiaoyun; Lu, Ying; Qi, Ying; Zhao, Shuo; Zhang, Linlin; Yi, Xiaodan; Liu, Fengyu; Pan, Guowei",Epidemiol Infect,,398

This study aims to assess changes in health services access, self-care, behavioural, and psychological impact of COVID-19 and partial lockdown amongst diabetes patients in Singapore. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey amongst people with diabetes with the Diabetes Health Profile-18 (DHP-18). Hierarchical regression analyses were performed for each DHP-18 subscale (Psychological Distress, Disinhibited Eating and Barriers to Activity) as dependent variables in separate models. RESULTS: Among 301 respondents, 45.2% were women, 67.1% of Chinese ethnicity, 24.2% were aged 40 to 49 years, 68.4% have Type 2 diabetes and 42.2% on oral medications alone. During the pandemic and the lockdown, nearly all respondents were able to receive care safely from the clinics they attend (94%) and obtain their medications and diabetes equipment and supplies (97%) when needed. Respondents reported less frequent engagement in physical activity (38%), checking of blood pressure (29%) and blood glucose (22%). Previous diagnosis of mental health conditions (ß = 9.33, P = .043), Type 1 diabetes (ß = 12.92, P = .023), number of diabetes-related comorbidities (ß = 3.16, P = .007) and Indian ethnicity (ß = 6.65, P = .034) were associated with higher psychological distress. Comorbidities were associated with higher disinhibited eating (ß = 2.49, P = .014) while ability to reach their doctor despite not going to the clinic is negatively associated with psychological distress (ß = -9.50 P = .002) and barriers to activity (ß = -7.53, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Health services access were minimally affected, but COVID-19 and lockdown had mixed impacts on self-care and management behaviours. Greater clinical care and attention should be provided to people with diabetes with multiple comorbidities and previous mental health disorders during the pandemic and lockdown.","Yeoh, Ester; Tan, Soon Guan; Lee, Ying Shan; Tan, Hwee Huan; Low, Ying Yee; Lim, Su Chi; Sum, Chee Fang; Tavintharan, Subramaniam; Wee, Hwee Lin",Int J Clin Pract,,398
270245,Detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in conjunctival secretions: Is it a valuable diagnostic method of COVID-19?,2020,"Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have spurred the need for reliable, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods which can be applied to large numbers of people. However, current standard protocols for the detection of viral nucleic acids while sensitive, require a high level of automation and sophisticated laboratory equipment to achieve throughputs that allow whole communities to be tested on a regular basis. Here we present Cap-iLAMP (capture and improved loop-mediated isothermal amplification) which combines a hybridization capture-based RNA extraction of gargle lavage samples with an improved colorimetric RT-LAMP assay and smartphone-based color scoring. Cap-iLAMP is compatible with point-of-care testing and enables the detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples in less than one hour. In contrast to direct addition of the sample to improved LAMP (iLAMP), Cap-iLAMP prevents false positives and allows single positive samples to be detected in pools of 25 negative samples, reducing the reagent cost per test to ~1 Euro per individual.","Bokelmann, Lukas; Nickel, Olaf; Maricic, Tomislav; Pääbo, Svante; Meyer, Matthias; Borte, Stephan; Riesenberg, Stephan",Nat Commun,,398

In current study, we sought to evaluate the incidence, clinical outcomes, and characteristics of barotrauma among COVID-19 patients receiving invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and requiring oxygen support or positive airway pressure for ARDS who presented to our tertiary-care center from March through November, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 353 patients met our inclusion criteria, of which 232 patients who required heated high-flow nasal cannula, continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure were assigned to non-invasive group. The remaining 121 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and were assigned to invasive group. Of the total 353 patients, 32 patients (65.6% males) with a mean age of 63 ± 11 years developed barotrauma in the form of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum. The incidence of barotrauma was 4.74% (11/232) and 17.35% (21/121) in the non-invasive group and invasive group, respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 22 (15.7 -33.0) days with an overall mortality of 62.5% (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 ARDS have a high incidence of barotrauma. Pulmonary barotrauma should be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who exhibit worsening of their respiratory disease as it is likely associated with a high mortality risk. Utilizing lung-protective ventilation strategies may reduce the risk of barotrauma.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Spanel, Alan J; McMillan, Sean; Lahan, Shubham; Boer, Brian; Birge, Justin; Thi, Meilinh",J Intensive Care Med,,398

The aim of this article was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-hospital continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) utilization and identify areas for process improvement. METHODS: A 38-question web-based survey was distributed to site principal investigators of the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium, and institutional contacts for the Neurodiagnostic Credentialing and Accreditation Board. The survey addressed the following aspects of cEEG utilization: (1) general center characteristics, (2) cEEG utilization and review, (3) staffing and workflow, and (4) health impact on EEG technologists. RESULTS: The survey was open from June 12, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and distributed to 174 centers with 79 responses (45.4%). Forty centers were located in COVID-19 hotspots. Fifty-seven centers (72.1%) reported cEEG volume reduction. Centers in the Northeast were most likely to report cEEG volume reduction (odds ratio [OR] 7.19 [1.53-33.83]; P = 0.012). Additionally, centers reporting decrease in outside hospital transfers reported cEEG volume reduction; OR 21.67 [4.57-102.81]; P &#8804; 0.0001. Twenty-six centers (32.91%) reported reduction in EEG technologist coverage. Eighteen centers had personal protective equipment shortages for EEG technologists. Technologists at these centers were more likely to quarantine for suspected or confirmed COVID-19; OR 3.14 [1.01-9.63]; P = 0.058. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a widespread reduction in cEEG volume during the pandemic. Given the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the importance of cEEG in managing hospitalized patients, methods to optimize use need to be prioritized to provide optimal care. Because the survey provides a cross-sectional assessment, follow-up studies can determine the long-term impact of the pandemic on cEEG utilization.","Zafar, Sahar F; Khozein, Rebecca J; LaRoche, Suzette M; Westover, Michael B; Gilmore, Emily J",J. clin. neurophysiol,,398

However, such models are based on meagre data and limited biological understanding. We evaluate the accuracy of various models from recent pandemics (SARS, MERS and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak) as a guide to whether we can trust the early model predictions for COVID-19. We show that early models can have good predictive power for a disease's first wave, but they are less predictive of the possibility of a second wave or its strength. The models with the highest accuracy tended to include stochasticity, and models developed for a particular geographic region are often applicable in other regions. It follows that mathematical models developed early in a pandemic can be useful for long-term predictions, at least during the first wave, and they should include stochastic variations, to represent unknown characteristics inherent in the earliest stages of all pandemics.","Costris-Vas, Christian; Schwartz, Elissa J; Smith, Robert",Math Biosci Eng,,398

Methods Chart review was performed for all PMDC patients between March 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018 (n=120), as a self-controlled case series design. Two-tailed t-tests compared initial and final EPDS scores for all patients with >1 visit (n=64), where EPDS score of &#8805;13 indicated a positive screen for depression. A multivariable linear regression model with robust standard errors estimated the relationship between patient characteristics and final EPDS scores. Results Of 120 patients, n=56 had one visit and n=64 had >1 visit. Of these 64, mean final score (11.04) was lower than mean initial score (16.54; p<0.001). Additionally, certain patient characteristics were associated with higher final EPDS score, including history of mood disorder and treatment with both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Conclusions Women treated at the PMDC showed improved EPDS scores when receiving at least two separate care visits.

Our aim was to investigate the physical and mental demands of mobile x-ray imaging on radiographers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, within a local NHS Trust. METHODS: A total of 16 participants from 1 NHS Trust took part within this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data was obtained through an online survey. Statistical data was obtained via the Trust Radiology Information System (RIS). Data was gathered for the thirteen weeks from 23rd March to 21st June 2020 (the first wave); direct comparison was made to the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the data. These include mental health challenges/work morale in Radiology, demand of mobile imaging and departmental and Trust-wide mental health support. Results indicate a high demand in mobile imaging which has made a significant difference in the working life of some radiographers. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the mental health of a proportion of radiographers at this Trust. Results indicate high workload and demand in mobile imaging has made a significant difference to the working life of radiographers, specifically the ones who were relatively newly qualified. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Two key interventions are proposed from this study. The first one is to provide and promote mental health support within radiology departments. The second is to encourage dual working on mobile x-ray examinations to help manage the emotional and physical burden.","Yasin, B; Barlow, N; Milner, R","Radiography (Lond. Engl., 1995, Online)",,398

This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the epidemiology, induced impact, viral kinetics and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific Region, focusing on regions previously exposed to outbreaks of coronavirus. COVID-19 progressed differently by regions, with some (such as China and Taiwan) featured by one to two epidemic waves and some (such as Hong Kong and South Korea) featured by multiple waves. There has been no consensus on the estimates of important epidemiological time intervals or proportions, such that using them for making inferences should be done with caution. Viral loads of patients with COVID-19 peak in the first week of illness around days 2 to 4 and hence there is very high transmission potential causing community outbreaks. Various strategies such as government-guided and suppress-and-lift strategies, trigger-based/suppression approaches and alert systems have been employed to guide the adoption and easing of control measures. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission is a hallmark of COVID-19. Identification and isolation of symptomatic patients alone is not effective in controlling the ongoing outbreaks. However, early, prompt and coordinated enactment predisposed regions to successful disease containment. Mass COVID-19 vaccinations are likely to be the light at the end of the tunnel. There is a need to review what we have learnt in this pandemic and examine how to transfer and improve existing knowledge for ongoing and future epidemics.","Kwok, Kin On; Huang, Ying; Tsoi, Margaret Ting Fong; Tang, Arthur; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Wei, Wan In; Hui, David Shu Cheong",Respirology,,398
283131,Textile-Based Pressure Sensing Matrix for In-Bed Monitoring of Subject Sleeping Posture and Breathing Activity,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in the COVID-19 pandemic has not been fully evaluated. With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is imperative to better understand the impact of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID patients. PubMed, Embase and the pre-print database Medrxiv were searched, and studies with data on patients on ACEi/ARB with COVID-19 were included. Random effects models were used to estimate the pooled mean difference with 95% confidence interval using Open Meta[Analyst] software. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 28,872 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The use of any RAAS inhibition for any conditions showed a trend to lower risk of death/critical events (OR 0.671, CI 0.435 to 1.034, p = 0.071). Within the hypertensive cohort, however, there was a significant lower association with deaths (OR 0.664, CI 0.458 to 0.964, p = 0.031) or the combination of death/critical outcomes (OR 0.670, CI 0.495 to 0.908, p = 0.010). There was no significant association of critical/death outcomes within ACEi vs non-ACEi (OR 1.008, CI 0.822 to 1.235, p = 0.941) and ARB vs non-ARB (OR 0.946, CI 0.735 to 1.218, p = 0.668). This is the largest meta-analysis including critical events and mortality data on patients prescribed ACEi/ARB and found evidence of beneficial effects of chronic ACEi/ARB use especially in hypertensive cohort with COVID-19. As such, we would strongly encourage patients to continue with RAAS inhibitor pharmacotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Baral, Ranu; White, Madeline; Vassiliou, Vassilios S",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,398

What is more, few studies have focused on the gender differences in mental health problems (MHPs) among HCWs during such an outbreak. Thus, the current study investigated the prevalence and gender differences of various MHPs among HCWs in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. This nationwide survey was conducted online from January 29 to February 3, 2020. General information was collected by questions about socio-demographics, work-related factors, and living situations. Depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Among the 2198 contacted HCWs, 1563 (71.1%) responded with valid data, of whom 1293 (82.7%) were females. The prevalences of depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms in participants were 50.7%, 44.7%, 52.5%, and 36.1%, respectively. Female HCWs had significantly higher scores in all four scales (p < 0.001) and higher prevalences in all MHPs involved (range, odds ratio [OR] 1.55-1.97). After adjusting for potential confounders, female HCWs still had higher risks for all MHPs involved than males (range, adjusted OR 1.36-1.96). HCWs present high prevalences of depressive, anxiety, stress, and insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, female HCWs are more vulnerable to all MHPs involved. These findings highlight the need for timely, special care and support for HCWs during the outbreak, especially for females.","Liu, Shuai; Yang, Lulu; Zhang, Chenxi; Xu, Yan; Cai, Lidan; Ma, Simeng; Wang, Ying; Cai, Zhongxiang; Du, Hui; Li, Ruiting; Kang, Lijun; Zheng, Huirong; Liu, Zhongchun; Zhang, Bin",J Psychiatr Res,,398

284731,TE-ESN: Time Encoding Echo State Network for Prediction Based on Irregularly Sampled Time Series Data,2021-05-02,"The past 20 years have witnessed a renaissance of dye chemistry, moving from traditional colorant research toward functional materials. Different from traditional colorant research, the properties of functional materials are governed extensively by intermolecular interactions, thereby entailing significant limitations to the classical approach based on molecular structure-molecular property (color, emission, redox properties, etc.) relationships for the respective dye molecules. However, as discussed in this Perspective, such an approach can be pursued for dye aggregates, and in many cases already well-tailored dimers are sufficient to understand the influence of supramolecular organization on the functional properties of ground and photoexcited states. Illustrative examples will be given for exciton coupling and charge-transfer coupling and how these properties relate to desirable functions such as fluorescence, symmetry-breaking charge separation, and singlet fission in molecular aggregates. While the progress in this research so far mostly originated from studies on well-defined folded and self-assembled structures composed of only two dye molecules, future work will have to advance toward larger oligomers of specific size and geometry. Furthermore, future experimental studies should be guided to a larger extent by theoretical predictions that may be supported by machine learning algorithms and new concepts from artificial intelligence. Beyond already pursued calculations of potential energy landscapes, we suggest the development of theoretical approaches that identify the most desirable dye aggregate structures for a particular property on functional energy landscapes.","Bialas, David; Kirchner, Eva; Röhr, Merle I S; Würthner, Frank",j. am. chem. soc,,398

We previously determined that the sequence immediately downstream from the S2' cleavage site is the bona fide SARS-1 FP. In this study, we used sequence alignment to identify the SARS-2 FP, and studied its membrane ordering effect. Although there are only three residue differences, SARS-2 FP induces even greater membrane ordering than SARS-1 FP, possibly due to its greater hydrophobicity. This may be a reason that SARS-2 is better able to infect host cells. In addition, the membrane binding enthalpy for SARS-2 is greater. Both the membrane ordering of SARS-2 and SARS-1 FPs are dependent on Ca2+, but that of SARS-2 shows a greater response to the presence of Ca2+. Both FPs bind two Ca2+ ions as does SARS-1 FP, but the two Ca2+ binding sites of SARS-2 exhibit greater cooperativity. This Ca2+ dependence by the SARS-2 FP is very ion-specific. These results show that Ca2+ is an important regulator that interacts with the SARS-2 FP and thus plays a significant role in SARS-2 viral entry. This could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca2+ channel.","Lai, Alex L; Freed, Jack H",J Mol Biol,,398
287470,Incorporating Visual Layout Structures for Scientific Text Classification,2021-06-01,"An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Recently, we reported safety, tolerability and antibody response data from an ongoing placebo-controlled, observer-blinded phase I/II coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine trial with BNT162b1, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated nucleoside-modified mRNA that encodes the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein1. Here we present antibody and T cell responses after vaccination with BNT162b1 from a second, non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1-50 µg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those seen in serum from a cohort of individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 serum-neutralizing antibodies on day 43 were 0.7-fold (1-µg dose) to 3.5-fold (50-µg dose) those of the recovered individuals. Immune sera broadly neutralized pseudoviruses with diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike variants. Most participants had T helper type 1 (TH1)-skewed T cell immune responses with RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell expansion. Interferon-Î³ was produced by a large fraction of RBD-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. The robust RBD-specific antibody, T cell and favourable cytokine responses induced by the BNT162b1 mRNA vaccine suggest that it has the potential to protect against COVID-19 through multiple beneficial mechanisms.","Sahin, Ugur; Muik, Alexander; Derhovanessian, Evelyna; Vogler, Isabel; Kranz, Lena M; Vormehr, Mathias; Baum, Alina; Pascal, Kristen; Quandt, Jasmin; Maurus, Daniel; Brachtendorf, Sebastian; Lörks, Verena; Sikorski, Julian; Hilker, Rolf; Becker, Dirk; Eller, Ann-Kathrin; Grützner, Jan; Boesler, Carsten; Rosenbaum, Corinna; Kühnle, Marie-Cristine; Luxemburger, Ulrich; Kemmer-Brück, Alexandra; Langer, David; Bexon, Martin; Bolte, Stefanie; Karikó, Katalin; Palanche, Tania; Fischer, Boris; Schultz, Armin; Shi, Pei-Yong; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Perez, John L; Swanson, Kena A; Loschko, Jakob; Scully, Ingrid L; Cutler, Mark; Kalina, Warren; Kyratsous, Christos A; Cooper, David; Dormitzer, Philip R; Jansen, Kathrin U; Türeci, Özlem",Nature,,398

Recently, some patients with COVID-19 have been shown to have neurological symptoms such as headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, impaired consciousness, and ischemic stroke. Case presentation we describe a case of ischemic stroke as the main presentation of COVID-19 in a 68 years old man with no previous history, without any associated respiratory signs;clinical examination revealed left hemiparesis with dysarthria and left facial paralysis, NIHSS score was at 11, the brain CT scan performed 1h30min later, completed by a brain MRI that came back in favor of right frontal, temporal and parietal ischemic stroke. The decision of thrombolysis was indicated in urgency, and the patient benefited from thrombolysis, which proceeded without incidents;the outcome was favorable with regression of symptoms. Ischemic stroke has been widely described among the thromboembolic complications of COVID-19, but only a few papers have reported it as a primary manifestation of COVID-19. Conclusion SARS-COV 2 infection can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system, resulting in an inflammatory response and excessive secretion of inflammatory markers, leading to ischemic stroke.","Rajae, Alkouh Manal Merbouh Ghizlane El Aidouni Amine Bouabdlaoui I.Zaid Houssam Bkiyar Yassine Mabrouk Brahim Housni",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),,398

289040,Swarm Learning for decentralized and confidential clinical machine learning,2021,"Older adults are susceptible to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes as a consequence of their age and, in some cases, underlying health conditions (1). A COVID-19 outbreak in a long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County, Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020, highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6, seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93%) of the 82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents. Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30%) residents with positive test results, 10 (43%) had symptoms on the date of testing, and 13 (57%) were asymptomatic. Seven days after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a confirmed case is identified in an SNF, all residents should be placed on isolation precautions if possible (3), with considerations for extended use or reuse of personal protective equipment (PPE) as needed (4).","Kimball, Anne; Hatfield, Kelly M; Arons, Melissa; James, Allison; Taylor, Joanne; Spicer, Kevin; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Tanwar, Sukarma; Chisty, Zeshan; Bell, Jeneita M; Methner, Mark; Harney, Josh; Jacobs, Jesica R; Carlson, Christina M; McLaughlin, Heather P; Stone, Nimalie; Clark, Shauna; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Page, Libby C; Kay, Meagan; Lewis, James; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Gant, Jessica; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Clark, Thomas A; Honein, Margaret A; Reddy, Sujan C; Jernigan, John A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,398

The speed and scope of the spread of COVID-19 makes it urgent to define clinical characteristics, serological and radiological changes of the affected patients. METHODS: Seven patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University Yuedong Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and their clinical features, serological and radiological longitudinal changes were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 7 patients, all (100%) had a clear epidemiological history. The most common symptoms were respiratory symptoms 6 (85.7%), and only 2 (28.6%) of the patients had fever at their first visit. The cohort included 4 (57.1%) common types and 3 (42.9%) severe types. Two (28.6%) common type patients developed to severe type in a short time. All of the 7 patients (100%) had abnormal liver function, normal renal function, and normal procalcitonin. The detection time of specific antibody in 7 patients was 5 - 13 days after symptoms. Before the specific antibody could be detected, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased in 2 (28.6%) common type cases transferred to severe type cases accompanied with obvious progress in pulmonary imaging. The phenomenon of decreased albumin and elevated globulin occurred in 6 patients (85.7%). The predominant pattern of lung lesions observed was bilateral (71.4%) and mainly near the pleura at the first diagnosis. Bilateral pulmonary involvement occurred in 6 cases (85.7%) during the course of disease. In 4 cases (57.1%) with obvious pulmonary lesions, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased, albumin decreased, and globulin increased during the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum specific antibodies can be detected within 2 weeks of onset. Close observation of the dynamic changes of absolute value of blood lymphocytes, serum albumin, and globulin which were related to pulmonary imaging changes in patients will contribute to assessment of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhiwei; Yu, Mingxue; Li, Ganwen; Liu, Guirong; Xie, Jinjun; Song, Hongzhong; Li, Gang; Jie, Yusheng",Clin. lab,,398

The number of reported Covid-19 positive cases is highest from Austria (1150 individuals), Italy (68) and Spain (90). Count data model estimations confirm that the number of Covid-19 cases in Scandinavia mainly originates from Austria and Italy, followed by Iran. The number of positive cases brought from abroad decreases significantly with the geographical distance between the home country and the destination.

One probable reason for this difference could be the difference in living conditions and exposure to other infections. Secondly, the difference in food especially, alcohol use may have deteriorating effects superimposed with obesity. Our hypothesis suggests that a combination of alcohol consumption and obesity causes low immunity and makes the individual prone to develop ‘cytokine storm’ and ‘acute respiratory distress syndrome’; the hallmark of COVID-19 mortality and morbidity. Thus, we propose that reducing any one trigger can have a beneficial effect in combating the disease severity.","Bilal, Bushra; Saleem, Faizan; Fatima, Syeda Sadia",Med. Hypotheses,,398

Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease. Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. It is unknown if immunocompromised hosts are at higher risk of more severe systemic disease. Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. Two of seven patients presented within three months of transplantation. Overall, two were managed on an out-patient basis, but the remaining five required hospital admission, four in intensive care units. All patients displayed respiratory symptoms and fever. Other common clinical features included hypoxia, chest crepitation, lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein. Very high D dimer, ferritin and troponin levels occurred in severe cases and likely prognostic. Immunosuppression was modified in six of seven patients. Three patients with severe disease were diabetic. During a three week follow up one patient recovered, and one patient died. Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission. The symptoms are predominantly respiratory and associated with fever. Most patients had their immunosuppression reduced and were treated with supportive therapy.","Banerjee, Debasish; Popoola, Joyce; Shah, Sapna; Ster, Irina Chis; Quan, Virginia; Phanish, Mysore",Kidney Int,,398

Numerical experiments from our model show that the control policies implemented in NYC reduced the number of infections by 72% [interquartile range (IQR) 53-95] and the number of deceased cases by 76% (IQR 58-96) by the end of 2020. Among all the NPIs, social distancing for the entire population and protection for the elderly in public facilities is the most effective control measure in reducing severe infections and deceased cases. School closure policy may not work as effectively as one might expect in terms of reducing the number of deceased cases. Our simulation results provide novel insights into the city-specific implementation of NPIs with minimal social disruption considering the locations and population characteristics.","Yang, Jiannan; Zhang, Qingpeng; Cao, Zhidong; Gao, Jianxi; Pfeiffer, Dirk; Zhong, Lu; Zeng, Daniel Dajun",Chaos,,398

296512,Face mask waste generation and management during the COVID-19 pandemic: An overview and the Peruvian case,2021,"Case details: A case of a 50-year old HIV-positive man is presented, with focus on visualization of post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) of the lungs, in comparison to a forensic control case. He had been found dead at home, a day after his nasopharyngeal swab had returned positive for SARS-COV-2, three days after the sample had been taken as an outpatient, over five weeks after first exhibiting possible symptoms. 3D-visualization was performed by visually discriminating correlates for aerated, poorly aerated and non-aerated lung regions. The visual side-by-side comparison with a control case shows the deterioration beyond any ”normal” post-mortem finding, however. The PMCT findings in the lungs resemble those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while histologically identified inflammation also shows, in part binuclear, lymphocytes. In addition, acute liver dystrophy and acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys were found. Except coronary artery atherosclerosis, there appeared to be no remarkable pathology of the heart. Comment: With the pandemic impact of SARS-COV-2, a range of issues unfolds, also for medicolegal investigations into deaths, as we report the first Swiss case with post-mortem CT where death had occurred due to a SARS-COV-2 infection, with features of a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, as an outpatient. As this pandemic from the view of risk assessment does constitute a black swan, underestimated fat tails as technical reason should be addressed by also analyzing apparent extreme single observations. This case of an outpatient (without hospital or intensive-care treatment) shows a pulmonary progression beyond the typical findings of COVID-19, to a non-specific picture of ARDS, where histologically, in part binuclear lymphocytes were remarked. What appeared to be an initially slow progression with final rapid escalation raises the question whether nasopharyngeal swabs alone or added pulmonary CT might be better for screening high-risk patients. The reported symptoms and relatively late medical consultation in this case appeared to contrast with the extensive pathology, raising the question whether any search for super-spreaders should not just focus on asymptomatic but under-reported symptomatic patients, and whether their prolonged circulation in everyday life would justify measures such as for example more extensive face mask policies. As post-mortem testing for SARS-COV-2 may not be available for every case, PMCT may provide sensitive testing for lung changes related to COVID-19. In order to allow for more precise medicolegal investigations in the context of COVID-19, however, any more specific extra tests may have to be financed by stakeholders in epidemiology, infectious disease or policy.","Schweitzer, Wolf; Ruder, Thomas; Baumeister, Rilana; Bolliger, Stephan; Thali, Michael; Meixner, Eva; Ampanozi, Garyfalia",For.

Data were collected and analyzed through the COVID-19 information published on the official websites of the health commissions in the six selected cities of Henan Province. As of 17 June 2020, the cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 in Henan Province was 1.33/100,000, the cumulative cure rate was 98.27%, the cumulative mortality rate was 1.73%, the age range of diagnosed cases was 5 days to 85 years old, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.09:1. The confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Henan Province were mainly imported cases from Hubei, accounting for 87.74% of all cases, of which the highest proportion was 70.50% in Zhumadian. The contact cases and local cases increased in a fluctuating manner over time. In this paper, epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan Province were analyzed from the onset of the outbreak to the effective control within 60 days, and effective and distinctive prevention and control measures in various cities were summarized to provide a favorable useful reference for the further formulation and implementation of epidemic prevention and control and a valuable theoretical basis for effectively avoiding a second outbreak.IMPORTANCE Epidemic prevention and control in China have entered a new stage of normalization. This article analyzes the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan Province and summarizes the effective disease prevention and control means and measures at the prefecture level; the normalized private data provide a theoretical reference for the formulation and conduct of future prevention and control work. At the same time, these epidemic prevention and control findings can also be used for reference in other countries and regions.","Yang, Xianguang; Chen, Xuelin; Ding, Cuihong; Bai, Zhibo; Zhu, Jingyi; Sun, Gege; Yu, Guoying",MSphere,,398
296971,Summoning a New Artificial Intelligence Patent Model: In the Age of Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: More severe cases of COVID- 19 are more likely to be hospitalized and around one-fifth, needing ICU admission. Understanding the common laboratory features of COVID-19 in more severe cases versus non-severe patients could be quite useful for clinicians and might help to predict the model of disease progression. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the laboratory test findings in severe vs. non-severe confirmed infected cases of COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from the beginning of 2019 to 3rd of March 2020. Heterogeneity across included studies was determined using Cochrane's Q test and the I2 statistic. We used the fixed or random-effect models to pool the weighted mean differences (WMDs) or standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: Out of a total of 3009 citations, 17 articles (22 studies, 21 from China and one study from Singapore) with 3396 ranging from 12 to1099 patients were included. Our meta-analyses showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil, hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, serum sodium, lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCR), leukocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LeCR), leukocyte to IL-6 ratio (LeIR), and an increase in the neutrophil, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), D-dimer, glucose level, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the severe group compared with the non-severe group. No significant changes in white blood cells (WBC), Creatine Kinase (CK), troponin I, myoglobin, IL-6 and K between the two groups were observed. INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis provides evidence for the differentiation of severe cases of COVID-19 based on laboratory test results at the time of ICU admission.

Normally, monoclonal antibodies may bind and block only one growth factor or receptor, such as bevacizumab binding and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Herein, we develop a monotargeting peptidic network antibody (pepnetibody) that blocks multiple receptors on the membrane of ECs through forming a fibrous network and ultimately achieves high-efficient treatment of CNV. The pepnetibody could bind to integrin &#945;vß3 in particulate formulation and in situ fibrillogenesis on ECs, mimicking the process of fibronectin fibrillogenesis on the cell membrane. The in situ formed peptidic network could firmly block integrin and cover other angiogenesis-related receptors, such as VEGF receptor-2 and neuropilin-1, exhibiting competitive efficacy of antiangiogenesis compared with traditional monoclonal antibody bevacizumab with 97.7 times lower dose.","Zhang, Kuo; Zhang, Hui; Gao, Yong-Hong; Wang, Jia-Qi; Li, Yuan; Cao, Hui; Hu, Ying; Wang, Lei",ACS nano,,398

Green coffee beans are known to have a higher content of chlorogenic acid (CGA) with potential health benefits like activity against hypertension, diabetes, obesity, etc. There are three major classes of chlorogenic acids present in green coffee beans, namely: caffeoylquinic acid (CQA), di-caffeoylquinic acid (diCQA) and feruloylquinic acid (FQA). Another pivotal component of the green beans is caffeic acid. A compilation of the different research studies and reviews pertaining to the diverse biomolecules present in the green coffee, their structure and the different sources of CGA is presented. The traditional and modern methods of the extraction of CGA are also studied. Green coffee upon roasting develops its aromatic characteristics but the flavor development comes with a reciprocation of reduced chlorogenic acid content. Thus, the effect of processing is also addressed. There are numerous studies conducted to show the health benefits associated with the consumption of green coffee out of which, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects are particularly concentrated in this article.","Pimpley, Vaibhavi; Patil, Siddhi; Srinivasan, Kartikeya; Desai, Nivas; Murthy, Pushpa S",Prep Biochem Biotechnol,,398

Although the resulting emission reductions will continue to evolve, this will presumably be temporary. Here, we provide estimates of the potential effect of such short-term emission reductions on global and regional temperature and precipitation by analyzing the response of an Earth System Model to a range of idealized near-term emission pathways not considered in available model intercomparison projects. These estimates reveal the modest impact that temporary emission reductions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will have on global and regional climate. Our simulations suggest that the impact of carbon dioxide and aerosol emission reductions is actually a temporary enhancement in warming rate. However, our results demonstrate that even large emission reductions applied for a short duration have only a small and likely undetectable impact.","Fyfe, J C; Kharin, V V; Swart, N; Flato, G M; Sigmond, M; Gillett, N P",Sci.

An extensive review of the literature revealed a few reported cases. This article reports the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and outcome of large-vessel occlusion in a young patient with COVID-19 and reviews the pertinent literature on this condition. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old female was in her usual state of health until she presented with a 3-day history of right-sided weakness, slurred speech, and decreased vision. The patient was taken to several hospitals where she was managed conservatively with analgesics. Shortly thereafter, her weakness become progressive. She became severely dysarthric and unresponsive. Upon arrival to the emergency department, her physical examination revealed that she was stuporous, with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 10 (E3 V2 M5). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19 upon presentation. Brain CT and a CT venogram revealed an occluded left internal carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery (MCA) with subacute left MCA territory infarction and midline shift. A CT angiogram revealed complete occlusion of the left common carotid artery. An emergent decompressive craniectomy was successfully performed. The patient was shifted to the intensive care unit. She was later found to be positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Although rare, patients with COVID-19 can present with large-vessel occlusion. Prompt identification of COVID-19-related coagulopathy is essential to assess young patients with clinical manifestations of infarction.","Alkhaibary, Ali; Abbas, Munzir; Ahmed, Muhammad Ejaz; Khatri, Ismail A; Alkhani, Ahmed",World neurosurgery (Online),,398

Feelings depend on the interoceptive nervous system (INS), a collection of peripheral and central pathways, nuclei and cortical regions which continuously sense chemical and anatomical changes in the organism. How such humoral and neural signals come to generate conscious mental states has been a major scientific question. The answer proposed here invokes (1) several distinctive and poorly known physiological features of the INS; and (2) a unique interaction between the body (the 'object' of interoception) and the central nervous system (which generates the 'subject' of interoception). The atypical traits of the INS and the direct interactions between neural and non-neural physiological compartments of the organism, neither of which is present in exteroceptive systems, plausibly explain the qualitative and subjective aspects of feelings, thus accounting for their conscious nature.","Carvalho, Gil B; Damasio, Antonio",Bioessays,,398

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of QoL, resilience, and associated factors among nursing faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In April 2020, a cross-sectional, anonymous survey was conducted with nursing faculty in a public university in rural Appalachia (n = 52). Instruments included QoL, resilience scales, work-related, and demographic variables. Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple linear regression analyses were used to analyze data.

317175,Security of Healthcare Data Using Blockchains: A Survey,2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND: It is now 25 years since the adoption of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the same concerns raised during its negotiations such as high prices of medicines, market exclusivity and delayed market entry for generics remain relevant as highlighted recently by the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics. The World Health Organization's (WHO) mandate to work on the interface between intellectual property, innovation and access to medicine has been continually reinforced and extended to include providing support to countries on the implementation of TRIPS flexibilities in collaboration with stakeholders. This study analyses the role of intellectual property on access to medicines in the African Region. METHODS: We analyze patent data from the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization (ARIPO) and Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle (OAPI) to provide a situational analysis of patenting activity and trends. We also review legislation to assess how TRIPS flexibilities are implemented in countries. RESULTS: Patenting was low for African countries. Only South Africa and Cameroon appeared in the list of top ten originator countries for ARIPO and OAPI respectively. Main diseases covered by African patents were HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and tumors. Majority countries have legislation allowing for compulsory licensing and parallel importation of medicines, while the least legislated flexibilities were explicit exemption of pharmaceutical products from patentable subject matter, new or second use of patented pharmaceutical products, imposition of limits to patent term extension and test data protection. Thirty-nine countries have applied TRIPS flexibilities, with the most common being compulsory licensing and least developed country transition provisions. CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities exist for WHO to work with ARIPO and OAPI to support countries in reviewing their legislation to be more responsive to public health needs.","Motari, Marion; Nikiema, Jean-Baptiste; Kasilo, Ossy M J; Kniazkov, Stanislav; Loua, Andre; Sougou, Aissatou; Tumusiime, Prosper",BMC Public Health,,398

It is important for organizations to evaluate the efficacy of interventions aiming at mitigating viral transmission among their personnel. We have developed a operational risk assessment simulation framework that couples a spatial agent-based model of movement with a SIR epidemiological model to assess the relative risks of different intervention strategies. By applying our model on MIT's STATA building, we assess the impacts of three possible dimensions of intervention: one-way vs unrestricted movement, population size allowed onsite, and frequency of leaving designated work location for breaks. We find that there is no significant impact made by one-way movement restrictions over unrestricted movement. Instead, we find that a combination of lowering the number of individuals admitted below the current recommendations and advising individuals to reduce the frequency at which they leave their workstations lowers the likelihood of highly connected individuals within the contact networks that emerge, which in turn lowers the overall risk of infection. We discover three classes of possible interventions based on their epidemiological effects. By assuming a direct relationship between data on secondary attack rates and transmissibility in the SIR model, we compare relative infection risk of four respiratory diseases, MERS, SARS, COVID-19, and Measles, within the simulated area, and recommend appropriate intervention guidelines.","Gunaratne, Chathika; Reyes, Rene; Hemberg, Erik; O'Reilly, Una-May",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11025v1.pdf,398

Dysfunction of endothelial cells is believed to mediate a variety of viral infections, including those caused by previous coronaviruses. Experience from previous coronaviruses has triggered hypotheses on the role of endothelial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical studies. Endothelial dysfunction is the common denominator of multiple clinical aspects of severe COVID-19 infection that have been problematic for treating physicians.

Here, the aim is to explore graphene oxide (GO), the most studied 2D nanomaterial in biomedical applications, as a nanoscale platform for interaction with SARS-CoV-2. Molecular docking analyses of GO sheets on interaction with three different structures: SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (open state - 6VYB or closed state - 6VXX), ACE2 (1R42), and the ACE2-bound spike complex (6M0J) are performed. GO shows high affinity for the surface of all three structures (6M0J, 6VYB and 6VXX). When binding affinities and involved bonding types are compared, GO interacts more strongly with the spike or ACE2, compared to 6M0J. Infection experiments using infectious viral particles from four different clades as classified by Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID), are performed for validation purposes. Thin, biological-grade GO nanoscale (few hundred nanometers in lateral dimension) sheets are able to significantly reduce copies for three different viral clades. This data has demonstrated that GO sheets have the capacity to interact with SARS-CoV-2 surface components and disrupt infectivity even in the presence of any mutations on the viral spike. GO nanosheets are proposed to be further explored as a nanoscale platform for development of antiviral strategies against COVID-19.","Unal, Mehmet Altay; Bayrakdar, Fatma; Nazir, Hasan; Besbinar, Omur; Gurcan, Cansu; Lozano, Neus; Arellano, Luis M; Yalcin, Süleyman; Panatli, Oguzhan; Celik, Dogantan; Alkaya, Damla; Agan, Aydan; Fusco, Laura; Suzuk Yildiz, Serap; Delogu, Lucia Gemma; Akcali, Kamil Can; Kostarelos, Kostas; Yilmazer, Açelya",Small,,398

Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, Switzerland, 2020. 265 pp. $84.99 (cloth)",2020,"IMPORTANCE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared a global pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality since first appearing in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. As many countries are grappling with the onset of their epidemics, pharmacotherapeutics remain lacking. The window of opportunity to mitigate downstream morbidity and mortality is narrow but remains open. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial to the homeostasis of both the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 utilises and interrupts this pathway directly, which could be described as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV (RAAS-SCoV) axis. There exists significant controversy and confusion surrounding how anti-hypertensive agents might function along this pathway. This review explores the current state of knowledge regarding the RAAS-SCoV axis (informed by prior studies of SARS-CoV), how this relates to our currently evolving pandemic, and how these insights might guide our next steps in an evidence-based manner. OBSERVATIONS: This review discusses the role of the RAAS-SCoV axis in acute lung injury and the effects, risks and benefits of pharmacological modification of this axis. There may be an opportunity to leverage the different aspects of RAAS inhibitors to mitigate indirect viral-induced lung injury. Concerns have been raised that such modulation might exacerbate the disease. While relevant preclinical, experimental models to date favour a protective effect of RAAS-SCoV axis inhibition on both lung injury and survival, clinical data related to the role of RAAS modulation in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 remain limited. CONCLUSION: Proposed interventions for SARS-CoV-2 predominantly focus on viral microbiology and aim to inhibit viral cellular injury. While these therapies are promising, immediate use may not be feasible, and the time window of their efficacy remains a major unanswered question. An alternative approach is the modulation of the specific downstream pathophysiological effects caused by the virus that lead to morbidity and mortality. We propose a preponderance of evidence that supports clinical equipoise regarding the efficacy of RAAS-based interventions, and the imminent need for a multisite randomised controlled clinical trial to evaluate the inhibition of the RAAS-SCoV axis on acute lung injury in COVID-19.","Ingraham, Nicholas E; Barakat, Abdo G; Reilkoff, Ronald; Bezdicek, Tamara; Schacker, Timothy; Chipman, Jeffrey G; Tignanelli, Christopher J; Puskarich, Michael A",Eur. respir. j,,398

However, to establish innovative therapeutic methods, it is crucial to learn more about the microbiota.

The application of these metagenomics approaches to studying the gut microbiome in COVID-19 patients could be one of the promising areas of research in the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disparity. Therefore, understanding how the gut microbiome is affected by or could affect the SARS-CoV-2 is very important. Herein, we present an overview of approaches and methods used in the current published studies on COVID-19 patients and the gut microbiome. The accuracy of these researches depends on the appropriate choice and the optimal use of the metagenomics bioinformatics platforms and tools. Interestingly, most studies reported that COVID-19 patients' microbiota are enriched with opportunistic microorganisms. The choice and use of appropriate computational tools and techniques to accurately investigate the gut microbiota is therefore critical in determining the appropriate microbiome profile for diagnosis and the most reliable antiviral or preventive microbial composition.","Sehli, Sofia; Allali, Imane; Chahboune, Rajaa; Bakri, Youssef; Al Idrissi, Najib; Hamdi, Salsabil; Nejjari, Chakib; Amzazi, Saaïd; Ghazal, Hassan",Bioinform Biol Insights,,398

The shape, roughness, length and width of the enamel prisms were studied in the Image Analysis NT-VDT program according to the method of Omsk State Medical University. RESULTS: The enamel prisms structure at all ages has a regular, ordered shape with 6-sided and 7-sided figures. The most constant structure occurs at the age group of 41-50, 51-60 years. The fastest enamel prisms growth occurs in the direction that increases the prism length at all ages. Growth on a plane which increases the prism width is slow at 41-50 years. It is catching up with the growth rate of enamel prisms in length at 51-60 years old. Enamel prisms at 15-20, 21-30 years old stretch faster in the horizontal direction. CONCLUSION: In maturation process, due to correct and harmonious growth, enamel prisms are timely modified from pyramidal form in the early postpartum period to a prismatic form in the late postpartum period of ontogenesis.","Vagner, V D; Konev, V P; Korshunov, A S; Kuryatnikov, K N; Skurikhina, A P",Stomatologiia (Mosk),,398

328081,Integrating Scientific Knowledge with Machine Learning for Engineering and Environmental Systems,2020-03-10,"Most ethics guidelines for distributing scarce medical resources during the coronavirus pandemic seek to save the most lives and the most life-years. A patient's prognosis is determined using a SOFA or MSOFA score to measure likelihood of survival to discharge, as well as a consideration of relevant comorbidities and their effects on likelihood of survival up to one or five years. Although some guidelines use age as a tiebreaker when two patients' prognoses are identical, others refuse to consider age for fear of discriminating against the elderly. In this paper, I argue that age is directly relevant for maximizing health benefits, so current ethics guidelines are wrongly excluding or deemphasizing life-stage in their triage algorithms. Research on COVID-19 has shown that age is a risk factor in adverse outcomes, independent of comorbidities. And limiting a consideration of life-years to only one or five years past discharge does not maximize health benefits. Therefore, based on their own stated values, triage algorithms for coronavirus patients ought to include life-stage as a primary consideration, along with the SOFA score and comorbidities, rather than excluding it or using it merely as a tiebreaker. This is not discriminatory because patients ought to have equal opportunity to experience life-stages. The equitable enforcement of that right justifies unequal treatment based on age in cases when there is a scarcity of life-saving resources. A consideration of life-stage would thus allow healthcare workers to responsibly steward public resources in order to maximize lives and life-years saved.","Altman, Matthew C",Bioethics,,398

329277,Assessing the recent impact of COVID-19 on carbon emissions from China using domestic economic data,2020,"PURPOSE: To investigate the anxiety and depression levels of frontline clinical nurses working in 14 hospitals in Gansu Province, China, during this period. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online between February 7 and 10, 2020, with a convenience sample of 22,034 nurses working in 14 prefecture and city hospitals in Gansu Province, located in northwest China. METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire with four parts (demographic characteristics, general questions related to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, self-rating anxiety scale, and self-rating depression scale) was administered. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and SDs were computed. The associations between anxiety and depression with sociodemographic characteristics, work-related concerns, and impacts were analyzed, followed by multiple stepwise linear regression to identify factors that best predicted the nurses' anxiety and depression levels. FINDINGS: A total of 21,199 questionnaires were checked to be valid, with an effective recovery rate of 96.21%. The mean ± SD age of the respondents was 31.89 ± 7.084 years, and the mean ± SD length of service was 9.40 ± 7.638 years. The majority of the respondents were female (98.6%) and married (73.1%). Some demographic characteristics, related concerns, and impacts of COVID-19 were found to be significantly associated with both anxiety (p < .001) and depression (p < .001). Nurses who needed to take care of children or elderly relatives, took leave from work because they were worried about COVID-19, avoided contact with family and friends, and wanted to obtain more COVID-19-related knowledge had higher levels of both anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that nurses faced with the COVID-19 outbreak are at risk for experiencing anxiety and depression. Demographic background, psychosocial factors, and work-related factors predicted the psychological responses. The family responsibilities and burdens of women may explain the higher levels of anxiety and depression among nurses with these obligations as compared to those without. On the other hand, nurses who chose not to take leave from work or who did not avoid going to work during this period were less anxious and depressed.

331257,Classification of Coronavirus (COVID-19) from X-ray and CT images using shrunken features,2020,"BACKGROUND: Feminizing and masculinizing hormone treatments are established components of management in transgender patients. Exogenous hormones have been associated with hemostatic effects, which are well-studied in cis-gender individuals on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Unfortunately, comprehensive understanding of their effects on venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in the transgender population is lacking. AIM: This manuscript aims to identify the risk of VTE among transgender individuals undergoing cross-sex hormone therapy. METHODS: A Systematic review of the literature was performed in March 2020 for studies reporting VTE rates in transgender patients undergoing hormone treatment and rates in cis-gender patients on HRT. Data regarding demographics, hormone therapy, and VTE incidence were collected and pooled for analysis. OUTCOME: The primary outcome of interest was the development of a VTE event in association with concurrent hormone administration. RESULTS: Overall, 22 studies were included with 11 reporting VTE rates among transgender patients, 6 in cis-female patients, and 5 in cis-male patients. Data from 9,180 transgender patients (6,068 assigned male at birth [AMAB] and 3,112 assigned female at birth [AFAB]) undergoing hormone treatment and 103,713 cis-gender patients (18,748 female and 84,965 male) undergoing HRT were pooled. The incidence of VTE was higher in AMAB patients compared to AFAB patients (42.8 vs 10.8 VTE per 10,000 patient years; P = .02). The rate of VTE incidences in AMAB patients appears similar or higher than the rate demonstrated in cis-females on HRT. VTE incidence in AFAB patients, however, is similar to the published rates in cis-males on HRT. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: AMAB patients on hormone therapy have higher VTE rates than AFAB patients. AMAB and AFAB patients may have similar VTE incidence to cis-female and cis-male patients on hormone replacement therapy, respectively. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to aggregate and quantify the development of VTE events in association with hormone therapy in transgender patients. It places these values in the context of rates published in more widely studied populations. It is limited by its retrospective data and heterogenic data. CONCLUSION: Surgical planning regarding perioperative and postoperative VTE prophylaxis or cessation of hormone therapy should take into account each patient's Caprini risk assessment and the nature of each intervention.

METHODS: The data of daily HFMD incidence in Ningbo from January 2014 to November 2017 were set as the training set, and the data of December 2017 were set as the test set. ARIMA and LSTM models combined and uncombined with exogenous meteorological variables were adopted to fit the daily incidence of HFMD by using the data of the training set. The forecasting performances of the four fitted models were verified by using the data of the test set. Root mean square error (RMSE) was selected as the main measure to evaluate the performance of the models. RESULTS: The RMSE for multivariate LSTM, univariate LSTM, ARIMA and ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model with Exogenous Input Variables) was 10.78, 11.20, 12.43 and 14.73, respectively. The LSTM model with exogenous meteorological variables has the best performance among the four models and meteorological variables can increase the prediction accuracy of LSTM model. For the ARIMA model, exogenous meteorological variables did not increase the prediction accuracy but became the interference factor of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Multivariate LSTM is the best among the four models to fit the daily incidence of HFMD in Ningbo. It can provide a scientific method to build the HFMD early warning system and the methodology can also be applied to other communicable diseases.","Zhang, Rui; Guo, Zhen; Meng, Yujie; Wang, Songwang; Li, Shaoqiong; Niu, Ran; Wang, Yu; Guo, Qing; Li, Yonghong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,398

It is vital to continue investigating the landscape of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and therapeutic interventions. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to compare the pneumonia exacerbation rate between ciclesonide (Alvesco R) administration and symptomatic treatment in COVID-19 patients and to determine the efficacy of ciclesonide (Alvesco R). The secondary objectives are to investigate the safety of ciclesonide (Alvesco R) administration, changes in clinical and laboratory findings, and the number of viral genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 over time between the two groups. METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, exploratory, prospective, multi-center, parallel-group, open-label, randomized trial, a total of 90 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with specific inclusion/exclusion criteria will be recruited from 21 hospitals in Japan. Participants will be randomized to either the ciclesonide group receiving ciclesonide (Alvesco R) 400 µg dose three times a day over a seven-day period or to the symptomatic treatment group. Both groups will antitussives and antipyretics as required. Data collection for various parameters will be conducted on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 22, and 29 to record baseline assessments and the findings over an extended period. Computed tomography (CT) image scans prior to drug administration and 1 week following treatment will be compared, and efficacy will be confirmed by checking for pneumonia exacerbation. Primary endpoint analysis will be performed using Fisher's exact test to determine statistically significant differences in the pneumonia exacerbation rate between the ciclesonide and symptomatic treatment groups. RESULTS: The first trial participant was enrolled on April 3, 2020; recruitment is expected to be completed on September 30, 2020, while follow-up assessments of all participants are expected to be completed by October 31, 2020. The study results will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. CONCLUSIONS: The RACCO study will provide definitive comparative effectiveness data and important clinical outcomes data between the ciclesonide and symptomatic treatment groups. If the hypotheses that pneumonia exacerbation rate reduction is more significant in the ciclesonide treatment group than in the symptomatic treatment group and that ciclesonide is safe for use are valid, ciclesonide (Alvesco R) will serve as an important therapeutic option for COVID-19 patients.

The research answers the following questions: What does the term “coronavirus” collocate with? and what does language tell us about the points of focus of science production on Coronavirus in general? Data for this research consisted of a large corpus of research articles that were published as part of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Covid-19 corpus has 224,061,570 words and 50,754 documents. The analysis took a rigorous data driven approach in investigating linguistics phenomena - keyword and collocation analyses of science discourse of COVID-19. Statistic scores reported frequency of occurrences and strength of collocates. Findings showed that early science production focused on naming, describing, classifying the virus. Another point of focus is the spread of the virus. Also, findings have also noted speculation about the origin of the new virus. Science production of research investigated behavior of the virus, the life cycle of the virus and its diagnostic virology. In general, the findings are expected of science research carried out to solve a problem. As the data was collected May 2020, most research has focused on knowing more about the nature of the problem. Findings have implications for understanding in-depth points of focus in research regarding COVID-19 at the early stage of science production. © 2021 IEEE.","Alkhammash, R.","2021 International Conference of Women in Data Science at Taif University, WiDSTaif 2021",,398

However, since COVID-19 testing is now easily available, there is a need to evaluate whether routine testing should be performed for asymptomatic health care workers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide a quantitative analysis of the predicted impact that regular testing of health care workers for COVID-19 may have on the prevention of the disease among emergency department patients and staff. METHODS: Using publicly available data on COVID-19 cases and emergency department visits, as well as internal hospital staffing information, we developed a mathematical model to predict the impact of periodic COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic staff members of the emergency department in COVID-19-affected regions. We calculated various transmission constants based on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data, used a logistic model to calculate new infections, and developed a Markov model based on the average incubation period for COVID-19. RESULTS: Our model predicts that after 180 days, with a transmission constant of 1.219e-4 new infections/person2, weekly COVID-19 testing of health care workers would reduce new health care worker and patient infections by approximately 3%-5.9%, and biweekly testing would reduce infections in both by 1%-2.1%. At a transmission constant of 3.660e-4 new infections/person2, weekly testing would reduce infections by 11%-23% and biweekly testing would reduce infections by 5.5%-13%. At a lower transmission constant of 4.067e-5 new infections/person2, weekly and biweekly COVID-19 testing for health care workers would result in an approximately 1% and 0.5%-0.8% reduction in infections, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Periodic COVID-19 testing for emergency department staff in regions that are heavily affected by COVID-19 or are facing resource constraints may significantly reduce COVID-19 transmission among health care workers and previously uninfected patients.","Zhang, Yuemei; Cheng, Sheng-Ru",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,398

Our primary analysis focused on children tested because of symptoms/signs suggestive of COVID-19.ResultsAmong 2,494 children tested, 2,148 (86.1%) had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Clinical presentation of confirmed COVID-19 cases included besides fever (82.4%) and respiratory signs or symptoms (60.4%) also gastrointestinal (18.2%), neurological (18.9%), cutaneous (3.8%) and other unspecific influenza-like presentations (17.8%). In multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were: exposure history (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 39.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 17.52-90.55; p < 0.0001), cardiac disease (AOR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.19-5.02; p < 0.0001), fever (AOR: 3.05%; 95% CI: 1.67-5.58; p = 0.0003) and anosmia/ageusia (AOR: 4.08; 95% CI: 1.69-9.84; p = 0.002). Among 190 (7.6%) children positive for SARS-CoV-2, only four (2.1%) required respiratory support and two (1.1%) were admitted to intensive care; all recovered.ConclusionRecommendations for SARS-CoV-2 testing in children should consider the evidence of broader clinical features. Exposure history, fever and anosmia/ageusia are strong risk factors in children for positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, while other symptoms did not help discriminate positive from negative individuals. This study confirms that COVID-19 was a mild disease in the general paediatric population in Italy.

This calls for a rapid screening strategy of SARS-CoV-2 protective antibodies, generated in rehabilitated and vaccinated populations. METHODS: Serum samples collected over a follow-up period of six months from 306 COVID-19 cases discharged from Wuhan Tongji Hospital were analyzed. Anti-S Abs were detected by colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA), and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were detected by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: Most COVID-19 survivors tested positive for anti-S Abs (83.7%) and nAbs (98.0%) 6 months after being discharged from the hospital, and the levels of anti-S Abs in the blood were highly positively correlated with nAbs (r = 0.652, P < 0.0001). The positivity rate of nAbs for patients with anti-S Abs positive was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a good agreement between anti-S Abs detected by GICA and nAbs detected by CMIA. It indicates that anti-S Abs detected by GICA may be used as a cheaper screening strategy for detectable SARS-CoV-2 nAbs in COVID-19 convalescent individuals.","Li, Xinjie; Yin, Yue; Pang, Ling; Xu, Shuyun; Lu, Fengmin; Xu, Dong; Shen, Tao",Int J Infect Dis,,398

This study aimed to evaluate the preparedness for the pandemic among a European network of children's hospitals and to explore the strategies to restart health care services. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed in May 2020 to the 13 children's tertiary care hospitals belonging to the European Children's Hospitals Organisation. Responses were obtained from eight hospitals (62%). Significant reductions were observed in accesses to the emergency departments (41.7%), outpatient visits (35.7%), intensive and non-intensive care unit inpatient admissions (16.4 and 13%, respectively) between February 1 and April 30, 2020 as compared with the same period of 2019. Overall, 93 children with SARS CoV-2 infection were admitted to inpatient wards. All the hospitals created SARS-CoV-2 preparedness plans for the diagnosis and management of infected patients. Routine activities were re-scheduled. Four hospitals shared their own staff with adult units, two designated bed spaces for adults and only one admitted adults to inpatient wards. The three main components for the resumption of clinical activities were testing, source control, and reorganization of spaces and flows. Telemedicine and telehealth services were used before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by three hospitals and by all the hospitals during it.

Although Denmark and Sweden are alike in political organization and health care, national responses to the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic differed noticeably. Denmark initiated a hard lock down followed by an outbreak control strategy (the so-called ""hammer and dance"" strategy), while Sweden's strategy was based on advising on social distancing, while keeping society open (a so-called mitigative strategy). The objective of this study is to describe national epidemic control strategies in Denmark and Sweden in 2020, and compare the epidemic dynamics in the two countries, with respect to number of COVID-19 cases, admissions to intensive care and mortality. Data on epidemic control efforts and COVID-associated morbidity/mortality were downloaded from official government and epidemic surveillance webpages and comparatively described using basic statistics. Overall, we found ""the hammer"" resulted in better epidemic control during 2020 with less COVID-19-associated admissions to intensive care and lower mortality.","Mens, H.; Koch, A.; Chaine, M.; Bengaard Andersen, A.",Apmis,,398

346001,Secure Learning Management System Based on User Behavior,2020,"RATIONALE: Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) typically undergo frequent clinical evaluation. The incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 and its impact on routine management for patients with pulmonary vascular disease is currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: For patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19. Evaluate the pandemic's impact on clinic operations at these centers. METHODS: A survey was emailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results. RESULTS: Seventy-seven center directors were successfully emailed a survey, 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.1 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general United States population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH and recognized COVID-19 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population. A large impact on clinic operations was observed including fewer clinic visits and substantially increased use of telehealth. A majority of centers curtailed diagnostic testing and a minority limited new starts of medical therapy. Most centers did not use experimental therapies in PAH/CTEPH patients diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in patients with PAH/CTEPH appears similar to the broader population, although outcomes may be worse. While the total number of patients with PAH/CTEPH recognized to have COVID-19 was small, the impact of COVID-19 on broader clinic operations, testing, and treatment was substantial.","Lee, Joshua D; Burger, Charles D; Delossantos, Genecelle B; Grinnan, Daniel; Ralph, David D; Rayner, Sam G; Ryan, John J; Safdar, Zeenat; Ventetuolo, Corey E; Zamanian, Roham T; Leary, Peter J",Ann.

XRD (X-ray diffraction), SEM (scanning electronic microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscope), HRTEM (high-resolution transmission electron microscope), UV-Vis, and Raman are adopted to ensure that this balsam pear-shaped CuO with dense nanoparticle protuberance is successfully prepared. The LOD of this CuO SERS substrate is 4.79 µg L-1 with R6G as molecular probe. By using DFT (density functional theory) calculation and FDTD (finite difference time domainmethod) simulation, both EM (electromagnetic enhancement) and CM (chemical enhancement) mechanisms are investigated, and the results show that these two-enhancement mechanisms can coexist in this balsam pear-shaped CuO. Finally, the prepared substrate has been applied for the determination of trace levels of paraquat in solution , and results show that its LOD for paraquat is 275 µg L-1 (optimum Raman band: 1646 cm-1 Raman shift), which is better than the government standard in China. A dexterous and facile way for fabrication of CuO SERS-active substrates with low cost and high performance, quite promising in detection of chemically hazardous substances and pesticide residue is provided.

353537,China,2020,"Background: Since the Covid-19 global pandemic emerged, developing countries have been facing multiple challenges over its diagnosis. We aimed to establish a relationship between the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for early detection and assessment to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-Cov-2. Methods: We collected published data on the clinical features of Covid-19 retrospectively and categorized them into physical and blood biomarkers. Common features were assigned scores by the Borg scoring method with slight modifications and were incorporated into a newly-developed Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 assessment Chart. Correlations between signs and symptoms with the development of Covid-19 was assessed by Pearson correlation and Spearman Correlation coefficient (rho). Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the highest correlating features. The frequency of signs and symptoms in developing Covid-19 was assessed through Chi-square test two tailed with Cramer's V strength. Changes in signs and symptoms were incorporated into a chart that consisted of four tiers representing disease stages. Results: Data from 10,172 Covid-19 laboratory confirmed cases showed a correlation with Fever in 43.9% (P = 0.000) cases, cough 54.08% and dry mucus 25.68% equally significant (P = 0.000), Hyperemic pharyngeal mucus membrane 17.92% (P = 0.005), leukopenia 28.11% (P = 0.000), lymphopenia 64.35% (P = 0.000), thrombopenia 35.49% (P = 0.000), elevated Alanine aminotransferase 50.02% (P = 0.000), and Aspartate aminotransferase 34.49% (P = 0.000). The chart exhibited a maximum scoring of 39. Normal tier scoring was ≤ 12/39, mild state scoring was 13–22/39, and star values scoring was ≥7/15; this latter category on the chart means Covid-19 is progressing and quarantine should be adopted. Moderate stage scored 23–33 and severe scored 34–39 in the chart. Conclusion: The Hashmi-Asif Covid-19 Chart is significant in assessing subclinical and clinical stages of Covid-19 to reduce the transmission rate.","Hashmi, Hafiz Abdul Sattar; Asif, Hafiz Muhammad",Front.

354173,Altered GABA-mediated information processing and cognitive dysfunctions in depression and other brain disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still evolving globally, and Brazil is currently one of the most affected countries. It is still debated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at a higher risk for developing COVID-19 or its complications. AIM: To assess geographical distribution of IBD patients at the highest risk and correlate these data with COVID-19 mortality rates in Brazil. METHODS: The Brazilian IBD Study Group (Grupo de Estudos da Doença Inflamatória Intestinal do Brasil) developed a web-based survey adapted from the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. The included categories were demographic data and inquiries related to risk factors for complications from COVID-19. Patients were categorized as highest, moderate or lowest individual risk. The Spearman correlation test was used to identify any association between highest risk and mortality rates for each state of the country. RESULTS: A total of 3568 patients (65.3% females) were included. Most participants were from the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil, and 84.1% were using immunomodulators and/or biologics. Most patients (55.1%) were at moderate risk, 23.4% were at highest risk and 21.5% were at lowest risk of COVID-19 complications. No association between the proportion of IBD patients at highest risk for COVID-19 complications and higher mortality rates was identified in different Brazilian states (r = 0.146, P = 0.467). CONCLUSION: This study indicates a distinct geographical distribution of IBD patients at highest risk for COVID-19 complications in different states of the country, which may reflect contrasting socioeconomic, educational and healthcare aspects. No association between high risk of IBD and COVID-related mortality rates was identified.","Queiroz, Natália Sousa Freitas; Teixeira, Fábio Vieira; Motta, Marina Pamponet; Chebli, Liliana Andrade; Hino, Adriano Akira Ferreira; Martins, Camilla de Almeida; Quaresma, Abel Botelho; da Silva, Alexandre Augusto de Paula; Damião, Adérson Omar Mourão Cintra; Saad-Hossne, Rogerio; Kotze, Paulo Gustavo",World J Gastroenterol,,398

356341,Manifold Topology Divergence: a Framework for Comparing Data Manifolds,2021-06-08,"In the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most important concerns in reproductive health is the issue of male fertility of recovered patients. In this study, we discuss the potential mechanisms that justify the possible impact of COVID-19 on male fertility. The main point of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells appears to be through the viral spike protein which permits entry into cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 receptor). In human testes, ACE2 is enriched in Sertoli and Leydig cells and spermatogonia. Also, it seems that there is a mild or severe cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19, and such changes may affect fertility. It should also be mentioned that the orchitis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have an important impact on fertility. Prolonged and high fever may lead to changes in testicular temperature and destroy germ cells. In general, there is little evidence for a definite conclusion, but there are facts that suggest that COVID-19 may affect male fertility. It is prudent for men of reproductive age who have recovered from COVID-19 to be evaluated for the presence of the virus in semen and fertility-related items. There is an urgent need to conduct quality studies on, in particular, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the fertility of recovered males.","Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Karimi, Leila; Makvandi, Somayeh; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,398

We present a case of an encephalopathic patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 with no pulmonary symptoms. We propose a three-tier risk stratification for CNS COVID-19 aiming to help clinicians to decide which patients should undergo CSF analysis. The neurological examination remains an integral component of screening and evaluating patients for COVID-19 considering the range of emerging CNS complications.","Ramakrishna, Jahanavi M; Libertin, Claudia R; Siegel, Jason; Binnicker, Matthew J; Harris, Dana; Matcha, Gautam V; Caulfield, Thomas; Freeman, W D",Rom. j. intern. med,,398

Its probabilistic foundation allows for a natural, yet not trivial, generalization of the approach to the matrix-valued setting, increasingly widespread, for example, in longitudinal and multivariate spatio-temporal studies. In this work we introduce nonparametric estimators of matrix-variate distributions based on kernel methods, and analyze their asymptotic properties. Additionally, we propose a generalization of the mean-shift procedure for the identification of the modes of the estimated density. Given the intrinsic high dimensionality of matrix-variate data, we discuss some locally adaptive solutions to handle the problem. We test the procedure via extensive simulations, also with respect to some competitors, and illustrate its performance through two high-dimensional real data applications.","Ferraccioli, Federico; Menardi, Giovanna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13440v1.pdf,398
358240,Analysis of pharmaceutical company websites using innovation diffusion theory and technology acceptance model,2021,"The current commercially available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic approaches including nucleic acid molecular assaying using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have many limitations and drawbacks. SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic strategies were reported to have a high false-negative rate and low sensitivity due to low viral antibodies or antigenic load in the specimens, that is why even PCR test is recommended to be repeated to overcome this problem. Thus, in anticipation of COVID-19 current wave and the upcoming waves, we should have an accurate and rapid diagnostic tool to control this pandemic. In this study, we developed a novel preanalytical strategy to be used for SARS-CoV-2 specimen enrichment to avoid misdiagnosis. This method depends on the immuno-affinity trapping of the viral target followed by in situ thermal precipitation and enrichment. We designed, synthesized, and characterized a thermal-responsive polymer poly (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-2-hydroxyisopropylacrylamide-co-strained alkyne isopropylacrylamide) followed by decoration with SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Different investigations approved the successful synthesis of the polymeric antibody conjugate. This conjugate was shown to enrich recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein samples to about 6 folds. This developed system succeeded in avoiding the misdiagnosis of low viral load specimens using the lateral flow immunoassay test. The strength of this work is that, to the best of our knowledge, this report may be the first to functionalize SARS-CoV-2 antibody to a thermo-responsive polymer for increasing its screening sensitivity during the current pandemic.","Nabil, Ahmed; Yoshihara, Erika; Hironaka, Keita; Hassan, Ayman A; Shiha, Gamal; Ebara, Mitsuhiro",,,398

361142,Special issue: 2018 Quebec elections,2020,"BACKGROUND: Lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a critical tool for evaluating patients with dyspnea in the emergency department (ED), including patients with suspected coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. However, given the threat of nosocomial disease spread, the use of ultrasound is no longer risk free. OBJECTIVE: Here, we review the lung POCUS findings in patients with COVID-19. In doing so we present a scanning protocol for lung POCUS in COVID-19 that maximizes clinical utility and provider safety. DISCUSSION: In COVID-19 lung, POCUS findings are predominantly located in the posterior and lateral lung zones bilaterally. A six-zone scanning protocol that prioritizes obtaining images in these locations optimizes provider positioning, and minimizes time spent scanning, which can reduce risk to health care workers performing POCUS. CONCLUSIONS: Lung POCUS can offer valuable clinical data when evaluating patients with COVID-19. Scanning protocols such as that presented here, which target clinical utility and decreased nosocomial disease spread, must be prioritized.","Duggan, Nicole M; Shokoohi, Hamid; Liteplo, Andrew S; Huang, Calvin; Goldsmith, Andrew J",J Emerg Med,,398

In this article we evaluate the current status of primary health care in the era of the Declaration of Astana, the sustainable development goals, universal health coverage and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We consider how best to guide greater application of the primary health care strategy, reflecting on tensions that remain between the political vision of primary health care and its implementation in countries. We also consider what is required to support countries to realize the aspirations of primary health care, arguing that national needs and action must dominate over global preoccupations. Changing contexts and realities need to be accommodated. A clear distinction is needed between primary health care as an inspirational vision and set of values for health development, and primary health care as policy and implementation space. To achieve this vision, political action is required. Stakeholders beyond the health sector will often need to lead, which is challenging because the concept of primary health care is poorly understood by other sectors. Efforts on primary health care as policy and implementation space might focus explicitly on primary care and the frontline of service delivery with clear links and support to complementary work on social determinants and building healthy societies. Such efforts can be partial but important implementation solutions to contribute to the much bigger political vision of primary health care.","Rasanathan, Kumanan; Evans, Tim G",Bull World Health Organ,,398

Considering the current pandemic, it's important to understand how COVID-19 impacts individuals with SCD, a medically vulnerable population. We sought to identify factors associated with more severe COVID-19 illness and hospitalization in the SCD population. We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect COVID-19 data in SCD patients. Providers were instructed to report confirmed COVID-19 cases after the disease course was known. Providers reported demographics, prior SCD complications and COVID-19 related hospitalization, severity/management strategies and death. Data were without protected health information. We used multivariable models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, SCD-related and non-related comorbidities grouped by organ systems on the outcomes of severe COVID-19 and hospitalization. We defined the pain variable as 0, 1-2 or &gt;2 prior acute care visits (i.e., emergency department visits, hospitalizations) for pain in the last 3 years. As of October 12th, 2020, 366 COVID-19 cases in SCD patients were reported, 41.5% were children and 52.7% were female. Acute pain was the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in SCD patients (54.6%), followed by pneumonia (27.0%). Children who had more than 2 acute care visits for pain had a more severe course of COVID-19 (OR=3.964, 95% CI (1.420, 11.065), p=0.03) and required hospitalization (OR=4.641, 95% CI (1.976, 10.900), p=0.006). Children who had 1-2 acute care visits for pain showed no significant association with COVID-19 severity (p=0.73) or hospitalization (p=0.82). In adults, there was no association between with history of frequent SCD pain and COVID outcomes. Pain is the most common presenting symptom of COVID-19 in SCD patients. Further, more than 2 prior acute care visits for pain is associated with severe COVID-19 course and hospitalization in children with SCD and not in adults.

Given the potential complexity of COVID-19 illnesses, a multifactorial causation is likely, but several studies have focused on infection-induced coagulopathy. Procoagulant states are commonly found in association with the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies. The correlation of the latter with thrombosis and/or clinical severity remains controversial. Although measures of antiphospholipid antibodies most commonly include assessments for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-ß2-glycoprotein-I antibodies, lesser common antibodies have been detected, and there remains speculation that other yet undiscovered autoimmune thrombotic events may yet be found. The recent discovery of post-vaccination thromboses associated with platelet factor 4 antibody has created another level of concern. The pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibodies and their role in COVID-19-related thrombosis deserves further attention. The multifactorial nature of thrombosis associated with both infection and vaccination should continue to be studied as new events unfold.

Immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG are commonly used to serologically diagnose COVID-19; however, the role of IgA is not well known. We aimed to quantify the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies, identify changes in them based on COVID-19 severity, and establish the significance of combined antibody detection. COVID-19 patients, divided into a severe and critical group and a moderate group, and non-COVID-19 patients with respiratory disease were included in this study. A chemiluminescence method was used to detect the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgA and IgG in the blood samples from the three groups. Epidemiological characteristics, symptoms, blood test results and other data were recorded for all patients. Compared to the traditional IgM-IgG combined antibodies, IgA-IgG combined antibodies are more effective for diagnosing COVID-19. During the disease process, IgA appeared first and disappeared last. All three antibodies had significantly higher levels in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients. IgA and IgG were also higher for severe and critical disease than for moderate disease. All antibodies were at or near low levels at the time of tracheal extubation in critical patients. Detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific combined IgA-IgG antibodies is advantageous in diagnosing COVID-19. IgA detection is suitable during early and late stages of the disease. IgA and IgG levels correspond to disease severity.","Huang, Z; Chen, H; Xue, M; Huang, H; Zheng, P; Luo, W; Liang, X; Sun, B; Zhong, N",Clin Exp Immunol,,398

In this study, we aim to clarify the frequency of false-positive reactions and reveal their details in SARS-CoV-2 quantitative antigen test using an automated laboratory device. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab samples (n = 4992) and saliva samples (n = 5430) were collected. We measured their SARS-CoV-2 antigen using Lumipulse® Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and performed a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) using the Ampdirect&#8482; 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit as needed. The results obtained from each detection test were compared accordingly. RESULTS: There were 304 nasopharyngeal samples and 114 saliva samples were positive in the Lumipulse® Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag test. All positive nasopharyngeal samples in the antigen test were also positive for NAAT. In contrast, only three (2.6%) of all the positive saliva samples in the antigen test were negative for NAAT. One showed no linearity with a dilute solution in the dilution test. Additionally, the quantitative antigen levels of all the three samples did not decrease after reaction with the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. CONCLUSIONS: The judgment difference between the quantitative antigen test and NAAT seemed to be caused by non-specific reactions in the antigen test. Although the high positive and negative predictive value of this quantitative antigen test could be confirmed, we should consider the possibility of false-positives caused by non-specific reactions and understand the characteristics of antigen testing. We recommend that repeating centrifugation before measurement, especially in saliva samples, should be performed appropriately.","Kobayashi, Ryo; Murai, Ryosei; Moriai, Mikako; Nirasawa, Shinya; Yonezawa, Hitoshi; Kondoh, Takashi; Saeki, Masachika; Yakuwa, Yuki; Sato, Yuki; Katayama, Yuki; Nakafuri, Hirotaka; Kitayama, Ikumi; Asanuma, Koichi; Fujiya, Yoshihiro; Takahashi, Satoshi",J Infect Chemother,,398

Historical trends in Quebec and implications for Canada"", we assessed public health investments since the establishment of the Nova Scotia provincial health authority in 2015. We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015-2016 to 2019-2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5-6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015-2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health work, and the need for a pandemic recovery plan that prioritizes investment in all areas of public health in Nova Scotia.","Caldwell, Hilary A T; Scruton, Sarah; Fierlbeck, Katherine; Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Dave, Shivani; Sim, S Meaghan; Kirk, Sara F L",Can J Public Health,,398

Methods: This study included 25 patients with COVID-19 (Group 1) and 25 healthy subjects (Group 2). The diameters of peripapillary temporal and nasal retinal arteries and veins were measured at baseline and at 4 months after remission. Results: The baseline diameters of the inferior temporal vein and the artery were increased in group 1 compared to controls (p = .007 and p = .041, respectively). There was also an increase in the diameters of the inferior and superior nasal veins and arteries in group 1 at baseline (p = .001, p = .019, p = .037, and p = .008, respectively). Retinal vessel diameters decreased after remission in all quadrants in comparison to baseline measurements (all p < .05). Conclusion: Increased retinal vessel diameters were measured in COVID-19 patients during the disease. Measurement of retinal vessel diameters may be a noninvasive method of estimating the vascular risk.","Asikgarip, Nazife; Temel, Emine; Hizmali, Lokman; Örnek, Kemal; Sezgin, Fikriye Milletli",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,,398

381869,Learning the language of viral evolution and escape,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has now been declared as a worldwide pandemic. Currently, no drugs have been endorsed for its treatment; in this manner, a pressing need has been developed for any antiviral drugs that will treat COVID-19. Coronaviruses require the SARS-CoV-2 3CL-Protease (3CL-protease) for cleavage of its polyprotein to yield a single useful protein and assume a basic role in the disease progression. In this study, we demonstrated that punicalagin, the fundamental active element of pomegranate in addition to the combination of punicalagin with zinc (Zn) II, appear to show powerful inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3CL protease assay kit was used to quantify 3CL protease action. The tetrazolium dye, MTS, was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Punicalagin showed inhibitory action against the 3CL-protease in a dose-dependent manner, and IC50 was found to be 6.192 µg/ml for punicalagin. Punicalagin (10 µg/mL) demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity toward 3CL-protease activity (p < 0.001), yet when punicalagin is combined with zinc sulfate monohydrate (punicalagin/Zn-II) extremely strong 3CL-protease activity (p < 0.001) was obtained. The action of 3CL-protease with punicalagin/Zn-II was decreased by approximately 4.4-fold in contrast to only punicalagin (10 µg/mL). Likewise, we did not notice any significant cytotoxicity caused by punicalagin, Zn-II, or punicalagin/Zn-II. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that these compounds could be used as potential antiviral drugs against COVID-19.","Saadh, M J; Almaaytah, A M; Alaraj, M; Dababneh, M F; Sa039,; adeh, I; Aldalaen, S M; Kharshid, A M; Alboghdadly, A; Hailat, M; Khaleel, A; Al-Hamaideh, K D; Abu Dayyih, W",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,398

Taking advantage of versatility and rapid development, three SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials with a two-dose immunization regimen. However, the waning antibody response in convalescent patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the emergence of human re-infection have raised widespread concerns about a possible short duration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection. Here, we developed a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine in lipid-encapsulated form that encoded the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, termed as mRNA-RBD. A single immunization of mRNA-RBD elicited both robust neutralizing antibody and cellular responses, and conferred a near-complete protection against wild SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of hACE2 transgenic mice. Noticeably, the high levels of neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice induced by mRNA-RBD vaccination were maintained for at least 6.5 months and conferred a long-term notable protection for hACE2 transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a sera transfer study. These data demonstrated that a single dose of mRNA-RBD provided long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.","Huang, Qingrui; Ji, Kai; Tian, Siyu; Wang, Fengze; Huang, Baoying; Tong, Zhou; Tan, Shuguang; Hao, Junfeng; Wang, Qihui; Tan, Wenjie; Gao, George F; Yan, Jinghua",Nat Commun,,398

Specifically, the rationale for high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning in early COVID-19 ARDS has been questioned. Methods: The first 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure transferred to a single ICU were assessed. Eight were excluded: five were not invasively ventilated and three received veno-venous ECMO support. The remaining 15 were assessed over the first 15 days of mechanical ventilation. Best PEEP was defined by maximal oxygenation and was determined by structured decremental PEEP trials comprising the monitoring of oxygenation, airway pressures and trans-pulmonary pressures. In nine patients the impact of prone positioning on oxygenation was investigated. Additionally, the effects of high PEEP and prone positioning on pulmonary opacities in serial chest x-rays were determined by applying a semiquantitative scoring-system. This investigation is part of the prospective observational PA-COVID-19 study. Findings: Patients responded to initiation of invasive high PEEP ventilation with markedly improved oxygenation, which was accompanied by reduced pulmonary opacities within 6 h of mechanical ventilation. Decremental PEEP trials confirmed the need for high PEEP (17.9 (SD ± 3.9) mbar) for optimal oxygenation, while driving pressures remained low. Prone positioning substantially increased oxygenation (p<0.01). Interpretation: In early COVID-19 ARDS, substantial PEEP values were required for optimizing oxygenation. Pulmonary opacities resolved during mechanical ventilation with high PEEP suggesting recruitment of lung volume.

We show that humans have always been exposed to nanoparticles and dust from natural sources and human activities, the recent development of industry and combustion-based engine transportation profoundly increasing anthropogenic nanoparticulate pollution. The key to understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles is that their minute size, smaller than cells and cellular organelles, allows them to penetrate these basic biological structures, disrupting their normal function. Among diseases associated with nanoparticles are asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson`s and Alzheimer`s diseases), Crohn`s disease, colon cancer. Nanoparticles that enter the circulatory system are related to occurrence of arteriosclerosis, and blood clots, arrhythmia, heart diseases, and ultimately cardiac death. We show that possible adverse effects of nanoparticles on human health depend on individual factors such as genetics and existing disease, as well as exposure, and nanoparticle chemistry, size, shape, and agglomeration state. The faster we will understand their causes and mechanisms, the more likely we are to find cures for diseases associated with nanoparticle exposure. We foresee a future with better-informed, and hopefully more cautious manipulation of engineered nanomaterials, as well as the development of laws and policies for safely managing all aspects of nanomaterial manufacturing, industrial and commercial use, and recycling.","Buzea, Cristina; Pacheco, Ivan I.; Robbie, Kevin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.3280v1.pdf,398

The COVID-19 pandemic has played serious havoc on economic activities throughout the world. Researchers are immensely curious about how to give the best protection to people before a vaccine becomes available. The coronavirus spreads principally through saliva droplets. Thus, it would be a great opportunity if the virus spread could be controlled at an early stage. The face mask can limit virus spread from both inside and outside the mask. This is the first study that has endeavoured to explore the design and fabrication of an antiviral face mask using licorice root extract, which has antimicrobial properties due to glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and glycyrrhizin (GL). An electrospinning process was utilized to fabricate nanofibrous membrane and virus deactivation mechanisms discussed. The nanofiber mask material was characterized by SEM and airflow rate testing. SEM results indicated that the nanofibers from electrospinning are about 15-30 µm in diameter with random porosity and orientation which have the potential to capture and kill the virus. Theoretical estimation signifies that an 85 L/min rate of airflow through the face mask is possible which ensures good breathability over an extensive range of pressure drops and pore sizes. Finally, it can be concluded that licorice root membrane may be used to produce a biobased face mask to control COVID-19 spread.","Chowdhury, Mohammad Asaduzzaman; Shuvho, Md Bengir Ahmed; Shahid, Md Abdus; Haque, A K M Monjurul; Kashem, Mohammod Abul; Lam, Su Shiung; Ong, Hwai Chyuan; Uddin, Md Alhaz; Mofijur, M",Environ Res,,398

Additionally, older adults have reduced vaccination responses. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the increased mortality rate in older adults for infectious disease, and brought vaccine development to the forefront. The speed of vaccine development was met with an equally impressive vaccine efficacy. Interestingly, both mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines currently available have shown similar efficacy in both young and older adults. mRNA vaccine production has significantly reduced the production timeline compared to current influenza vaccines, making them particularly attractive for influenza vaccine development.

However, the impact of this inequitable distribution on COVID-19 outcomes is unknown. This observational study determined the association between zip-code level vaccination rate and COVID-19 mortality in residents of 52 Chicago zip codes. After controlling for age distribution and recovery from infection, a 10% higher vaccination rate by March 28, 2021, was associated with a 39% lower relative risk of death during the peak of the spring wave of COVID-19. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, Chicago could have prevented an estimated 72% of deaths in the least vaccinated quartile of the city (vaccination rates of 17.8 - 26.9%) if it had had the same vaccination rate as the most vaccinated quartile (39.9 - 49.3%).

COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and leads to respiratory dysfunction. Studies on hemostatic parameters have showed that COVID-19 significantly affects the disruption of the coagulation system and may contribute to coagulation and thrombotic events. A relevant cause of hemostasis disorders is inflammation and cytokine storms, which cause, for example, endothelial dysfunction in blood vessels. In order to prevent and treat states of hypercoagulability and thrombosis, the administration of anticoagulants, e.g., heparin, is recommended. The present mini-review describes the relationship between hemostasis and COVID-19, and discusses whether this relationship may cast light on the nature of COVID-19. The present short manuscript also examines the relationship between blood platelets and COVID-19. In addition, the paper explores the potential use of antiplatelet drugs in COVID-19 cases.

We examined correlates of smoking status, level, and importance and confidence regarding quitting among 608 MSM in the country of Georgia recruited in June-September, 2016 (493 without HIV via peer referral in 3 Georgian cities; 115 with HIV via the National AIDS Center). Median age was 26 years, 78.6% reported current (past 30-day) alcohol use, and 22.4% reported past-year illicit drug use. Overall, 73.8% reported current smoking; of these, 87.1% smoked daily, mean cigarettes per day (cpd) was 19.8, 64.6% smoked &#8804;30 min of waking, and mean quitting importance and confidence were 6.8 and 6.4 (0 = not at all to 10 = extremely), respectively. Multivariable analyses indicated that current smoking correlated with past-month alcohol and past-year illicit drug use (p's < .001). Among smokers, cpd correlated with being older and smoking within 30 min of waking; greater quitting importance (&#8805;7) correlated with higher education and no illicit substance use; and greater quitting confidence (&#8805;7) was associated with fewer cpd, smoking &#8804;30 min of waking, and regional versus capital city residence.

403517,Applications of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques in disease outbreak prediction – A review,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Metastatic bladder cancer is an aggressive disease that can often be difficult to diagnose and stage with conventional cross-sectional imaging. The primary objective of this study was to determine the clinical value of fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI for surveillance and restaging of patients with muscle-invasive, locally advanced, and metastatic bladder cancer compared to conventional imaging methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled patients with muscle-invasive, locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer in a single institute evaluated with 18F-FDG PET/MRI. All patients also underwent conventional imaging with CT. Additional imaging may also have included 18F-FDG PET/CT (18F-FDG PET), or sodium fluoride (NaF) PET/CT in some patients. Images were reviewed by a diagnostic radiologist/nuclear medicine physician. Number of lesions and sites of disease were captured and compared between 18F-FDG PET/MRI and conventional imaging. Lesions were confirmed by sequential imaging or lesion biopsy. All patients were followed for survival. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (4 for surveillance; 11 for restaging) underwent 34 18F-FDG PET/MRI scans. Each patient received a corresponding conventional CT around the time of the 18F-FDG PET/MRI (median 6 days). The 15 patients (11 male; 4 female) had a median age of 61.5 years (range 37-73) and histologies of urothelial carcinoma (nâ¯=â¯13) and small-cell carcinoma of the bladder (nâ¯=â¯2) diagnosed as stage 4 (nâ¯=â¯13), stage 3 (nâ¯=â¯1), or stage 2 (nâ¯=â¯1). 18F-FDG PET/MRI detected 82 metastatic malignant lesions involving lymph nodes (nâ¯=â¯22), liver (nâ¯=â¯10), lung (nâ¯=â¯34), soft tissue (nâ¯=â¯12), adrenal glands (nâ¯=â¯1), prostate (nâ¯=â¯1), and bone (nâ¯=â¯2) with a resultant advantage of 36% for lesion visibility in comparison with CT. Serial imaging or biopsy confirmed these lesions as malignant. CONCLUSION: 18F-FDG PET/MRI can detect metastatic lesions which cannot be identified on conventional CT, and this can allow for better treatment planning and improved disease monitoring during therapy.","Civelek, Ali Cahid; Niglio, Scot A; Malayeri, Ashkan A; Lin, Jeffrey; Gurram, Sandeep; Chalfin, Heather J; Turkbey, Baris; Valera, Vladimir; Steinberg, Seth M; Apolo, Andrea B",Urol. oncol,,398

Direct contact with the patients could create some psychological problems in this group. Thus, the prevalence of such problems must be investigated in them. The present study aimed to determine the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among the healthcare staff in Zanjan City, Iran, during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: This descriptive study has a cross-sectional design. The Sample of the study population consisted of 535 Staff healthcare members of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Zanjan City, Iran. A sample of 200 of medical staff was randomly selected to participate in the present study. The required data were collected using the electronic version of Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) tool. Descriptive statistics, as well as the inferential statistics (the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi, and Cramer's correlation tests), were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS. Results: The mean age of the study participants was 40.60 years. The mean values of depression, anxiety, and stress in study samples were 6.27, 5.38, and 8.41, respectively. There was a significant relation between gender and variables of depression, anxiety, and stress. There was also an inverse relationship between stress and variables of educational level and age (P&lt;0/05). Conclusion: We found that our sample reported a normal degree of Depression, anxiety, and stress. The extent of stress induced by direct contact with patients was higher in female employees. Furthermore, with the increase in the education and age of the employees, their stress level decreased.","Hosseinzadeh-Shanjani, Zarintaj; Hajimiri, Khadijeh; Rostami, Bahram; Ramazani, Shokoufeh; Dadashi, Mohsen",Basic Clin.

406125,Supercomputing Pipelines Search for Therapeutics Against COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the presented study is to analyze the respiratory and functional effects of a rehabilitation program in patients affected by hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to COVID-19, in comparison with the group treated with standard of care, at discharge endpoint. The secondary objectives of the presented study are to evaluate different outcomes of the rehabilitation program in comparison to standard of care regarding: functional performance at 4-week and 12-week post- discharge mark; health-related quality of life, the impact on the health services (namely days of hospitalization), the cost-effectiveness of the intervention proposed. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-arm clinical trial of treatment, with an allocation ratio 1:1 and framework of superiority. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted at Centro Hospitalar Entre Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Potential participants will be adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) hospitalized in ICU with respiratory insufficiency due to COVID-19, who are referred to respiratory and functional rehabilitation. Only patients approved by physical rehabilitation doctors to perform respiratory and functional rehabilitation will be considered potential participants. To be eligible for inclusion participants must have been independent in their activities of daily living before the onset of critical illness (verbal statement by their proxy) and have to meet the safety criteria defined by the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Both groups will receive usual medical and nursing care in the ICU, which involves assessment and treatment of the respiratory system and may include positioning, hyperinflation techniques and suctioning. The physical function of the patient is assessed, and active bed exercises and mobility are encouraged as soon as possible and may include sitting out of bed. The intervention group will receive a functional and respiratory multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol (that includes medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions) during their entire hospital stay. After reassurance that the patients fulfil the safety criteria, they will initiate the rehabilitation protocol, individualized to each patient based on the clinical status. The rehabilitation interventions and exercises implemented will be consistent with recommendations from the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. The intervention will occur 6 days per week (Monday to Saturday), fifteen minutes, twice per day for each participant. Throughout all activities, progression will be increased successively, depending on the individual's tolerance and stability. After discharge, the intervention group will continue with rehabilitation exercises, prescribed by physical rehabilitation doctors. These exercises are designed for the patient to do at home, and then report their execution to rehabilitation nurses through teleconsultation, until 12 weeks after ICU discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES: Baseline descriptive data collection will include age, sex, comorbidities and date of admission to ICU. The need of mechanical ventilation and length of use, as well as the need for oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay (days/hours), incidence of ICU readmission, discharge destination and survival will also be recorded. Prior to intervention, every two days and at discharge, participants will be evaluated using the following scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment, 5 standardized questions for cooperation, Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test and Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. At discharge, Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will be evaluated. The primary outcome measure will be functional capacity using the 6-Minute Walk Test, and it will be measured at discharge and at the 4-week and 12-week mark. Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test, Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will also be re-evaluated at the 4-week and 12-week mark. The health related quality of life will also be used as an outcome measure, using the 12-Item Short Form Survey, at 12 weeks of follow-up. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be divided into two groups, standard care and intervention, by means of balanced randomization at a 1:1 ratio using blocks of 10 participants. The randomization sequence is going to be created using a free software ( http://www.randomized.org/ ). In order to ensure the confidentiality of the randomisation sequence, this process will be conducted by an assessor external to the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The evaluators in the study will be blinded during the entire process. The evaluators will be unaware of the study objectives and the randomized distribution of patients to study groups and will not have access to the randomization sequence. Although blinding for patients will not be possible to achieve completely, subjects will be unaware of other treatment modalities, and they will not know if they belong to the intervention or standard group. As for the treating physiotherapists and ICU staff, blinding will not be possible to achieve, but they will not be responsible for assessing outcomes. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We plan to randomise 40 participants to each group. 80 participants in total. TRIAL STATUS: This is the second and definitive protocol version, dated from 26th February 2021. Recruitment started on 8th March 2021. Participants will be recruited between March 8, 2021, and June 8, 2021. Study completion is expected to be October 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ReBEC RBR-7rvhpq9 .

406299,We Can Detect Your Bias: Predicting the Political Ideology of News Articles,2020-10-11,"Billions of cells undergo turnover and die via apoptosis throughout our lifetime. A prompt clearance of these apoptotic cells and debris by phagocytic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, is important in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, impaired efferocytosis due to the defective clearance and disrupted stages can lead to a growing number of inflammation- and immune-related diseases. Although numerous studies have shown the mechanisms of efferocytosis, its role in disorders, such as non-tumor and tumor diseases, remains poorly understood. This review summarizes the processes and signal molecules in efferocytosis, and efferocytosis-related functions in non-tumor (atherosclerosis, lung diseases, etc.) and tumor diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc.), as well as describes the role of involved cytokines. Of note, there is a dual role of efferocytosis in the abovementioned disorders, and a paradoxical effect among non-tumor and tumor diseases in terms of inflammation resolution, immune response, and disease progression. Briefly, intact efferocytosis and cytokines promote tissue repair, while they contribute to tumor progression via tumor microenvironment and macrophage politzerization. Additionally, this review provides potential targets associated with TAM receptors and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor &#945; - and CXCL5, suggesting potential novel therapeutic ways in treating diseases.","Lin, Danfeng; Kang, Xiaodiao; Shen, Lu; Tu, Sheng; Lenahan, Cameron; Chen, Yiding; Wang, Xiaochen; Shao, Anwen",,,398

In this period, radical changes in business relations, working style, and consumer behaviors have forced businesses to seek different management strategies. Based on the idea that the changes that occur will leave permanent marks in many ways, it is expected that all functions of businesses will be digitalized due to the digital transformation required by the post-pandemic period defined as the ""new normal"". Business Administration departments and business education at universities play an important role in making students ready for this new era, and in making them become a part and even pioneers of this transformation after graduation. Accordingly, the curricula of the Business Departments where future manager candidates are trained should be revised and converted into new systems, in the process of adaptation to the digital society. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to determine the extent the courses are included for digitalization in the Business Administration departments' curricula which are traditionally a subdivision of the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. The curricula, and the core and elective courses of all Business Administration departments in Turkish universities that were active in 2020 were reviewed, and a descriptive research was conducted on the courses regarding their digitalization through the departmental websites. It was found out that although inclusion of digital transformation courses has begun in the Business Administration programs in Turkey, this inclusion has not been widespread.

Methods: We surveyed U.S. transplant programs to assess practices, strategies and barriers to living LDKT during the COVID-19 pandemic. After IRB approval, the survey was distributed 5/9/20-5/30/20 by email and postings to professional society list-servs. Responses were stratified based on state COVID-19 cumulative incidence levels. Results: Staff at 118 unique centers responded, representing 61% of U.S. living donor recovery programs and 75% of LKDT volume in the pre-pandemic year. Overall, 66% reported LDKT surgery was on hold (81% in ""high"" vs. 49% in ""low"" COVID-19 cumulative incidence states). Thirty-six percent reported that evaluation of new donor candidates had paused, 27% reported evaluations were very decreased (>0% to <25% typical) and 23% reported evaluations were moderately decreased (25% to <50% typical). Barriers to LDKT surgery included program concerns for donor (85%) and recipient (75%) safety, patients concerns (56%), elective case restrictions (47%) and hospital administrative restrictions (48%). Programs with higher local COVID-19 cumulative incidence reported more barriers related to staff and resource diversion. Most centers continuing donor evaluations used remote strategies (video 82%; telephone 43%). As LDKT resumes, all programs will screen for COVID-19, although timeframe and modalities vary. Recommendations for pre-surgical self-quarantine are also variable. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had broad impacts on LDKT practice. Ongoing research and consensus-building are needed to reduce barriers, guide optimal practices, and support safe restoration of LDKT across centers.","Lentine, Krista L; Vest, Luke; Schnitzler, Mark A; Mannon, Roslyn B; Kumar, Vineeta; Doshi, Mona D; Cooper, Matthew; Mandelbrot, Didier A; Harhay, Meera N; Josephson, Michelle A; Caliskan, Yasar; Sharfuddin, Asif; Kasiske, Bertram L; Axelrod, David A",,,398

Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in Iran. The research method is library type which was done during 2 months by using valid scientific sources and books. More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increases the risk of developing stress.","Kamran, A.; Malekpour, A.; Naeim, M.",Addictive Disorders and their Treatment,,398

Aim: This manuscript describes the system development, collaborative efforts and the challenges encountered in developing an in-house clinical intelligence dashboard. Methods: Through a longitudinal, interdepartmental collaboration, a COVID-19 clinical intelligence dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI and Cerner Computer Language (CCL) to demonstrate clinical severity of patients and patient location in a single screen. A color-coding schema was applied to produce a red highlight for patients whose condition is deteriorating, whether due to increasing oxygen demand or worsening laboratory values. An additional function enabled users to drill down into the patient's clinical and laboratory parameters for the past 5 days, and ultimately to the respective patient chart for further assessment. Results: The development of an in-house clinical intelligence dashboard is a feasible, effective tool to allow frontline clinicians to monitor patient status in multiple wards and proactively intervene as clinically necessary and transfer patients to the appropriate level of care. Comparing the 30 days before and 30 days after the implementation of the dashboard, the percentage of patients who required urgent intubation or cardiac resuscitation on the general medical ward, rather than a critical care setting, declined by over 50% (8 out of 34, 33% vs. 7 out of 55, 13%; two-tailed p < 0.05 by Fisher's exact test; OR 3.43; CI 1.07 to 10.95). Conclusion: The dashboard has enabled physicians to efficiently assess patient volumes and case severity to prioritize clinical care and appropriately allocate scarce resources. The dashboard can be replicated by developing healthcare systems that are continuing to grapple with the pandemic.","Ibrahim, Halah; Sorrell, Sara; Nair, Satish Chandrasekhar; Al Romaithi, Ahmed; Al Mazrouei, Shamma; Kamour, Ashraf",Acta Inform Med,,398

416402,Scientists want virtual meetings to stay after the COVID pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: There are specific physiological features regarding the immunity and coagulation among pregnant women, which may play important roles in the development of coronavirus disease 2019. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the key factors associated with the deterioration of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and the differentiating clinical characteristics of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 to interfere with the progression of coronavirus disease 2019. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 539 Chinese Han adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was conducted, of which 36 cases were pregnant women. In addition, 36 pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019 were recruited as the control. The characteristics of severe and critical illnesses, which were differentiated from mild and moderate illnesses in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, were analyzed using a machine learning algorithm. In addition, major differences between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and age-matched nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, paired with pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019, were explored to identify specific physiological features of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: For the total patient population, the lymphocyte, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD16+CD56+ cell counts were significantly lower, and white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were higher in those with severe or critical illness than those with mild or moderate illness (P<.001). The plasma levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and interleukin-6-to-interleukin-10 ratio were significantly increased in patients with critical illness compared with patients with mild, moderate, and severe illnesses (P<.001). The above immunologic coclusters achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.801 (95% confidence interval, 0.764-0.838), and its combined model with the coagulation and fibrinolysis indices (prothrombin time, D-dimer) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.815 (95% confidence interval, 0.779-0.851) using the random forest regression model to predict severe or critical illness. For pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, none had preexisting diseases. Compared with nonpregnant women with mild or moderate coronavirus disease 2019, pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 displayed increased white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen, along with decreased lymphocyte and interleukin-4 levels (P<.05). Although they presented similar changes of immunologic markers of lymphocyte; white blood cell count; neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+CD56+ cell counts; and interleukin-6-to-interleukin-10 ratio, compared with nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, none of the pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 deteriorated into severe or critical illness. There was no significant difference in white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, immunologic markers, or coagulation and fibrinolysis markers between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and pregnant women without coronavirus disease 2019. As for the discrepancy of pathophysiological features between pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 and nonpregnant women with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the immunologic markers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.875 (95% confidence interval, 0.773-0.977), and its combined model with coagulation and fibrinolysis indices achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.931 (95% confidence interval, 0.850-1.000). CONCLUSION: Immune dysregulation was identified as a crucial feature of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, which developed severe or critical illness, and pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 presented with similar immune responses but rarer incidences of severe or critical illness. Immune dysregulation is related to the risks of deterioration into severe or critical illness. The specific coagulation and fibrinolysis systems of pregnancy may reduce the risk of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 without preexisting disease from developing severe illness.","Zhong, Yajuan; Cao, Yacong; Zhong, Xiaozhu; Peng, Zhihang; Jiang, Sushi; Tang, Tiantian; Chen, Hai; Li, Xiaojia; Xia, Yankai; Cheng, Yanxiang; Zhao, Xiaomiao",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,398

416606,Machine learning-based prediction of COVID-19 diagnosis based on symptoms,2021,"Purpose of review: Within the last two decades several members of the Coronaviridae family namely Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated epidemic potential. In late, 2019 an unnamed genetic relative, later named SARS-CoV-2 realized its potential in the highly populous neighborhoods of Wuhan, China. Unchecked, the virus rapidly spread among interconnected communities and related households before containment measures could be in acted. ""Appropriate"" diagnostic testing in response to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak should be urgently considered. This perspective review gives particular attention to the potential diagnostic testing of the virus in semen and seminal fluids due to its high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) precursor. Recent findings: As many infectious viruses are stable in semen and have transmitted the respective diseases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 should be tested in semen to assess their stabilities and half-life. As in case of Ebola virus, it was present in semen for longer period in a carrier man without any symptom. Additional hypothesis is that since ACE2 could serve as a mediator for the endocytosis of the previously SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 may enter the cells through similar mechanism. From the protein expression atlas, high levels of ACE2 precursor were found in intestines and testis. Hence, the testis and seminal fluids could be the host cell and/or reservoir. The results could be used as a suggestive guideline for the sexual activities after the discharge or declaration of disease free.","Vo, Van Giau; Bagyinszky, Eva; Shim, Kyuhwan; Park, Yoon Soo; An, Seong Soo A",Mol Cell Toxicol,,398

The objectives of this systematic review were to determine the GI manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 and to evaluate their role as risk factors for a severe clinical course. METHODS: : A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed and Scopus for studies published before 31 December 2020 with information about the GI manifestations of pediatric COVID-19. Patients with a severe and nonsevere clinical course were compared using the inverse variance heterogeneity model and odds ratio (OR) as the effect size. A sensitivity analysis was performed if the heterogeneity was high among studies. RESULTS: A total of 811 studies were identified through a systematic search of which 55 studies (4369 patients) were included in this systematic review. The commonest GI symptoms were diarrhea-19.08% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.6-28.2], nausea/vomiting 19.7% (95% CI 7.8-33.2) and abdominal pain 20.3% (95% CI 3.7-40.4). The presence of diarrhea was significantly associated with a severe clinical course with a pooled OR of 3.97 (95% CI 1.80-8.73; p < 0.01). Abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting were not associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea, nausea/vomiting or abdominal pain are present in nearly one-fifth of all children with COVID-19. The presence of diarrhea portends a severe clinical course.","Bolia, Rishi; Dhanesh Goel, Akhil; Badkur, Mayank; Jain, Vidhi",J. trop. pedriatr,,398

418433,Mathematical analysis of spread and control of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) in China,2020,"Although ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) is considered the primary receptor for CoV-2 cell entry, recent reports suggest that alternative pathways may contribute. This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways, with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes, endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance, binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state, perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets, could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virion-integrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors, including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding, resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant, B.1.1.7 (or VUI 202012/01), includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement, N501Y, that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins, with consequent clinical impacts.","Makowski, Lee; Olson-Sidford, William; W-Weisel, John",Viruses,,398

Using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we have uncovered that, in addition to the prefusion structure determined by cryo-EM, this protein adopts an alternative conformation that interconverts slowly with the canonical prefusion structure. This new conformation--an open trimer-- contains easily accessible RBDs. It exposes the conserved trimer interface buried in the prefusion conformation, thus exposing potential epitopes for pan-coronavirus antibody and ligand recognition. The population of this state and kinetics of interconversion are modulated by temperature, receptor binding, antibody binding, and sequence variants observed in the natural population. Knowledge of the structure and populations of this conformation will help improve existing diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

We report findings from a survey among HCWs in three counties in Kenya. METHODS: We recruited 684 HCWs from Kilifi (rural), Busia (rural) and Nairobi (urban) counties. The serosurvey was conducted between 30th July 2020 and 4th December 2020. We tested for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using ELISA. Assay sensitivity and specificity were 93% (95% CI 88-96%) and 99% (95% CI 98-99.5%), respectively. We adjusted prevalence estimates using Bayesian modeling to account for assay performance. RESULTS: Crude overall seroprevalence was 19.7% (135/684). After adjustment for assay performance seroprevalence was 20.8% (95% CrI 17.5-24.4%). Seroprevalence varied significantly (p<0.001) by site: 43.8% (CrI 35.8-52.2%) in Nairobi, 12.6% (CrI 8.8-17.1%) in Busia and 11.5% (CrI 7.2-17.6%) in Kilifi. In a multivariable model controlling for age, sex and site, professional cadre was not associated with differences in seroprevalence. CONCLUSION: These initial data demonstrate a high seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs in Kenya. There was significant variation in seroprevalence by region, but not by cadre.","Etyang, Anthony O; Lucinde, Ruth; Karanja, Henry; Kalu, Catherine; Mugo, Daisy; Nyagwange, James; Gitonga, John; Tuju, James; Wanjiku, Perpetual; Karani, Angela; Mutua, Shadrack; Maroko, Hosea; Nzomo, Eddy; Maitha, Eric; Kamuri, Evanson; Kaugiria, Thuranira; Weru, Justus; Ochola, Lucy B; Kilimo, Nelson; Charo, Sande; Emukule, Namdala; Moracha, Wycliffe; Mukabi, David; Okuku, Rosemary; Ogutu, Monicah; Angujo, Barrack; Otiende, Mark; Bottomley, Christian; Otieno, Edward; Ndwiga, Leonard; Nyaguara, Amek; Voller, Shirine; Agoti, Charles; Nokes, David James; Ochola-Oyier, Lynette Isabella; Aman, Rashid; Amoth, Patrick; Mwangangi, Mercy; Kasera, Kadondi; Ng039,; ang039,; a, Wangari; Adetifa, Ifedayo; Kagucia, E Wangeci; Gallagher, Katherine; Uyoga, Sophie; Tsofa, Benjamin; Barasa, Edwine; Bejon, Philip; Scott, J Anthony G; Agweyu, Ambrose; Warimwe, George",Clin. infect. dis,,398

Methods: A case-control study was conducted on the Saudi Arabian population during September 2020. The data were collected from recovered COVID-19 participants as the case group, and healthy volunteers as the control group. Results: The data showed that 42.2% (n = 315) of recovered COVID-19 cases were more willing to participate in the COVID-19 vaccine trial than healthy volunteers (299; 38.1%) with a p < 0.001. The proportion of the participants who were willing to donate plasma was significantly higher among recovered participants, 84.2% (n = 112), than healthy volunteers, 76.3% (n = 87), with a p < 0.0001. The most significant factor responsible for a willingness to participate was the belief that vaccine discovery would help scientific developments (r = 0.525 and 0.465 for case and control, respectively). In comparison, significant reasons behind the unwillingness to participate were the risk of exposure to an unproven vaccine, r = 0.377 and 0.497 for case and control, respectively (p < 0.001), and a discomfort with being treated as an experimental subject (r = 0.275 and 0.374 for case and control, respectively). Conclusions: The differences in readiness toward the COVID-19 vaccine trial in our study does not indicate any passive exposure of participants to an unproven clinical trial vaccine, nor does it shed light on well-informed risk-related decisions. However, certain factors can significantly influence decision-making while contributing toward clinical research. This study's results must not be used for the individuals' recruitment bias in a COVID-19 vaccine trial.","Felemban, Rania M; Tashkandi, Emad M; Mohorjy, Doaa K",,,398

423923,Customer Centricity in Medical Affairs Needs Human-centric Artificial Intelligence,2021,"Global berry production and consumption have significantly increased in recent years, coinciding with increased consumer awareness of the health-promoting benefits of berries. Among them, fresh market blackberries and raspberries are primarily harvested by hand to maintain post-harvest quality. However, fresh market berry harvesting is an arduous, costly endeavor that accounts for up to 50% of the worker hours. Additionally, the inconsistent forces applied during hand-harvesting can result in an 85% loss of marketable berries due to red drupelet reversion (RDR). Herein, we present a novel, tendon-driven soft robotic gripper with active contact force feedback control, which leverages the passive compliance of the gripper for the gentle harvesting of blackberries. The versatile gripper was able to apply a desired force as low as 0.5 N with a mean error of 0.046 N, while also holding payloads that produce forces as high as 18 N. Field test results indicate that the gripper is capable of harvesting berries with minimal berry damage, while maintaining a harvesting reliability of 95% and a harvesting rate of approximately 4.8 seconds per berry.","Gunderman, Anthony L.; Collins, Jeremy; Myer, Andrea; Threlfall, Renee; Chen, Yue",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04270v1.pdf,398

Through an online survey, we demonstrated variable adherence to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) PPE guidelines among health care personnel (HCP). METHODS: CDC guidelines for optimal and acceptable PPE usage in common situations faced by frontline healthcare workers were referenced to create a short online survey. The survey was distributed to national, statewide, and local professional organizations across the United States and to HCP using a snowball sampling technique. Responses were collected between June 15 and July 17, 2020. RESULTS: 2245 responses were received from doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, and medical technicians in 44 states. Eight states with n>20 (Arizona, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington) and a total of 436 responses are included in the quantitative analysis. Adherence to CDC guidelines was observed to be highest in the scenario of patient contact when COVID was not suspected (86.47%) and lowest when carrying out aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) (42.47%). CONCLUSIONS: Further research is urgently needed to identify the reasons underlying variability between professions and regions to pinpoint strategies for maximizing adherence and improving the safety of HCPs.","Darwish, Oliver A; Aggarwal, Ayushi; Karvar, Mehran; Ma, Chenhao; Haug, Valentin; Wu, Mengfan; Orgill, Dennis P; Panayi, Adriana C",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,398

The current world- wide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus showed many gaps in understanding of coronaviruses spread and transmission. Because of lack of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 the only preventive measures are represented by wearing protective masks and gloves thus limiting potential risk of contact with the airborne virus. Inversely, the limited time of protective function of the masks presents another drawback of their use. Therefore, the application of disinfection agent dispersed on the surface of protective masks may enhance their effectivity and safety of their application. The aim of the study was to examine the virucidal efficacy of low-concentra- ted sodium hypochlorite dispersed using ultrasonic humidifier on the surface of surgery masks. The study was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus, namely porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) representing a model with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure to human coronaviruses. Five different concentrations of the disinfectant with different content of sodium hypochlorite were selected for the study. A final concentration of 0.228 g/L sodium hypochlorite effectively inactivated the PED virus and may support the biosafety of masks usage.","Antas, M; Szczotka-Bochniarz, A; Wozniakowski, G",Pol J Vet Sci,,398

METHOD: A total of 55 nasal swab samples from the first wave in Hiroshima and 13 from the second wave were examined quantitatively by RT-qPCR and qualitatively by nested PCR using specific primers. Four samples from each wave underwent next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis including controls and all sequences retrieved in Japan from GISAID and GenBank. Subsequently, mutations were examined. RESULTS: Viral load ranged 7.85 × 101-1.42 × 108 copies/ml. Of 68 samples, one was Asian type-O, 65 were European type-GR, and 2 were undetectable. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that Japan was infected with various Asian strains (L, S, V, O) from January through April. By second week of March, European strains (G, GH, GR) had appeared, and GR strains became predominant after mid-March. The first case in Hiroshima was classified as Asian strain O, and the rest were GR strains. Then, second wave of GR strains appeared independently with 11-15 base mutations. Comparing the first- and second-wave GR strains, mutation rate was 1.17-1.36 × 10-3 base substitutions per site per year; in addition, amino acid changes occurred at S1361P and P3371S in ORF1a, A314V in ORF1b, and P151L in N. All seven GR strains were D614G variants with R202K and G203R mutations in N. A single-nucleotide insertion in ORF8 that causes a defect in ORF8 protein was found in one isolate (S66) from the second wave. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal the evolutionary hierarchy of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. The predominant D614G variants and a new form of ORF8 deletion in Hiroshima provide the clue for role of viral factor in local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.","Ko, Ko; Nagashima, Shintaro; E, Bunthen; Ouoba, Serge; Akita, Tomoyuki; Sugiyama, Aya; Ohisa, Masayuki; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Tahara, Hidetoshi; Ohge, Hiroki; Ohdan, Hideki; Kubo, Tatsuhiko; Kishita, Eisaku; Kuwabara, Masao; Takahashi, Kazuaki; Tanaka, Junko",PLoS One,,398

Based on these estimates, this work allows us to accurately re-estimate the lethality of the disease in Spain, taking into account unreported cases. METHODS: A hierarchical Bayesian model recently proposed in the literature has been adapted to model the actual number of Covid-19 cases in Spain. RESULTS: The results of this work show that the real load of Covid-19 in Spain in the period considered is well above the data registered by the public health system. Specifically, the model estimates show that, cumulatively until June 1st, 2020, there were 2 425 930 cases of Covid-19 in Spain with characteristics similar to those reported (95% credibility interval: 2 148 261 2 813 864), from which were actually registered only 518 664. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the results obtained from the second wave of the Spanish seroprevalence study, which estimates 2 350 324 cases of Covid-19 produced in Spain, in the period of time considered, it can be seen that the estimates provided by the model are quite good. This work clearly shows the key importance of having good quality data to optimize decision-making in the critical context of dealing with a pandemic.","Moriña, David; Fernández-Fontelo, Amanda; Cabaña, Alejandra; Arratia, Argimiro; Ávalos, Gustavo; Puig, Pedro",Eur. j. public health,,398

In particular, the face and body protective equipment is critical to prevent the wearer from exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates. This situation has been now observed worldwide during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As concern over shortages of PPE at hospitals grows, we share with the public and makers' community the Pressure Optimized PowEred Respirator (PROPER) equipment, made out of COTS components. It is functionally equivalent to a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR). PROPER, a hood-based system which uses open source and easily accessible components is low-cost, relatively passive in terms of energy consumption and mechanisms, and easy and fast to 3D print, build and assemble. We have adapted our experience on building clean room environments and qualifying the bioburden of space instruments to this solution, which is in essence a miniaturized, personal, wearable cleanroom. PROPER would be able to offer better protection than an N95 respirator mask, mainly because it is insensitive to seal fit and it shields the eyes as well. The PROPER SMS fabric is designed for single-use and not intended for reuse, as they may start to tear and fail but the rest of the parts can be disinfected and reused. We provide a set of guidelines to build a low-cost 3D printed solution for an effective PAPR system and describe the procedures to validate it to comply with the biosafety level 3 requirements. We have validated the prototype of PROPER unit for air flow, ISO class cleanliness level, oxygen and carbon-dioxide gas concentrations during exhalation, and present here these results for illustration. We demonstrate that the area inside the hood is more than 200 times cleaner than the external ambient without the operator and more than 175 times with the operator and in an aerosol exposed environment. We also include the procedure to clean and disinfect the equipment for reuse. PROPER may be a useful addition to provide protection to HCPs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus or other potential future viral diseases that are transmitted aerially.","Israel Nazarious, Miracle; Mathanlal, Thasshwin; Zorzano, Maria-Paz; Martin-Torres, Javier",HardwareX,,398

For factorial and construct validity, reliability, and measurement error, we administered the 20-item SCOVID scale to a sample of 461 Italians in May/June 2020 (mean age: 48.8, SD ± 15.8). RESULTS: SCOVID scale item content validity ranged between 0.85-1.00, and the total scale content validity was 0.94. Confirmatory factor analysis supported SCOVID scale factorial validity (comparative fit index = 0.91; root mean square error of approximation = 0.05). Construct validity was supported by significant correlations with other instrument scores measuring self-efficacy, positivity, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Reliability estimates were good with factor score determinacy, composite reliability, global reliability index, Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest reliability ranging between 0.71-0.91. The standard error of measurement was adequate. CONCLUSIONS: The SCOVID scale is a new instrument measuring self-care in the COVID-19 pandemic with adequate validity and reliability.

One immediate concern was what the impact of the comprehensive disease control measures on rates of violence and abuse against children and adolescents would be. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish rates of child abuse and degree of family conflict during the first COVID-19 lockdown spring 2020. Additionally, we aimed to investigate associations between preexisting and concurrent risk factors and abuse during these unique times. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 3545 Norwegian 13- to 16-year-olds participated in this study. A total of 1944 of these had provided data 1â¯year before the lockdown. METHODS: We used a web survey format to assess abuse exposure and associated risk factors. The survey was administered in schools during school hours in June 2020, shortly after the reopening of schools after the first lockdown. RESULTS: In this sample 8.2% reported psychological abuse during lockdown, 2.4% had experienced physical abuse and 1.4% sexual abuse. For online sexual abuse, the rate was 5.6% during this time period. Adolescents did not report an increase in family conflict. Concurrently perceived family affluence and family risk factors were most strongly associated with physical abuse during lockdown (ORâ¯=â¯11.01(95% CI 5.32-22.84); ORâ¯=â¯5.36 (95% CI 2.69-10.67)), but also other types of child maltreatment. Analyses across assessment points suggested that prior victimization was the most accurate predictor of abuse experiences during lockdown (ORâ¯=â¯3.84 (95% CI 2.85-5.20)). CONCLUSIONS: The negative consequences of the COVID-19 preventative measures struck the adolescent population unevenly. The findings underscore the need for targeted measures to mitigate the negative outcomes of health-related crises for adolescents in risk groups such as those with low family affluence and prior abuse experiences.","Augusti, Else-Marie; Sætren, Sjur Skjørshammer; Hafstad, Gertrud S",Child Abuse Negl,,398

434527,Evaluation of the Expression of CCR5 and CX3CR1 Receptors and Correlation with the Functionality of T Cells in Women infected with ZIKV during Pregnancy,2021,"Adulterants in processed food and herbal medicines reduce their safety, quality control, or pharmacological efficacy. Four mistletoe species, including Viscum coloratum, inhabit Korea. Leaves and branches of V. coloratum, defined as edible or medicinal mistletoe species in Korean, are used to prepare Korean herbal medicines as well as leached tea. However, other mistletoe species including Taxillus sutchuenensis var. duclouxii, Korthalsella japonica, and Loranthus tanakae are frequently distributed as authentic V. coloratum in Korean markets because of similarities in the branches morphology and Korean names of these species with V. coloratum. Although herbal medicines and food products prepared from the other mistletoe species are inauthentic, they are sold at high prices because of the rarity of these species. Thus, it is important to distinguish between authentic and inauthentic adulterant mistletoe species. In this study, we developed species-specific primer, based on matK sequences, suitable for both conventional PCR and real time PCR (qPCR) assay. These assays allowed rapid discrimination among all four mistletoe species. Moreover, qPCR assay enabled the detection of trace amounts of adulterant mistletoe species in V. coloratum samples. Furthermore, we used these assays to monitor commercial mistletoe products distributed in Korean markets. Our data suggest that these methods would serve as a reliable genetic tool to prevent adulteration and standardize the quality of commercial V. coloratum products.","Kim, Wook Jin; Yang, Sungyu; Choi, Goya; Park, Inkyu; Noh, Pureum; Lee, A Yeong; Kim, Hyo Seon; Moon, Byeong Cheol",Phytochemistry,,398

We aimed to discover how elderly people coped with the psychological burdens of pandemic and the social isolation in Hungary. METHODS: This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (M = 68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. RESULTS: Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. CONCLUSION: Overall, our research might help the understanding of how external and internal factors contributed to the well-being of elderly people during the COVID-19. The model can also be translated into professional interventions to develop coping strategies among elderly for the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.","Lábadi, Beatrix; Arató, Nikolett; Budai, Tímea; Inhóf, Orsolya; Stecina, Diána T; Sík, Attila; Zsidó, András N",Aging Ment Health,,398

Although neither variant appears to cause more severe illness nor increased risk of death, the faster spread of the virus is a major threat. Using computational tools, we found that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may acquire an increased transmissibility by increasing the propensity of its spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain via proteolysis, perhaps by neutrophil elastase and/or via reduced intramolecular interactions that contribute to the stability of the closed conformation of spike protein. This information leads to the identification of potential treatments to avert the imminent threat of these more transmittable SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Pokhrel, Suman; Kraemer, Benjamin R; Lee, Lucia; Samardzic, Kate; Mochly-Rosen, Daria",PLoS One,,398

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Anonymous online survey of adult Australian residents, 3 April - 2 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported psychological status during the preceding fortnight assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; symptoms of depression) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Optimism about the future was assessed with a 10-point study-specific visual analogue scale. RESULTS: 13 829 respondents contributed complete response data. The estimated prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 10) was 27.6% (95% CI, 26.1-29.1%) and of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 10) 21.0% (95% CI, 19.6-22.4%); 14.6% of respondents (95% CI, 13.5-16.0%) reported thoughts of being better off dead or self-harm (PHQ-9, item 9) on at least some days and 59.2% (95% CI, 57.6-60.7%) that they were more irritable (GAD-7, item 6). An estimated 28.3% of respondents (95% CI, 27.1-29.6%) reported great optimism about the future (score &#8805; 8). People who had lost jobs, were worried about contracting COVID-19, or for whom the restrictions had a highly adverse impact on daily life were more likely to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, and less likely to report high optimism than people without these experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems were widespread among Australians during the first month of the stage two COVID-19 restrictions; in addition, about one-quarter of respondents reported mild to moderate symptoms of depression or anxiety. A public mental health response that includes universal, selective and indicated clinical interventions is needed.","Fisher, Jane Rw; Tran, Thach D; Hammarberg, Karin; Sastry, Jayagowri; Nguyen, Hau; Rowe, Heather; Popplestone, Sally; Stocker, Ruby; Stubber, Claire; Kirkman, Maggie",Med J Aust,,398

We also wish to evaluate the possible horizontal transmission after hospital discharge, by means of a follow-up of all the newborns included at 1 month of age. METHODS: This multicenter descriptive study involved 16 Spanish hospitals. We reviewed the medical records of 242 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 13 to May 31, 2020, when they were in their third trimester of pregnancy. They and their 248 newborn infants were monitored until the infant was 1 month old. RESULTS: Caesarean sections (C-sections) were performed on 63 (26%) women. The initial clinical symptoms were coughing (33%) and fever (29.7%). Mothers hospitalized due to COVID-19 pathology had a higher risk of ending their pregnancy via C-section (P = 0.027). Newborns whose mothers had been admitted due to their COVID-19 infection had a higher risk of premature delivery (P = 0.006). We admitted 115 (46.3%) newborn infants to the neonatal unit, of those, 87 (75.6%) were only admitted due to organizational circumstances. No infants died and no vertical or horizontal transmission was detected. Regarding type of feeding, 41.7% of the newborns received exclusive breast-feeding at discharge and 40.4% at 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect COVID-19 transmission during delivery or throughout the first month of life in the newborns included in our study. Exclusive breast-feeding rates at discharge and at 1 month of age were lower than expected.","Marín Gabriel, Miguel A; Reyne Vergeli, Mar; Caserío Carbonero, Sonia; Sole, Laia; Carrizosa Molina, Tamara; Rivero Calle, Irene; Cuadrado Pérez, Irene; Álvarez Fernández, Blanca; Forti Buratti, Azul; Fernández-Cañadas Morillo, Aurora",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,398

439529,GB-2 inhibits ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression: In vivo and in vitro studies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse intracranial susceptibility abnormalities have recently been described among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although prior studies have consisted of case reports and/or series. This brief literature review seeks to compile and catalogue the available data to elucidate characteristic features of such findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific articles and studies on intracranial microhemorrhages in the setting of COVID-19 were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Included studies described intracranial microbleed(s) on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with COVID-19. If multiple patients were described, only patients with intracranial microhemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging were included for analysis. Patient demographics, severity of illness (e.g. intensive care unit admission and/or intubation), time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to magnetic resonance imaging, and location(s) of any observed microhemorrhages were noted. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients with suspected intracranial microhemorrhages have been described in prior studies. The average age of patients was 64.7 years; 21.9% were women. The average time between COVID-19 diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging was 31.7 days. All patients in the cohort were admitted to critical care and were either intubated or treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during their clinical course. Microhemorrhages were most commonly located in the subcortical/juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial microbleeds are a well-documented finding in patients with severe COVID-19, and are most commonly callosal and subcortical/juxtacortical in location.","Benson, John C; Hunt, Christopher H; Klaas, James P; Kallmes, David F",Neuroradiol J,,398

METHODS: A total of 136 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Patients were grouped according to the presence of hypertension and BPV. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. was analyzed, and BPV was calculated as the coefficient of variation of MAP (MAPCV). High BPV was defined as MAPCV values above the median. We compared the age, level of C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), creatinine and in-hospital mortality and investigated the relationship among the groups. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were older (70 ± 12 vs. 53 ± 17 years; P < 0.001), had higher levels of CRP (9.4 ± 9.2 vs. 5.3 ± 8.2 mg/dL; P = 0.009), MAPCV (11.4 ± 4.8 vs. 8.9 ± 3.2; P = 0.002), and higher in-hospital mortality (19.6% vs. 5.9%; P = 0.013) than those without hypertension. There was a proportional relationship between BPV and age, levels of CRP, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, creatinine and in-hospital mortality (all, P < 0.05). In Cox regression analysis, advanced age [&#8805;80 years, hazard ratio (HR) 10.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.264-47.772, P = 0.003] and higher MAPCV (HR 1.617, 95% CI, 1.281-2.040, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: High BPV in COVID-19 patients with hypertension is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Advanced age and systemic inflammation are proportional to high BPV. Additional attention is needed for COVID-19 patients with hypertension and high BPV.","Nam, Jong-Ho; Park, Jong Il; Kim, Byung-Jun; Kim, Hun-Tae; Lee, Jung-Hee; Lee, Chan-Hee; Son, Jang-Won; Kim, Ung; Park, Jong-Seon; Shin, Dong-Gu; Hong, Kyung Soo; Jang, Jong Geol; Ahn, June Hong; Jin, Hyun Jung; Choi, Eun Young; Shin, Kyeong-Cheol; Chung, Jin Hong; Lee, Kwan Ho; Hur, Jian; Hong, Young-Hoon; Lee, Choong-Ki",Blood press. monit,,398
439659,Computational Intelligence Techniques for Combating COVID-19: A Survey,2020,"Purpose COVID-19 has shifted models of health care delivery, requiring the rapid adoption of telehealth, despite limited evidence and few resources to guide speech-language pathologists. Management of dysarthria presents specific challenges in the telehealth modality. Evaluations of dysarthria typically rely heavily on perceptual judgments, which are difficult to obtain via telehealth given a variety of technological factors such as inconsistencies in mouth-to-microphone distance, changes to acoustic properties based on device settings, and possible interruptions in connection that may cause video freezing. These factors limit the validity, reliability, and clinicians' certainty of perceptual speech ratings via telehealth. Thus, objective measures to supplement the assessment of dysarthria are essential. Method This tutorial outlines how to obtain objective measures in real time and from recordings of motor speech evaluations to support traditional perceptual ratings in telehealth evaluations of dysarthria. Objective measures include pause patterns, utterance length, speech rate, diadochokinetic rates, and overall speech severity. We demonstrate, through clinical case vignettes, how these measures were completed following three clinical telehealth evaluations of dysarthria conducted via Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic. This tutorial describes how each of these objective measures were utilized, in combination with subjective perceptual analysis, to determine deviant speech characteristics and their etiology, develop a patient-specific treatment plan, and track change over time. Conclusion Utilizing objective measures as an adjunct to perceptual ratings for telehealth dysarthria evaluations is feasible under real-world pandemic conditions and can be used to enhance the quality and utility of these evaluations.","Sevitz, Jordanna S; Kiefer, Brianna R; Huber, Jessica E; Troche, Michelle S",Am J Speech Lang Pathol,,398

This gave rise to important questions about surgeons' attitude towards surgical practice and the level of preparation at work. Methods: Cross-sectional web-based national survey distributed to general surgeons by e­mail over a period of 7 days. Results: Among 304 responders, 42.6% were working in the hospital with COVID-19 patients. Three quarters of all surgeons (74.5%) were afraid of contracting the disease. While 42% expressed a fear for their own life while caring for COVID-19 patients, 90.1% were afraid of transmitting the disease to family members. The average reported level of PPE provided at the workplace was significantly higher among the group which was not afraid of contracting COVID-19 than among the group afraid of contracting COVID-19 (4.0 vs. 3.12, pâ¯= 0.02). Nearly all surgeons (93.8%) agreed that cancer surgeries should be continued during the pandemic and 49% perceived laparoscopy as a safe approach when operating on COVID-19 positive patients. Conclusion: A high proportion of surgeons admitted being afraid of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, which had various implications for their attitude towards surgical practice.

Consider the following...,2021-09-14,"The application, timing, and duration of lockdown strategies during a pandemic remain poorly quantified with regards to expected public health outcomes. Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the [Formula: see text] formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible [Formula: see text] for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a ""tunneling"" effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.","Oraby, Tamer; Tyshenko, Michael G; Maldonado, Jose Campo; Vatcheva, Kristina; Elsaadany, Susie; Alali, Walid Q; Longenecker, Joseph C; Al-Zoughool, Mustafa",Sci Rep,,398

RESEARCH QUESTION: Do Japanese health care workers and the general public agree with principles of ventilator allocation developed internationally? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 4-point Likert scale questionnaire was used to assess the extent of agreement or disagreement with internationally developed triage principles for rationing mechanical ventilators during pandemics. Questionnaires were distributed in person or online, and generalized linear models were used to analyze quantitative data. Free-text descriptions were qualitatively analyzed, both deductively and inductively, to compare respondent opinions with those described in previous US studies. RESULTS: Of 3191 surveys distributed, 1520 were returned. Allocation of resources to maximize survival from current illness (""save the most lives"") was the most popular triage principle, with 95.8% of respondents in agreement. Allocation to ensure a minimum duration of benefit, as determined by predicted post-illness prognosis (""ensure minimum duration of benefit""), and allocation to persons who have experienced fewer life stages (""life cycle"") obtained agreement of 82.2% and 80.1%, respectively. Withdrawal and reallocation of mechanical ventilators to more appropriate patients was supported by 64.4% of respondents. Only 29.4% of respondents supported the principle of first-come, first-served access to ventilators. INTERPRETATION: Most respondents supported allocation principles developed internationally and disagreed with the idea of first-come, first-served allocation during resource shortages.

The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the missions and the medical conditions of COVID-19 patients transported during an air medical evacuation on fixed wing aircraft in March and April 2020. METHOD: This was a retrospective analysis of transport records as well as other documents for 58 COVID-19 patients requiring artificial ventilation. RESULTS: The median age of the transported patients was 61.5 years, and 61% of them had preexisting medical conditions. They had been ventilated for a median of 5 days and experienced the first symptoms 18 days before transport. The patients flown out of France had less days of ventilation before flight, a lower end-tidal carbon dioxide level at the beginning of the flight, and a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index. There were also some differences between the ventilation and the flight level flown by the 2 air forces. CONCLUSION: The intensive care transport of ventilated COVID-19 patients requires highly qualified personnel and appropriate equipment and should be planned appropriately.","Sammito, Stefan; Turc, Jean; Post, Janina; Beaussac, Madeleine; Hossfeld, Björn; Boutonnet, Mathieu",Air Med J,,398

Here, we review what is currently known about the effects of the virus and its clinical condition, Covid-19 in areas of relevance to those providing care to neonates. While aspects of pregnancy, including higher expression of the cell receptor for the virus, ACE2, could put these women at higher risk, preliminary epidemiological information does not support this. Viral carriage prevalence based on universal screening show that rates vary from 13% in ""hot spots"" such as New York City, to 3% in areas with lower cases. Vertical transmission risks are unknown but 3.1% of 311 babies born to mothers with Covid-19 were positive within a week of birth.

Therefore, we assessed iron metabolism markers in COVID-19 patients for their ability to predict disease severity. COVID-19 patients referred to the Heidelberg University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into outpatients (cohort A, nâ=â204), inpatients (cohort B, nâ=â81), and outpatients later admitted to hospital because of health deterioration (cohortâC, nâ=â23). Iron metabolism parameters were severely altered in patients of cohort B and C compared to cohort A. In multivariate regression analysis including age, gender, CRP and iron-related parameters only serum iron and ferritin were significantly associated with hospitalization. ROC analysis revealed an AUC for serum iron of 0.894 and an iron concentration <6âµmol/l as the best cutoff-point predicting hospitalization with a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 67.9%. When stratifying inpatients in a low- and high oxygen demand group serum iron levels differed significantly between these two groups and showed a high negative correlation with the inflammatory parameters IL-6, procalcitonin, and CRP. Unexpectedly, serum iron levels poorly correlate with hepcidin. We conclude that measurement of serum iron can help predicting the severity of COVID-19. The differences in serum iron availability observed between the low and high oxygen demand group suggest that disturbed iron metabolism likely plays a causal role in the pathophysiology leading to lung injury.","Hippchen, Theresa; Altamura, Sandro; Muckenthaler, Martina U; Merle, Uta",Hemasphere,,398

The reports pertaining to the treatment of this pandemic are still lacking. We firmly believe that Nature itself provides a simple solution for any complicated problem created in it which motivated us to carry out In Silico investigations on some bioactive natural compounds reportedly found in the fruits and leaves of Anthocephalus Cadamba which is a miraculous plant found on the earth aiming to predict the potential inhibitors against aforesaid virus. Having modeled the ground state ligand structure of the such nine natural compounds applying density functional theory at B3LYP/631+G (d, p) level we have performed their molecular docking with SARS-COV-2 protease to calculate the binding affinity as well as to screen the binding at S-protein site during ligand-protein interactions. Out of these nine studied naturally occurring compounds; Oleanic Acid has been appeared to be potential inhibitor for COVID-19 followed by Ursolic Acid, IsoVallesiachotamine,Vallesiachotamine,Cadambine,Vincosamide-N-Oxide, Isodihydroamino-cadambine, Pentyle Ester of Chlorogenic Acid and D-Myo-Inositol. Hence these bioactive natural compounds or their structural analogs may be explored as anti-COVID19 drug agent which will be possessing the peculiar feature of cost-less synthesis and less or no side effect due to their natural occurrence. The solubility and solvent-effect related to the phytochemicals may be the point of concern. The In-vivo investigations on these proposed natural compounds or on their structural analogs are invited for designing and developing the potential medicine/vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19 pandemic.","Mishra, Ashok Kumar; Tewari, Satya Prakash",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01634v1.pdf,398

COVID-19, the disease caused by this coronavirus, was declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The incidence of patients with fracture who are also positive for COVID-19 is on the rise. The diagnosis and management of such patients can be complicated as their clinical characteristics are heterogeneous. Furthermore, a surgical procedure can be particularly challenging given that the use of high-speed devices results in aerosol generation. In this study, we develop and propose globally applicable guidelines to fill this knowledge gap and we identify and propose the necessary protective strategies for medical personnel in an orthopaedic emergency department and in the inpatient wards. We also introduce diagnostic criteria, surgical complication management, and follow-up strategies for infected patients. These guidelines may be helpful to decrease the infection rate of orthopaedic trauma personnel and to provide diagnosis and treatment therapy for patients with fracture and COVID-19.","Mi, Bobin; Xiong, Yuan; Lin, Ze; Panayi, Adriana C; Chen, Lang; Liu, Guohui",J Bone Joint Surg Am,,398
460959,Carbon footprint forecasting using time series data mining methods: the case of Turkey,2021,"Early in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in-person ambulatory health care visits declined by 60% across the United States, while telehealth* visits increased, accounting for up to 30% of total care provided in some locations (1,2). In March 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released updated regulations and guidance changing telehealth provisions during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, including the elimination of geographic barriers and enhanced reimbursement for telehealth services (3-6). The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) administers a voluntary weekly Health Center COVID-19 Survey§ to track health centers' COVID-19 testing capacity and the impact of COVID-19 on operations, patients, and staff. CDC and HRSA analyzed data from the weekly COVID-19 survey completed by 1,009 HRSA-funded health centers (health centers¶) for the week of July 11-17, 2020, to describe telehealth service use in the United States by U.S. Census region,** urbanicity, staffing capacity, change in visit volume, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supply. Among the 1,009 health center respondents, 963 (95.4%) reported providing telehealth services. Health centers in urban areas were more likely to provide >30% of health care visits virtually (i.e., via telehealth) than were health centers in rural areas. Telehealth is a promising approach to promoting access to care and can facilitate public health mitigation strategies and help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory illnesses, while supporting continuity of care. Although CMS's change of its telehealth provisions enabled health centers to expand telehealth by aligning guidance and leveraging federal resources, sustaining expanded use of telehealth services might require additional policies and resources.","Demeke, Hanna B; Pao, Leah Zilversmit; Clark, Hollie; Romero, Lisa; Neri, Antonio; Shah, Rhea; McDow, Kendra B; Tindall, Erica; Iqbal, Naureen J; Hatfield-Timajchy, Kendra; Bolton, Joshua; Le, Xuan; Hair, Brionna; Campbell, Stephanie; Bui, Cuong; Sandhu, Paramjit; Nwaise, Isaac; Armstrong, Paige A; Rose, Michelle A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,398
461066,Rapid retooling for emergency response with hybrid manufacturing,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been widely reported to cause symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Neurologic complications have not been widely reported without associated respiratory symptoms. These neurologic manifestations have been found mostly in the elderly. There has been no report of ataxia or COVID-19 cerebellitis in the young adult population without associated respiratory symptoms. CASE REPORT: Here we report the case of a 30-year-old patient who presented with isolated cerebellar symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19 cerebellitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: It is important for emergency physicians to know that COVID-19 can have many clinical manifestations and to have a high level of suspicion with acute neurologic symptoms.","Povlow, Adriana; Auerbach, Andrew J",J. emerg. med,,398
463190,From the President and IFST News,2020,"Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) packaged mRNA vaccines have been deployed against infectious diseases such as COVID-19, yet their structural features remain unclear. Cholesterol, a major constituent within LNPs, contributes to their morphology that influences gene delivery. Herein, we examine the structure of LNPs containing cholesterol derivatives using electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and membrane fluidity assays. LNPs formulated with C24 alkyl derivatives of cholesterol show a polymorphic shape and various degrees of multilamellarity and lipid partitioning, likely due to phase separation. The addition of methyl and ethyl groups to the C24 alkyl tail of the cholesterol backbone induces multilamellarity (>50% increase compared to cholesterol), while the addition of a double bond induces lipid partitioning (>90% increase compared to cholesterol). LNPs with multilamellar and faceted structures, as well as a lamellar lipid phase, showed higher gene transfection. Unraveling the structure of mRNA-LNPs can enable their rational design toward enhanced gene delivery.","Eygeris, Yulia; Patel, Siddharth; Jozic, Antony; Sahay, Gaurav",,,398

463665,Three million COVID deaths is a grim milestone,2021,"Improvement on oxygen (O2) concentrator using pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology according to variable product demands is of great significance, which, for instance, provides the key step for success in practical O2 therapy for COVID-19 patients who need to be delivered with a wide product flow rate range (1–15 standard liter per minute (SLPM)) of medical O2 (purity &gt;82%). This work studied the individual effects of major PSA process parameters on O2 production performance at the product flow rate of 3.46–19.88 SLPM (0.64–3.68 SLPM per kilogram of adsorbent (SLPM/kg)), based on a self-designed two-bed PSA unit with a modified Skarstom cycle using Li-LSX zeolite adsorbents. The improvement strategies were accordingly proposed based upon influential mechanisms of each parameter: 1) at lower product flow rates (≤2.00 SLPM/kg), increasing the purge flow rate and decreasing the adsorption pressure to suppress excess O2 adsorption, and decreasing the feed flow rate to ensure low energy consumption;2) at higher product flow rates (≥2.00 SLPM/kg), decreasing the purge flow rate and increasing the adsorption pressure to eliminate N2 breakthrough and O2-rich product waste, and appropriately increasing the feed flow rate to enhance cost-effectiveness. An improved set of parameters rendered O2 purity (95.67–74.86%), recovery (11.28–49.05%), productivity (0.47–2.04 mmol/kg/s) increased by up to 3.52–20.08%, 0.36–20.47%, 6.82–19.61%, and energy consumption (4.07–0.95 kWh/kgO2) decreased by up to 10.56–18.10%, in comparison to two conventional sets, respectively. The results are beneficial for developing intellectualized and flexibly-controlled O2 concentrators for practical applications. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Zhang, Q.; Liu, Y.; Li, Z.; Xiao, P.; Liu, W.; Yang, X.; Fu, Y.; Zhao, C.; Yang, R.

Despite state obligations to protect, respect, and fulfil the rights of workers under international human rights law, gaps in legal frameworks and lack of political will have left food system workers exposed to discrimination and abuse at the hands of private actors. Migrant workers, as well as racial and ethnic minorities, in particular, face targeted exploitation without redress. Case studies demonstrate the extent of this harm, even as governments designate workers as ""essential"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors of this article argue that deliberate inaction by states to extend meaningful protections to workers or indict exploitative actors demonstrates the need for a new state crime-one that holds accountable governments that are complicit in the grave violations of workers' fundamental rights.","Elver, H.; Shapiro, M.",State Crime,,398

The clinical presentation and patients characteristics are usually utilized to identify those patients who need more critical care. However, the clinical evidence shows an unmet need to determine more accurate and optimal clinical biomarkers to triage patients under a condition like the COVID-19 crisis. Here we have presented a machine learning approach to find a group of clinical indicators from the blood tests of a set of COVID-19 patients that are predictive of poor prognosis and morbidity. Our approach consists of two interconnected schemes: Feature Selection and Prognosis Classification. The former is based on different Matrix Factorization (MF)-based methods, and the latter is performed using Random Forest algorithm. Our model reveals that Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) O2 Saturation and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are the most important clinical biomarkers determining the poor prognosis in these patients. Our approach paves the path of building quantitative and optimized clinical management systems for COVID-19 and similar diseases.","Saberi-Movahed, Farshad; Mohammadifard, Mahyar; Mehrpooya, Adel; Rezaei-Ravari, Mohammad; Berahmand, Kamal; Rostami, Mehrdad; Karami, Saeed; Najafzadeh, Mohammad; Hajinezhad, Davood; Jamshidi, Mina; Abedi, Farshid; Mohammadifard, Mahtab; Farbod, Elnaz; Safavi, Farinaz; Dorvash, Mohammadreza; Eftekhari, Mahdi; Vahedi, Shahrzad; Saberi-Movahed, Farid; Tavassoly, Iman",,,398

OBJECTIVE: To describe the development and rapid deployment of a virtual hospital program, Atrium Health hospital at home (AH-HaH), within a large health care system. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Atrium Health, a large integrated health care organization in the southeastern United States. PATIENTS: 1477 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 23 March to 7 May 2020 who received care via AH-HaH. INTERVENTION: A virtual hospital model providing proactive home monitoring and hospital-level care through a virtual observation unit (VOU) and a virtual acute care unit (VACU) in the home setting for eligible patients with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Patient demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, treatments administered (intravenous fluids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, and respiratory medications), transfer to inpatient care, and hospital outcomes (length of stay, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, and death) were collected from electronic health record data. RESULTS: 1477 patients received care in either the AH-HaH VOU or VACU or both settings, with a median length of stay of 11 days. Of these, 1293 (88%) patients received care in the VOU only, with 40 (3%) requiring inpatient hospitalization. Of these 40 patients, 16 (40%) spent time in the ICU, 7 (18%) required ventilator support, and 2 (5%) died during their hospital admission. In total, 184 (12%) patients were ever admitted to the VACU, during which 21 patients (11%) required intravenous fluids, 16 (9%) received antibiotics, 40 (22%) required respiratory inhaler or nebulizer treatments, 41 (22%) used supplemental oxygen, and 24 (13%) were admitted as an inpatient to a conventional hospital. Of these 24 patients, 10 (42%) required ICU admission, 1 (3%) required a ventilator, and none died during their hospital admission.

This paper will discuss the experimental details, limitations and sensitivity of the PCR Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism method in relation to all existing literature available to us until today. Genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification and Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism conditions (concentration of polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis, dissociation treatment of double- stranded DNA) and comparison with PCR Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism are presented. Since its discovery in 1989, there have been many variations, innovations, and modifications of the method, which makes it very easy, safe, fast and for this reason widely applied in clinical diagnostic, forensic medicine, biochemical, veterinary, microbiological, food and environmental laboratories. One of the possible applications of the method is the diagnosis and identification of mutations in new strains of coronaviruses, because science needs more tools to tackle the problem of this pandemic. The PCR Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism method can be applied in many cases provided that control samples are available and the required conditions of the method are achieved.","Kakavas, Konstantinos V",Mol Biol Rep,,398
468523,The Drug Overdose Epidemic Seen through Different Lenses,2021,"The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, is global and unprecedented. Although remdesivir has recently been approved by the FDA to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, no oral antiviral is available for outpatient treatment. AT-527, an orally administered double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, was previously shown to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected subjects. Here, we report the potent in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base of AT-527, against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In normal human airway epithelial cells, the concentration of AT-511 required to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 by 90% (EC90) was 0.47 µM, very similar to its EC90 against human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. Little to no cytotoxicity was observed for AT-511 at concentrations up to 100 µM. Substantial levels of the active triphosphate metabolite AT-9010 were formed in normal human bronchial and nasal epithelial cells incubated with 10 µM AT-511 (698 ± 15 and 236 ± 14 µM, respectively), with a half-life of at least 38 h. Results from steady-state pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies of nonhuman primates administered oral doses of AT-527, as well as pharmacokinetic data from subjects given daily oral doses of AT-527, predict that twice daily oral doses of 550 mg AT-527 will produce AT-9010 trough concentrations in human lung that exceed the EC90 observed for the prodrug against SARS-CoV-2 replication. This suggests that AT-527 may be an effective treatment option for COVID-19.","Good, Steven S; Westover, Jonna; Jung, Kie Hoon; Zhou, Xiao-Jian; Moussa, Adel; La Colla, Paolo; Collu, Gabriella; Canard, Bruno; Sommadossi, Jean-Pierre",,,398
468593,The Real Economic Dimensions of Climate Change,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified in Indonesia in March 2020, and the number of infections has grown exponentially. The situation is at its worst, overwhelming intensive care unit (ICU) resources and capacity. CASE PRESENTATION: This is a single-center observational case study of 21 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU from March 20, 2020, to April 31, 2020. Demographics, baseline comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest imaging were obtained consecutively during patient care. We identified 21 patients with confirmed COVID-19 severe infection in our ICU. The mean (± standard deviation) age of the patients was 54 ± 10 years; 95% were men, with shortness of breath (90.6%) the most common symptom. Hypertension was identified as a comorbidity in 28.6% of patients. The most common reason for admission to the ICU was hypoxemic respiratory failure, with 80% (17 patients) requiring mechanical ventilation. Half of the patients (10) died between day 1 and day 18, with septic shock as the primary cause of death. Of the 11 surviving patients, five were discharged home, while six were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital ward. Even then, the median length of ICU stay amongst survivors was 18 days. CONCLUSIONS: To date, there are no known effective antiviral agents or specific therapy to treat COVID-19. As severe systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ failure seems to be the primary cause of death, supportive care in maintaining oxygenation and hemodynamic stability remain the mainstay goals in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Hariyanto, Hori; Yahya, Corry Quando; Aritonang, Ronald Christian Agustinus",J Med Case Rep,,398

475756,An holistic approach to access the viability of cultured meat: A review,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The global number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has surpassed 28,285,700 with mortality that appears higher than for seasonal influenza. About 20% of COVID-19 patients have experienced cardiac involvement and myocardial infarction in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had a worse prognosis. Furthermore, the widespread use of antiviral drugs can be linked to a worsening of heart function. Arrhythmias and hypertension have also been reported in patients with Covid-19. On the other hand, previous cardiac diseases are present in 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is uncertainty in the use of ace inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) antagonists in the COVID-19 era. The mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 has been elucidated. It has been demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and it is required for host cell entry and subsequent viral replication. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the downregulation of ACE2 that may contribute to the severity of lung pathologies as well as the cardiac function. ACE2, a homolog of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that converts Ang II into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) that with its vasodilatory, antifibrotic, antihypertrophic effects counterbalances the negative effects of Ang II. On the other hand, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and AT1R blockers have been shown to upregulate the expression of ACE2. Based on the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors was questioned although all scientific societies did not recommend discontinuation when clinically recommended. The BRACE CORONA, a phase 4, randomized study tested two strategies: temporarily stopping the ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) for 30âdays versus continuing ACE inhibitors/ARBs in patients who were taking these medications chronically and were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was also discussed. Therefore, the goal of this review is to summarize recent laboratory and clinical investigations concerning the use of ACEi and ARBs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The available data, based also on a randomized trial, suggest that ACEIs or ARBs, when clinically indicated, should be regularly used in the COVID-19 era.","Spaccarotella, Carmen; Mazzitelli, Maria; Migliarino, Serena; Curcio, Antonio; De Rosa, Salvatore; Torti, Carlo; Indolfi, Ciro",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,398

To date, there is still no clinically effective treatment for this comorbidity, and drug repositioning might be a good strategy considering the established clinical safety profile. In this context, since COVID-19 affects the respiratory tract, a promising approach would be the pulmonary drug delivery. Objective: Identify repurposing drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the data of ongoing clinical trials and in silico studies and also assess their potential to be applied in formulations for pulmonary administration. Method: A narrative literature review was conducted between June and July 2020, by extracting the results from Clinical Trials, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct databases. Results: By crossing the results obtained from diverse sources, 21 common drugs were found, from which only 4 drugs presented studies of pulmonary release formulations, demonstrating the need for greater investment and incentive in this field. Conclusion: Even though the lung is a target that facilitates viral infection and replication, formulations for pulmonary delivery of suitable drugs are still lacking for COVID-19 treatment. However, it is indisputable that the pandemic constitutes a concrete demand, with a profound impact on public health, and that, with the appropriate investments, it will give the pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to reinforce the pulmonary delivery field.","Sarcinelli, Michelle Alvares; Martins da Silva, Thalita; Artico Silva, Andressa Daniele; Ferreira de Carvalho Patricio, Beatriz; Mendes Paiva, Flávia Costa; Santos de Lima, Raissa; Leal da Silva, Manuela; Antunes Rocha, Helvécio Vinícius",J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,,398

In addition, the available literature on COVID-19 and other viral transmission in CO2 pneumoperitoneum, as well as the presence of virus in the plume created by electrocautery during MIS was reviewed. The society recommendations were compared to the available literature on the topic to create our review and recommendations to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. RESULTS: The recommendations promulgated by various surgical societies evolved over time as more information became available on COVID-19 transmission. Review of the available literature on the presence of COVID-19 in CO2 pneumoperitoneum was inconclusive. There is no clear evidence of the presence of COVID-19 in plume created by electrocautery. Technologies to reduce CO2 pneumoperitoneum release into the operating room as well as filter viral particles are available and should reduce the exposure risk to operating room personnel. CONCLUSION: There is no clear evidence of COVID-19 virus in the CO2 used during MIS procedures or in the plume created by electrocautery. Until the presence or absence of COVID-19 viral particles has been clearly established, measures to mitigate CO2 and surgical cautery plume release into the operating room should be performed.

Society is positioning teachers, especially teachers of literacy, as the reason for poor student performance. In addition, negative media discourse around deficit initial teacher education, especially with regard to the teaching of reading and writing, is adding to the overall assumption that teachers of literacy are failing. This article highlights instances of teacher practice by literacy teachers during the global pandemic of COVID-19 which oppose the 'problem teacher' discourse. Snowball sampling was used to garner seven early years and primary school teachers for interviews, focussing on teacher perceptions of multimodal texts. A Foucaultian lens of governmentality and power and Fairclough's approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) were used as lens and method of analysis. The findings of this study indicate that these participant teachers have been sophisticated practitioners in their planning and practice during the pandemic, despite the institutional barriers and extreme disruptions experienced. On reflection, therefore, the constructed societal discourse around 'problem teachers' needs to be reviewed and adjusted.","Downes, Lynn; Brosseuk, Deb",Aust Educ Res,,398

Bats are considered as the reservoir host, and the search of a probable intermediate host is still going on. The severe form of the infection is associated with death is mainly reported in older and immune-compromised patients with pre-existing disease history. Death in severe cases is attributed to respiratory failure associated with hyperinflammation. Cytokine storm syndrome associated with inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered as the leading cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients have thus higher levels of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The blood laboratory profile of the COVID-19 patients exhibits lymphopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and RNAaemia, along with increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women does not lead to fetus mortality, unlike other zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and there is, to date, no evidence of intrauterine transmission to neonates. Rapid diagnostics have been developed, and significant efforts are being made to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics. In the absence of any virus-specific therapy, internationally, health care authorities are recommending the adoption of effective community mitigation measures to counter and contain this pandemic virus.

To address coronavirus disease (COVID-19), currently no effective drug or vaccine is available. This necessity motivated us to explore potential lead compounds by considering drug repurposing approach targeting main protease (Mpro) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. This enzyme considered to be an attractive drug target as it contributes significantly in mediating viral replication and transcription. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme. The structure-based pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the co-crystallized structure of the enzyme with its biological active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied for virtual screening based PhaseScore. Docking based virtual screening workflow was used to generate hit compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based Glide GScore. The pharmacological and physicochemical properties of the selected lead compounds were characterized using ADMET. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the binding affinities of the considered lead compounds. Binding energies revealed that compound ABBV-744 binds to the Mpro with strong affinity (&#916;Gbind -45.43 kcal/mol), and the complex is more stable in comparison with other protein-ligand complexes.

The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs.

This has created a need for strategies to triage surgical patients. Here, we describe our experience using the American College of Surgeons (ACS) COVID-19 Guidelines for Triage of Vascular Surgery Patients in an academic surgery practice. METHODS: We used the ACS Guidelines as a framework to direct the triage of vascular surgery patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively analyzed the results of this triage during the first month of surgical restriction at our hospital. Patients undergoing surgery were identified by reviewing the operating room schedule. We reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) and assigned an ACS Category, Condition and Tier Class to each completed surgery. Surgeries that were postponed during that same time period were identified from a prospectively maintained list. We reviewed the EMR for all postponed surgeries and assigned an ACS Category, Condition and Tier Class to each surgery. We reviewed the EMR for all postponed procedures to identify adverse events related to the treatment delay. RESULTS: We performed 69 surgeries in 52 patients during the study period. All surgeries were performed to treat emergent, urgent or time-sensitive elective diagnoses. Forty-seven surgeries (68%) were from Tier 3 and 22 (32%) were from Tier 2b. We did not perform any surgeries from Tier 1 or 2a. We postponed surgery in 66 patients during the same time period. Thirty-six (55%) were from Tier 1, 22 (33%) were from Tier 2a, 5 (8%) were from Tier 2b and 3 (5%) could not be assigned a Tier Class. No Tier 3 surgeries were postponed. Three patients (4.5%) experienced an adverse event that could be attributed to the treatment delay. CONCLUSIONS: The ACS Triage Guidelines provided an effective method to decrease vascular surgical volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic without an increase in patient morbidity. The clinical utility of the Guidelines would be strengthened by incorporating the SURGCON/VASCCON threat level alert system.","Sarfati, Mark R; Griffin, Claire L; Kraiss, Larry W; Smith, Brigitte K; Brooke, Benjamin S",J. vasc. surg,,398

As medical resources are limited, deciding on the proper allocation of these resources is a very crucial issue. Besides, uncertainty is a major factor that can affect decisions, especially in medical fields. To cope with this issue, we use fuzzy logic (FL) as one of the most suitable methods in modeling systems with high uncertainty and complexity. We intend to make use of the advantages of FL in decisions on cases that need to treat in ICU. In this study, an interval type-2 fuzzy expert system is proposed for prediction of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients. For this prediction task, we also developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Finally, the results of these fuzzy systems are compared to some well-known classification methods such as Naive Bayes (NB), Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), Decision Tree (DT), and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The results show that the type-2 fuzzy expert system and ANFIS models perform competitively in terms of accuracy and F-measure compared to the other system modeling techniques.","Asl, Ali Akbar Sadat; Ershadi, Mohammad Mahdi; Sotudian, Shahabeddin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12868v1.pdf,398

In light of the research advances on H2S signaling in biology and medicine, this review proposed H2S as a potential defense against COVID-19. It is suggested that H2S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development. Preclinical studies and clinical trials with slow-releasing H2S donor(s) or the activators of endogenous H2S-generating enzymes should be considered as a preventative treatment or therapy for COVID-19.","Yang, Guangdong",,,398

The understanding of the mechanisms driving early infection events, that are crucial for the exponential spread of the disease, is mandatory and can be significantly implemented generating 3D in vitro models as experimental platforms to investigate the infection substrates and how the virus invades and ravages the tissues.We here describe a protocol for the creation of a synthetic hydrogel-based 3D culture system that mimics in vitro the complex architectures and mechanical cues distinctive of the upper airway epithelia. We then expose the in vitro generated 3D nasal and tracheal epithelia to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that display the typical shape and size distinctive of SARS-CoV-2 and of the majority of Coronaviridae presently known.The infection platform here described provides an efficient and highly physiological in vitro model that reproduces the host-pathogen early interactions, using virus-mimicking nanoparticles, and offers a flexible tool to study virus entry into the cell. At the same time, it reduces the risk of accidental infection/spillovers for researchers, which represents a crucial aspect when dealing with a virus that is highly contagious, virulent, and even deadly.","Pennarossa, Georgia; Fazeli, Alireza; Ledda, Sergio; Gandolfi, Fulvio; Brevini, Tiziana A L",Methods Mol Biol,,398
491731,COVID-19 Chest CT Image Segmentation Network by Multi-Scale Fusion and Enhancement Operations,2021,"Immigration is increasingly politicised: issues surrounding immigration are more salient and party immigration positions are becoming more polarised. Literature on this topic has overwhelmingly focused on Europe and the USA, while identifying radical right parties and particular social dynamics as the main drivers of politicisation. In this paper, we consider a case that exhibits growing politicisation, yet does not fit existing measures and explanation of this phenomenon: Quebec, Canada. Considering party manifestos between 1991 and 2018, we ask: how have Quebec major political parties treated immigration policy issues over time? We argue that Quebec's immigration partisan space is organised by a liberal-restrictive immigration policy continuum and a jurisdictional axis. Mapping provincial political parties' positions, we document a stable clustering towards liberal policy positions but a clear cleavage on the jurisdictional axis. We show that the emergence in 2012 of a highly moderate centre right party-the Coalition Avenir Québec-broke with these established positions and drove a politicisation of the issue. These results demonstrate the importance of considering alternative drivers to explain the politicisation of immigration, as well as of paying attention to the politics of immigration in contexts where pro-immigration discourses dominate.","Xhardez, Catherine; Paquet, Mireille",J Int Migr Integr,,398

No therapies have been shown effective with the exception of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid that was recently proved to be the first life-saving drug in this disease. Remarkably, around 20 % of infected people develop a severe form of COVID-19, giving rise to respiratory and multi-organ failures requiring subintensive and intensive care interventions. This phenomenon is due to an excessive immune response that damages pulmonary alveoli, leading to a cytokine and chemokine storm with systemic effects. Indeed glucocorticoids' role in regulating this immune response is controversial, and they have been used in clinical practice in a variety of countries, even without a previous clear consensus on their evidence-based benefit.","Solinas, Cinzia; Perra, Laura; Aiello, Marco; Migliori, Edoardo; Petrosillo, Nicola",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,398

The immunochromatographic test kits lacks sensitivity and specificity with certain diseases. In this study, our intention was to develop a rapid test kit for SARS-COV-2 with a novel diluent system to enhance the efficacy of antigen-antibody binding and thereby the improvement in the sensitivity outlined. Finally, IgG antibodies against SARS-COV-2 virus peptides were analyzed using 25 positive and 25 negative confirmed clinical samples. The sensitivity of the clinical studies showed 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Therefore, the authors propose that this assay will be a potential tool for efficient community or sentinel surveillance of SARS-COV-2 infection and additionally, for effective monitoring of convalescent sera therapy.","Maya, Vani; Kaviyil, Jyothi Embekkat; Ponnambath, Dinoop Koral; Nair, Renjith P; Bhatt, Anugya; Pilankatta, Rajendra; Valliyot, Lathika; Dungdung, Ranjeet; Veettil, Ramdas Athikkal; Gopi, Manoj",Virusdisease,,398

METHODS: Explanted human islet cells from three independent solid organ donors were incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor biding domain (RBD) fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a control-GFP, with differential adherence established by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flow cytometry revealed dose-dependent specific binding of RBD-GFP to islet cells when compared to control-GFP.

Many cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN-Î³), utilize the JAK/STAT pathway for signal propagation. Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-1 (SOCS1) is an inducible, intracellular protein that regulates IFN-Î³ signaling by dampening JAK/STAT signaling. Using Fas deficient, MRL/MpJ-Faslpr/J (MRL/lpr) mice, which develop lupus-like disease spontaneously, we tested the hypothesis that a peptide mimic of the SOCS1 kinase inhibitory region (SOCS1-KIR) would inhibit lymphocyte activation and modulate lupus-associated pathologies. Consistent with in vitro studies, SOCS1-KIR intraperitoneal administration reduced the frequency, activation, and cytokine production of memory CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes within the peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. In addition, SOCS1-KIR administration reduced lymphadenopathy, severity of skin lesions, autoantibody production, and modestly reduced kidney pathology. On a cellular level, peritoneal SOCS1-KIR administration enhanced Foxp3 expression in total splenic and follicular regulatory T cells, reduced the effector memory/naïve T lymphocyte ratio for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and reduced the frequency of GL7+ germinal center enriched B cells. Together, these data show that SOCS1-KIR treatment reduced auto-reactive lymphocyte effector functions and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the SOCS1 pathway through peptide administration may have efficacy in mitigating autoimmune pathologies.","Sharma, Jatin; Collins, Teresa D; Roach, Tracoyia; Mishra, Shiwangi; Lam, Brandon K; Mohamed, Zaynab Sidi; Veal, Antia E; Polk, Timothy B; Jones, Amari; Cornaby, Caleb; Haider, Mohammed I; Zeumer-Spataro, Leilani; Johnson, Howard M; Morel, Laurence M; Larkin, Joseph",Sci Rep,,398

While most campuses trained faculty to ensure quality and maintenance of the curriculum through virtual classrooms, less consideration has been given to training students, who face equal challenges in adapting to this abrupt change in the delivery of the curriculum. Few approaches have been developed for students to facilitate their involuntary transition to virtual classrooms and maintenance of appropriate online learning behaviours and etiquette. Presented here are a series of propositions to help to maintain and enhance the quality of college student engagement and activity in the virtual classroom. These guidelines are from one example of the State University of New York public educational system perspective, at the pandemic’s epicentre, while serving a diverse student population. Initiating a meaningful dialogue between faculty, who are engaged in efforts to cope and adapt to the pandemic, may prove useful in re-envisioning and re-designing future curriculum. This may facilitate future discussions on creating best practices guidelines for asynchronous/synchronous virtual classrooms post the pandemic.

METHODS: Data for COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province (capital, Wuhan) was extracted until 7 March 2020. The spatiotemporal distribution of the epidemic in four periods (before 10 January, 10-22 January, 23 January-6 February and 7 February-7 March) was evaluated, and the impacts of interventions were observed. RESULTS: Among 67 706 COVID-19 cases, 52 111 (76.97%) were aged 30-69 years old, and 34 680 (51.22%) were women. The average daily attack rates (95% CI) were 0.5 (0.3 to 0.7), 14.2 (13.2 to 15.1), 45.7 (44.0 to 47.5) and 8.6 (7.8 to 9.3) cases per 106 people in four periods, and the harmonic means (95% CI) of doubling times were 4.28 (4.01 to 4.55), 3.87 (3.78 to 3.98), 5.40 (4.83 to 6.05) and 45.56 (39.70 to 52.80) days. Compared with the first period, daily attack rates rose rapidly in the second period. In the third period, 14 days after 23 January, the daily average attack rate in and outside Wuhan declined by 33.8% and 48.0%; the doubling times increased by 95.0% and 133.2%. In the four periods, 14 days after 7 February, the daily average attack rate in and outside Wuhan decreased by 79.1% and 95.2%; the doubling times increased by 79.2% and 152.0%.

501009,Using country-level variables to classify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases: An unsupervised machine learning approach,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is pressuring healthcare systems worldwide. Disease outcomes in certain subgroups of patients are still scarce, and data are needed. Therefore, we describe here the experience of four dialysis centers of the Brescia Renal COVID Task Force. During March 2020, within an overall population of 643 hemodialysis patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity was detected in 94 (15%). At disease diagnosis, 37 of the 94 (39%) patients (group 1) were managed on an outpatient basis, whereas the remaining 57 (61%) (group 2) required hospitalization. Choices regarding management strategy were made based on disease severity. In group 1, 41% received antivirals and 76% hydroxychloroquine. Eight percent died and 5% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In group 2, 79% received antivirals and 77% hydroxychloroquine. Forty two percent died and 79% developed ARDS. Overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was 29%. History of ischemic cardiac disease, fever, older age (over age 70), and dyspnea at presentation were associated with the risk of developing ARDS, whereas fever, cough and a C-reactive protein higher than 50 mg/l at disease presentation were associated with the risk of death. Thus, in our population of hemodialysis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we documented a wide range of disease severity. The risk of ARDS and death is significant for patients requiring hospital admission at disease diagnosis.","Alberici, Federico; Delbarba, Elisa; Manenti, Chiara; Econimo, Laura; Valerio, Francesca; Pola, Alessandra; Maffei, Camilla; Possenti, Stefano; Lucca, Bernardo; Cortinovis, Roberta; Terlizzi, Vincenzo; Zappa, Mattia; Saccà, Chiara; Pezzini, Elena; Calcaterra, Eleonora; Piarulli, Paola; Guerini, Alice; Boni, Francesca; Gallico, Agnese; Mucchetti, Alberto; Affatato, Stefania; Bove, Sergio; Bracchi, Martina; Costantino, Ester Maria; Zubani, Roberto; Camerini, Corrado; Gaggia, Paola; Movilli, Ezio; Bossini, Nicola; Gaggiotti, Mario; Scolari, Francesco",Kidney Int,,398
501151,Accelerating transition to the circular economy in Georgia,2020,"COVID-19 has evolved into a global pandemic. Early and rapid detection is crucial to control of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While representing the gold standard for early diagnosis, nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 are often complicated and time-consuming. Serological rapid antibody tests are characterized by high rates of false-negative diagnoses, especially during early infection. Here, we developed a novel nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, which integrates nanozyme and enzymatic chemiluminescence immunoassay with the lateral flow strip. The core of our paper test is a robust Co-Fe@hemin-peroxidase nanozyme that catalyzes chemiluminescence comparable with natural peroxidase HRP and thus amplifies immune reaction signal. The detection limit for recombinant spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.1 ng/mL, with a linear range of 0.2-100 ng/mL. Moreover, the sensitivity of test for pseudovirus could reach 360 TCID50/mL, which was comparable with ELISA method. The strip recognized SARS-CoV-2 antigen specifically, and there was no cross reaction with other coronaviruses or influenza A subtypes. This testing can be completed within 16 min, much shorter compared to the usual 1-2 h required for currently used nucleic acid tests. Furthermore, signal detection is feasible using the camera of a standard smartphone. Ingredients for nanozyme synthesis are simple and readily available, considerably lowering the overall cost. In conclusion, our paper test provides a high-sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) approach for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, which should greatly facilitate early screening of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and considerably lower the financial burden on national healthcare resources.","Liu, Dan; Ju, Chenhui; Han, Chao; Shi, Rui; Chen, Xuehui; Duan, Demin; Yan, Jinghua; Yan, Xiyun",Biosens Bioelectron,,398

The Severe Heterogeneous Asthma Registry, Patient-centred (SHARP) Clinical Research Collaboration is created as a network of national registries and severe asthma centres that work together to perform registry based real-world research and clinical studies on a pan-European scale. Such collaboration requires a new, innovative design to overcome the many issues that arise with large-scale data collection across national borders. SHARP has developed a platform that offers a federated analysis approach where national registry data are transformed and integrated into a common data model (CDM). The CDM then allows a local analysis of de-identified patient data and subsequent aggregate (meta-)analysis. To facilitate an easily accessible way to set up new registries, SHARP enables new registries to take part in a central database, based on already proven technology. Next to being economical, this linkage ensures data from different SHARP central members to be comparable. Technological advancements lead to an ever-expanding rate of patient data that will be collected;with the collective effort of the pan-European severe asthma research community SHARP hopes to ensure that they are well equipped to enter a new era of medical research, with the ultimate goal to positively impact the lives of patients with severe asthma.","van Bragt, J.

Likewise, it provides a vision of the impact on the environment and human health of exposure to disinfectants and the presence of COVID-19 in wastewater, among other actions.","SanJuan-Reyes, Sindy; Gómez-Oliván, Leobardo Manuel; Islas-Flores, Hariz",Chemosphere,,398
509061,Intrinsic persistent homology via density-based metric learning,2020-12-11,"We established an individual-based computer model to simulate the occurrence, infection, discovery, quarantine, and quarantine release (recovery) of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals or patients within the community. The model was used to explore the effects of control measures, such as active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine on the epidemic. Considering the condition that R0 = 1.2, when a case of an imported asymptomatic infected individual (AII) was reported in the community, the implementation of control measures reduced the number of AIIs and patients by 62.2% and 62.4%, respectively. The number of undetected AIIs and patients peaked at 302 days of the epidemic, reaching 53 and 20 individuals, respectively. The implementation of sustained active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine can significantly reduce the probability of disease outbreaks and block the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic caused by AIIs in the community.","Guo, Zuiyuan; Xiao, Dan",Sci Rep,,398

It may cause severe viral pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome requiring critical care. Aim: to describe clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: it was a retrospective study carried out in the medical ICU of Farhat Hached teaching hospital between March 11 and May 7, 2020. All consecutive patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 were included. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were collected by reviewing medical records. Results: during the study period, 10 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Mean age, 51.8±6.3 years; 8(80%), male. The most common comorbidities were; diabetes mellitus, 6(60%), obesity 2(20%), chronic kidney disease 2(20%) and hypertension 1(10%). Mean SAPS II, 23.2±1.8. The mean arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratio at admission was 136.2±79.7. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation was used in 4(40%) patients and 7(70%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Tidal volume and PEEP were set respectively within the median [IQR] of, 5.7[5.6-6.3]ml/Kg and 10.7[6.5-11.7]cm H2O. Plateau pressure was monitored in the median [IQR] of 27.9 [25.9-28.5] cm H2O. Four patients received hydroxychloroquine alone and five hydroxychloroquine associated with an antiviral. Five patients developed respectively hyperactive (n=2), hypoactive (n=2) and mixed delirium (n=1). Mortality rate was at 70%. Conclusion: this study demonstrated a particular profile of COVID-19 in the critically ill as a severe presentation in aged males with comorbidities presenting with an ARDS-like and neurological impairment with poor prognosis. The only survivals seem to have benefited from noninvasive ventilatory support.","Saida, Imen Ben; Ennouri, Emna; Nachi, Rayane; Meddeb, Khaoula; Mahmoud, Jihene; Thabet, Nesrine; Jerbi, Salma; Boussarsar, Mohamed",Pan Afr Med J,,398

Four subtypes of this syndrome have been identified, which are clinically and genetically different. To date, altogether 32 patients have been described with ATP8A2 mutations and phenotypic features assigned to CAMRQ type 4. Herein, three additional patients in an Iranian consanguineous family with non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, severe hypotonia, intellectual disability, dysarthria, and cerebellar atrophy have been identified. METHODS: Following the thorough clinical examination, consecutive detections including chromosome karyotyping, chromosomal microarray analysis, and whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed on the proband. The sequence variants derived from WES interpreted by a standard bioinformatics pipeline. Pathogenicity assessment of candidate variant was done by in silico analysis. The familial cosegregation of the WES finding was carried out by PCR-based Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: A novel homozygous missense variant (c.1339G > A, p.Gly447Arg) in the ATP8A2 gene was identified and completely segregated with the phenotype in the family. In silico analysis and structural modeling revealed that the p.G477R substitution is deleterious and induced undesired effects on the protein stability and residue distribution in the ligand-binding pocket. The novel sequence variant occurred within an extremely conserved subregion of the ATP-binding domain. CONCLUSION: Our findings expand the spectrum of ATP8A2 mutations and confirm the reported genotype-phenotype correlation. These results could improve genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in families with clinical presentations related to CAMRQ4 syndrome.","Mohamadian, Malihe; Ghandil, Pegah; Naseri, Mohsen; Bahrami, Afsane; Momen, Ali Akbar",J Clin Lab Anal,,398
516054,Deep Learning COVID-19 Features on CXR using Limited Training Data Sets,2020,"Since the declaration of the global pandemic of COVID-19 by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, we have continued to see a steady rise in the number of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, there is still very limited data on the course and outcomes of this serious infection in a vulnerable population of pregnant patients and their fetuses. International perinatal societies and institutions including SMFM, ACOG, RCOG, ISUOG, CDC, CNGOF, ISS/SIEOG, and CatSalut have released guidelines for the care of these patients. We aim to summarize these current guidelines in a comprehensive review for patients, healthcare workers, and healthcare institutions. We included 15 papers from 10 societies through a literature search of direct review of society's websites and their journal publications up till 20 April 2020. Recommendations specific to antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum were abstracted from the publications and summarized into Tables. The summary of guidelines for the management of COVID-19 in pregnancy across different perinatal societies is fairly consistent, with some variation in the strength of recommendations. It is important to recognize that these guidelines are frequently updated, as we continue to learn more about the course and impact of COVID-19 in pregnancy.","Narang, Kavita; Ibirogba, Eniola R; Elrefaei, Amro; Trad, Ayssa Teles Abrao; Theiler, Regan; Nomura, Roseli; Picone, Olivier; Kilby, Mark; Escuriet, Ramón; Suy, Anna; Carreras, Elena; Tonni, Gabriele; Ruano, Rodrigo",,,398

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 77 inpatients were grouped into sufficient control group (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] <6.5%, n = 49) and insufficient control group (HbA1c &#8805;6.5%, n = 28). Regression models were used to analyze the clinical data. RESULTS: Compared with patients with HbA1c <6.5, patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5 showed higher heart rate (101 vs 89 b.p.m., P = 0.012), lower percutaneous oxygen saturation (93 vs 97%, P = 0.001), higher levels of multiple indicators of inflammation, such as white blood cell count (7.9 vs 5.9 × 109 /L, P = 0.019), neutrophil count (6.5 vs 4.1 × 109 /L, P = 0.001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (52 vs 30 mg/L, P = 0.025) and serum ferritin (1,287 vs 716 µg/L, P = 0.023), as well as lower levels of lymphocyte count (0.7 vs 0.8 × 109 /L, P = 0.049) at hospital admission. Thus, patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5 were more likely to develop secondary respiratory infections (25 [89%] vs 33 [67%], P = 0.032) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (17 [61%] vs 14 [29%], P = 0.006) than patients with HbA1c <6.5, resulting in a higher proportion of critically ill patients (19 [68%] vs 18 [37%], P = 0.009) and non-survivors (13 [46%] vs 11 [22%], P = 0.029). After adjustment for potential risk factors, HbA1c was independently associated with in-hospital death. CONCLUSION: HbA1c was an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Severe pulmonary infection and consequent acute respiratory distress syndrome might be the primary causes of death in insufficient glycemic control patients.","Liu, Li; Wei, Wang; Yang, Kun; Li, Shengzhong; Yu, Xuefeng; Dong, Chen; Zhang, Benping",J. diabetes investig.

We investigated whether patients with previous CVD have increased risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) when hospitalised for COVID-19. METHODS: We included 839 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the University Hospitals of Geneva. Demographic characteristics, medical history, laboratory values, ECG at admission and medications at admission were collected based on electronic medical records. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality or MACE. RESULTS: Median age was 67 years, 453 (54%) were males and 277 (33%) had history of CVD. In total, 152 (18%) died and 687 (82%) were discharged, including 72 (9%) who survived a MACE. Patients with previous CVD were more at risk of composite outcomes 141/277 (51%) compared with those without CVD 83/562 (15%) (OR=6.0 (95% CI 4.3 to 8.4), p<0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that history of CVD remained an independent risk factor of in-hospital death or MACE (OR=2.4; (95% CI 1.6 to 3.5)), as did age (OR for a 10-year increase=2.2 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.6)), male gender (OR=1.6 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3)), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR=2.1 (95% CI 1.0 to 4.2)) and lung infiltration associated with COVID-19 at CT scan (OR=1.9 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.0)). History of CVD (OR=2.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 5)), age (OR=2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2)), male gender (OR=1.6 (95% CI 0.98 to 2.6)) and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) levels on admission (OR for a 10 mg/L increase=1.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.2)) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: History of CVD is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and MACE in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Other factors associated with higher in-hospital mortality are older age, male sex and elevated CRP on admission.","Tessitore, Elena; Carballo, David; Poncet, Antoine; Perrin, Nils; Follonier, Cedric; Assouline, Benjamin; Carballo, Sebastian; Girardin, François; Mach, Francois",,,398

At that time, the conventional medical system was grappling to cope with the rapidly spreading pandemic. The potential of Ayurveda, one of the branches of traditional Indian medicine (TIM), with a 5000 year old history, employing medicines derived from plants and other natural sources, against COVID-19 has been explored through a comparative retrospective open-label study. Methods: Reported here are the remedial effects of Ayurvedic medicines alone or in combination with Allopathic treatment on 59 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients, across multiple COVID-19 care centers in Ahmedabad, India. The patients were confirmed for COVID-19 infection through RT-qPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. With informed consents from the patients, the sourced data was divided into 'Allopathic and Ayurvedic' [AlloAyur] (n = 41) and 'Ayurvedic only'[Ayur] (n = 18) groups, based on the type of treatment the patients decided to receive, that is Ayurvedic medicines with Allopathic treatment or Ayurvedic medicines alone, respectively. Ayurvedic medicines included oral doses and nasal drops; the dosage and regime were decided based on the recommendations from Ayurvedic texts. The Allopathic medicines included Azithromycin, Vitamin-C and anti-histamines. Acetaminophen was also administered when necessary, by the attending physician. The patients were observed for symptomatic improvement. Results: Primary outcome of this study was the symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Data collected over a period of two months, showed that more patients exhibited symptomatic relief in Ayur goup (83.33%) than in the AlloAyur group (48.78%) within the first 13 days of treatment. No visible adverse effects were observed. This indicated faster and safe symptomatic resolution among those treated with Ayurvedic medicines alone. Conclusion: Patients receiving only Ayurvedic medicines on average were symptomatically relieved faster than those receiving Allopathic and Ayurvedic medicines together.","Balkrishna, Acharya; Bhatt, Aarti Ben; Singh, Pratima; Haldar, Swati; Varshney, Anurag",J Herb Med,,398

Therefore, we used a surrogate viral neutralization test to evaluate their levels in patients with varying severity of illness, in those with prolonged shedding and those with mild/asymptomatic illness at various time points. Patients with severe or moderate COVID-19 illness had earlier appearance of NAbs at higher levels compared to those with mild or asymptomatic illness. Furthermore, those who had prolonged shedding of the virus, had NAbs appearing faster and at higher levels than those who cleared the virus earlier. During the first week of illness the NAb levels of those with mild illness was significantly less (p = 0.01), compared to those with moderate and severe illness. At the end of 4 weeks (28 days), although 89% had NAbs, 38/76 (50%) in those with > 90 days had a negative result for the presence of NAbs. The Ab levels significantly declined during convalescence (> 90 days since onset of illness), compared to 4 to 8 weeks since onset of illness.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional time-series study of clinical virology results from children tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Southern Connecticut and areas of New York and Rhode Island. Data collected include demographics, hospital admission, changes in percent positive tests over time, detection intervals in persistently positive children and cycle threshold values. The setting was the Yale New Haven Health System has 6 hospitals at 4 Connecticut locations, 1 hospital in Rhode Island and ambulatory locations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and New York. Participants included twenty-three-thousand one-hundred thirty-seven children &#8804; 18 years of age, tested for coronavirus disease 2019 at an ambulatory testing site, the emergency department or on an inpatient unit within the Yale New Haven Health System. RESULTS: Among all tests, 3.2% were positive. Older children consistently made up the larger portion of positive pediatric cases, regardless of community prevalence. Increased pediatric cases later in the pandemic when prevalence in adults was relatively low correlates with a higher number of tests performed in children and not with an increased positivity rate. No significant changes in trends of positivity were detected after the reopening of schools. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children had similar cycle threshold values regardless of age, and a subset of children demonstrated persistent viral detection, some for as long as 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: An increase in pediatric cases documented in the late summer was predominately due to increased access to testing for children. The percent positivity in children did not change in the first 3 weeks after school opened. A subset of children has detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract for weeks after the initial infection.","Peaper, David R; Murdzek, Christina; Oliveira, Carlos R; Murray, Thomas S",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,398

Many of these solutions threaten individual rights and privacy. Our goal is to break past the false dichotomy of effective versus privacy-preserving contact tracing. We offer an alternative approach to assess and communicate users' risk of exposure to an infectious disease while preserving individual privacy. Our proposal uses recent GPS location histories, which are transformed and encrypted, and a private set intersection protocol to interface with a semi-trusted authority. There have been other recent proposals for privacy-preserving contact tracing, based on Bluetooth and decentralization, that could further eliminate the need for trust in authority. However, solutions with Bluetooth are currently limited to certain devices and contexts while decentralization adds complexity. The goal of this work is two-fold: we aim to propose a location-based system that is more privacy-preserving than what is currently being adopted by governments around the world, and that is also practical to implement with the immediacy needed to stem a viral outbreak.","Berke, Alex; Bakker, Michiel; Vepakomma, Praneeth; Larson, Kent; Pentland, Alex 'Sandy'",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14412v2.pdf,398

This paper aims to analyze all the challenges which have a significant impact on the teaching method for children with disability. The research was carried out on a qualitative design. Several stages of the investigation were carried out which included a detailed survey of literature and the special education environment in Saudi Arabia. Interviews were conducted with 15 teachers to learn about online learning and restriction imposed during the global pandemic Sampling was carried out based on age, gender, and years of experience. The result showed that shutdown periods were more challenging for students as special education required a lead towards physical responses and the online mode was not suited in Saudi Arabia. It was found that the education infrastructure of the country also had a weak for educational professionals. The study showed that teacher inputs are essential in special education and online mode of education cannot satisfy the requirement of children with disabilities.

The attempts of transplant immunologists have been for long hampered by the large size of the alloreactive T cell repertoire. Understanding how self-TCR can interact with allogeneic MHC is a key to critically appraise the different assays available to analyze the TCR Vβ repertoire usage.

We develop a mathematical model to compute the relative suppression of the effective reproduction number of an epidemic that such measures produce. This outcome is expressed as a function of a small set of parameters that describe the main features of the epidemic and summarize the effectiveness of the isolation measures. In particular, we focus on the impact when a fraction of the population uses a mobile application for epidemic control. Finally, we apply the model to COVID-19, providing several computations as examples, and a link to a public repository to run custom calculations. These computations display in a quantitative manner the importance of recognizing infected individuals from symptoms and contact-tracing information, and isolating them as early as possible. The computations also assess the impact of each variable on the mitigation of the epidemic.","Maiorana, Andrea; Meneghelli, Marco; Resnati, Mario",J Math Biol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-021-01660-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599662/,398
590979,Building alternative consensus trees and supertrees using k-means and Robinson and Foulds distance,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has become one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for the prevention of this condition; however, its use appears to be insufficient. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the missed opportunities for VTE prophylaxis in hospitals that provide maternal healthcare in mainland China. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey-based study, we collected case data on pregnant and puerperal women with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism from January 1st to December 31st, 2019. Demographics, obstetric information, VTE risk assessment scores, and prophylaxis-related information were recorded. Thromboprophylaxis included mobilization, mechanical methods, and treatment with anticoagulants. RESULTS: Data corresponding to a total of 106 cases from 26 hospitals across China were collected, and 100 (94.3%) cases, 75 cases involving deep vein thrombosis and 25 cases involving pulmonary thromboembolism, were included in the final analysis. VTE occurred in 80% of the patients at the postpartum stage, while 20 patients developed the disease during the antenatal stage. Cesarean section, advanced maternal age, and obesity were the most common risk factors related to VTE during the postpartum stage, while a previous VTE-related history was a prominent risk factor among antenatal cases. Up to 75% of the patients had one or more missed opportunities for prophylaxis. The lack of the implementation of mechanical methods (60.8% vs. 24.5%, P < 0.001) and anticoagulant treatment (61.1% vs. 48.7%, P < 0.001) were more common in general hospitals compared to those of specialized hospitals. In women assessed as high-risk, anticoagulant treatment was lacking in 41 (54.7%) cases. More importantly, the lack of the implementation of mechanical methods was more common among women assessed as low-risk (56.0% vs. 38.7%, P < 0.001). Among the antenatal cases, the lack of treatment with anticoagulants (100.0% vs. 48.5%, P < 0.001) and implementation of mechanical methods (70.0% vs. 36.7%, P < 0.001) was highlighted. In addition, the lack of early mobilization was much more prominent among the PTE cases (10.5% vs. 37.5%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: At least one prophylactic opportunity was missed in most of the enrolled Chinese women with VTE during the course of their maternal healthcare. Missed prophylactic opportunities varied with the type of hospitals, risk assessment, onset timing and disease type. Further efforts from patients, healthcare systems, and healthcare providers are needed for improving the implementation of preventative strategies.","Zhao, Zhekun; Zhou, Qiongjie; Li, Xiaotian",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030656/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03863-w,398

The COVID-19 pandemic has given a big boost to the use of telemedicine, as it allows to maintain the physical distance, essential to the containment of contagion having regular health contact. Encouraging results related to the use of telemedicine in women with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, have been recently published. It is well known that hyperglycaemia alters the immune response to infections, that inflammation, in turn, worsens glycaemic control and that any form of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy (HIP) has effects not only on the mother but also on development of the foetus. Therefore, the Italian Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group, together with a group of experts, developed these recommendations in order to guide physicians in the management of HIP, providing specific diagnostic, therapeutic and assistance pathways (PDTAs) for the COVID-19 emergency.

592315,Scalable Analysis of Authentic Viral Envelopes on FRONTERA,2020-08-31,"INTRODUCTION: Injury patterns are closely related to changes in behavior. Pandemics and measures undertaken against them may cause changes in behavior; therefore, changes in injury patterns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak can be expected when compared to the parallel period in previous years. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare injury-related hospitalization patterns during the overall national lockdown period with parallel periods of previous years. METHODS: A retrospective study was completed of all patients hospitalized from March 15 through April 30, for years 2016-2020. Data were obtained from 21 hospitals included in the national trauma registry during the study years. Clinical, demographic, and circumstantial parameters were compared amongst the years of the study. RESULTS: The overall volume of injured patients significantly decreased during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the greatest decrease registered for road traffic collisions (RTCs). Patients’ sex and ethnic compositions did not change, but a smaller proportion of children were hospitalized during the outbreak. Many more injuries were sustained at home during the outbreak, with proportions of injuries in all other localities significantly decreased. Injuries sustained during the COVID-19 outbreak were more severe, specifically due to an increase in severe injuries in RTCs and falls. The proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations did not change, however more surgeries were performed; patients stayed less days in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant decrease in number of patients hospitalized due to trauma as compared to parallel periods of previous years. Nevertheless, trauma remains a major health care concern even during periods of high-impact disease outbreaks, in particular due to increased proportion of severe injuries and surgeries.","Rozenfeld, Michael; Peleg, Kobi; Givon, Adi; Bala, Miklosh; Shaked, Gad; Bahouth, Hany; Bodas, Moran",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33641689/,398

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-IL-6 signaling (anti-IL6/IL-6R/JAK) agents on COVID-19 based on the current evidence. Methods: Studies were identified through systematic searches of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library, ongoing clinical trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov), and preprint servers (medRxiv, ChinaXiv) on August 10, 2020, as well as eligibility checks according to predefined selection criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager (version 5.3) and STATA 12.0. Results: Thirty-one studies were included in the pooled analysis of mortality, and 12 studies were identified for the analysis of risk of secondary infections. For mortality analysis, 5630 COVID-19 cases including 2,132 treated patients and 3,498 controls were analyzed. Anti-IL-6 signaling agents plus standard of care (SOC) significantly decreased the mortality rate compared to SOC alone (pooled OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45–0.84, p = 0.002). For the analysis of secondary infection risk, 1,624 patients with COVID-19 including 639 treated patients and 985 controls were included, showing that anti-IL-6 signaling agents did not increase the rate of secondary infections (pooled OR = 1.21, 95% CI 0.70–2.08, p = 0.50). By contrast, for patients with critical COVID-19 disease, anti-IL-6 signaling agents failed to reduce mortality compared to SOC alone (pooled OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.42–1.33, p = 0.33), but they tended to increase the risk of secondary infections (pooled OR = 1.85, 95% CI 0.95–3.61, p = 0.07). A blockade of IL-6 signaling failed to reduce the mechanical ventilation rate, ICU admission rate, or elevate the clinical improvement rate. Conclusion: IL-6 signaling inhibitors reduced the mortality rate without increasing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19 based on current studies. For patients with critical disease, IL-6 signaling inhibitors did not exhibit any benefit.","Han, Qi; Guo, Mingyue; Zheng, Yue; Zhang, Ying; De, Yanshan; Xu, Changchang; Zhang, Lin; Sun, Ruru; Lv, Ying; Liang, Yan; Xu, Feng; Pang, Jiaojiao; Chen, Yuguo",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.615972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33384605/,398
593208,Tomorrow’s Critical Design Competencies: Building a Course System for 21st Century Designers,2020-08-31,"[Image: see text] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19, is a novel human betacoronavirus that is rapidly spreading worldwide. The outbreak currently includes over 3.7 million cases and 260,000 fatalities. As a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 encodes for a papain-like protease (PLpro) that is likely responsible for cleavage of the coronavirus (CoV) viral polypeptide. The PLpro is also responsible for suppression of host innate immune responses by virtue of its ability to reverse host ubiquitination and ISGylation events. Here, the biochemical activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro against ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) substrates is evaluated, revealing that the protease has a marked reduction in its ability to process K48 linked Ub substrates compared to its counterpart in SARS-CoV. Additionally, its substrate activity more closely mirrors that of the PLpro from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and prefers ISG15s from certain species including humans. Additionally, naphthalene based PLpro inhibitors are shown to be effective at halting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro activity as well as SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Freitas, Brendan T.; Durie, Ian A.; Murray, Jackelyn; Longo, Jaron E.; Miller, Holden C.; Crich, David; Hogan, Robert Jeff; Tripp, Ralph A.; Pegan, Scott D.",ACS Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32428392/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00168,398
596012,Comparing CT scan and chest X-ray imaging for COVID-19 diagnosis,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a recent epidemic human disease, is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). First reported in Asia, SARS quickly spread worldwide through international travelling. As of July 2003, the World Health Organization reported a total of 8,437 people afflicted with SARS with a 9.6% mortality rate. Although immunopathological damages may account for the severity of respiratory distress, little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV. RESULTS: Based on changes in gene expression of peripheral blood, we identified 52 signature genes that accurately discriminated acute SARS patients from non-SARS controls. While a general suppression of gene expression predominated in SARS-infected blood, several genes including those involved in innate immunity, such as defensins and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, were upregulated. Instead of employing clustering methods, we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots (GAP) according to the expression profiles of 52 signature genes. Through this method, we discovered a smooth transition pattern of severity from normal controls to acute SARS patients. The rank of SARS severity was significantly correlated with the recovery period (in days) and with the clinical pulmonary infection score. CONCLUSION: The use of the GAP approach has proved useful in analyzing the complexity and continuity of biological systems. The severity rank derived from the global expression profile of significantly regulated genes in patients may be useful for further elucidating the pathophysiology of their disease.","Lee, Yun-Shien; Chen, Chun-Houh; Chao, Angel; Chen, En-Shih; Wei, Min-Li; Chen, Lung-Kun; Yang, Kuender D; Lin, Meng-Chih; Wang, Yi-Hsi; Liu, Jien-Wei; Eng, Hock-Liew; Chiang, Ping-Cherng; Wu, Ting-Shu; Tsao, Kuo-Chein; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tien, Yin-Jing; Wang, Tzu-Hao; Wang, Hsing-Shih; Lee, Ying-Shiung",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16174304/,398

Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV commonly contains 4 major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Among these, the N protein is known to be the most abundant and multifunctional viral component. Therefore, as the first step toward understanding the biology of PDCoV, the present study investigated functional characteristics and expression dynamics of host proteins in a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PDCoV N protein. Similar to N proteins of other coronaviruses, the PDCoV N protein was found to interact with itself to form non-covalently linked oligomers and was mainly localized to the nucleolus. We then assessed alterations in production levels of proteins in the N-expressing PK (PK-PDCoV-N) cells at different time points by means of proteomic analysis. According to the results of high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a total of 43 protein spots were initially found to be differentially expressed in PK-PDCoV-N cells in comparison with control PK cells. Of these spots, 10 protein spots showed a statistically significant alteration, including 8 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated protein spots and were picked for subsequent protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting following matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The affected cellular proteins that we identified in this study were classified into the functional groups involved in various cellular processes such as cell division, metabolism, the stress response, protein biosynthesis and transport, cytoskeleton networks and cell communication. Notably, two members of the heat shock protein 70 family were found to be up-regulated in PK-PDCoV-N cells. These proteomic data will provide insights into the specific cellular response to the N protein during PDCoV infection.","Lee, Sunhee; Lee, Changhee",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215002786; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.06.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103099/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215002786,398

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: : Citation bias was investigated by assessing the degree of agreement between evidence provided by a remdesivir randomized controlled trial and its citing articles. The dissimilarity of outcomes derived from non-randomized and randomized studies was tested by a meta-analysis of hydroxychloroquine effects on mortality. The differential influence of studies with beneficial over those with neutral results was evaluated by a bibliometric analysis. RESULTS: : The articles citing the ACTT-1 remdesivir trial preferentially presented its positive outcomes in 55.83% and its negative outcomes in 6.43% of cases. The hydroxychloroquine indicated no significant effect by randomized studies, but a significant survival benefit by non-randomized ones. Citation mapping revealed that the study reporting survival benefit from the hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin combination was the most influential, despite subsequent studies reporting potential harmful effects. CONCLUSION: : The present study raises concerns about citation bias and a predilection of reporting beneficial over harmful effects in the Covid-19 treatment research, potentially in the context of white hat bias.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 23rd 2020 and April 6th 2020 at Wuhan JinYinTan Hospital and The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. RESULTS: Among 210 patients, 131 were males (62.4%). The median Age was 64 years (IQR: 56–71). Of 92 (43.8%) patients who developed AKI during hospitalization, 13 (14.1%), 15 (16.3%) and 64 (69.6%) were classified as being at stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 54 patients (58.7%) received continuous renal replacement therapy. Age, sepsis, nephrotoxic drug, invasive mechanical ventilation and elevated baseline serum creatinine levels were associated with the occurrence of AKI. Renal recovery during hospitalization was identified among 16 patients with AKI (17.4%), who had a significantly shorter time from admission to AKI diagnosis, lower incidence of right heart failure and higher ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen. Of 210 patients, 93 deceased within 28 days of ICU admission. AKI stage 3, critical disease, greater Age and the lowest ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen being < 150 mmHg were independently associated with death.

This may result in misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, and lead to further transmission in the community. We aimed to derive early predictors to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza and dengue. The study comprised 126 patients with COVID-19, 171 with influenza and 180 with dengue, who presented within 5 days of symptom onset. All cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests. We used logistic regression models to identify demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory markers in classifying COVID-19 versus influenza, and COVID-19 versus dengue. The performance of each model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Shortness of breath was the strongest predictor in the models for differentiating between COVID-19 and influenza, followed by diarrhoea. Higher lymphocyte count was predictive of COVID-19 versus influenza and versus dengue. In the model for differentiating between COVID-19 and dengue, patients with cough and higher platelet count were at increased odds of COVID-19, while headache, joint pain, skin rash and vomiting/nausea were indicative of dengue. The cross-validated area under the ROC curve for all four models was above 0.85.

We selected four of the big five species, namely; buffalo (Syncerus caffer), elephant (Loxodonta africana), the leopard (Panthera pardus) and lion (Panthera leo) for analysis. Existing database of 188 trophies from 2009 to 2011 was reviewed and recorded using the Safari Club International (SCI) scoring system. Further, 50 trophies for 2012 were measured and recorded based on the SCI scoring system. Local ecological knowledge on trophy quality and hunting effort in CSSA was obtained through semi-structured questionnaires from 22 conveniently selected professional hunters in 2012. The results indicated no significant change in trophy quality trends of buffalo, leopard and lion (p > 0.05) over the study period. In contrast, there was a significant decline in elephant trophy quality trend over the same period (p < 0.05). The results showed no significant change in hunting effort over the study period for all the four study species (p > 0.05). Furthermore, seventy-two percent (72%, n = 13) of the professional hunters confirmed that elephant population was declining in CSSA and this was likely due to poaching. Professional hunters perceived trophy hunting as a source of financial capital generation for wildlife conservation (61%, n = 11), as well as positively contributing to the local economy (56%, n = 10). It was concluded that hunting has limited negative impact on species trophy quality trends when a sustainable hunting system is consistently followed in CSSA.

601033,Chest computed tomography for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection screening for COVID‐19 before emergency and elective upper endoscopy: a pilot study,2020-07-08,"RATIONALE: Patients with coronavirus disease-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) could have a specific physiological phenotype as compared with those affected by ARDS from other causes (NC-ARDS). OBJECTIVES: To describe the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on respiratory mechanics in C-ARDS patients in supine and prone position, and as compared to NC-ARDS. The primary endpoint was the best PEEP defined as the smallest sum of hyperdistension and collapse. METHODS: Seventeen patients with moderate-to-severe C-ARDS were monitored by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and evaluated during PEEP titration in supine (n = 17) and prone (n = 14) position and compared with 13 NC-ARDS patients investigated by EIT in our department before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: As compared with NC-ARDS, C-ARDS exhibited a higher median best PEEP (defined using EIT as the smallest sum of hyperdistension and collapse, 12 [9, 12] vs. 9 [6, 9] cmH(2)O, p < 0.01), more collapse at low PEEP, and less hyperdistension at high PEEP. The median value of the best PEEP was similar in C-ARDS in supine and prone position: 12 [9, 12] vs. 12 [10, 15] cmH(2)O, p = 0.59. The response to PEEP was also similar in C-ARDS patients with higher vs. lower respiratory system compliance. CONCLUSION: An intermediate PEEP level seems appropriate in half of our C-ARDS patients. There is no solid evidence that compliance at low PEEP could predict the response to PEEP.","Perier, François; Tuffet, Samuel; Maraffi, Tommaso; Alcala, Glasiele; Victor, Marcus; Haudebourg, Anne-Fleur; Razazi, Keyvan; De Prost, Nicolas; Amato, Marcelo; Carteaux, Guillaume; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03414-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287864/,398

This polymer was obtained by ring-opening polymerization of the lactide initiated by selected low-toxic zinc complexes, Zn[(acac)(L)H(2)O], where L represents N-(pyridin-4-ylmethylene) tryptophan or N-(2-pyridin-4-ylethylidene) phenylalanine. These complexes were obtained by reaction of Zn[(acac)(2) H(2)O] and Schiff bases, the products of the condensation of amino acids and 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde. The composition, structure, and geometry of the synthesized complexes were determined by NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and molecular modeling. Both complexes showed the geometry of a distorted trigonal bipyramid. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of both complexes were found to be much stronger than those of the primary Schiff bases. The present study showed a higher efficiency of polymerization when initiated by the obtained zinc complexes than when initiated by the zinc(II) acetylacetonate complex. The synthesized polylactide showed antibacterial properties, especially the product obtained by polymerization initiated by a zinc(II) complex with a ligand based on l-phenylalanine. The polylactide showed a particularly strong antimicrobial effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aspergillus brasiliensis.

The number of cases changes quickly and varies depending upon which source you use to track, so in the current epidemiological context, the early recognition is critical for the rapid identification of suspected cases (with SARS-CoV-2 infection-like symptoms and signs) to be immediately subjected to quarantine measures. Although surveys are widely used for identifying COVID-19 cases, outcomes and associated risks, no validated epidemiological tool exists for surveying SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population so far. Methods Our study is the phase II of the EPICOVID19 national survey, launched in April 2020 including a national convenience sample of 201121 adults, who voluntarily filled the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. The phase II questionnaire was mailed to all subjects who underwent tests for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and who accepted to be involved in the second phase of the study, focused on the results reported for NPS and/or serological IgG/IgM tests. We evaluated the capability of the self-reported symptoms collected through the EPICOVID19 questionnaire to discriminate the COVID-19 among symptomatic subjects, in order to identify possible cases to undergo instrumental measurements and clinical examinations. We defined a method for the identification of a total score and validated it with reference to the serological and molecular clinical diagnosis, using four standard steps: identification of critical factors, confirmation of presence of latent variable, development of optimal scoring algorithm and validation of the scoring algorithm. Findings 2703 subjects [66% response rate] completed the Phase II questionnaire. Of 2703 individuals, 694 (25.7%) were NPS(+) and of these 84 (12.1% of the 694 NPS(+)) were asymptomatic. In the individuals who performed serological testing, of the 472 who did IgG(+) and 421 who did IgM(+), 22.9% and 11.6% tested positive, respectively. Among IgG(+) 1 of 108 subjects was asymptomatic (0.9%) while 5/49 subjects among IgM(+) were asymptomatic (10.2%). Compared with NPS(-), among NPS(+) subjects there was a higher rate for Fever (421 [60.7%] vs 391[19.5% ]; p<0.0001), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (365 [52.6%] vs 239 [11.9% ]; p<0.0001) and Cough (352 [50.7%] vs 580 [28.9% ]; p<0.0001). Also for other symptoms the frequencies were significantly higher in NPS(+) subjects than in NPS(-) ones (p<0.001). Among groups with serological tests, the symptoms with higher percentages in the subjects IgG(+) were Fever (65 [60.2%] vs 43[11.8% ]; p<0.0001) and Pain in muscles, bones, joints (73 [67.6%] vs 71 [19.5% ]; p<0.0001). For the COVID-19 self-reported symptoms items, exploratory (proportion variance explained [89.9%]) and confirmatory factor analysis results (SMSR 0.072; RMSEA 0.052) highlights the presence of one latent variable (factor) underlying the symptoms. We define the one-factor solution as EPICOVID19 diagnostic scale and optimal score for each items was identified: Respiratory problems (1.03), Chest pain (1.07), Loss of Taste and/or Smell (0.97) and Tachycardia (palpitations) (1.05) were the most important symptoms. The cut-off score was 2.56 (Sensitivity 76.56%; Specificity 68.24%) in NPS(+) and 2.59 (Se 80.37; Sp 80.17) in IgG(+) subjects.","Bastiani, L.; Fortunato, L.; Pieroni, S.; Bianchi, F.; Adorni, F.; Prinelli, F.; Giacomelli, A.; Pagani, G.; Maggi, S.; Trevisan, C.; Noale, M.; Jesuthasan, N.; Sojic, A.; Pettenati, C.; Andreoni, M.; Antonelli Incalzi, R.; Galli, M.; Molinaro, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.20159590; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.22.20159590v1?rss=1,398

Most individuals (>80%) have mild symptoms and recover in the outpatient setting, but detailed studies of immune responses have focused primarily on moderate to severe COVID-19. We deeply profiled the longitudinal immune response in individuals with mild COVID-19 beginning with early time points post-infection (1-15 days) and proceeding through convalescence to >100 days after symptom onset. We correlated data from single cell analyses of peripheral blood cells, serum proteomics, virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses, and clinical metadata. Acute infection was characterized by vigorous coordinated innate and adaptive immune activation that differed in character by age (young vs. old). We then characterized signals associated with recovery and convalescence to define and validate a new signature of inflammatory cytokines, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility that persists in individuals with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).","Talla, Aarthi; Vasaikar, Suhas V.; Lemos, Maria P.; Moodie, Zoe; Lee Pebworth, Mark-Phillip; Henderson, Kathy E.; Cohen, Kristen W.; Czartoski, Julie L.; Lai, Lilin; Suthar, Mehul S.; Heubeck, Alexander T; Genge, Palak C.; Roll, Charles R.; Weiss, Morgan; Reading, Julian; Kondza, Nina; MacMillan, Hugh; Fong, Olivia C.; Thomson, Zachary James; Graybuck, Lucas T.; Okada, Lauren Y.; Newell, Evan W.; Coffey, Ernest M.; Meijer, Paul; Becker, Lynne A.; De Rosa, Stephen C.; Skene, Peter J.; Torgerson, Troy R.; Li, Xiao-jun; Szeto, Gregory Lee; McElrath, M.

Methods: A total of 1099 preschoolers, children and adolescents (aged 3–17 years) from Spain (12.1 ± 4.6 years) and Brazil (10.7 ± 4.3 years) were included. An online survey was created and distributed in each country using a snowball sampling strategy. This online survey was completed by parents (mother/father/responsible guardian). Results: The proportion of the sample who met the PA and ST recommendations decreased during the COVID-19 lockdown in both Spanish and Brazilian samples (p < 0.001), while sleep duration increased (p < 0.001). The proportion of the sample meeting the overall 24-h movement guidelines was very low before the lockdown (Spain 3.0%; Brazil 11.7%) and even worse during the lockdown (Spain 0.3%; Brazil 7.5%). Conclusions: The prevalence of preschoolers, children and adolescents in both the Spain and Brazil samples meeting the 24-h movement guidelines during COVID-19 restrictions was as low as previous studies in other countries.

The aim of this paper is to quantify the impact of the pandemic on the cancer care line in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina. METHOD: It is an observational cross-sectional study comparing the impact on selected variables of the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic periods. The formula of percentage variation was used to show the differences. The positivity index was calculated and expressed as a percentage. The proportions of both periods were compared through the chi-squared test and its p-value. RESULTS: Reductions were observed in all the variables under study. However, the deeper impact was evident in screening, with 56%–87% decreases in the number of procedures carried out. A 26% reduction was seen in diagnosis. Treatment was the variable with the least impact, with a 3% decrease. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 as well as the measures taken to reduce its impact caused alterations in the cancer care line in the province, with clear differences according to the variable under study. Measures related to cancer screening were displaced, prioritising the care of patients already diagnosed and treated. CONCLUSION: Considering the new increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, it is essential to adapt the healthcare system, and design new innovative strategies to reduce long-term consequences.","de Degani, Graciela Lopez; Duarte, Leandro; Ismael, Julia; Martinez, Laura; López, Florencia",Ecancermedicalscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567255/; https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1270,398

605424,Severity Prediction for COVID-19 Patients via Recurrent Neural Networks,2021-01-21,"The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to vaccination in many parts of the world for herd immunity, and as vaccination has progressed, several rare adverse events have been reported. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been reported to be one of the rare adverse events caused by vaccination with MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine and influenza vaccine. In addition, ITP has been reported to occur in a small number of cases associated with the COVID-19 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine. However, there are few reports on the details of the treatment and clinical course; optimal treatment has not yet been established. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman who developed ITP after receiving Pfizer-BioNTech’s BNT162b2 vaccine. She had generalized subcutaneous hemorrhage, 14 days after vaccination. At the time of our visit, she had marked thrombocytopenia and intraoral bleeding; she was diagnosed with ITP. Treatment with oral steroids was started and the platelet count promptly improved after 4 days of treatment. Since the response to treatment was very good, we tapered off the steroids. As these vaccines will be increasingly used in the future, it is important to recognize ITP as a possible adverse event.","Akiyama, Hiroaki; Kakiuchi, Seiji; Rikitake, Junpei; Matsuba, Hiroyuki; Sekinada, Daisuke; Kozuki, Yoko; Iwata, Nobuko",IDCases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01245; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214250921002018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214250921002018?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381692/,398

The uptake of genome-editing technologies in plant breeding greatly depends on how governments regulate its use. Some major agricultural production countries have already developed regulatory approaches that enable the application of genome editing for crop improvement, while other governments are in the early stages of formulating policy. Central to the discussion is the principle of “like products should be treated in like ways” and the subsequent utilization of exclusions and exemptions from the scope of GMO regulations for these products. In some countries, the outcomes of genome editing that could also have been achieved through conventional breeding have been defined as not needing GMO regulatory oversight. In this paper, we provide a short overview of plant breeding and the history of plant biotechnology policy development, the different classes of current regulatory systems and their use of exemptions and exclusions for genome-edited plants, and the potential benefits of such approaches as it relates to achieving societal goals.","Jenkins, Daniel; Dobert, Raymond; Atanassova, Ana; Pavely, Chloe",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Plant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429575/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11627-021-10201-4,398

METHODS: Here we evaluated the performance of 6 different sample-to-answer SARS-CoV-2 detection methods—Roche cobas 6800, Cepheid GeneXpert, Diasorin Simplexa, Luminex Aries emergency use authorization (EUA), Luminex Aries research use only (RUO), and bioMérieux BioFire—in clinical specimens with a range of viral loads. RESULTS: The positive percentage agreement between the Roche cobas 6800 and GeneXpert was 100%, Diasorin 95%, Aries EUA 74%, Aries RUO 83%, and BioFire 97%. Notably, in samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values below 30 for the E gene on the Roche cobas 6800 platform, we found 100% positive agreement among all platforms. Given these results, we examined the distribution of over 10 000 Ct values of all positive specimens from individuals at our institution on the Roche cobas platform. Nearly 60% of specimens from asymptomatic individuals had a PCR Ct value >30 as measured using the cobas 6800 assay E gene.

We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: 1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; 2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; 3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; 4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; 5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient. Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.","Day, Andrew T.; Sher, David J.; Lee, Rebecca C.; Truelson, John M.; Myers, Larry L.; Sumer, Baran D.; Stankova, Lenka; Tillman, Brittny N.; Hughes, Randall S.; Khan, Saad A.; Gordin, Eli A.",Oral Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330858/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104684; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837520301202?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1368837520301202,398

However, thanks to the integration of ultrasound-aided navigation used for indoor UAV flight planning and development in sensorics, the acquired magnetic field images can be further used, for example, to enhance indoor UAV navigation based on the physical quantities of the image or for the identification of risk areas in manufacturing or industrial halls, where workers can be exposed to high values of electromagnetic fields. The knowledge of the spatial distribution of magnetic fields can also provide valuable information from the perspective of the technical cleanliness. This paper presents results achieved with the original fluxgate magnetometer developed and specially modified for integration on the UAV. Since the magnetometer had a wider frequency range of measurement, up to 250 Hz, the DC (Direct Current) magnetic field and low frequency industrial components could be evaluated. From the obtained data, 3D magnetic field images using spline interpolation algorithms written in the Python programming language were created.

616595,A shallow defence of a technocracy of artificial intelligence: Examining the political harms of algorithmic governance in the domain of government,2020-06-08,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the structure and working of viral fusion machinery. The entry of enveloped viruses into cells requires the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, driven by conformational changes in viral glycoproteins. Structural studies have defined three classes of viral membrane fusion proteins. Despite their different structural organizations, all seem to have a common mechanism of action that generates the same lipid organizations during the fusion pathway. The entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires binding of the virus to one or more receptors present at the cell surface, followed by fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. These steps are mediated by virally encoded glycoproteins that promote both receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The first crystal structure of a viral fusion protein ectodomain that has been determined is that of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) in its prefusion conformation. The structures of viral fusion glycoproteins, of which the conformational change is triggered at low pH, has allowed the identification of amino acid residues that play the role of pH-sensitive molecular switches.","Albertini, Aurélie; Bressanelli, Stéphane; Lepault, Jean; Gaudin, Yves",Current Topics in Membranes,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123858917000039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123858917000039; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-385891-7.00003-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771495/,398
617291,Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19 Using Deep Learning and Data Augmentation on Chest CT,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND: During the early stages of the 2009 swine flu (influenza H1N1) outbreak, the large majority of patients who contacted the health services about the illness did not have it. In the UK, the NHS Direct telephone service was used by many of these patients. We used qualitative interviews to identify the main reasons why people approached NHS Direct with concerns about swine flu and to identify aspects of their contact which were reassuring, using a framework approach. METHODS: 33 patients participated in semi-structured interviews. All patients had telephoned NHS Direct between 11 and 14 May with concerns about swine flu and had been assessed as being unlikely to have the illness. RESULTS: Reasons for seeking advice about swine flu included: the presence of unexpectedly severe flu-like symptoms; uncertainties about how one can catch swine flu; concern about giving it to others; pressure from friends or employers; and seeking 'peace of mind.' Most participants found speaking to NHS Direct reassuring or useful. Helpful aspects included: having swine flu ruled out; receiving an alternative explanation for symptoms; clarification on how swine flu is transmitted; and the perceived credibility of NHS Direct. No-one reported anything that had increased their anxiety and only one participant subsequently sought additional advice about swine flu from elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Future major incidents involving other forms of chemical, biological or radiological hazards may also cause large numbers of unexposed people to seek health advice. Our data suggest that providing telephone triage and information is helpful in such instances, particularly where advice can be given via a trusted, pre-existing service.","Rubin, G James; Amlôt, Richard; Carter, Holly; Large, Shirley; Wessely, Simon; Page, Lisa",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20678192/,398

Various deletions surrounding the FCS have been identified in patients. When SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells, it acquired deletions surrounding the FCS. We studied the viral transcriptome in Vero cell-derived SARS-CoV-2-infected primary human airway epithelia (HAE) cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI) with an emphasis on the viral genome stability of the FCS. While we found overall the viral transcriptome is similar to that generated from infected Vero cells, we identified a high percentage of mutated viral genome and transcripts in HAE-ALI. Two highly frequent deletions were found at the FCS region: a 12 amino acid deletion ((678)TNSPRRAR↓SVAS(689)) that contains the underlined FCS and a 5 amino acid deletion ((675)QTQTN(679)) that is two amino acids upstream of the FCS. Further studies on the dynamics of the FCS deletions in apically released virions from 11 infected HAE-ALI cultures of both healthy and lung disease donors revealed that the selective pressure for the FCS maintains the FCS stably in 9 HAE-ALI cultures but with 2 exceptions, in which the FCS deletions are retained at a high rate of >40% after infection of ≥13 days. Our study presents evidence for the role of unique properties of human airway epithelia in the dynamics of the FCS region during infection of human airways, which is likely donor dependent.","Zou, Wei; Xiong, Min; Hao, Siyuan; Zhang, Elizabeth Yan; Baumlin, Nathalie; Kim, Michael D.; Salathe, Matthias; Yan, Ziying; Qiu, Jianming",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01006-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33975939/,398

The signals that lead to the production of extracellular ISG15 and the relationship between its two core functions remain unclear. We show that both epithelial cells and lymphocytes can secrete ISG15, which then signals in either an autocrine or paracrine manner to LFA-1-expressing cells. Microbial pathogens and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists result in both IFN-β-dependent and -independent secretion of ISG15, and residues required for ISG15 secretion are mapped. Intracellular ISGylation inhibits secretion, and viral effector proteins, influenza B NS1, and viral de-ISGylases, including SARS-CoV-2 PL(pro), have opposing effects on secretion of ISG15. These results establish extracellular ISG15 as a cytokine-like protein that bridges early innate and IFN-γ-dependent immune responses, and indicate that pathogens have evolved to differentially inhibit the intracellular and extracellular functions of ISG15.","Swaim, Caleb D.; Canadeo, Larissa A.; Monte, Kristen J.; Khanna, Swati; Lenschow, Deborah J.; Huibregtse, Jon M.",Cell Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221112472030752X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107772; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221112472030752X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32553163/,398

622456,Teaching the “how” of transformation,2021-05-13,"Viral recombination can generate novel genotypes with unique phenotypic characteristics, including transmissibility and virulence. Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, there is limited evidence of recombination between SARS-CoV-2 strains. By identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure, we developed a lightweight approach for detecting recombinant genomes. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried, we detect 1175 putative recombinants that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in these detected cases. An analysis of these detected cases did not reveal any evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although most recombinant genotypes were detected a limited number of times, at least two recombinants are now widely transmitted. Recombinant genomes were also found to contain substitutions of concern for elevated transmissibility and lower vaccine efficacy, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades, and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 5% of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant. While the phenotypic characterization of detected recombinants was beyond the scope of our analysis, the identification of transmitted recombinants involving substitutions of concern underscores the need to sustain efforts to monitor the emergence of new genotypes generated through recombination.","VanInsberghe, David; Neish, Andrew S.; Lowen, Anice C.; Koelle, Katia",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758853/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.05.238386,398

The aim of this study was to compare the activity of our EGS service before and after these changes. METHODS Patients referred by the emergency department were identified prospectively over a 4-week period beginning from the date our EGS service was reconfigured (COVID) and compared with patients identified retrospectively from the same period the previous year (Pre-COVID), and followed up for 30 days. Data were extracted from handover documents and electronic care records. The primary outcomes were the rate of admission, ambulation and discharge. RESULTS There were 281 and 283 patients during the Pre-COVID and COVID periods respectively. Admission rate decreased from 78.7% to 41.7%, while there were increased rates of ambulation from 7.1% to 17.3% and discharge from 6% to 22.6% (all p<0.001). For inpatients, mean duration of admission decreased (6.9 to 4.8 days), and there were fewer operative or endoscopic interventions (78 to 40). There were increased ambulatory investigations (11 to 39) and telephone reviews (0 to 39), while early computed tomography scan was increasingly used to facilitate discharge (5% vs 34.7%). There were no differences in 30-day readmission or mortality.

622733,Supporting Remote Survey Data Analysis by Co-researchers with Learning Disabilities through Inclusive and Creative Practices and Data Science Approaches.,2021-06-01,"We consider testing strategies for active SARS-CoV-2 infection for a large university community population, which we define. Components of such a strategy include individuals tested because they self-select or are recommended for testing by a health care provider for their own health care; individuals tested because they belong to a high-risk group where testing serves to disrupt transmission; and, finally, individuals randomly selected for testing from the university community population as part of a proactive community testing, or surveillance, program. The proactive community testing program is predicated on a mobile device application that asks individuals to self-monitor COVID-like symptoms daily. The goals of this report are (i) to provide a framework for estimating prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the university community wherein proactive community testing is a major component of the overall strategy, (ii) to address the issue of how many tests should be performed as part of the proactive community testing program, and (iii) to consider how effective proactive community testing will be for purposes of detection of new disease clusters. We argue that a comprehensive prevalence estimate informed by all testing done of the university community is a good metric to obtain a global picture of campus SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at a particular point in time and to monitor the dynamics of infection over time, for example, estimating the population-level reproductive number, R0). Importantly, the prevalence metric can be useful to campus leadership for decision making. One example involves comparing campus prevalence to that in the broader off-campus community. We also show that under some reasonable assumptions, we can obtain valid statements about the comprehensive prevalence by only testing symptomatic persons in the proactive community testing component. The number of tests performed for individual-level and high-risk group-level needs will depend on the disease dynamics, individual needs, and testing availability. For purposes of this report, we assume that, for these groups of individuals, inferential precision --- that is, the accuracy with which we can estimate the true prevalence from testing a random sample of individuals --- does not drive decisions on the number of tests. On the other hand, for proactive community testing, the desired level of inferential precision {in a fixed period of time can be used to justify the number of tests to perform {in that period. For example, our results show that, if we establish a goal of ruling out with 98% confidence a background prevalence of 2% {in a given week, and the actual prevalence is 1% among those eligible for proactive community testing, we would need to test 835 randomly-selected symptomatics (i.e., those presenting with COVID-like symptoms) per week via the proactive community testing program in a campus of 80k individuals. In addition to justifying decisions about the number of tests to perform, inferential precision can formalize the intuition that testing of symptomatic individuals should be prioritized over testing asymptomatic individuals in the proactive community testing program.","Rathouz, P.

Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and umifenovir (Arbidol) to treat COVID-19 patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial involving adult patients with COVID-19. Enrolled patients with initial symptoms within 12 days were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive conventional therapy plus Arbidol (200 mg*3/day) or favipiravir (1600 mg*2/first day followed by 600 mg*2/day) for 7 days. The primary outcome was the clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration (relief for pyrexia and cough, respiratory frequency ≤24 times/min; oxygen saturation ≥98%). Latency to relief for pyrexia and cough and the rate of auxiliary oxygen therapy (AOT) or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NMV)/mechanical ventilation (MV) were the secondary outcomes. Safety data were collected for 17 days. Results: A total of 240 enrolled COVID-19 patients underwent randomization; 120 patients were assigned to receive favipiravir (116 assessed), and 120 patients were assigned to receive Arbidol (120 assessed). The clinical recovery rate at day 7 of drug administration did not significantly differ between the favipiravir group (71/116) and Arbidol group (62/120) (p = 0.1396, difference in recovery rate: 0.0954; 95% CI: −0.0305∼0.2213). Favipiravir contributed to relief for both pyrexia (difference: 1.70 days, p < 0.0001) and cough (difference: 1.75 days, p < 0.0001). No difference was observed in the AOT or NMV/MV rate (both p > 0.05). The most frequently observed favipiravir-associated adverse event was increased serum uric acid (16/116, OR: 5.52, p = 0.0014). Conclusion: Among patients with COVID-19, favipiravir, compared to Arbidol, did not significantly improve the clinical recovery rate at day 7.

622952,Physical and Chemical Methods for the Reduction of Biological Hazards in Animal Feeds,2017-10-27,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has led to a global pandemic. The United States has been severely affected, accounting for the most COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. Without a coordinated national public health plan informed by surveillance with actionable metrics, the United States has been ineffective at preventing and mitigating the escalating COVID-19 pandemic. Existing surveillance has incomplete ascertainment and is limited by the use of standard surveillance metrics. Although many COVID-19 data sources track infection rates, informing prevention requires capturing the relevant dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop dynamic metrics for public health surveillance that can inform worldwide COVID-19 prevention efforts. Advanced surveillance techniques are essential to inform public health decision making and to identify where and when corrective action is required to prevent outbreaks. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted COVID-19 data from global public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers for our use case in 50 US states and the District of Colombia as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Examination of the United States and state data demonstrated that most US states are experiencing outbreaks as measured by these new metrics of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Larger US states have high COVID-19 caseloads as a function of population size, density, and deficits in adherence to public health guidelines early in the epidemic, and other states have alarming rates of speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence in novel infections. North and South Dakota have had the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission combined with positive acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence. Wisconsin and Illinois also have alarming indicators and already lead the nation in daily new COVID-19 infections. As the United States enters its third wave of COVID-19, all 50 states and the District of Colombia have positive rates of speed between 7.58 (Hawaii) and 175.01 (North Dakota), and persistence, ranging from 4.44 (Vermont) to 195.35 (North Dakota) new infections per 100,000 people. CONCLUSIONS: Standard surveillance techniques such as daily and cumulative infections and deaths are helpful but only provide a static view of what has already occurred in the pandemic and are less helpful in prevention. Public health policy that is informed by dynamic surveillance can shift the country from reacting to COVID-19 transmissions to being proactive and taking corrective action when indicators of speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence remain positive week over week. Implicit within our dynamic surveillance is an early warning system that indicates when there is problematic growth in COVID-19 transmissions as well as signals when growth will become explosive without action. A public health approach that focuses on prevention can prevent major outbreaks in addition to endorsing effective public health policies. Moreover, subnational analyses on the dynamics of the pandemic allow us to zero in on where transmissions are increasing, meaning corrective action can be applied with precision in problematic areas. Dynamic public health surveillance can inform specific geographies where quarantines are necessary while preserving the economy in other US areas.","Post, Lori Ann; Issa, Tariq Ziad; Boctor, Michael J; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert L; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Faber, Joshua Marco Mitchell; Culler, Kasen; Brandt, Cynthia A; Oehmke, James Francis",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216726/,398

624096,Tracking droplets in soft granular flows with deep learning techniques,2021-08-21,"Following its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic resulting in unprecedented efforts to reduce transmission and develop therapies and vaccines (WHO Emergency Committee, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Rapidly generated viral genome sequences have allowed the spread of the virus to be tracked via phylogenetic analysis (Hadfield et al., 2018; Pybus et al., 2020; Worobey et al., 2020). While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced, allowing continent-specific variants to emerge. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020, and the impact of this travel on the epidemic is not well understood. Here we report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20A.EU1, that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread to multiple locations in Europe, accounting for the majority of sequences by autumn. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility of this variant, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel across Europe, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant’s success. Despite travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we estimate 20A.EU1 was introduced hundreds of times to countries across Europe by summertime travellers, likely undermining local efforts to keep SARS-CoV-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes.","Hodcroft, Emma B.; Zuber, Moira; Nadeau, Sarah; Crawford, Katharine H.

METHODS: To simulate the clinical aerosol transmission route, hDPP4 transgenic mice were infected with MERS‐CoV by an animal nose‐only exposure device and compared with instillation‐inoculated mice. The challenged mice were observed for 14 consecutive days and necropsied on days 3, 5, 7, and 9 to analyze viral load, histopathology, viral antigen distribution, and cytokines in tissues. RESULTS: MERS‐CoV aerosol‐infected mice with an incubation period of 5‐7 days showed weight loss on days 7‐11, obvious lung lesions on day 7, high viral loads in the lungs on days 3‐9 and in the brain on days 7‐9, and 60% survival. MERS‐CoV instillation‐inoculated mice exhibited clinical signs on day 1, obvious lung lesions on days 3‐5, continuous weight loss, 0% survival by day 5, and high viral loads in the lungs and brain on days 3‐5. Viral antigen and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected in the aerosol and instillation groups. Disease, lung lesion, and viral replication progressions were slower in the MERS‐CoV aerosol‐infected mice than in the MERS‐CoV instillation‐inoculated mice. CONCLUSION: hDPP4 transgenic mice were successfully infected with MERS‐CoV aerosols via an animal nose‐only exposure device, and aerosol‐ and instillation‐infected mice simulated the clinical symptoms of moderate diffuse interstitial pneumonia.

A blood sample was collected from each subject for serum analysis for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Of 3,013 tested individuals, a total 2,932 were included in the analysis due to some missing data. Observed prevalence of 1.06% (31 antibody positive cases), adjusted prevalence of 1.13% for test sensitivity and specificity were identified. Significant group differences between positive vs. negative were observed for age (z = 2.65, p = .008), race (p = .037), presence of fever (p < .001) and loss of smell (p < .001). Possible explanation for this low prevalence includes a relatively low local geographic community prevalence (~4.4%) at the time of testing, the hospital's timely procurement of personal protective equipment, rigorous employee education, patient triage and treatment protocol development and implementation. In addition, possible greater presence of cross-reactive adaptive T cell mediated immunity in healthcare workers vs. the general population may have contributed. Determining antibody prevalence in front-line workers, and duration of antibody presence may help stratify the workforce for risk, establish better health place policies and procedures, and potentially better mitigate transmission.","Brant-Zawadzki, M.; Fridman, D.; Robinson, P.; Zahn, M.; German, R.; Breit, M.; Hara, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.20158329v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158329,398

Historical and ongoing macro-level policies and forces over time have induced disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among Black women and birthing people, and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors continue to hold particular consequence. These factors induce detrimental psychological, health, and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people, as policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare contexts. The resulting consequences may form a ‘vicious cycle’, with upstream impacts that exacerbate upstream macro-level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population. Understanding the impacts of COVID-19 among Black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that can sufficiently conceptualize their multi-level, interacting, and dynamic nature. Thus, we advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities research and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. These perspectives can enable a holistic and nuanced understanding of the intersection of endemic and COVID-19-specific vulnerabilities and disparities experienced by Black women and birthing people. Syndemic-informed research can then lead to impactful multi-level prevention strategies that simultaneously tackle both endemic and COVID-19-specific factors and outcomes that lead to the clustering of vulnerabilities and disparities over time.","Lemke, Michael Kenneth; Brown, Kyrah K.",Matern Child Health J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-02983-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696248/,398

627901,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches to Analyze and Detect COVID-19: A Review,2021-04-20,"STING is a nodal point for cellular innate immune response to microbial infections, autoimmunity and cancer; it triggers the synthesis of the antiviral proteins, type I interferons. Many DNA viruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV1), trigger STING signaling causing inhibition of virus replication. Here, we report that HSV1 evades this antiviral immune response by inducing a cellular microRNA, miR-24, which binds to the 3’ untranslated region of STING mRNA and inhibits its translation. Expression of the gene encoding miR-24 is induced by the transcription factor AP1 and activated by MAP kinases in HSV1-infected cells. Introduction of exogenous miR-24 or prior activation of MAPKs, causes further enhancement of HSV1 replication in STING-expressing cells. Conversely, transfection of antimiR-24 inhibits virus replication in those cells. HSV1 infection of mice causes neuropathy and death; using two routes of infection, we demonstrated that intracranial injection of antimiR-24 alleviates both morbidity and mortality of the infected mice. Our studies reveal a new immune evasion strategy adopted by HSV1 through the regulation of STING and demonstrates that it can be exploited to enhance STING’s antiviral action.","Sharma, Nikhil; Wang, Chenyao; Kessler, Patricia; Sen, Ganes C.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591940/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009950,398

The perception that there is paucity of evidence on the cost-effectiveness of public health programmes is seen as a barrier to policy change. The aim of this scoping review is to conduct a census of economic evaluations in primary prevention in order to identify and map the existing evidence. METHODS: This review is an update of a prior census and will include full economic evaluations of primary prevention programmes conducted in a community-based setting that were published between 2014 and 2019. The search of electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase, and NHS-EED for 2014) will be supplemented by a search for grey literature in OpenGrey and a search of the reference lists of reviews of economic evaluations identified in our searches. Retrieved citations will be imported into Covidence® and independently screened in a two-stage process by two reviewers (abstracts and full papers). Any disagreements on the eligibility of a citation will be resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Included studies will then be categorised by one independent reviewer according to a four-part typology covering the type of health promotion intervention, the risk factor being tackled, the setting in which the intervention took place and the population most affected by the intervention. New to this version of the census, we will also document whether or not the intervention sets out specifically to address inequalities in health. DISCUSSION: This review will produce an annotated bibliography of all economic evaluations plus a report summarising the current scope and content of the economic evidence (highlighting where it is plentiful and where it is lacking) and describing any changes in the type of economic evidence available for the various categories of disease prevention programmes since the last census. This will allow us to identify where future evaluative efforts should be focused to enhance the economic evidence base regarding primary prevention interventions.

Recent reports indicate an increased rate of fungal coinfections during COVID-19. With incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and without any causative therapy available, secondary infections may be detrimental to the prognosis. We monitored 11 COVID-19 patients with ARDS for their immune phenotype, plasma cytokines, and clinical parameters on the day of ICU admission and on day 4 and day 7 of their ICU stay. Whole blood stimulation assays with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes (HKLM), Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans were used to mimic secondary infections, and changes in immune phenotype and cytokine release were assessed. COVID-19 patients displayed an immune phenotype characterized by increased HLA-DR(+)CD38(+) and PD-1(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and elevated CD8(+)CD244(+) lymphocytes, compared to healthy controls. Monocyte activation markers and cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-10, and sIL2Rα were elevated, corresponding to monocyte activation syndrome, while IL-1β levels were low. LPS, HKLM and Aspergillus fumigatus antigen stimulation provoked an immune response that did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, while COVID-19 patients showed an attenuated monocyte CD80 upregulation and abrogated release of IL-6, TNF, IL-1α, and IL-1β toward Candida albicans. This study adds further detail to the characterization of the immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients and hints at an increased susceptibility for Candida albicans infection.","Moser, Dominique; Biere, Katharina; Han, Bing; Hoerl, Marion; Schelling, Gustav; Choukér, Alexander; Woehrle, Tobias",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.640644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717195/,398

631299,409 Dynamic Phenotype Learning: A Novel Machine Learning Approach To Develop And Discover New OSA Sub-Types,2021-05-03,"How host cells recognize many kinds of RNA and DNA viruses and initiate innate antiviral responses against them has not yet been fully elucidated. Over the past decade, investigations into the mechanisms underlying these antiviral responses have focused extensively on immune surveillance sensors that recognize virus‐derived components (such as lipids, sugars and nucleic acids). The findings of these studies have suggested that antiviral responses are mediated by cytosolic or intracellular compartment sensors and their adaptor molecules (e.g., TLR, myeloid differentiation primary response 88, retinoic acid inducible gene‐I, IFN‐β promoter stimulator‐1, cyclic GMP‐AMP synthase and stimulator of IFN genes axis) for the primary sensing of virus‐derived nucleic acids, leading to production of type I IFNs, pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by the host cells. Thus, host cells have evolved an elaborate host defense machinery to recognize and eliminate virus infections. In turn, to achieve sustained viral infection and induce pathogenesis, viruses have also evolved several counteracting strategies for achieving immune escape by targeting immune sensors, adaptor molecules, intracellular kinases and transcription factors. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries concerning the role of the cytosolic nucleic acid‐sensing immune response in viral recognition and control of viral infection. In addition, we consider the regulatory machinery of the cytosolic nucleic acid‐sensing immune response because these immune surveillance systems must be tightly regulated to prevent aberrant immune responses to self and non‐self‐nucleic acids.","Abe, Takayuki; Marutani, Yuki; Shoji, Ikuo",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677166/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12669,398

Healthcare systems which are unprepared to properly deal with crises are much more likely to expose their public health workers and health personnel to harm and will not be able to deliver healthcare provisions in critical situations. This can lead to a drammatic toll of deaths, even in developed countries. The possible occurrence of global crises has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to devise instruments, guidelines and tools to assess the capacity of countries to deal with disasters. Iran’s health system has been hit hardly by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to assess its preparedness and response to the outbreak. METHODS: The present investigation was designed as a qualitative study. We utilized the “COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan” devised by WHO as a conceptual framework. RESULTS: The dimension/pillar which scored the highest was national laboratories, followed by surveillance, rapid response teams and case investigations. Risk communication and community engagement was another pillar receiving a high score, followed by infection prevention and control and by country-level coordination, planning and monitoring. The pillars/dimensions receiving the lowest scores were operational support and logistics; case management; and points of entry. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has represented an unprecedent event that has challenged healthcare systems and facilities worldwide, highlighting their weaknesses and the need for inter-sectoral cooperation and collaboration during the crisis.

Orf9b is a unique accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. It is implicated in immune evasion by targeting mitochondria, where it associates with the versatile adapter TOM70. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 orf9b in complex with the cytosolic segment of human TOM70 to 2.2 Å. A central portion of orf9b occupies the deep pocket in the TOM70 C-terminal domain (CTD) and adopts a helical conformation strikingly different from the β-sheet-rich structure of the orf9b homodimer. Interactions between orf9b and TOM70 CTD are primarily hydrophobic and distinct from the electrostatic interaction between the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) EEVD motif and the TOM70 N-terminal domain (NTD). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that the orf9b dimer does not bind TOM70, but a synthetic peptide harboring a segment of orf9b (denoted C-peptide) binds TOM70 with nanomolar K(D). While the interaction between C-peptide and TOM70 CTD is an endothermic process, the interaction between Hsp90 EEVD and TOM70 NTD is exothermic, which underscores the distinct binding mechanisms at NTD and CTD pockets. Strikingly, the binding affinity of Hsp90 EEVD motif to TOM70 NTD is reduced by ~29-fold when orf9b occupies the pocket of TOM70 CTD, supporting the hypothesis that orf9b allosterically inhibits the Hsp90/TOM70 interaction.

In the absence of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, well-targeted social distancing measures are essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing strain on local health systems, and preventing mortality. Here, we provide a quantitative assessment of the efficacy of social distancing to slow COVID-19 transmission and reduce hospital surge, depending on the timing and extent of the measures imposed for a metropolitan region and its health care systems. We built a granular mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission that incorporated age-specific and risk-stratified heterogeneity, estimates for the transmission, and severity of COVID-19 using current best evidence. We performed thousands of stochastic simulations of COVID-19 transmission in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Area to project the impact of school closures coupled with social distancing measures that were estimated to reduce non-household contacts by 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% or 90%. We compare early versus late implementation and estimate the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU patients, ventilator needs and deaths through mid-August, 2020. We queried local emergency services and hospital systems to estimate total hospital bed, ICU, and ventilator capacity for the region. We expected COVID-19 hospital beds and ICU requirements would surpass local capacity by mid-May if no intervention was taken. Assuming a four-day epidemic doubling time, school closures alone would be expected to reduce peak hospitalizations by only 18% and cumulative deaths by less than 3%. Immediate social distancing measures that reduced non-household contacts by over 75%, such as stay-at-home orders and closing of non-essential businesses, would be required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity. Peak ICU bed demand prior to mid August 2020 would be expected to be reduced from 2,121 (95% CI: 2,018-2,208) with no intervention to 698 (95% CI: 204-1,100) with 75% social distancing and 136 (95% CI: 38-308) with 90% social distancing; current ICU bed capacity was estimated at 680. A two-week delay in implementation of such measures is projected to accelerate a local ICU bed shortage by four weeks. School closures alone hardly impact the epidemic curve. Immediate social distancing measures that reduce non-household contacts by over 75% were required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity.

There is an urgent need for drugs that can be used to either prevent or treat the potentially fatal disease COVD-19. To this end, we screened FDA approved antiviral drugs which could be repurposed for COVID-19 through molecular docking approach in the various active sites of receptor binding domain (RBD). The RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a promising drug target due to its pivotal role in viral-host attachment. Specifically, we focussed on identifying antiviral drugs which could a) block the entry of virus into host cells, b) demonstrate anti-inflammatory and/or anti-thrombogenic properties. Drugs which poses both properties could be useful for prevention and treatment of the disease. While we prioritized a few antiviral drugs based on molecular docking, corroboration with in vitro studies including a new 3D human vascular lung model strongly supported the potential of Homoharringtonine, a drug approved for chronic myeloid leukaemia to be repurposed for COVID-19. This natural product drug not only antagonized the biding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD binding to human angiotensin receptor 2 (ACE-2) protein but also demonstrated for the first time anti-thrombogenic and anti-leukocyte adhesive properties in a human cell model system.

CVLP were detected in 5 (8%) stool samples from 5 different patients (14%). Only one of the patients had diarrhoea. The five patients with CVLP-positive stools were all at advanced stages of HIV infection. The remarkable discrepancy between our data and another study, reporting a rate of 50% CVLP-positive HIV patients, most of them persistently shedding the virus, is discussed.","Eis-Hübinger, A.

Methods: We conducted a systematic search of 9 databases including key terms related to intensive care AND training AND redeployment AND healthcare workers. Analysis consisted of a narrative synthesis of quantitative study outputs, and a framework-based thematic analysis of qualitative study outputs and grey literature. These results were then combined applying an interpretative synthesis. Results: Twenty papers were analysed. These took place primarily in the UK (N=8, 40%) and USA (N=5, 25%). Themes included in the results are Redeployment: Implementation strategies and learnings; Redeployed staff experience and strategies to address their needs; Redeployed staff learning needs; Training formats offered and training evaluations; and Future redeployment and training concerns. Some of the redeployment implementation and training strategies documented in this review are: Skills-based redeployment, buddy support systems, and agreeing on locally-specific principles, rather than strict procedures. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges to deliver training promptly while following infection control recommendations and develop flexible redeployment strategies. This study synthesises original approaches to tackle these challenges which are relevant to inform the development of targeted and adaptative training and redeployment plans.","Vera San Juan, N.; Camilleri, M.; Jeans, J.

However, the clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR remains uncertain. In the present study, Bayesian statistical modeling was used to retrospectively determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR using SARS-CoV-2 serology in 644 COVID-19-suspected patients with varying degrees of disease severity and duration. The sensitivity of RT-PCR ranged between 79-95%; while increasing with disease severity, it decreased rapidly over time in mild COVID-19 cases. Negative URT RT-PCR results should therefore be interpreted in the context of clinical characteristics, especially with regard to containment of viral transmission based on the 'test, trace and isolate' principle.","Bergmans, B.

The German county of Tirschenreuth suffered a severe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in spring 2020 with particularly high CFR. To estimate seroprevalence, dark figure, and IFR for the Tirschenreuth population aged [≥]14 years in June/July 2020 with misclassification error control, we conducted a population-based study, including home visits for elderly, and analyzed 4203 participants for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies via three antibody tests (64% of our random sample). Latent class analysis yielded 8.6% standardized county-wide seroprevalence, dark figure factor 5.0, and 2.5% overall IFR. Seroprevalence was two-fold higher among medical workers and one third among current smokers with similar proportions of registered infections. While seroprevalence did not show an age-trend, the dark figure was 12.2 in the young versus 1.7 for [≥]85-year-old. Age-specific IFRs were <0.5% below 60 years of age, 1.0% for age 60-69, 13.2% for age 70+, confirming a previously reported age-model for IFR. Senior care homes accounted for 45% of COVID-19-related deaths, reflected by an IFR of 7.5% among individuals aged 70+ and an overall IFR of 1.4% when excluding senior care home residents from our computation. Our data underscore senior care home infections as key determinant of IFR additionally to age, insufficient targeted testing in the young, and the need for further investigations on behavioral or molecular causes of the fewer infections among current smokers.","Wagner, R.; Peterhoff, D.; Beileke, S.; Guenther, F.; Berr, M.; Einhauser, S.; Schuetz, A.; Niller, H.-H.; Steininger, P.; Knoell, A.; Tenbusch, M.; Maier, C.; Korn, K.; Stark, K.; Gessner, A.; Burkhardt, R.; Kabesch, M.; Schedl, H.; Kuechenhoff, H.; Pfahlberg, A.

647487,Detection of SAR-CoV-2 on surfaces in food retailers in Ontario,2021-08-31,"PURPOSE: Adolescent use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has risen rapidly, which is concerning given the health effects of e-cigarettes and youth susceptibility to nicotine addiction. It is critical that efforts to educate, prevent, and reduce adolescent use of e-cigarettes are developed and evaluated. The purpose of this paper is to review available current prevention and cessation programs. FINDINGS: A web-based search of currently available e-cigarette prevention and cessation/treatment programs was conducted using Google in May of 2020. Programs were then reviewed on whether they included theory- and evidence-based practices of effective adolescent prevention and cessation programs. Eight prevention programs, seven cessation programs, and one program that addressed both prevention and cessation were identified and included in this review. Most prevention programs included the importance of understanding flavored e-cigarette products, addressed industry-targeted marketing, included social learning activities to develop refusal skills, delivered free-of-cost, available online, and explicitly stated their incorporation of theory. Five prevention programs and two cessation programs had empirically evaluated their e-cigarette-related components. CONCLUSIONS: Although the programs reviewed largely incorporated theory and included key components known to be effective, there are some gaps in the programs’ overall ability to prevent and stop adolescents from using e-cigarettes, such as lack of dedicated e-cigarette materials. More evidence-based tools, resources, and evaluations are needed to best inform adolescent e-cigarette cessation. Addressing the gaps that existing prevention and cessation programs present requires intervening at multiple systematic levels, conducting more rigorous program evaluations, and bolstering the availability of cessation programs.","Liu, Jessica; Gaiha, Shivani Mathur; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie",Curr Addict Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33204602/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-020-00345-5,398

Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002 and revised its guideline to fulfill the International Health Regulation (IHR) requirements in 2014. This study aimed to understand the state of IDSR implementation and differences between guideline and practice for future disease surveillance system strengthening. METHODS: This was a mixed-method research study. Quantitative data were to analyze completeness and timeliness of surveillance system performance from national District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) during October 2014 to September 2016. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district and 7 key informants of the IDSR system implementation and administration at district and national levels. FINDINGS: The current IDSR system showed relatively good completeness (73.1%) but poor timeliness (40.2%) of total expected monthly reports nationwide and zero weekly reports during the study period. Major implementation gaps were lack of weekly report and trainings. The challenges of IDSR implementation revealed through qualitative data included case identification, compiling reports for timely submission and inadequate resources. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between IDSR technical guideline and actual practice were huge. The developing information technology infrastructure in Malawi and emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology can be opportunities for the country to overcome these challenges and improve surveillance system to have better timeliness for the outbreaks and unusual events detection.","Joseph Wu, Tsung-Shu; Kagoli, Matthew; Kaasbøll, Jens Johan; Bjune, Gunnar Aksel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496177/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200858,398

Yet little is known about vaccine acceptance in this population. The objective of this study was to determine the level of vaccine hesitancy among PEH in Los Angeles, CA and to understand the covariates of hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 risk, threat perception, self-protection and information sources. Methods and findings: A novel mobile survey platform was deployed to recruit PEH from a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Los Angeles to participate in a monthly rapid response study of COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors, and risks. Of 90 PEH surveyed, 43 (48%) expressed some level of vaccine hesitancy based either on actual vaccine offers (17/90 = 19%) or a hypothetical offer (73/90 = 81%). In bivariate analysis, those with high COVID-19 threat perception were less likely to be vaccine hesitant (OR=0.34, P=.03), while those who frequently practiced COVID-19 protective behaviors were more likely to be vaccine hesitant (OR=2.21, P=.08). In a multivariate model, those with high threat perception (OR=0.25, P=.02) were less likely to be hesitant, while those engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors were more hesitant (OR=3.63, P=.02). Those who trusted official sources were less hesitant (OR=0.37, P=.08) while those who trusted friends and family for COVID-19 information (OR=2.70, P=.07) were more likely to be hesitant. Conclusions: Findings suggest that targeted educational and social influence interventions are needed to address high levels of vaccine hesitancy among PEH.","Kuhn, R.; Henwood, B.; Lawton, A.; Kleva, M.; Murali, K.; Gelberg, L.; King, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254146v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254146,398

We aimed to quantify missed vaccination opportunities among hospitalised children in India, and identify vaccination barriers perceived by caregivers and healthcare providers. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two public-sector tertiary-care hospitals in northern India, during November 2018 and March 2019. PARTICIPANTS: We tracked 263 hospitalised children aged 1–59 months through hospital discharge, to assess vaccination status, and document catch-up vaccinations given during the hospital stay. We interviewed caregivers and healthcare providers to assess their perceptions on vaccination. OUTCOMES: Proportion of hospitalised children considered under-vaccinated for their age; proportion of missed opportunities for vaccination among under-vaccinated children who were eligible for vaccination; and vaccine coverage by antigen. RESULTS: We found that 65.4% (172/263) of hospitalised children were under-vaccinated for their age when they presented to the hospital. Among under-vaccinated children, 61.0% were less than 4 months old, and 55.6% reported prior contact with a health facility for a sick visit. The proportion of under-vaccinated children in hospitals were higher compared with the general population as indicated by regional vaccination coverage data. Among under-vaccinated children who were tracked till discharge, 98.1% (158/161) remained incompletely vaccinated at discharge and were considered ‘missed opportunities for vaccination’. Perceived vaccination contraindications that are not part of established contraindications included in national and international guidelines was the most common reason for healthcare providers not to vaccinate children during hospital stay. Among caregivers of under-vaccinated children, 90.1% reported being comfortable having their children vaccinated while they were sick, if recommended by the healthcare provider. CONCLUSION: This pilot study confirmed that hospitalised sick children had substantial missed vaccination opportunities. Addressing these opportunities through concerted actions involving caregivers, healthcare providers and healthcare systems can improve overall vaccination coverage.","Albaugh, Nicholas; Mathew, Joseph; Choudhary, Richa; Sitaraman, Sadasivan; Tomar, Anjali; Bajwa, Ishumeet Kaur; Dhaliwal, Baldeep; Shet, Anita",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33741673/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046464,398

Although traditional loneliness interventions aim to increase social contact, targeting maladaptive cognition about time alone may be an effective way to reduce loneliness. We investigated whether a brief reappraisal manipulation enables individuals to experience their time alone more positively. We also tested the impact of trait loneliness, compulsive social media use, and trait reappraisal on experiences of time alone. METHODS: College students and community members (N = 220) were randomly assigned to read a passage about the benefits of solitude (n = 74), the true prevalence of loneliness (n = 72), or a control topic (n = 74). Participants then sat alone for 10 min. RESULTS: Across conditions, positive and negative mood significantly decreased after sitting alone. Participants who read about the benefits of solitude experienced a smaller reduction in positive mood than those in the control condition. Participants who less frequently used reappraisal in their everyday lives benefited most from the manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence that reappraising time alone as solitude may boost resilience to the decrements in positive mood associated with time alone.

Blood and CSF PCR analyses were negative for the most common viruses involved in immunocompromised patients including EBV. A cerebral biopsy was performed, which showed intense gliosis and perivascular lymphocytic cuffing. PCR analysis performed on brain tissue was positive only for the EBV genome, while extensive investigations for other viral infections were negative. The patient's neurological symptoms rapidly worsened and he died two months later. This case report suggests that in patients presenting neurological and radiological signs of encephalitis after an HSCT, an EBV involvement should be considered, even in the absence of CSF and blood PCR virus detection.","Barberi, Walter; Perrone, Salvatore; Iori, Anna Paola; Torelli, Giovanni Fernando; Testi, Anna Maria; Moleti, Maria Luisa; Ceglie, Teresa; Papoff, Paola; Caresta, Elena; Antonelli, Manila; Gianno, Francesca; Melone, Antonio; Badiali, Manuela; Giangaspero, Felice; Foà, Robin; Gentile, Giuseppe",Pediatr Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.12386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25388950/,398

We aim to review available clinical and biomedical literature on cardiovascular risks of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, enters the cell via ACE2 expressed in select organs. Emerging epidemiological evidence suggest cardiovascular risk factors are associated with increased disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Patients with a more severe form of COVID-19 are also more likely to develop cardiac complications such as myocardial injury and arrhythmia. The true incidence of and mechanism underlying these events remain elusive. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular diseases appear intricately linked with COVID-19, with cardiac complications contributing to the elevated morbidity/mortality of COVID-19. Robust epidemiologic and biologic studies are urgently needed to better understand the mechanism underlying these associations to develop better therapies.","Cheng, Paul; Zhu, Han; Witteles, Ronald M.; Wu, Joseph C; Quertermous, Thomas; Wu, Sean M.; Rhee, June-Wha",Curr Cardiol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32350632/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01293-2,398

Pulmonary function can also show long-term impairment in adults: 10% of hospitalised adults had reduced spirometry values, and 24% had decreased diffusion capacity. To date, only preliminary evidence is available on persistent respiratory sequelae in children and adolescents, therefore our objective was to examine the long-term effects of COVID-19 on pulmonary function in this age group. Methods: Multiple-breath washout, body plethysmography, and diffusion capacity testing were performed after an average of 2.6 months (range 0.4-6.0) following COVID-19 in 73 children and adolescents (age 5-18 years) with different disease severity. Cases were compared to 45 controls with and without infection within six months prior to assessment after exclusion of severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2). Results: Of the 19 patients (27.1%) who complained about persistent or newly emerged symptoms since COVID-19, 8 (11.4%) reported respiratory symptoms. Comparing patients with COVID-19 to controls, no significant differences were detected in frequency of abnormal pulmonary function (COVID-19: 12, 16.4%; controls: 12, 27.7%; OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.22-1.34). Only two patients with persistent respiratory symptoms showed abnormal pulmonary function. Multivariate analysis revealed reduced forced vital capacity (p=0.045) in patients with severe infection regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Discussion: Pulmonary function is rarely impaired in children and adolescents after COVID-19, except of those with severe infection. The discrepancy between persistent respiratory symptoms and normal pulmonary function suggests a different underlying pathology such as dysfunctional breathing.","Knoke, L.; Schlegtendal, A.; Maier, C.; Eitner, L.; Luecke, T.; Brinkmann, F.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.22.21259273; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.22.21259273v1?rss=1,398

However, previous knowledge pertaining to the related SARS virus and other human coronaviruses may prove useful. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may provide a pattern for estimating infection degrees and observing the development of the epidemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the persistence of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients in Al Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 150 recovered COVID-19 patients participated in this study. All the patients tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using qualitative RT-PCR. An ELISA was used to measure anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies in serum samples and screen for their persistence at various time points post-infection. RESULTS: The patients were categorized as asymptomatic (27.3%), mild (28%) and moderate (44.7%) according to the disease severity. Amongst them, 35.3% were females (n = 53) and 64.7% were males (n = 97). Significant anti-S IgG antibody levels were observed among the different groups, with the patients in moderate group exhibiting the highest levels followed by the mild group; while the lowest levels were detected among the asymptomatic. There was a significant positive correlation between the patients’ age and anti-S IgG antibody concentrations (Pearson r = 0.45; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide a solid evidence to support the use of an anti-S IgG ELISA as a diagnostic tool to indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgG seropositivity was sustained in recovered patients up to a hundred days' post-infection, the latest time point for antibody measurement in our study. Ours is the first report in Saudi Arabia to investigate the durability of humoral immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients.","Mahallawi, Waleed; Alzahrani, Mohammad; Alahmadey, Ziab",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X21000826; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.02.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X21000826?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613046/,398

A framing analysis of bed bug news coverage,2014-11-17,"There is a global need to elucidate protective antigens expressed by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Monoclonal antibody reagents that recognise specific antigens on SARS-CoV are needed urgently. In this report, the development and immunochemical characterisation of a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV is presented, based upon their specificity, binding requirements, and biological activity. Initial screening by ELISA, using highly purified virus as the coating antigen, resulted in the selection of 103 mAbs to the SARS virus. Subsequent screening steps reduced this panel to seventeen IgG mAbs. A single mAb, F26G15, is specific for the nucleoprotein as seen in Western immunoblot while five other mAbs react with the Spike protein. Two of these Spike-specific mAbs demonstrate the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV in vitro while another four Western immunoblot-negative mAbs also neutralise the virus. The utility of these mAbs for diagnostic development is demonstrated. Antibody from convalescent SARS patients, but not normal human serum, is also shown to specifically compete off binding of mAbs to whole SARS-CoV. These studies highlight the importance of using standardised assays and reagents. These mAbs will be useful for the development of diagnostic tests, studies of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and vaccine development.","Berry, Jody D; Jones, Steven; Drebot, Michael A; Andonov, Anton; Sabara, Marta; Yuan, Xin Y; Weingartl, Hana; Fernando, Lisa; Marszal, Peter; Gren, Jason; Nicolas, Brigitte; Andonova, Maya; Ranada, Francesca; Gubbins, Michael J; Ball, T.Blake; Kitching, Paul; Li, Yan; Kabani, Amin; Plummer, Frank",J Virol Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093404001272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15234813/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093404001272,398

664278,Towards Smart City Governance. Case Study: Improving the Interpretation of Quantitative Traffic Measurement Data through Citizen Participation,2021-08-06,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with pulmonary coagulopathy, which determines the deposition of fibrin in the air spaces and lung parenchyma. The resulting lung lesions compromise patient pulmonary function and increase mortality, or end in permanent lung damage for those who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease. Therefore, local pulmonary fibrinolysis can be efficacious in degrading pre-existing fibrin clots and reducing the conversion of lung lesions into lasting scars. Plasminogen is considered a key player in fibrinolysis processes, and in view of a bench-to-bedside translation, we focused on the aerosolization of an orphan medicinal product (OMP) for ligneous conjunctivitis: human plasminogen (PLG-OMP) eye drops. As such, the sterile and preservative-free solution guarantees the pharmaceutical quality of GMP production and meets the Ph. Eur. requirements of liquid preparations for nebulization. PLG-OMP aerosolization was evaluated both from technological and stability viewpoints, after being submitted to either jet or ultrasonic nebulization. Jet nebulization resulted in a more efficient delivery of an aerosol suitable for pulmonary deposition. The biochemical investigation highlighted substantial protein integrity maintenance with the percentage of native plasminogen band > 90%, in accordance with the quality specifications of PLG-OMP. In a coherent way, the specific activity of plasminogen is maintained within the range 4.8–5.6 IU/mg (PLG-OMP pre-nebulization: 5.0 IU/mg). This is the first study that focuses on the technological and biochemical aspects of aerosolized plasminogen, which could affect both treatment efficacy and clinical dosage delivery. Increasing evidence for the need of local fibrinolytic therapy could merge with the availability of PLG-OMP as an easy handling solution, readily aerosolizable for a fast translation into an extended clinical efficacy assessment in COVID-19 patients.","Piras, Anna Maria; Zambito, Ylenia; Lugli, Maurizio; Ferro, Baldassare; Roncucci, Paolo; Mori, Filippo; Salvatore, Alfonso; Ascione, Ester; Bellini, Marta; Crea, Roberto",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260813/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph13120425,398

Mediastinal tumours, although mostly asymptomatic, may cause non-specific symptoms associated with advanced tumour growth. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 30-year-old woman who presented with exhaustion and lower back pain accompanied by severe headaches with symptoms of visual disturbances, followed by the typical Horner syndrome. Computed tomography revealed a tumour measuring 12 × 11 × 10 cm in the right cavity with features suggestive of teratoma. The patient underwent mediastinal tumour resection and thymectomy. The pathomorphological examination confirmed the primary diagnosis of mediastinal teratoma, but rare somatic type malignancy was detected. Therefore, the patient was referred for further oncological treatment. DISCUSSION: Mediastinal teratoma is an uncommon finding and usually asymptomatic. Despite its slow growth, it can grow enough to compress adjacent structures, causing symptoms similar to those presented in our patient. CONCLUSION: Radiologic imaging proves diagnostic in most cases. Despite the somatic type malignancy, surgical excision of the tumour using the en-bloc technique seems to be a sufficient option for the patient, and further oncological treatment is not always obligatory.","Rachwalik, Maciej; Kosiorowska, Kinga; Bochenek, Maciej; Jasinski, Marek; Przybylski, Roman",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667908/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.105680,398

In Europe, there is a distribution of power between the European Union and its member states. In contrast, China’s political power is concentrated in the central government. This enables it to take immediate measures that affect the entire country, such as massive quarantines or closing borders. Moreover, the Chinese legal framework includes restrictions on privacy and other human rights that are unknown in Europe. In addition, China has the technological power to easily impose such restrictions. In most European countries, that would be science fiction.

METHODS: The demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings, treatment, and prognosis from 15 cases of pSS-LIP patients were retrospectively analyzed. The data were compared with t test, χ(2) test, and Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: (1) Fifteen cases of patients with pSS-LIP are all females (100%). Compared with pSS with interstitial lung disease(pSS-ILD) patients, the incidence of dry cough, dental caries is higher in pSS-LIP patients. The incidence of shortness of breath, weight loss, and crackles is lower in pSS-LIP patients than that of pSS-ILD patients. (2) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, pSS-LIP patients had higher percentage of patients with ANA, anti-SSA52KD antibody, anti-SSA60KD antibody, and anti-SSB antibody, and the higher concentration of serum globulin. (3) Compared with pSS-ILD patients, the frequency of obstructive ventilation dysfunction is significantly higher and the frequency of diffusion dysfunction is significantly lower in pSS-LIP patients. (4) The most frequent HRCT findings in patients with pSS-LIP is cysts (100%), followed by ground-glass opacities (73.3%), nodular shadow (73.3%) among the pSS-LIP patients. Compared with PSS-ILD patients, the incidence of pulmonary nodule shadow is significantly higher in PSS-LIP patients, while that of grid shadow was significantly lower. (5) Compared with the baseline, the sum of the number, maximum diameter, and diameter of cysts in three levels of pSS-LIP patients showed an increasing trend after treatment. (6) Correlation analysis: The changes of ground-glass opacities were positively correlated with using GC or not, and those were negatively correlated with the dose of GC treatment. Besides, there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the maximum diameter of cysts (△Ømax1/t) and the use of CTX; there is a positive correlation between the annual change rate of the total diameter of cysts (△Øsum1/t) and the use of CTX. CONCLUSION: To the patients of pSS-LIP, female were more common than male, and the onset of LIP was usually more insidious. Hyperglobulinemia and anti-SSA antibody were more prominent in patients with pSS-LIP. Pulmonary function showed the higher rate of obstructive ventilation dysfunction and the lower rate of diffusion dysfunction. The appearance of ground-glass opacities in pSS-LIP patients suggests that the infiltration of inflammatory cells increases, which may cause airway compression, the expansion of terminal bronchioles, and the formation of cysts. The more ground-glass opacities appear earlier, and the more appearance of new cysts later. Therapy with glucocorticoid may be effective on the ground-glass opacity during acute stage, and therapy with cyclophosphamide may be effective on the cysts during chronic stage. The heavier ground-glass opacity is at baseline, the more likely it will recur during maintenance treatment. So follow-up closely is needed.","Dong, Xin; Gao, Yan-li; Lu, Yong; Zheng, Yi",Clin Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05236-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32613392/,398

Socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, but confidence in the importance (OR 8.71, 95% CI 5.89–12.89), safety (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.24–2.61) and effectiveness (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.83–3.87) of COVID-19 vaccine was significantly positively associated with vaccine acceptance. The top reasons for vaccine hesitancy were lack of vaccine information and confidence. The proportion of those definitely willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine was 20% lower if paid by themselves than free vaccination. Migrants were willing to pay a median amount of USD 46 for the COVID-19 vaccine. Results show that a high acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was universal among migrants in Shanghai. Concerns about vaccine safety, effectiveness and high costs of the COVID-19 vaccine may hinder their uptake. Effective health communication to build confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and subsidies toward the costs of these vaccines are needed to improve uptake.","Han, Kaiyi; Francis, Mark R.; Zhang, Ruiyun; Wang, Qian; Xia, Aichen; Lu, Linyao; Yang, Bingyi; Hou, Zhiyuan",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063182/,398
673440,The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Chess World,2020-12-10,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: COVID-19 is a major public health emergency with increasing mortality since the first case in December 2019. COVID-19 has multifaceted presentation and only about 15-20% required hospitalizations and a quarter of those required management in an intensive care unit (ICU). Herein, we reviewed the demographics, clinical outcomes, and identified the potential prognostic indicators in patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to our ICU. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients ≥ 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to our ICU between 03/17/2020 and 05/14/2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were reviewed and retrieved. Data was expressed as counts and percentages. T-test and chi-square (χ) were used for continuous and categorical variables respectively. Univariate analysis was also performed to identify the prognostic indicators associated with mortality. GraphPad PRISM was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were identified during the study period with an average age of 60.8 (ranged from 19-89), of which males were 99 (71%) and females were 41 (29%). Majority were Hispanic (45%) and African Americans (34%). The average body mass index was 30.6. Hypertension (47.9%) and chronic kidney disease (47.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Mechanical ventilation was required in 99 (70.7%) of the patients. Of those 99, 75 (76%) expired. There was no statistically significant difference between the survival and expired groups in term of age, gender, ethnicities and number of comorbidities. Need of mechanical ventilation (MV) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) were significantly associated with mortality (p<0.0001 for both parameters). Interestingly, use of therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with decrease risk of mortality (p-value 0.03865). When looking into the laboratory parameters, higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on Day 5 (p-value 0.0067), initial LDH (p<0.0001), initial CRP (p-value 0.0062), white blood cell counts (WBC) (p<0.0001), and high absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) (p-value 0.0002) were statistically associated with increased risk of mortality. SOFA scores did not predict mortality in these patients (p-value 0.9243) CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort study on patients with COVID-19 who required ICU showed that need for Mechanical Ventilation and Renal Replacement Therapy were significantly associated with mortality. Surprisingly, use of therapeutic anticoagulation decreased the risk of mortality and initial LDH and CRP were the two inflammatory markers that may help predict mortality. This interesting finding need to be corroborated in a larger study. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study was done using the data during the initial two months of first wave of COVID-19 in the United States and the data represents our observations at that time. Several studies have been done on the use of Anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients thereafter, however there is no universally accepted protocol. This study helped us identify the differences in the outcome between first and second use with aggressive use of anticoagulation, Remdesivir, and dexamethasone during the second wave.

A total of 176 patients received SHL by three doses (56 in low dose, 61 in middle dose, and 59 in high dose) in addition to standard care. The control group was composed of 59 patients who received standard therapy alone. Treatment with SHL was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to disease recovery. Patients with 14-day SHL treatment had significantly higher rate in negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 in nucleic acid swab tests than the patients from the control group (93.4% vs. 73.9%, P = 0.006). Analysis of chest computed tomography images showed that treatment with high-dose SHL significantly promoted absorption of inflammatory focus of pneumonia, which was evaluated by density reduction of inflammatory focus from baseline, at day 7 (mean difference (95% CI), −46.39 (−86.83 to −5.94) HU; P = 0.025) and day 14 (mean difference (95% CI), −74.21 (−133.35 to −15.08) HU; P = 0.014). No serious adverse events occurred in the SHL groups. This study illustrated that SHL in combination with standard care was safe and partially effective for the treatment of COVID-19.

This study assesses COVID-19 knowledge and case management of informal providers (IPs), trained practitioners of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) and Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) medical doctors providing primary care services in rural Bihar, India. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of primary care providers conducted via telephone between 1 and 15 July 2020. SETTING: Primary care providers from 224 villages in 34 districts across Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: 452 IPs, 57 AYUSH practitioners and 38 doctors (including 23 government doctors) were interviewed from a census of 1138 primary care providers used by community members that could be reached by telephone. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Providers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire with choice-based answers to gather information on (1) change in patient care seeking, (2) source of COVID-19 information, (3) knowledge on COVID-19 spread, symptoms and methods for prevention and (4) clinical management of COVID-19. RESULTS: During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, 72% of providers reported a decrease in patient visits. Most IPs and other private primary care providers reported receiving no COVID-19 related engagement with government or civil society agencies. For them, the principal source of COVID-19 information was television and newspapers. IPs had reasonably good knowledge of typical COVID-19 symptoms and prevention, and at levels similar to doctors. However, there was low stated compliance among IPs (16%) and qualified primary care providers (15% of MBBS doctors and 12% of AYUSH practitioners) with all WHO recommended management practices for suspect COVID-19 cases. Nearly half of IPs and other providers intended to treat COVID-19 suspects without referral. CONCLUSIONS: Poor management practices of COVID-19 suspects by rural primary care providers weakens government pandemic control efforts. Government action of providing information to IPs, as well as engaging them in contact tracing or public health messaging can strengthen pandemic control efforts.","Rao, Krishna D; Kaur, Japneet; Peters, Michael A; Kumar, Navneet; Nanda, Priya",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931411/,398

We define uncertainty distress as the subjective negative emotions experienced in response to the as yet unknown aspects of a given situation. In the first paper we draw on a robust body of research on distinct areas including: threat models of anxiety, perceived illness uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty. We explore how threat and uncertainty are separable in anxiety and how we can understand behaviours in response to uncertainty. Finally, we propose a clinically, theoretically and empirically informed model for uncertainty distress, and outline how this model can be tested. Caveats, clinical applications and practitioner key points are briefly included, although these are more fully outlined in the treatment implications article. While we outline this model in the context of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the model has broader applications to both mental and physical health care settings. Key learning aims (1)To define the concept of uncertainty distress.(2)To understand the role of threat, over-estimation of threat, perceived uncertainty, actual uncertainty, and intolerance of uncertainty in distress maintenance.(3)To understand how people may behave in response to uncertainty distress.(4)To describe a model of uncertainty distress.","Freeston, Mark; Tiplady, Ashley; Mawn, Lauren; Bottesi, Gioia; Thwaites, Sarah",Cognitive behaviour therapist,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1754470x2000029x; https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/A8B3CEAB50F66F1C85282488CF686453/S1754470X2000029Xa.pdf/div-class-title-towards-a-model-of-uncertainty-distress-in-the-context-of-coronavirus-covid-19-div.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191941/,398

Poor communication while wearing respirators may have fatal complications for patients, and no solution has been proposed to date. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether use of an in-ear communication device is associated with improved communication while wearing different personal protective equipment (N95 mask, half-face elastomeric respirator, and powered air-purifying respirator [PAPR]) in the operating room. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study was conducted in June 2020. Surgical residents from the Department of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were recruited. All participants had normal hearing, were fluent in English, and had access to the operating rooms at the Royal Victoria Hospital. EXPOSURES: All participants performed the speech intelligibility tasks with and without an in-ear communication device. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Speech intelligibility was measured using a word recognition task (Modified Rhyme Test) and a sentence recognition task (AzBio Sentence Test). A percentage correct score (0% to 100%) was obtained for each speech intelligibility test. Listening effort was assessed using the NASA Task Load Index. An overall workload score, ranging from 0 points (low workload) to 100 points (high workload), was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 12 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] years; 8 women [66.7%]). AzBio Sentence Test results revealed that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) speech intelligibility was 98.8% (1.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.3% (7.4%) with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean speech intelligibility was 58.5% (12.4%) without the in-ear device vs 90.8% (8.9%) with the device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean speech intelligibility was 84.6% (9.8%) without the in-ear device vs 94.5% (5.5%) with the device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (32.3%; 95% CI, 23.8%-40.7%; P < .001) and the PAPR (9.9%; 95% CI, 1.4%-18.3%; P = .01). Furthermore, use of the device was associated with decreased listening effort. The NASA Task Load Index results reveal that, while wearing the N95 mask, the mean (SD) overall workload score was 12.6 (10.6) points without the in-ear device vs 17.6 (9.2) points with the device. While wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator, the mean overall workload score was 67.7 (21.6) points without the in-ear device vs 29.3 (14.4) points with the in-ear device. While wearing the PAPR, the mean overall workload score was 42.2 (18.2) points without the in-ear device vs 23.8 (12.8) points with the in-ear device. Use of the in-ear device was associated with a significant decrease in overall workload score while wearing the half-face elastomeric respirator (38.4; 95% CI, 23.5-53.3; P < .001) and the PAPR (18.4; 95% CI, 0.4-36.4; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that among participants using facial respirators that impaired communication, a novel in-ear device was associated with improved communication and decreased listening effort.

Perturbations in glycosylation have been implicated in a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases and certain types of cancer. However, understanding the relationship between a glycan and its biological role is often difficult due to the numerous glycan isomers that exist. To address this challenge, nanoflow liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry, and mass spectrometry (nLC-IMS-MS) were combined with the Individuality Normalization when Labeling with the Isotopic Glycan Hydrazide Tags (INLIGHT™) strategy to study a series of glycan standards and those enzymatically released from the glycoproteins horseradish peroxidase, fetuin, and pooled human plasma. The combination of IMS and the natural (NAT) and stable-isotope label (SIL) in the INLIGHT™ strategy provided additional confidence for each glycan identification due to the mobility aligned NAT- and SIL-labeled glycans and further capabilities for isomer examinations. Additionally, molecular trend lines based on the IMS and MS dimensions were investigated for the INLIGHT™ derivatized glycans, facilitating rapid identification of putative glycans in complex biological samples.

677940,Buccal swabs as non-invasive specimens for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2,2021-05-22,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with various neurological manifestations. Since patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection present coagulation and immune system dysregulation, ischemic or haemorragic stroke is not uncommon, irrespective of respiratory distress. However, the occurrence of focal neurological deficits together with other symptoms like headache, cortical blindness, seizure and altered mental status should prompt the diagnosis of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES). Antithrombotic treatment, the alteration of endothelial function, and coagulopathy due to COVID-19 and PRES leading to the breakdown of blood–brain barrier may then contribute to the occurrence of a brain haemorrhage. METHODS: We describe the case of a COVID-19 patient who developed bilateral occipital lobe haemorrhages suggestive of haemorrhagic PRES. We then reviewed the available literature about haemorrhagic evolution of PRES in COVID-19. RESULTS: We describe the clinical and radiological features of five COVID-19 patients who developed haemorrhagic PRES. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy and endothelial dysfunction resulting from the massive release of cytokines during the host immune response may be key factors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related PRES. Antithrombotic therapy and the leakage of the blood–brain barrier can subsequently increase the risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the lesioned brain tissue. A prompt diagnosis of PRES is mandatory, since the timely interruption/reversal of antithrombotic therapy may be a key determinant for a good prognosis.","Motolese, Francesco; Ferrante, Mario; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Sbarra, Martina; Ursini, Francesca; Marano, Massimo; Capone, Fioravante; Travaglino, Francesco; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Pilato, Fabio",J Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-021-10709-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34291313/,398

METHODS: An online survey was completed by ophthalmologists and ophthalmology trainees during the lockdown. The information collected included demographics (age, gender), domicile (state, union territory), current professional status (in training or practising), type of practice (solo, group, institutional, governmental, non-governmental), marital status (married, single), impact of COVID-19 on their training or practice, and impact on income and ability to meet living expenses. Psychological distress was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). RESULTS: In all, 2,355 ophthalmologists responded. Mean age was 42.5 (range, 25-82 years; SD, 12.05) years. Of these, 1,332 (56.7%) were males; 475 (20.2%) were still not in practice; 366 (15.5%) were single; 1,244 (52.8%) felt that COVID-19 would impact on their training or professional work; and 869 (37%) had difficulty in meeting their living expenses. The mean PHQ-9 score was 3.98 (range, 0-27; SD, 4.65).

IL-18 promotes the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and strongly induces a Th1 response. IL-18 drives the same myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as IL-1β. In physiological conditions, IL-18 is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), and the activity of IL-18 is balanced. It is reported that in several inflammatory diseases, the IL-18 activity is unbalanced, and IL-18 neutralization by IL-18BP is insufficient. IL-18 acts synergistically with IL-12 to induce the production of IFN-γ as a Th1 cytokine, and IL-18 acts alone to induce the production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. In addition, IL-18 alone enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity and FAS ligand expression. The biological and pathological roles of IL-18 have been studied in many diseases. Here we review the knowledge regarding IL-18 signaling and the role of IL-18 in inflammatory kidney diseases.

The improvement of primary care efficiency and productivity should be a priority, to ensure that future investments in the medical workforce can cope with the increasingly large and complex demand for care. OBJECTIVES: This paper presents a systematic literature review of studies that define or measure efficiency in primary care in high-income settings. The review of the existing definitions of primary care efficiency and their limitations will inform future research on the measurement of efficiency in primary care in England and its determinants. METHODS: Literature searches were performed on Embase, Medline, and EconLit in January 2020. The records that passed the screening were reviewed in full text, and data on the study settings, the efficiency definition, and the efficiency analysis were extracted. RESULTS: Of the 2590 non-duplicate records retrieved from the searches, 38 papers were included in the analysis. The volume of the literature on primary care efficiency has evolved significantly from the 1980s, with the majority of the published studies focussing on European health systems. The setting most often analysed was primary care centres. Output was usually expressed using measures of primary care utilisation, with or without quality adjustments. Reference to the health outcomes achieved was, however, limited. Inputs were more commonly expressed in labour terms, while the exogenous variables related either to the characteristics of the patient population or the organisation of primary care. While all studies included an analysis of technical efficiency, consideration of allocative or cost efficiency or the determinants of productivity (e.g. technological change, skill mix) was rare. CONCLUSIONS: The main limitations that future research on primary care efficiency should address relate to the definition of output. Current approaches to measure the impact on health and the multiple dimensions of output are not sufficient to represent the valued output of primary care. In light of the recent changes in the model of primary care delivery in England, future research should also investigate the impact of technological change on productivity and the scope for substitution across staff roles.

680102,Identifying homogeneous subgroups of patients and important features: a topological machine learning approach,2021-09-20,"Studying the prescription pattern of medications will help in understanding potential unnecessary prescriptions, due to the trial-and-error method of prescribing, and the need for personalized medicine in a population. Therefore, in this study, our aim was to explore the prescribing pattern and off-label use of antidepressants in the Qatari population. We conducted a retrospective study of Qatari patients who received prescriptions for antidepressants from the major healthcare providers in Qatar, for a period of 24 months between June 2018 and May 2020. The number of patients, prescriptions, and diagnostic indications were analyzed. The chi-square test was used for identifying statistically significant association of the number of individuals prescribed with age category or gender. Of the 14,601 Qatari patients who were prescribed antidepressants, the majority were female (61%, p < 2.2 × 10(−16)), and were at or above 60 years of age (27%, p < 2.2 × 10(−16)). More numbers of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (22,085 out of 48,031; 46%), were dispensed than other classes of antidepressants, with escitalopram (26%) at the top of the list. Preponderance of prescription of antidepressants for non-mental health diseases was observed. Population-level prescription trends, as we reported here, when combined with patient genetic variability and outcome data, will have the power to predict the potential for treatment failures and adverse effects of these medications in the population. We also recommend educating non-mental health prescribers about the adherence to evidence and guidelines to ensure patient safety while prescribing antidepressants.","Bastaki, Kholoud; El Anbari, Mohammed; Ghuloum, Suhaila; Jithesh, Puthen Veettil",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11050406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068080/,398
680118,A novel bio-inspired hybrid multi-filter wrapper gene selection method with ensemble classifier for microarray data,2021-09-12,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic RNA virus characterized by high transmission rates and pathogenicity worldwide. Continued control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the diversification of rapid, easy to use, sensitive, and portable methods for SARS-CoV-2 sample preparation and analysis. Here, we propose a method for SARS-CoV-2 viral enrichment and enzymatic extraction of RNA from clinically relevant matrices in under 10 min. This technique utilizes affinity-capture hydrogel particles to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from solution, and leverages existing PDQeX technology for RNA isolation. Characterization of our method is accomplished with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for relative, comparative RNA detection. In a double-blind study analyzing viral transport media (VTM) obtained from clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, our sample preparation method demonstrated both comparable results to a routinely used commercial extraction kit and 100% concordance with laboratory diagnoses. Compatibility of eluates with alternative forms of analysis was confirmed using microfluidic RT-PCR (μRT-PCR), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The alternative methods explored here conveyed successful amplification from all RNA eluates originating from positive clinical samples. Finally, this method demonstrated high performance within a saliva matrix across a broad range of viral titers and dilutions up to 90% saliva matrix, and sets the stage for miniaturization to the microscale.","Dignan, Leah M.; Turiello, Rachelle; Layne, Tiffany R.; O'Connell, Killian C.; Hickey, Jeff; Chapman, Jeff; Poulter, Melinda D.; Landers, James P.",Anal Chim Acta,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267021006723?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003267021006723; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2021.338846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538333/,398

There are well-documented cardiac complications of COVID-19 in patients with and without prior cardiovascular disease. The cardiac complications include myocarditis, heart failure, and acute coronary syndrome resulting from coronary artery thrombosis or SARS-CoV-2-related plaque ruptures. There is growing evidence showing that arrhythmias are also one of the major complications. Myocardial inflammation caused by viral infection leads to electrophysiological and structural remodeling as a possible mechanism for arrhythmia. This could also be the mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 leads to different arrhythmias. In this review article, we discuss arrhythmia manifestations in COVID-19.","Babapoor-Farrokhran, Savalan; Rasekhi, Roozbeh Tarighati; Gill, Deanna; Babapoor, Shaghayegh; Amanullah, Aman",SN Comprehensive Clinical Medicine,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42399-020-00454-2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838188/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00454-2,398

This paper reports on a cross-national comparison of four countries (Norway, UK, USA and Australia) and examines the differences in mental health between those individuals employed and those not employed during the social distancing implementation. METHODS: Participants (N = 3,810) were recruited through social media in April/May 2020 and were invited to complete a self-administered electronic survey over a 3-week period. Differences between those employed and those not employed with regard to their sociodemographic characteristics and mental health were investigated with chi-square tests, independent t tests, and one-way analysis of variances (ANOVAs). RESULTS: Compared with their counterparts, participants who were employed reported lower levels of mental health distress (p < 0.001), higher levels of psychosocial well-being (p < 0.001), better overall quality of life (p < 0.001), and lower levels of overall loneliness, social loneliness, and emotional loneliness (p < 0.001). Small to medium but consistent differences (Cohen’s d = 0.23–0.67) in mental health favor those with employment or those who were retired.

Here, we evaluated COVID‐19 infection outcomes and mortality in thyroid cancer patients with COVID‐19 infection. DESIGN AND METHODS: We included a cohort of patients with thyroid cancer with PCR‐confirmed COVID‐19 disease from 11 March to 30 May 2020 from the Turkish Ministry of Health database in our nationwide, retrospective study. We compared the mortality and morbidity of COVID patients with or without thyroid cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the independent factors for mortality, length of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. We also analysed the effect of radioiodine treatment on severity and death rate of COVID‐19 disease. RESULTS: We evaluated 388 COVID‐19 patients with thyroid cancer [median age: 54 years, interquartile range (IQR) 18 years, males: 23%] and age and gender‐matched 388 COVID‐19 patients without thyroid cancer. Patients with thyroid cancer had a similar mortality ratio compared with the non‐cancer group. Among patients with thyroid cancer, age, presence of diabetes mellitus, asthma/COPD, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, prior coronary artery disease, RAS blocker usage and low lymphocyte count were associated with mortality. Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment and cumulative radioactive iodine dosage did not negatively affect the severity and mortality of COVID‐19 disease in our patient group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that history of thyroid cancer did not have an increased risk of mortality or morbidity in COVID‐19 disease. Besides, RAI therapy history and doses of radioactive iodine did not affect mortality or outcome.","Sahin, Mustafa; Haymana, Cem; Demirci, Ibrahim; Tasci, Ilker; Rıfat, Emral; Unluturk, Ugur; Satman, Ilhan; Demir, Tevfik; Cakal, Erman; Ata, Naim; Ertugrul, Derun; Salman, Serpil; Sahin, Ibrahim; Dagdelen, Selcuk; Celik, Osman; Caglayan, Murat; Atmaca, Aysegul; Sonmez, Alper",Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872399/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.14486,398

Limited social support for older or frail people might have led to decreased oral health and its related quality of life. The current study aimed to investigate the social support of older seniors and self-perceived oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Questionnaires were sent to all patients of the Dental Clinic of the University of Leipzig (Germany) aged 75, 80, or 85 years (n = 1228) at the end of February 2021. Besides demographic characteristics and care level, an adapted German version of the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI-D) and the German Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) were included. The response rate was 35.7% (n = 439). Twelve replies were not included in the data analysis as participants had either no interest, were cognitively impaired, or did not match the required age group. Analysis of ESSI-D revealed low social support for 13.2% (n = 53/403) of the seniors. No statistically significant impact of assigned care level on low social support was identified. Seniors with an assigned care level (CL(yes)) presented higher OHIP-14 sum scores (CL(no)/CL(yes) 6.43/10.12; p < 0.001). This was also true for six of the seven OHIP-14 domains, except for functional limitation. Regarding seniors with an assigned care level, a weak positive correlation was identified for sum scores of the ESSI-D and the OHIP-14 (r = 0.29). Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, older seniors reported high self-perceived social support. As seniors with an assigned care level revealed more impaired OHRQoL and a correlation with lower social support, special attention should be given to this vulnerable and frail group in times of a pandemic. When restrictions may minimize access to dental treatment and might negatively influence the oral health of older seniors, health care programs should offer more individual options for dental/medical appointments.","Weber, Sophia; Hahnel, Sebastian; Nitschke, Ina; Schierz, Oliver; Rauch, Angelika",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34574950/,398

In United States Government-sponsored phase 3 efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines, nAbs are measured by two different validated pseudovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays, with each trial using one of the two assays. Here we describe and compare the nAb titers obtained in the two assays. We observe that one assay consistently yielded higher nAb titers than the other when both assays were performed on the World Health Organization’s anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin International Standard, COVID-19 convalescent sera, and mRNA-1273 vaccinee sera. To overcome the challenge this difference in readout poses in comparing/combining data from the two assays, we evaluate three calibration approaches and show that readouts from the two assays can be calibrated to a common scale.

Social isolation and vulnerability to stressors may prevent efficient psychological adjustment negatively affecting adaptation to life changes, as that imposed during Covid-19 lockdown. Here, we explored psychosocial dimensions and changes in clinical condition during Covid-19 lockdown in migraine patients, with regard to migraine type and headache impact. METHODS: Sixty-four migraine patients (32 episodic and 32 chronic) and 64 healthy control subjects were included in a case-control cross-sectional study. A two-step clustering procedure split patients into two clusters, based on the Headache Impact Test. Perceived global distress, loneliness, empathy, and coping levels were compared in groups, as well as changes in clinical condition. RESULTS: Migraine patients reported higher general loneliness and lower social support compared to healthy control subjects. Emotional loneliness was more marked in patients with higher headache impact. This subgroup of patients more frequently reported changes in the therapeutic and care paths as the perceived cause of the occurrence of motor or extra-motor symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine patients, especially those more severely affected, proved more vulnerable than healthy control subjects to Covid-19 lockdown. Long-lasting interruption of social interactions may be detrimental in fragile patients that are in need of structured support interventions to maintain psycho-physical wellbeing.","Cerami, Chiara; Crespi, Chiara; Bottiroli, Sara; Santi, Gaia Chiara; Sances, Grazia; Allena, Marta; Vecchi, Tomaso; Tassorelli, Cristina",Cephalalgia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256651/; https://doi.org/10.1177/03331024211027568,398

Certain viruses, such as influenza virus, can attack fully immunocompetent adults, but many viruses take advantage of more-vulnerable patients. The latter include patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy and elderly subjects, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities. The range of viruses producing pneumonia in adults includes common agents, such as varicella-zoster virus and influenza virus, as well as respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses. The roles played by other agents, such as rhinoviruses and human bocaviruses, in pneumonia are still under study.

METHODS: CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analyzed on per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the 3 weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated. RESULTS: Of patients, 85.2% had travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of ≥ 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: While bilateral GGO are predominant features, CT findings changed during different time intervals in the 3 weeks after symptom onset in patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • Four of 88 (4.5%) patients with COVID-19 had negative initial CT. • Majority of COVID-19 patients had abnormal CT findings in ≥ 3 lobes. • A proportion of patients with pure ground glass opacities decreased over the 3 weeks after symptom onset.","Liang, Ting; Liu, Zhe; Wu, Carol C.; Jin, Chao; Zhao, Huifang; Wang, Yan; Wang, Zekun; Li, Fen; Zhou, Jie; Cai, Shubo; Liang, Yukun; Zhou, Heping; Wang, Xibin; Ren, Zhuanqin; Yang, Jian",Eur Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291502/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06823-8,398

687684,Statistical Hypothesis Testing versus Machine Learning Binary Classification: Distinctions and Guidelines,2020-10-09,"During recent years our society has often been exposed to coherent information waves of high amplitudes. These are waves of huge social energy. Often they are of destructive character, a kind of information tsunami. However, they can also carry positive improvements in human society, as waves of decision-making matching rational recommendations of societal institutes. The main distinguishing features of these waves are their high amplitude, coherence (homogeneous character of social actions generated by them), and short time needed for their generation and relaxation. Such waves can be treated as large-scale exhibitions of the bandwagon effect. We show that this socio-psychic phenomenon can be modeled based on the recently developed social laser theory. This theory can be used to model stimulated amplification of coherent social actions. “Actions” are treated very generally, from mass protests to votes and other collective decisions, such as, e.g., acceptance (often unconscious) of some societal recommendations. In this paper, we concentrate on the theory of laser resonators, physical vs. social. For the latter, we analyze in detail the functioning of Internet-based echo chambers. Their main purpose is increasing of the power of the quantum information field as well as its coherence. Of course, the bandwagon effect is well known and well studied in social psychology. However, social laser theory gives the possibility to model it by using general formalism of quantum field theory. The paper contains the minimum of mathematics and it can be read by researchers working in psychological, cognitive, social, and political sciences; it might also be interesting for experts in information theory and artificial intelligence.","Khrennikov, Andrei",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33286331/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e22050559,398

To better detect affected individuals at an early stage and stop disease progression to an advanced stage, several studies have been conducted to identify the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19. This study aimed to enrich the literature by critically analyzing the clinical and biological characteristics of 134 patients from the North African Mediterranean region, including numerous genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors that may influence disease evolution. This single-center retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years confirmed to have COVID-19 and hospitalized at the Cheikh Khalifa University Hospital affiliated with Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences, Casablanca, Morocco. Clinical, demographic, and biological data were analyzed in a cohort of severe and non-severe patients. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of severity. There were 134 patients: the median age was 53 years, and 54.5% were male. Of these, 89 had mild to moderate disease; 45 had severe to critical disease, of which 14 died and 31 survived. Advanced age, presence of comorbidities, male sex, and infection in ethnic or family groups were risk factors for progression to severe disease. The presence of abnormalities in the following parameters were strongly associated with progression to severe disease: white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during both admission and hospitalization.
