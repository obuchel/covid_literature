2182,2182,2182,What Effect Did the Global Financial Crisis Have Upon Youth Wellbeing? Evidence From Four Australian Cohorts,15.809749,2.0998719,2016-02-08,"Recent research has suggested significant negative effects of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on mental health and wellbeing. In this article, the authors suggest that the developmental period of late adolescence may be at particular risk of economic downturns. Harmonizing 4 longitudinal cohorts of Australian youth (N = 38,017), we estimate the impact of the GFC on 1 general and 11 domain specific measures of wellbeing at age 19 and 22. Significant differences in wellbeing in most life domains were found, suggesting that wellbeing is susceptible to economic shocks. Given that the GFC in Australia was relatively mild, the finding of clear negative effects across 2 ages is of international concern.","Parker, Philip D.; Jerrim, John; Anders, Jake",Dev Psychol,341,17

Using the method of cluster-agon analysis, we identified four terminological clusters in our data, in which mental health/illness is conceptualized as “dangerous,” “a matter of lifestyle,” “a unique story and experience,” and “socially situated.” We furthermore found that we cannot unambiguously assume that biopsychiatric discourses or discourses aimed at empathy and understanding are either exclusively stigmatizing or exclusively empowering and normalizing. We consequently call for a critical conception of mental health literacy arguing that all mental health news socializes its audience in specific understandings of and attitudes toward mental health (knowledge) and that discourses on mental health/illness can work differently in varying contexts.","Van Beveren, Laura; Rutten, Kris; Hensing, Gunnel; Spyridoula, Ntani; Schønning, Viktor; Axelsson, Malin; Bockting, Claudi; Buysse, Ann; De Neve, Ine; Desmet, Mattias; Dewaele, Alexis; Giovazolias, Theodoros; Hannon, Dewi; Kafetsios, Konstantinos; Meganck, Reitske; Øverland, Simon; Triliva, Sofia; Vandamme, Joke",Qual Health Res,341,22

The generation of such signals is sometimes independent of the nervous system, such as in Passive BCI. This is majorly beneficial for those who have severe motor disabilities. Traditional BCI systems have been dependent only on brain signals recorded using Electroencephalography (EEG) and have used a rule-based translation algorithm to generate control commands. However, the recent use of multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning-based translation algorithms has improved the accuracy of such systems. This paper discusses various BCI applications such as tele-presence, grasping of objects, navigation, etc. that use multi-sensor fusion and machine learning to control a humanoid robot to perform a desired task. The paper also includes a review of the methods and system design used in the discussed applications.","Chamola, Vinay; Vineet, Ankur; Nayyar, Anand; Hossain, Eklas",Sensors (Basel),341,1

The aromatic Louisiana Clearfield Jazzman (CJ) and Thai Jasmine (TJ), and a non-aromatic parboiled (PB) rice were hydrated during the first 10 min of processing with reciprocal agitation followed by static retort processing. The aroma compound, 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) was more heat-stable in CJ than TJ rice but decreased 15-fold compared to the rice cooker method. Pareto analysis indicated that rice type and agitation had the main effect on amylose and total starch and chroma and hue. Color differences of rice agitated during hydration and between rice cooker or static retort processed rice, indicated only slight differences for each rice variety. Hydration of dry rice during retort cooking and similar starch, color, and aroma quality were achieved with reciprocal compared to static or rice cooker methods.

Digital slides are created using a scanning device to capture a high-resolution image on glass slides for analysis on a computer or a mobile device. Though digital pathology has drastically grown over the last 10 years and has created opportunities to support specialists, few have attempted to address its full-scale implementation in routine clinical practice. To incorporate new technologies in diagnostic processes, it is necessary to study their application, the value they provide to specialists, and their effects on improvements across the entire workflow, rather than studying a particular element. In this study, we aimed to identify what have the current digital pathology systems contributed to the pathological and diagnostic process. We retrieved articles published between 2010 and 2020 from the databases PubMed and Google Scholar. We explored how digital pathology systems can better utilize existing medical data and new technologies within the current diagnostic workflow. While the evidence concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of digital pathology is mounting, high-quality evidence regarding its impact on resource allocation and value for diagnosis is still needed to support clinical diagnosis and policy decision-making.","Kim, Yoo Jung; Roh, Eul Hee; Park, Sangchan",J Exerc Rehabil,341,1

While this effort supports the US-government mandate that research be made widely available, little is known about what research journalists share with the public. This cross-sectional exploratory study characterises US-government-funded research on cancer that appeared most frequently in news coverage and how that coverage varied by cancer type, disease incidence and mortality rates. The subject of analysis was 11436 research articles (published in 2016) on cancer funded by the US government and 642 news stories mentioning at least one of these articles. Based on Altmetric data, researchers identified articles via PubMed and characterised each based on the news media attention received online. Only 1.88% (n = 213) of research articles mentioning US government-funded cancer research included at least one mention in an online news publication. This is in contrast to previous research that found 16.8% (n = 1925) of articles received mention by online mass media publications. Of the 13 most common cancers in the US, 12 were the subject of at least one news mention; only urinary and bladder cancer received no mention. Traditional news sources included significantly more mentions of research on common cancers than digital native news sources. However, a general discrepancy exists between cancers prominent in news sources and those with the highest mortality rate. For instance, lung cancer accounted for the most deaths annually, while melanoma led to 56% less annual deaths; however, journalists cited research regarding these cancers nearly equally. Additionally, breast cancer received the greatest coverage per estimated annual death, while pancreatic cancer received the least coverage per death. Findings demonstrated a continued misalignment between prevalent cancers and cancers mentioned in online news media. Additionally, cancer control and prevention received less coverage from journalists than other cancer continuum stages, highlighting a continued underrepresentation of prevention-focused research. Results revealed a need for further scholarship regarding the role of journalists in research dissemination.","Moorhead, Laura; Krakow, Melinda; Maggio, Lauren",PLoS One,341,1

It is suggested that t-PA synthesized in mucous cells is promptly secreted and modifies the watery nasal discharge in allergic rhinitis and that u-PA activity may help with the passage of large amounts of rhinorrhea by reducing its viscosity. Furthermore, we clarify the relation between fibrinolytic components and the pathology of allergy, particularly during the development of nasal allergy and nasal tissue changes. Wild-type (WT) mice can develop nasal allergy for ovalbumin (OVA) sensitization, but PAI-1-deficient mice (PAI-1(-/-)) cannot. The production of specific immunoglobulins IgG1 and IgE in the serum and production of interleukins IL-4 and IL-5 in splenocyte culture supernatant increased significantly in WT-OVA mice. In PAI-1(-/-) mice, these reactions were absent, and specific IgG2a in serum and interferon-γ in splenocyte culture medium increased significantly. Histopathologically, there was marked goblet cell hyperplasia and eosinophil infiltration into the nasal mucosa in WT-OVA mice, but these were absent in PAI-1(-/-) mice. These results indicate that the immune response in WT-OVA mice can be classified as a dominant Th2 response, which would promote collagen deposition. In contrast, the Th2 response in PAI-1(-/-) mice was down-regulated and the immune response shifted from Th2-dominant reaction to a Th1-dominant one. Taken together, these findings suggest that PAI-1 plays an important role not only in thrombolysis but also in the immune response.","Sejima, Takayuki; Sakata, Yoichi",Recent Advances in Thrombosis and Hemostasis 2008,341,1

Two different viruses, 229E and OC43 were initially recognized. Because of difficulty in isolating them using standard techniques, many of the early studies of their occurrence were seroepidemiologic. They were confirmed to be worldwide in distribution, and, in the North Temperate Zone, mainly occurring in the winter season. With the development of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, two additional distinct viruses have been identified, HKU1 and NL63. The four viruses have now been recognized as important in the etiology of common respiratory infections, second only to the rhinoviruses. In 2002, a previously unrecognized betacoronavirus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir in Southern China and spread during the following year to several major cities of the world. The resulting illness was termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) because of its potential lethality. More than 8,000 probable cases were reported during 2003, mainly from Hong Kong and mainland China, producing social and economic disruption in those areas affected. A constant feature of the outbreak was the importance of nosocomial spread. In spite of an estimated basic reproductive number higher than influenza, the outbreak was ended, in large part because of control of in-hospital transmission. In 2012, another betacoronavirus has emerged in the Arabian peninsula which is producing a somewhat similar illness, termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also marked by extensive nosocomial transmission. The outcome of this emergence is currently unknown.","Monto, Arnold S.; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Peiris, J. S. Malik",Viral Infections of Humans,341,1

This system of axioms does not guaranty additivity of divergences and allows us to consider, for example, the [Formula: see text]-metric on probability measures as a divergence.

Field-based coordination is one such approach, promoting the idea of programming system coordination declaratively from a global perspective, in terms of functional manipulation and evolution in “space and time” of distributed data structures, called fields. More specifically, regarding time, in field-based coordination it is assumed that local activities in each device, called computational rounds, are regulated by a fixed clock, typically, a fair and unsynchronized distributed scheduler. In this work, we challenge this assumption, and propose an alternative approach where the round execution scheduling is naturally programmed along with the usual coordination specification, namely, in terms of a field of causal relations dictating what is the notion of causality (why and when a round has to be locally scheduled) and how it should change across time and space. This abstraction over the traditional view on global time allows us to express what we call “time-fluid” coordination, where causality can be finely tuned to select the event triggers to react to, up to to achieve improved balance between performance (system reactivity) and cost (usage of computational resources). We propose an implementation in the aggregate computing framework, and evaluate via simulation on a case study.","Pianini, Danilo; Mariani, Stefano; Viroli, Mirko; Zambonelli, Franco",Coordination Models and Languages,341,1

There are significant efforts proposed to extract rare itemsets. The RP-growth algorithm outperforms previous methods proposed for generating rare itemsets. However, the performance of the RP-growth degrades on sparse datasets, and it is costly in terms of time and memory consumption. Hence, in this paper, we propose the RPP algorithm to extract rare itemsets. The advantage of the RPP algorithm is that it avoids time for generating useless candidate itemsets by omitting conditional trees as RP-growth does. Furthermore, our RPP algorithm uses a novel data structure, RN-list, for creating rare itemsets. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on sparse and dense datasets. The results show that the RPP algorithm is around an order of magnitude better than the RP-growth algorithm.","Darrab, Sadeq; Broneske, David; Saake, Gunter",Data Mining and Big Data,341,1

SDEs are mathematical models of stochastic processes that capture how states evolve continuously in time. They are widely used in numerous applications such as engineered systems (e.g., modeling how pedestrians move in an intersection), computational finance (e.g., modeling stock option prices), and ecological processes (e.g., population change over time). Previously the safety verification problem has been tackled over finite and infinite time horizons using a diverse set of approaches. The approach in this paper attempts to connect the two views by first identifying a finite time bound, beyond which the probability of a safety violation can be bounded by a negligibly small number. This is achieved by discovering an exponential barrier certificate that proves exponentially converging bounds on the probability of safety violations over time. Once the finite time interval is found, a finite-time verification approach is used to bound the probability of violation over this interval. We demonstrate our approach over a collection of interesting examples from the literature, wherein our approach can be used to find tight bounds on the violation probability of safety properties over the infinite time horizon.","Feng, Shenghua; Chen, Mingshuai; Xue, Bai; Sankaranarayanan, Sriram; Zhan, Naijun",Computer Aided Verification,341,1

In this paper I use the Shapley value to decompose the risk and return of optimal portfolios that result from minimizing ordinary least squares. These regression portfolios are identical to tangency portfolios obtained by maximizing the Sharpe ratio of holdings on the mean-variance efficient frontiers. The Shapley value of individual assets is computed using the statistics resulting from the regressions. The value imputation prices assets by their comprehensive contribution to portfolio risk and return. This procedure allows investors to make unbiased decisions when analyzing the inherent risk of their holdings.

The need for better control strategies gave rise to the identification of various vaccine candidates. The recombinant form of a member of the cysteine protease family, cathepsin L1 of Fasciola hepatica (FhCL1) has been a vaccine target for the past few decades since it has been shown to behave as an immunodominant antigen. However, when FhCL1 was used as vaccine, it has been observed to elicit significant protection in some trials, whereas no protection was provided in others. METHODS: In order to improve vaccine development strategy, we conducted a linear B-cell epitope mapping of FhCL1 in sheep vaccinated with FhCL1, FhHDM, FhLAP and FhPrx plus Montanide and with significant reduction of the fluke burden, sheep vaccinated with FhCL1, FhHDM, FhLAP and FhPrx plus aluminium hydroxide and with non-significant reduction of the fluke burden, and in unvaccinated-infected sheep. RESULTS: Our study showed that the pattern and dynamic of peptide recognition varied noticeably between both vaccinated groups, and that the regions 55–63 and 77–84, which are within the propeptide, and regions 102–114 and 265–273 of FhCL1 were specifically recognised only by vaccinated sheep with significant reduction of the fluke burden. In addition, these animals also showed significant production of specific IgG2, whereas none was observed in vaccinated-Aluminium hydroxide and in infected control animals.

The new generation of trainees require novel approaches to teaching to make the requisite impacts on their minds. Conventional classroom teaching might be considered obsolete by some, especially when the subject being talked about is ethics and philosophy of medicine. An untapped resource for the teachers lies perhaps in the colossal reserve of decades of cinema. This novel concept of using movies to teach is enumerated in this article by using the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now” to draw parallels between the situations occurring in the film with the ethical dilemmas that a clinician might face or philosophies that may be of utility to a physician. This article presents a conceptual framework of this ideology by exploring a film that might be considered by some to have no correlation with the queries that a medical mind might have while proving that it might not be the content of the film but the viewpoint of the teacher/trainee that may define the interpretations that may be drawn from it. Soldiers and doctors both work in a strict structure of hierarchy and are both put in situations where ethical dilemmas have life and death implications. This core philosophy has served as an inspiration for this article.","Lamba, Ishan",International Journal of Ethics Education,341,1

This poses a major public health threat, as congregational prayer involves large numbers of worshippers gathering under conditions known to enable the spread of the virus. Using a nationally representative survey, we evaluated the efficacy of messages delivered from different authorities in encouraging Indonesians to worship at home. We find no consistent evidence that public health messages change Indonesians’ attitudes toward communal prayer or their willingness to forgo communal prayer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, however, looking at well-defined subpopulations – non-Muslims and supporters of the president – we find suggestive evidence that messages were effective in increasing the likelihood of individuals to indicate a willingness to forgo communal prayer in the forthcoming week. Our results suggest that public health officials should eschew blanket messaging strategies in favor of more targeted approaches.","Kuipers, Nicholas; Mujani, Saiful; Pepinsky, Thomas",,341,16

Unfortunately, only a small percentage of preclinical intervention studies using well-defined mouse models of disease have progressed to clinically-effective treatments in patients. The reasons for this lack of bench-to-bedside transition are not completely understood; however, emerging data suggest that genetic diversity and housing environment may greatly influence muring immunity and inflammation. RESULTS: Accumulating evidence suggests that certain immune responses and/or disease phenotypes observed in inbred mice may be quite different than those observed in their outbred counterparts. These differences have been thought to contribute to differing immune responses to foreign and/or auto-antigens in mice vs. humans. There is also a growing literature demonstrating that mice housed under specific pathogen free conditions possess an immature immune system that remarkably affects their ability to respond to pathogens and/or inflammation when compared with mice exposed to a more diverse spectrum of microorganisms. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that mice develop chronic cold stress when housed at standard animal care facility temperatures (i.e. 22–24 °C). These temperatures have been shown alter immune responses to foreign and auto-antigens when compared with mice housed at their thermo-neutral body temperature of 30–32 °C. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of genetically diverse mice to a spectrum of environmentally-relevant microorganisms at housing temperatures that approximate their thermo-neutral zone may improve the chances of identifying new and more potent therapeutics to treat infectious and inflammatory diseases.","Enriquez, Josue; Mims, Brianyell Mc Daniel; Trasti, Scott; Furr, Kathryn L.; Grisham, Matthew B.",BMC Immunol,341,1

The analysis of variable regions of African swine fever virus (ASFV) genome led to more genotypic and serotypic information about circulating strains. The present study aimed at investigating the genetic diversity of ASFV strains in symptomatic pigs in South Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples collected from 391 ASF symptomatic domestic pigs in 6 of 8 districts in South Kivu were screened for the presence of ASFV, using a VP73 gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the universal primer set PPA1-PPA2. To genotype the strains, we sequenced and compared the nucleotide sequences of PPA-positive samples at three loci: the C-terminus of B646L gene encoding the p72 protein, the E183L gene encoding the p54 protein, and the central hypervariable region (CVR) of the B602L gene encoding the J9L protein. In addition, to serotype and discriminate between closely related strains, the EP402L (CD2v) gene and the intergenic region between the I73R and I329L genes were analyzed. RESULTS: ASFV was confirmed in 26 of 391 pigs tested. However, only 19 and 15 PPA-positive samples, respectively, were successfully sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed for p72 (B646L) and p54 (E183L). All the ASFV studied were of genotype X. The CVR tetrameric repeat clustered the ASFV strains in two subgroups: the Uvira subgroup (10 TRS repeats, AAAABNAABA) and another subgroup from all other strains (8 TRS repeats, AABNAABA). The phylogenetic analysis of the EP402L gene clustered all the strains into CD2v serogroup 7. Analyzing the intergenic region between I73R and I329L genes revealed that the strains were identical but contained a deletion of a 33-nucleotide internal repeat sequence compared to ASFV strain Kenya 1950. CONCLUSION: ASFV genotype X and serogroup 7 was identified in the ASF disease outbreaks in South Kivu province of DRC in 2018–2019. This represents the first report of ASFV genotype X in DRC. CVR tetrameric repeat sequences clustered the ASFV strains studied in two subgroups. Our finding emphasizes the need for improved coordination of the control of ASF.","Bisimwa, Patrick N.; Ongus, Juliette R.; Tiambo, Christian K.; Machuka, Eunice M.; Bisimwa, Espoir B.; Steinaa, Lucilla; Pelle, Roger",Virol J,341,16

The paper aims to (i) evaluate the shift of exercise services to online and (ii) examine how engagement with online services has influenced people’s reaction to Covid-19 and unprecedented confinement to their homes. Our analysis shows that experiences of exercise in the home are dependent on prior exercise engagement, particularly a sense of progress and competency in exercise movements, trust in the instructor and socio-economic privileges that enable participants to love and appreciate their homes. This paper argues that online classes have had positive impact on participants’ ability to cope with lockdown: routine, structure and being seen by others all proved important well-being aspects.","Taylor, Lisa; Raisborough, Jayne; Harrison, Katherine; Dulson, Shelly",Int J Sociol Leis,341,16

This study used a qualitative description design to explore what contributes to quality of care for residents living in long-term care, and how this could change in times of crisis from the perspective of long-term care staff. Interviews were conducted with a broad range of staff at one LTC home. A semi-structured interview guide and approach to thematic analysis was framed by a social ecological perspective, making it possible to include the individual and proximal social influences as well as community, organizations, and policy influencers.

Given the day-to-day behavioral changes necessitated by this global threat, the current study examined daily stress reactivity and its potential moderators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-level, multilevel modeling was used to examine the daily relationship between perceived stress and negative affect, as well as the moderating effects of daily positive affect, average pandemic worry, and age, on this process. Participants included 349 individuals from the young adult, midlife, and later-life cohorts of the Notre Dame Study of Health & Well-being who completed a 28-day, daily diary study amidst the COVID-19 pandemic (NDHWB; Age Range = 26-89). Individuals were affectively reactive to perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing higher negative affect on days of higher perceived stress. Regarding moderators, older individuals were less stress reactive than younger individuals, and the extent of individuals’ pandemic worry exacerbated their stress reactivity. Furthermore, daily positive affect buffered daily stress reactivity, regardless of pandemic worry and age. In sum, individuals who were younger or more worried about the pandemic tended to be more stress reactive than older or less worried individuals. Furthermore, daily positive affect buffered stress reactivity, and this buffering effect did not depend on age or the extent to which individuals were worried about the pandemic. Thus, mobilizing positive affect during the COVID-19 pandemic may be a promising avenue for intervention in daily stress processes.","Nelson, Niccole; Bergeman, Cindy",Innov Aging,341,16

We surveyed Veterans Affairs clinicians about dementia caregiver support delivery following the COVID surge in the six New England states. 38 out of 68 (55%) clinicians from 6 states responded in June and July 2020. We found: 1) Clinicians continued providing the same types of support services for family caregivers before and after COVID, with over 50% of providers interacting with caregivers daily or multiple times per week. The most prevalent services were caregiver needs assessments, information and referrals, and assistance with accessing services. Two-thirds reported continuing to offer caregiver skills training and counseling, including peer support groups. 2) Caregiver support modality changed, most frequently through the combined use of phone and video, followed by only phone, and rarely, by only video. 3) Providers indicated that phone, more than video, increased to replace in-person interactions, because of multiple factors: caregivers (who continued to call for support on an as-needed basis but declined video encounters), providers (who began to provide group support via phone), and service factors (ad hoc versus scheduled encounters). Results suggest clinicians continued providing caregiver support despite suspension of in-person interactions, but future research is needed to assess the impacts of caregiver support delivery mostly by phone and factors underlying the limited use of video in delivering caregiver support.","Quach, Emma; Franzosa, Emily; Scali, Rachael; Moo, Lauren; Hartmann, Christine",Innov Aging,341,16

Given its maladaptive nature, studies have investigated the antecedents of work avoidance, such as the role of personal characteristics and social-contextual factors. The influence of one’s classmates, however, remains under-explored. Drawing from social contagion research, we examined whether work avoidance goals spread among classmates. Questionnaires were administered to 1524 adolescent students nested within 50 classes. Two waves of data were collected one semester apart. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the data. Results showed that a student’s work avoidance in Time 2 was predicted by his/her classmates’ work avoidance in Time 1. These results held even after controlling for one’s own Time 1 work avoidance. Moreover, work avoidance goals led to higher levels of disengagement and lower levels of engagement. The findings demonstrate that work avoidance goals are socially contagious and that they have negative consequences for students’ engagement. This study extends our theoretical understanding of work avoidance by highlighting the vital role played by one’s classmates in shaping students’ avoidance of schoolwork and the deleterious consequences that come with it.","Mendoza, Norman B.; King, Ronnel B.",Eur J Psychol Educ,341,1

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the OTI time and success rate of two aerosol-mitigating strategies under direct laryngoscopy and videolaryngoscopy performed by anaesthesiologists, intensive care physicians and emergency physicians who were voluntarily recruited for OTI in an airway simulation model. METHODOLOGY: The outcomes were successful OTI, degree of airway visualisation and time required for OTI. Not using a stylet during OTI reduced the success rate among non-anaesthesiologists and increased the time required for intubation, regardless of the laryngoscopy device used. RESULTS: Success rates were similar among physicians from different specialties during OTI using videolaryngoscopy with a stylet. The time required for successful OTI by intensive care and emergency physicians using videolaryngoscopy with a stylet was longer compared with anaesthesiologists using the same technique. Videolaryngoscopy increased the time required for OTI among intensive care physicians compared with direct laryngoscopy. The aerosol-mitigating strategy under direct laryngoscopy with stylet did not increase the time required for intubation, nor did it interfere with OTI success, regardless of the specialty of the performing physician.

Due to the inaccessibility of the reliable data on the population of the temporarily occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, the data on internally displaced persons and returnees from the sample of International Organization for Migration, 2018–2020, have been used to study the contexts of adaptation and return, such as reasons to integrate or go back to an unsafe environment. The author suggests an application of refrain (after Deleuzian ritournelle), as a unity of the aspects of chaos, abode, and escape, to the situation of internal displacement. The key observations make it possible to suggest that forming and change of localness imply either the ritournelle missed as a disrupted adaptation and return, or the ritournelle achieved when displaced newcomers become new locals in the host communities. Thus, localness is regarded as a dynamic characteristic that can be boosted or reshaped through treating the displaced persons as equals, in terms of benefits and burdens distribution, providing access to decision-making, and promoting the sense of belonging to a community. The study is also aimed at formulating the questions for future investigations of the group of returnees, and thus shaping the criteria for the assessment of future durable solutions and reintegration scenarios.","Balinchenko, Svitlana",SN Soc Sci,341,1

However, HSI classification is a small-sample-size problem due to the labour cost of labeling. CNN may perform poorly on HSI data due to the ill-conditioned and overfitting problems caused by the lack of enough training samples. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a kind of single-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) with high training efficiency, which simplifies the learning of parameters. Therefore, in this paper, we try to combine the convolutional feature extraction method of CNN and the parameter randomization idea of ELM, and then propose a random convolutional network (RCN) model. The proposed RCN randomly generates the parameters of three-dimensional (3D) convolution kernels in convolutional layer used for the joint spectral-spatial feature extraction. RCN avoids ill-conditioned and overfitting problems in the case of small samples by significantly reducing the number of parameters to be trained. At the same time, further analyses on the convolution kernel sizes and the number of convolution kernels have been carried out.

One way in which location-based media are refiguring previously taken-for-granted spatial traditions is via GPS-enabled online dating and hook-up apps. For sexual minorities, these apps can reconfigure any street, park, bar, or home into a queer space through a potential meeting between mutually attracted individuals, but what does this signify for already-existing queer spaces? This chapter examines how smartphone apps including Grindr, Tinder, and Blued synthesize online queer encounter with offline physical space to create a new hybrid terrain predicated on availability, connection, and encounter. It is also a terrain that can sidestep established gay neighborhoods entirely. I explore how this hybridization impacts on older, physically rooted gay neighborhoods and the role that these neighborhoods have traditionally played in brokering social and sexual connection for sexual minorities. Few would deny that location-based apps have come to play a valuable role in multiplying opportunities for sexual minorities. However, the stratospheric rise of these technologies also provokes questions about their impact on embodied encounter, queer community, and a sense of place. A decade on from Grindr’s release, this chapter evaluates the impact of location-based media on gay spaces and reflects on what the increasing hybridization of online and offline spaces for same-sex encounter might mean for queer lives of the future.","Miles, Sam",The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods,341,7

Even in countries with the best rated healthcare systems, this change in demographics and health care needs poses a significant challenge. Many older people, particularly those in non-urban locations, currently experience a range of vulnerabilities which can impact on their health status. Technological solutions are required to support health systems to be economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. In this context, socially accountable care needs to empower older people to make choices which align with their values, while also taking into account professional and familial care-givers, equitable care provision in what are often large and disjointed systems, and resource constraints. Intelligent technologies offer the potential to reduce some of the burden on health care systems, while simultaneously providing person-centered care, enabling improvements to older people’s wellbeing. Through the findings of a relatively simple technology-based health intervention we explore how these benefits will only be realized if such technologies are designed and implemented with exceptional social accountability in place.","Greig, Jenni; Ul-Haq, Anwaar; Dresser, Greg; Burmeister, Oliver K.; Rehman, Sabih-Ur",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,341,1

This result has recently been extended to two flavours of quantitative modal logic, viz. fuzzy modal logic and probabilistic modal logic. In both cases, the quantitative van Benthem theorem states that every formula in the respective quantitative variant of first-order logic that is bisimulation-invariant, in the sense of being nonexpansive w.r.t. behavioural distance, can be approximated by quantitative modal formulae of bounded rank. In the present paper, we unify and generalize these results in three directions: We lift them to full coalgebraic generality, thus covering a wide range of system types including, besides fuzzy and probabilistic transition systems as in the existing examples, e.g. also metric transition systems; and we generalize from real-valued to quantale-valued behavioural distances, e.g. nondeterministic behavioural distances on metric transition systems; and we remove the symmetry assumption on behavioural distances, thus covering also quantitative notions of simulation.","Wild, Paul; Schröder, Lutz",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,341,1

For concurrent and communicating systems, compositional techniques based on behavioural type systems have received much attention. By abstracting communication protocols as types, these type systems can statically check that programs interact with channels according to a certain protocol, whether the intended messages are exchanged in a certain order. In this paper, we put on our coalgebraic spectacles to investigate session types, a widely studied class of behavioural type systems. We provide a syntax-free description of session-based concurrency as states of coalgebras. As a result, we rediscover type equivalence, duality, and subtyping relations in terms of canonical coinductive presentations. In turn, this coinductive presentation makes it possible to elegantly derive a decidable type system with subtyping for [Formula: see text] -calculus processes, in which the states of a coalgebra will serve as channel protocols. Going full circle, we exhibit a coalgebra structure on an existing session type system, and show that the relations and type system resulting from our coalgebraic perspective agree with the existing ones.","Keizer, Alex C.; Basold, Henning; Pérez, Jorge A.",Programming Languages and Systems,341,1

The analysis first reviews key points of Fraser’s philosophical critique of capitalism. These points include explanations of the ethics of recognition, redistribution, and representation in the context of capitalism. Also considered are contradictions that Fraser identifies in “post-socialist feminist” perspectives, as these are relevant for nursing ethics. Finally discussed are Fraser’s latest FMP explanations of financialized transnational corporate capitalism, including its social, political, and economic effects. The chapter next uses Fraser’s critical theoretical explanation of capitalism to piece together some implications for nursing ethics. This critical exploration first focuses on discourses of caring in U.S. nursing, also exploring parallel developments in feminist care ethics. This analysis suggests that the ethics of care in nursing and beyond can be deepened and strengthened by greater consideration of Fraser’s FMP, explicitly in considering capitalism. Next, the discussion examines the discourse of social justice in nursing, acknowledging connections between care and social justice ethics in nursing literature. Definitions of social justice are discussed as are recent analyses of social justice ethics in Canadian and U.S. Codes of Ethics. Selected examples of social justice scholarship in Canadian and the U.S. nursing literature are next reviewed, pointing to similar theoretical and practice-oriented concerns. This review of social justice scholarship argues again that greater consideration of Fraser’s FMP can strengthen accounts of social justice in nursing ethics by explicating contextual effects of capitalism. The chapter concludes in arguing that Fraser’s work presents a puzzle for nursing ethics, a question about what form of professionalism nurses believe they are enacting under capitalism. In providing that critical approach to nursing ethics, Fraser’s FMP ultimately invites nurses to define pragmatically what forms their professional moral agency will take under capitalism.","Thompson, Janice L.",Nursing Ethics: Feminist Perspectives,341,5

Based on a sample of N = 1182 adult Americans, gathered at the pandemic’s onset (March 2020), we conclude that science knowledge helps individuals convert information into coronavirus knowledge. This knowledge then helps individuals avoid panic behavior. Individuals lacking coronavirus knowledge and science knowledge still comply with prevention guidelines when they have a general trust in medicine. Individuals lacking knowledge still follow prevention guidelines when they trust in medicine.

In COPD patients, MAIT cells have the ability to produce more IL-17 and less IFN-γ compared to healthy individuals. We found that HLA-DR expression levels reflected the degree of inflammation and the proportion of IL-17 was significantly correlated with lung function in peripheral blood. In addition, we found that MAIT cells were highly expressed in the lung, and the increased expression of CXCR2, CXCL1 indicated that MAIT cells had the potential to migrate to inflammatory tissues.

This study aims to evaluate: 1) perceptions on how social distancing due to CoVID-19 affected stress, sleep, dietary habits and physical activity (PA) patterns in female vs. male college students; 2) perceived factors associated with self-reported weight changes during the initial months of social distancing. METHODS: Cross-sectional. Online anonymous survey administered using a social network site as the main data collection tool in a period from June to August 2020. Questionnaire was framed to retrospectively recall the first phase of social distancing measures. RESULTS: College students (n = 575); majority 18-24 y, 80% women, 14% men, 1.3% transgender and 2% non-binary; 76% White, 10% Hispanic/Latino, 7% African American, 5% Asian & 6% Multiracial. Of the 575 participants, 36% reported overeating and 34% an increase in weight. Under exercise was reported in 31% of participants and 40% decreased their sleep during the initial months of social distancing. Regarding mental health, 37% reported having high levels of anxiety, and 61% reported a decreased sense of happiness. Fifty-five reported feeling high levels of stress at home and 64% reported stress due to schoolwork. A higher proportion of women reported higher levels of uncertainty (p = 0.002), anxiety (p = 0.042), stress at home (p = 0.046), changes in mood (p = 0.01) and changes in eating (0.014). There were no differences among gender responses for changes in sleep, weight, loneliness, exercise and school work related stress. Self-reported weight gain was associated with changes in exercise for 54% (P < 0.0001). Changes in mood for 73% (P = 0.002), overall changes in sleep 78% (P = 0.002) and changes in eating for 82% (P = 0.002) of the responders. Weight change was associated with uncertainty (P = 0.023), anxiety (P < 0.001) and stress levels at home (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this non-representative US sample, most college students reported high levels of stress and decreased happiness, with women affected at higher levels. It can be hypothesized that long term disaster responses using social distancing, should address stress management, PA, sleep and eating habits for age college students to maintain a healthy weight.

METHOD/DESIGN: This stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial will allocate 18 communities to one of five 6-monthly intervention start dates. Stratification will be by region and population size. The intervention (Hearing for Learning Initiative, HfLI) consists of six 20-h weeks of training (delivered over 3 months) that includes Certificate II in Aboriginal Primary Health Care (3 modules) and competencies in ear and hearing data collection (otoscopy, tympanometry and hearScreen), plus 3 weeks of assisted integration into the health service, then part-time employment as Ear Health Facilitators to the end of the trial. Unblinding will occur 6 months prior to each allocated start date, to allow Community Reference Groups to be involved in co-design of the HfLI implementation in their community. Relevant health service data will be extracted 6-monthly from all 18 communities. The primary outcome is the difference in proportion of children (0 to 16 years of age) who have at least one ear assessment (diagnosis) documented in their medical record within each 6-month period, compared to control periods (no HfLI). Secondary outcomes include data on sustainability, adherence to evidence-based clinical guidelines for otitis media, including follow-up and specialist referrals, and school attendance. Structured interviews with staff working in health and education services, Ear Health Trainees, Ear Health Facilitators and families will assess process outcomes and the HfLI broader impact. DISCUSSION: The impact of training and employment of Ear Health Facilitators on service enhancement will inform the health, education and employment sectors about effectiveness of skills and job creation that empowers community members to contribute to addressing issues of local importance, in this instance ear and hearing health of children.

In our encounters with our patients, we as psychoanalysts have experienced the broad spectrum of possible reactions to the viral threat, just as it is found throughout society: from real fear to panic or, on the contrary, to a denial of the impending danger. We are facing drastic changes which are connected with painful losses but sometimes also with new possibilities in our accustomed lives. Nevertheless, the loss of trust in the preservation of individual and general health and of economic existence as well goes beyond the individual and leads to tensions and even cracks in the supposed social consensus. Thus, in the relationship of the individual to society, the pandemic exacerbates the ambivalence between self‐interest and solidarity, not infrequently to the point of forming hostile attitudes. In this article, the author explores the question of to what extent it is possible to speak about a “new Civilization and Its Discontents” in light of the increasing social tensions under the conditions of the pandemic. It is the task of psychoanalysis to explicitly name the unconscious conflict between striving for pleasure and happiness or the search for security, in order to also contribute to dealing with the resulting aggression and fear of death in times of pandemic.","Blass, Heribert",,341,16

At present, the extent of endothelial barrier failure and its underlying mechanisms in COVID‑19 remain unclear. We hypothesized that endothelial leak results from bioactive mediators released in COVID‐19 rather than direct endothelial infection and can thus be recapitulated ex vivo by treating endothelial cells with patient plasma, thus providing a personalized screening platform for barrier‐protective interventions in COVID‐19. METHODS: Citrate plasma was sampled as part of the Pa‐COVID‐19 cohort study (ethics approval EA2/066/20) in patients with moderate (hospitalized, no invasive ventilation; WHO severity score: 3‐4) and severe (high flow O(2) or intubated and mechanically ventilated; WHO severity score: 5‐7) COVID‑19. Plasma samples were diluted to 10% (v/v) in cell culture medium without FCS and tested for their ability to disrupt barrier integrity of primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) monolayers by electrical cell‐substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), immunofluorescence for endothelial VE‐cadherin and F‐actin, and real‐time Ca(2+) imaging. Plasma from healthy donors served as control. RESULTS: COVID‐19 plasma was virus‐free but caused endothelial barrier disruption as measured by ECIS and gap formation in HPMEC monolayers. The extent of barrier disruption increased with disease severity but varied considerably between endothelial cells from different microvascular beds (lung/heart >> skin). The TRPV4‐antagonist HC‐067047 prevented the endothelial Ca(2+) response to COVID‐19 plasma and protected endothelial barrier integrity in lung microvascular cells. CONCLUSION: Here, we identify TRPV4 as critical regulator of microvascular permeability in COVID‑19. Targeting TRPV4‐mediated endothelial barrier failure may present a promising adjunctive therapy in COVID‐19.","Michalick, Laura; Weidenfeld, Sarah; Grimmer, Benjamin; Fatykhova, Diana; Solymosi, Philip; Behrens, Felix; Dohmen, Melanie; Brack, Markus; Schulz, Sabrina; Thomasch, Elisa; Simmons, Szandor; Müller‐Redetzky, Holger; Suttorp, Norbert; Kurth, Florian; Corman, Victor; Hocke, Andreas; Witzenrath, Martin; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Kuebler, Wolfgang",FASEB J,341,1

SARS‐CoV‐2, the virus causing COVID‐19, uses ACE2, an important enzyme in the cardiovascular system that regulates the conversion of Ang II (deleterious/pro‐hypertensive) to Ang 1‐7 (protective/anti‐hypertensive), as a receptor for host cell entry and infection. Considering the relationship between the viral S1‐protein and the host's ACE2, it is unclear whether this interaction is merely a mechanism of infection or whether it also contributes to cardiovascular damage associated with COVID‐19. We hypothesisedthat SARS‐Cov‐2‐ACE2 interaction induces activation of vascular cell inflammatory responses that are influenced by ACE2 dependent and/or independent enzymatic Ang‐(1‐7) production. METHODS: Human microvascular endothelial cells (MEC) were used and stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 recombinant S1 protein (rS1p) (0.66 μg/mL) at 10/30 min (acute) and 5/24h (chronic). Activation of pro‐inflammatory signaling pathways (immunoblotting, real‐time PCR), microparticle (MP) generation (NanoSight), and cytokine production (ELISA) were assessed. In some experiments, cells were pre‐incubated with an ACE2 activator (DIZE – 190 nM) and inhibitor (MLN‐4760 – 440 pM). RESULTS: rS1P increased NFκB activation (Control ©=0.99±0.06 vs. 1.38±0.19 AU; p<0.05) and MP formation (C=1.01±0.17 vs. 2.06±0.21, x10(9)/mL; p<0.05), a marker of endothelial cell damage. mRA expression of IL‐1β (C=1.07±0.13 vs. 50.04±4.63 2(^‐ddCT)), IL6 (C=1.15±0.0.19 vs. 13.52±2 2(^‐ddCT)), TNFα (C=1.12±0.16 vs. 20.29±2.15 2(^‐ddCT)), VCAM‐1 (C=1.21±0.24 vs. 13.39±1.57 2(^‐ddCT)) and MCP‐1 (C=1.02±0.06 vs. 7.01±2.16 2(^‐ddCT)) was increased by rS1p (p<0.05). This was associated with an increased production of IL6 (C=22.77±3.27 vs. 1221±18.33 pg/mL) and MCP‐1 (C=876.9±33.47 vs. 1110±13.33 pg/mL, (p<0.05). rS1p did not change gene levels of TGFβ, galectin‐3 or ACE2. While DIZE did not influence rS1p pro‐inflammatory markers; MLN‐4760 potentiated rS1p‐induced increase in IL‐1β gene levels (rS1p=27.59±5.05 vs. MLN=62.11±11.17 2(^‐ddCT)) and blocked rS1p effects on MCP‐1 (rS1p=5.08±0.47 vs. MLN=2.43±0.6 2(^‐ddCT)) and VCAM‐1 (rS1p=72.82±13.76 vs. MLN=20.74±4.53 2(^‐ddCT)). ACE2 inhibition did not interfere with rS1p‐induced increase in IL6 or TNFα mRNA expression. Analysis of MP content revealed the expression of ACE2 short form (60 kDa) and flotillin‐1, suggesting that ACE2 localizes in membrane microdomains. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in human endotheial cells rS1P induces a pro‐inflammatory response and stimulates generation of ACE2‐containing microparticles. These findings suggest that the spike protein 1 of SARS‐CoV‐2 has a direct injurious effect on the endothelium that may contribute to endotheliitis in COVID‐19. Whether these processes are associated with viral infection await clarification.","Montezano, Augusto; Camargo, Livia; Neves, Karla; Lopes, Rheure; Rios, Francisco; Beattie, Wendy; Nicklin, Stuart; Berry, Colin; Touyz, Rhian",FASEB J,341,1

The role of multiple mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the disease has been recently unravelled. The unbalanced production of α-globin is a major source of oxidative stress and membrane damage in red blood cells (RBC). In addition, IE is tightly linked to iron metabolism dysregulation, and the relevance of new players of this pathway, i.e., hepcidin, erythroferrone, matriptase-2, among others, has emerged. Advances have been made in understanding the balance between proliferation and maturation of erythroid precursors and the role of specific factors in this process, such as members of the TGF-β superfamily, and their downstream effectors, or the transcription factor GATA1. The increasing understanding of IE allowed for the development of a broad set of potential therapeutic options beyond the current standard of care. Many candidates of disease-modifying drugs are currently under clinical investigation, targeting the regulation of iron metabolism, the production of foetal haemoglobin, the maturation process, or the energetic balance and membrane stability of RBC. Overall, they provide tools and evidence for multiple and synergistic approaches that are effectively moving clinical research in β-thalassaemia from bench to bedside.","Longo, Filomena; Piolatto, Andrea; Ferrero, Giovanni Battista; Piga, Antonio",Int J Mol Sci,341,16

Clinical interviews are at the centre of diagnosing this disorder. However, in addition to clinical assessment a simple, validated questionnaire conducted by any healthcare professional may aid in screening for BUD and referral for further management. AIM: To compare the accuracy of the severity dependence scale (SDS) as a screening tool for BUD against the standard clinical interviews using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5, (DSM 5) checklist amongst benzodiazepine users with primary psychiatric disorders. SETTING: Outpatient psychiatric clinic in South Rand Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, once informed consent was attained, looking at demographic and clinical profiles of benzodiazepine users. Clinical interviews were conducted in 81 patients who completed the SDS. In comparing the results of the SDS and clinical interview outcomes, chi-square tests were used to determine an association between categorical variables. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated in determining the cut-off score in the SDS with the highest sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: This study indicated that a cutoff score of greater than or equal to six of the SDS showed 86% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity compared to a diagnosis of BUD made with clinical interview. The only categorical variables of marginal significance (p~0.06) in comparison to a BUD diagnosis were with benzodiazepine type (oxazepam) and longer duration of use (greater than 24 months). CONCLUSION: This study identified the SDS as a useful screening tool for BUD with a high sensitivity and specificity compared to interview outcomes. Statistically, correlates were identified between duration and type of benzodiazepine prescribed and BUD suggesting emphasis on these factors when prescribing benzodiazepines.","Lowton, Karishma; Chiba, Gaveeta",S Afr J Psychiatr,341,11

Recently, eicosanoids are widely involved in regulating immunity and inflammation for COVID-19 patients. Rats were intravenously administered remdesivir at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and series of blood samples were collected before and after treatment. Targeted metabolomics regarding the eicosanoid profile were investigated and quantitated simultaneously using the previously reported reliable HPLC-MS/MS method. Additionally, interplay relationship between metabolomics and pharmacokinetic parameters was performed using the Pearson correlation analysis and PLS model. For the longitudinal metabolomics of remdesivir, metabolic profiles of the same rat were comparatively substantial at discrete sampling points. The metabolic fingerprints generated by individual discrepancy of rats were larger than metabolic disturbance caused by remdesivir. As for the transversal metabolomics, the prominent metabolic profile variation was observed between the baseline and treatment status. Except for TXB2, the inflammatory- and immunology-related eicosanoids of resolvin D2, 5-HEPE, 5-HETE, and DHA were significantly disturbed and reduced after single administration of remdesivir (p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Moreover, the metabolite of PGE2 correlated with GS-441524 (active metabolite of remdesivir) concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters of C(max), AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity), and CL significantly. Eicosanoid metabolic profiles of remdesivir at both longitudinal and transversal levels were first revealed using the robust HPLC-MS/MS method. This initial observational eicosanoid metabolomics may lighten the therapy for fighting COVID-19 and further provide mechanistic insights of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.","Du, Ping; Wang, Guo-yong; Zhao, Rui; An, Zhuo-ling; Liu, Li-hong",Front Pharmacol,341,11

AngII levels can be modulated by ACE2 in tissues where the enzyme is highly expressed, such as the kidney. In the kidney, ACE2 has the potential to regulate the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which can impact blood pressure and renal injury. Thus, in disease states where the RAS is often upregulated, the function of ACE2 plays a particularly important role. This review highlights the results of recent studies that demonstrate the interplay between ACE2 and the kidney under normal and pathological conditions. RECENT FINDINGS ACE2 has been reported to play a key role in renal and cardiovascular function. Recent studies have implicated shedding of the membrane-bound ectodomain of ACE2 as one way in which the enzyme can be regulated and enzymatic activity altered. This posttranslational modification releases a fragment which retains enzymatic activity, and thus provides a novel mechanism by which the RAS can be altered in response to physiological stimuli. Decreased ACE2 activity is associated with increased blood pressure, diabetes, and oxidative stress, whereas, increased levels of ACE2 appear to be renoprotective. SUMMARY A growing body of evidence, involving both experimental and human studies, points out the crucial role that ACE2 plays on the modulation of renal injury. Thus, therapeutic targets aiming to increase ACE2 activity and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-MasR axis could potentially become clinically relevant, especially in disease states where the renal RAS is upregulated.","Ortiz-Melo, David I; Gurley, Susan B",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,341,25

Applying the same technique to aspherical or inhomogeneous particles yields measurements of the position, diameter and refractive index of an effective sphere that represents an average over the particle's geometry and composition. This effective-sphere interpretation has been applied successfully to porous, dimpled and coated spheres, as well as to fractal clusters of nanoparticles, all of whose inhomogeneities appear on length scales smaller than the wavelength of light. Here, we combine numerical and experimental studies to investigate effective-sphere characterization of symmetric dimers of micrometer-scale spheres, a class of aspherical objects that appear commonly in real-world dispersions. Our studies demonstrate that the effective-sphere interpretation usefully distinguishes small colloidal clusters in holographic characterization studies of monodisperse colloidal spheres. The effective-sphere estimate for a dimer's axial position closely follows the ground truth for its center of mass. Trends in the effective-sphere diameter and refractive index, furthermore, can be used to measure a dimer's three-dimensional orientation. When applied to colloidal dimers transported in a Poiseuille flow, the estimated orientation distribution is consistent with expectations for Brownian particles undergoing Jeffery orbits.","Altman, Lauren E; Quddus, Rushna; Cheong, Fook Chiong; Grier, David G",Soft matter,341,1

The method differs from TOT and retropubic tape (RT) in the usage of autologous tissue. We hypothesized that a-TOT improves female sexual dysfunction (FSD) more than TOT and RT. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study. Patients who underwent a-TOT, TOT, and RT surgeries were surveyed regarding the cure of SUI, complications, and FSD parameters. The groups were compared according to baseline and postoperative data. RESULTS A-TOT, TOT, and RT groups included 37, 69, and 36 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 19 months. The groups were similar in terms of preoperative characteristics. The objective cure, subjective cure, and overall complication rates were comparable among the groups (p > 0.05). A-TOT group had significant improvements in mean female sexual function index (FSFI) scores, TOT group deteriorated, and RT group remained stable (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.226, respectively). The postoperative mean total FSFI scores were 25.73 ± 2.46, 23.17 ± 3.35, and 21.53 ± 2.47 for the a-TOT, TOT, and RT groups, respectively. The a-TOT group had better results than the TOT and RT groups (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05), and besides, the difference between the TOT and RT groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). According to percentage changes in domain scores following the operations, the a-TOT group had significantly better results in desire, arousal, lubrication, satisfaction, and pain domains than the TOT group (p < 0.05) as well as better desire, arousal, and pain domains (p < 0.05) than the RT group. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS Besides comparable outcomes in SUI treatment, the a-TOT technique provides improvements in female sexual functions while TOT worsens and RT does not change. Favorable outcomes in sexual functions caused by improvements in desire, arousal, satisfaction, and pain domains are observed following the a-TOT technique.","Çubuk, Alkan; Şahan, Ahmet; Özkaptan, Orkunt; Dinçer, Erdinç; Karaaslan, Onur; Sarılar, Ömer; Akça, Oktay",Urologia internationalis,341,8

METHODS We quantitatively analyzed ""coronavirus"" digital footprints on the Internet, in particular, on Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by EventRegistry, from 15.01 to 07.04.2020 (before and after official introduction of COVID-19 to Poland on 04.03.2020). We present results on trend analysis supported by statistical techniques. RESULTS We identified six major temporal clusters of the interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Physical distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield. There was an exponential increase of the interest when the Polish government ""declared a war against disease"" around 11/12.03.2020 with a massive response activity. Later on, there was a decay in the interest with additional phases related to physical distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act associated with pronounced local peaks. We have found that declarations of response strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So already enacted or in force events do not affect the interest to such an extent. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial search term ""antiviral mask"" in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia ""SARS-CoV-2"" as well as official COVID-19 incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual burden of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Interest in COVID-19 (measured by topic intensity on the Internet) is unrelated to the officially notified viral pressure (measured by incidence) and probably physical risk of acquiring infection in Poland. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.","Jarynowski, Andrzej; Wójta-Kempa, Monika; Belik, Vitaly",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,341,1

Adaptive intelligence is the ability to adapt to, shape, and select real-world environments in ways that result in positive outcomes not only for oneself, but also for others and the world. Edward Zigler was among the first to recognize the importance of levels of adaptation to intellectual deficiency, arguing from early on that intellectual challenges needed to be recognized not just in terms of IQ but also in terms of adaptive functioning. Adaptive intelligence is compared to and contrasted with general intelligence, which is usually defined as the first factor in a factor analysis of psychometric tests. I first introduce the main issues in the article. Then I discuss how one even would decide what intelligence is. Next I discuss broader theories of intelligence and especially the theory of adaptive intelligence. Then I talk about the perishability of theories of intelligence and other things-to what extent are they set up so that people are willing and able to move beyond them? Finally, I discuss how individual outcomes do not necessarily predict collective outcomes.","Sternberg, Robert J",Development and psychopathology,341,16

Instrument positioning and lack of triangulation complicate single-incision laparoscopic surgery, and open surgical procedures are highly invasive. Using minimally invasive techniques with miniature robotic platforms potentially offers significant clinical benefits. A miniature robot platform has been designed to perform advanced laparoscopic surgery with speed, dexterity, and tissue-handling capabilities comparable to standard laparoscopic instruments working through trocars. The robotic platform includes a dexterous in vivo robot and a remote surgeon interface console. For this study, a standard laparoscope was mounted to the robot to provide vision and lighting capabilities. In addition, multiple robots could be inserted through a single incision rather than the traditional use of four or five different ports. These additional robots could provide capabilities such as tissue retraction and supplementary visualization or lighting. The efficacy of this robot has been demonstrated in a nonsurvival cholecystectomy in a porcine model. The procedure was performed through a single large transabdominal incision, with supplementary retraction being provided by standard laparoscopic tools. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a dexterous robot platform for performing single-incision, advanced laparoscopic surgery.","Lehman, Amy C; Wood, Nathan A; Farritor, Shane; Goede, Matthew R; Oleynikov, Dmitry",Surgical endoscopy,341,31

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can downregulate RAAS activation by unloading the left ventricle and increasing the cardiac output translating into a better end-organ perfusion improving survival. However, the absence of pulsatility brought about by continuous-flow devices may variably trigger RAAS activation depending on left ventricular (LV) intrinsic contractility, the design and speed of the pump device. Moreover, the concept of myocardial recovery is being tested in clinical trials and in this setting LVAD support combined with intense RAAS inhibition can promote recovery and ensure maintenance of LV function after explantation. Blood pressure control on LVAD recipients is key to avoiding complications as gastrointestinal bleeding, pump thrombosis and stroke. Furthermore, emerging data highlight the role of RAAS antagonists as prevention of arteriovenous malformations that lead to gastrointestinal bleeds. Future studies should focus on the role of angiotensin receptor inhibitors in preventing myocardial fibrosis in patients with LVADs and examine in greater details the target blood pressure for these patients.","Briasoulis, Alexandros; Ruiz Duque, Ernesto; Mouselimis, Dimitrios; Tsarouchas, Anastasios; Bakogiannis, Constantinos; Alvarez, Paulino",Journal of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system : JRAAS,341,1

Especially for at-risk, vulnerable populations like people who use drugs (PWUD), poor experiences with EMA may exacerbate existing chronic struggles while decreasing response rates. However, little research queries participants' experiences with EMA studies.Objectives: We explore participants' positive and negative experiences with EMA, identifying what they liked about the study, the problems they experienced, and suggested solutions to these problems.Methods: Results come from semi-structured interviews from 26 PWUD (6 women; 20 men) in Nebraska who participated in a two-week EMA pilot study on drug use with a study-provided smartphone. Participant responses were recorded by interviewers into open-text fields in Qualtrics. Data were analyzed with an iterative open coding procedure.Results: We found that many participants enjoyed the study and seamlessly incorporated the phone into their daily lives. There were a number of negative study aspects identified, however, as many participants experienced functional issues (e.g., running out of high-speed data, trouble keeping the phone charged, not able to answer questions within the two-hour timeframe) that detracted from their experience, especially if they were homeless.Conclusion: Our findings provide methodological considerations for studies with EMA components among at-risk, vulnerable populations, like PWUD.

Recently, taste disturbance is also considered as one of the predominant symptoms of COVID-19 although its pathogenesis requires further research. Localized taste disorders may be overlooked considering that whole-mouth taste perception is insured through several mechanisms. Individuals often fail to discern taste from flavor, and interviews/surveys are insufficient to properly assess taste function. Hence, various taste assessment methods have been developed. Among them, psychophysical methods are most widely applied in a clinical context. Less-biased electrophysiological, imaging, or morphological methods are used to a much lesser degree.

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING 142,659 adults seen in a primary care network from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional, comparing associations between area-based SES indicators and patient outcomes. DATA COLLECTION Address data were geocoded to construct area-based SES indicators at block group (BG), census tract (CT), and ZIP code (ZIP) levels. Data on health outcomes were abstracted from electronic records. Relative indices of inequality (RIIs) were calculated to quantify disparities detected by area-based SES indicators and compared to RIIs from self-reported educational attainment. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS ZIP indicators had less missing data than BG or CT indicators (p < .0001). Area-based SES indicators were strongly associated with self-report educational attainment (p < .0001). ZIP, BG, and CT indicators all detected expected SES gradients in health outcomes similarly. Single-item, cut point defined indicators performed as well as multidimensional indices and quantile indicators. CONCLUSIONS Area-based SES indicators detected health outcome differences well and may be useful for monitoring disparities within health care systems. Our preferred indicator was ZIP-level median household income or percent poverty, using cut points.","Berkowitz, Seth A; Traore, Carine Y; Singer, Daniel E; Atlas, Steven J",Health services research,341,1

To resolve those problems, the authors present the surgical outcomes of deep superior sulcus (DSS) augmentation using acellular dermal matrix in patients with anophthalmic or phthisis socket. The authors retrospectively reviewed anophthalmic or phthisis patients who underwent surgery for DSS augmentation using acellular dermal matrix. To evaluate surgical outcomes, the authors focused on 3 aspects: the possibility of wearing contact prosthesis, the degree of correction of the DSS, and any surgical complications. The degree of correction of DSS was classified as excellent: restoration of superior sulcus enough to remove sunken sulcus shadow; fair: gain of correction effect but sunken shadow remained; or fail: no effect of correction at all. Ten eyes of 10 patients were included. There was a mean 21.3 ± 37.1-month period from evisceration or enucleation to the operation for DSS augmentation. All patients could wear contact prosthesis after the operation (100%). The degree of correction was excellent in 8 patients (80%) and fair in 2. Three of 10 (30%) showed complications: eyelid entropion, upper eyelid multiple creases, and spontaneous wound dehiscence followed by inflammation after stitch removal. Uneven skin surface and paresthesia in the forehead area of the affected eye may be observed after surgery. The overall surgical outcomes were favorable, showing an excellent degree of correction of DSS and low surgical complication rates. This procedure is effective for patients who have DSS in the absence or atrophy of the eyeball.","Cho, Won-Kyung; Jung, Su-Kyung; Paik, Ji-Sun; Yang, Suk-Woo",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,341,8

Combining dopamine self-polymerization and a sol-gel method, SiO2 is in situ grown on a PDA-modified fabric surface to synergistically construct micro-nano rough structures. Finally, a superhydrophobic fabric is successfully obtained after coating the fabric with a layer of PDMS. The prepared fabric can maintain superhydrophobicity after immersion in various solvents (pH = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, DMF, ethanol, THF, n-hexane) for 24 h and strong ultraviolet irradiation for 60 min. Thanks to the highly reactive PDA clusters, the stronger interfacial bond between the fabric and SiO2 enables it to withstand 180 min of washing and 159.22 N tensile stress, showing strong adhesion strength. In addition, the modified fabric has excellent self-cleaning properties and is resistant to contamination such as milk, coffee and tea. More importantly, the prepared fabric can selectively repel water and adsorb oil, achieving above 90% oil-water separation efficiency even after 8 cycles.","Zhang, Jixi; Zhang, Ligui; Gong, Xiao",Soft matter,341,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five datasets in patients with lung tumors who had undergone a CTp protocol were evaluated. Each dataset consisted of one reference CT image from an initial cine slab and six subsequent breathhold helical volumes (16-row multi-detector CT), acquired during intravenous contrast administration. Each helical volume was registered to the reference image using two semiautomated intensity-based registration methods (rigid-translational and nonrigid), and 1D manual registration (the only registration method available in the relevant application software). The performance of each technique to align tumor regions was assessed quantitatively (percent overlap and distance of center of mass), and by a visual validation study (using a 5-point scale). The registration methods were statistically compared using linear mixed and ordinal probit regression models. RESULTS Quantitatively, tumor alignment with the nonrigid method compared to rigid-translation was borderline significant, which in turn was significantly better than the 1D manual method: average (± SD) percent overlap, 91.8 ± 2.3%, 87.7 ± 5.5%, and 77.6 ± 5.9%, respectively; and average (± SD) DCOM, 0.41 ± 0.16 mm, 1.08 ± 1.13 mm, and 2.99 ± 2.93 mm, respectively (all P < .0001). Visual validation confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION Semiautomated registration methods achieved superior alignment of lung tumors compared to the 1D manual method. This will hopefully translate into more reliable CTp analyses.","Chandler, Adam; Wei, Wei; Herron, Delise H; Anderson, Ella F; Johnson, Valen E; Ng, Chaan S",Academic radiology,341,20

A previous study demonstrated that gastric acid secretion, thought to be an important factor in the increase in the rate of GERD, in Japanese individuals increased in the era from the 1970s to the 1990s. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether gastric acid secretion has altered over the past two decades with and without the influence of Helicobacter pylori infection in nonelderly and elderly Japanese. METHODS Gastric acid secretion, the concentrations of serum gastrin, pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen II, and H. pylori infection were determined in 78 healthy Japanese subjects. The findings were compared with data obtained in the 1990s. RESULTS Basal acid output (BAO) and maximal acid output (MAO) gradually decreased with age in H. pylori-negative subjects. In addition, those with H. pylori infection tended to show decreased gastric acid secretion as compared with those without infection, particularly in the elderly group. MAO decreased gradually with age in males, whereas it remained unchanged with age in females. MAO in H. pylori-negative subjects has not changed over the past two decades (17.7 mEq/h vs 17.6 mEq/h in nonelderly subjects, and 15.2 mEq/h vs 12.7 mEq/h in elderly subjects). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the increased prevalence of GERD, gastric acid secretion has not increased over the past two decades in Japanese. However, secretion has decreased with age in males but not in females, which may partly explain the sex difference in the age-related GERD prevalence.","Ishimura, Norihisa; Owada, Yasuko; Aimi, Masahito; Oshima, Tadayuki; Kamada, Tomoari; Inoue, Kazuhiko; Mikami, Hironobu; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Miwa, Hiroto; Higuchi, Kazuhide; Kinoshita, Yoshikazu",Journal of gastroenterology,341,20

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of preoperative enteral nutritional support (PENS) on postoperative outcome in patients with CD complicated by malnutrition included in a prospective nationwide cohort. METHOD Malnutrition was defined as body mass index<18 kg/m2 and/or albuminemia<30g/L and/or weight loss>10%. PENS failure was defined as the requirement of additional preoperative parenteral nutrition to PENS. Univariate analysis of the risk factors of PENS failure was performed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to compare the outcomes between ""upfront surgery"" and ""PENS"" groups. The primary endpoint was the rate of intraabdominal septic morbidity and/or temporary defunctioning stoma. RESULTS Among 592 patients included, 149 were selected. In the intent to treat population including 20 (13.4%) patients with PENS failure, after PSM, 78 ""upfront surgery"" and 71 ""PENS""-matched patients were compared, with no significant difference in the primary endpoint. Perforating CD and preoperative intraabdominal fistula were associated with PENS failure (37.5 vs 16.1%, P=0.047, and 41.2% vs 16.2%, P=0.020 respectively).

Cardiovascular disease and sexual health share common risk factors (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking) and common mediating mechanisms (endothelial dysfunction, subclinical inflammation, and atherosclerosis). This generated a shift of thinking about the pathophysiology and subsequently the management of sexual dysfunction. The introduction of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors revolutionized the management of sexual dysfunction in men. This article will focus on erectile dysfunction and its association with arterial hypertension. This update of the position paper was created by the Working Group on Sexual Dysfunction and Arterial Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension. This working group has been very active during the last years in promoting the familiarization of hypertension specialists and related physicians with erectile dysfunction, through numerous lectures in national and international meetings, a position paper, newsletters, guidelines, and a book specifically addressing erectile dysfunction in hypertensive patients. It was noted that erectile dysfunction precedes the development of coronary artery disease. The artery size hypothesis has been proposed as a potential explanation for this observation. This hypothesis seeks to explain the differing manifestation of the same vascular condition, based on the size of the vessels. Clinical presentations of the atherosclerotic and/or endothelium disease in the penile arteries might precede the corresponding manifestations from larger arteries. Treated hypertensive patients are more likely to have sexual dysfunction compared with untreated ones, suggesting a detrimental role of antihypertensive treatment on erectile function. The occurrence of erectile dysfunction seems to be related to undesirable effects of antihypertensive drugs on the penile tissue. Available information points toward divergent effects of antihypertensive drugs on erectile function, with diuretics and beta-blockers possessing the worst profile and angiotensin receptor blockers and nebivolol the best profile.","Viigimaa, Margus; Vlachopoulos, Charalambos; Doumas, Michael; Wolf, Jacek; Imprialos, Konstantinos; Terentes-Printzios, Dimitios; Ioakeimidis, Nikolaos; Kotsar, Andres; Kiitam, Urmo; Stavropoulos, Konstantinos; Narkiewicz, Krzysztof; Manolis, Athanasios; Jelakovic, Bojan; Lovic, Dragan; Kreutz, Reinhold; Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Mancia, Giuseppe",Journal of hypertension,341,24

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to describe a standardized research ActiGraph and HRV (ActiGraph HRV) protocol for an ongoing randomized controlled trial to measure physical activity and short-term HRV in patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness. METHODS We outline the study protocol for the standardization of reliable and rigorous physical activity and HRV data collection using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT and Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor, and data analysis using ActiLife and Kubios software programs. RESULTS Sixty-four participants enrolled in the randomized controlled trial to date, and 45 (70.3%) have completed or are actively participating in the study. Heart rate variability data have been collected on 43 of the 45 participants (96%) to date. During the first data collection time point, 42 of 44 participants (95.5%) wore the ActiGraph for a minimum of 5 valid days, followed by 28 of 31 participants (90.3%) and 25 of 26 participants (96.2%) at subsequent data collection time points. The intraclass correlation for physical activity in this study is 0.95 and 0.98 for HRV. DISCUSSION Revisions to the protocol were successfully implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for data collection using social distancing. The protocol was additionally amended in response to an unanticipated problem with ActiGraph battery life using Bluetooth technology. Use of the ActiGraph HRV protocol has led to a reliable and rigorous measurement of physical activity and HRV for patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness in this randomized controlled trial.

Clinical outcomes including functional independence (0-2 modified Rankin Score), mortality, and home-discharge checked at 1 year post-IAT were compared among the three groups. Cost utility was calculated using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) estimated using the EuroQol-5 dimensions-3 levels questionnaire and the fees paid for institutional rehabilitation during the year post-IAT, and, was compared among the groups. RESULTS Patients in the ≤6-hr group showed higher functional independence (≤6-hr, 70%; >6-hr, 40%; no-recanalization, 6%, p < .001) and home-discharge rate (73%, 52%, 21%, and respectively, p < .001), and lower mortality (10%, 16%, and 43%, respectively, p < .001) at 1 year after IAT than other two groups. The cost utility of the ≤6-hr group was $35,557/QALY higher than that of the >6-hr group, and $27.829/QALY higher than no-recanalization group. CONCLUSIONS Rapid and successful recanalization of the occluded intracranial vessels within 6 hr after the onset of symptoms resulted in markedly higher cost utility and functional independence at 1 year post-IAT.","Jeong, Hye Seon; Shin, Jong Wook; Kwon, Hyon-Jo; Koh, Hyeon-Song; Nam, Hae-Sung; Yu, Hee Seon; Yoon, Na Young; Kim, Jei",Brain and behavior,341,8

BACKGROUND Patient safety is an important issue in healthcare organizations. As the release of Institute of Medicine reports in the United States of America, substantial interest has arisen in studying patient safety culture; however, the concept remains poorly defined. DATA SOURCES Multiple databases, including CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Anthropological Index Online, were searched from 1970 to 2006. A keyword search method was employed followed by a combined key word search. REVIEW METHODS A concept analysis based on Caron and Bowers' method was carried out using 45 papers, three books and three theses after examination of the abstracts to identify definitions, dimensions, perspectives and consequences needed for content and dimensional analyses. FINDINGS Nurses' shared values, beliefs and behavioural norms towards patient safety were identified as the overarching dimensions of the patient safety culture. The four sub-dimensions of patient safety culture were synthesized as system, personal, task-associated and interaction. Two main philosophical perspectives, functional and interpretative, were added to the analysis and further clarification was provided. CONCLUSION It is expected that understanding the nature, as well as the key elements of the concept, would assist with analysing the existing safety culture and help to determine the strategies to build or shape the safety culture.","Feng, Xianqiong; Bobay, Kathleen; Weiss, Marianne",Journal of advanced nursing,341,12

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many of these countries. This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in four parts. First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies; notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.","Kola, Lola; Kohrt, Brandon A; Hanlon, Charlotte; Naslund, John A; Sikander, Siham; Balaji, Madhumitha; Benjet, Corina; Cheung, Eliza Yee Lai; Eaton, Julian; Gonsalves, Pattie; Hailemariam, Maji; Luitel, Nagendra P; Machado, Daiane B; Misganaw, Eleni; Omigbodun, Olayinka; Roberts, Tessa; Salisbury, Tatiana Taylor; Shidhaye, Rahul; Sunkel, Charlene; Ugo, Victor; van Rensburg, André Janse; Gureje, Oye; Pathare, Soumitra; Saxena, Shekhar; Thornicroft, Graham; Patel, Vikram",The lancet.

METHODS A correlational cross-sectional study was conducted from April 11th to May 3rd 2020. Medical students who have been in home confinement and who accepted to participate in an online survey were targeted. Sociodemographic data, clinical variables, and data related to home confinement were collected. Participants also completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and Beck Hopelessness Scale. RESULTS Results showed a high prevalence of poor sleepers among medical students (72.5%) with poor subjective sleep quality, increased sleep latency, sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction. Multiple regression analysis revealed that family history of suicide attempts, tobacco use, perception of home confinement and reduced physical activity during home confinement significantly contributed to poor sleep quality. Among the psychological variables, anxiety and hopelessness significantly contributed to poor sleep quality in medical students during home confinement. CONCLUSIONS Results revealed a high prevalence of poor sleep quality in medical students who have been in home confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Except family history of suicide attempts, factors that significantly contributed to poor sleep quality were modifiable factors. Sleep quality and sleep parameters need to be assessed in this particular population and adequate measures aiming to promote quality of sleep need to be enhanced, given the crucial regenerative, homeostatic and psychological roles of sleep.","Saguem, B N; Nakhli, J; Romdhane, I; Nasr, S B",L'Encephale,341,1

METHODS A total of 500 patients (580 legs) were randomized to one of the three endovenous treatments or high ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV). Follow-up included clinical and duplex ultrasound examinations and VCSS and QOL questionnaires. Kaplan-Meier (KM) life-table analysis was used. P values below .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS At 3 years, eight (KM estimate, 7%), eight (KM estimate, 6.8%), 31 (KM estimate, 26.4%), and eight (KM estimate, 6.5%) of GSVs recanalized or had a failed stripping procedure (more than 10 cm open refluxing part of the treated GSV; CLF, EVLA, UGFS, and stripping, respectively; P < .01). Seventeen (KM estimate, 14.9%), 24 (KM estimate, 20%), 20 (KM estimate, 19.1%), and 22 (KM estimate, 20.2%) legs developed recurrent varicose veins (P = NS). The patterns of reflux and location of recurrent varicose veins were not different between the groups. Within 3 years after treatment, 12 (KM estimate, 11.1%), 14 (KM estimate, 12.5%), 37 (KM estimate, 31.6%), and 18 (KM estimate, 15.5%) legs were retreated in the CLF, EVLA, UGFS, and stripping groups, respectively (P < .01). VCSS, SF-36, and Aberdeen QOL scores improved significantly in all the groups with no difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS All treatment modalities were efficacious and resulted in a similar improvement in VCSS and QOL. However, more recanalization and reoperations were seen after UGFS.","Rasmussen, Lars; Lawaetz, Martin; Serup, Julie; Bjoern, Lars; Vennits, Bo; Blemings, Allan; Eklof, Bo",Journal of vascular surgery.

However, efficient delivery and expression of the therapeutic transgene at levels sufficient to result in phenotypic correction of the diseased state has proved elusive. This review focuses on the development of gene delivery strategies for the lungs. One of the principal prerequisites for successful gene therapy is the delivery of gene vectors to the target area within a tissue and to target cells within that area. Physical and biological targeting of the gene vectors and its application in various models is discussed. Subsequently, both viral and non-viral vectors are addressed with respect to their transfection efficiency in different lung cells, the longevity of expression and their immunogenicity. Also, the various methods for pulmonary gene delivery are evaluated for their merits and limitations.","Aneja, Manish K; Geiger, Johannes-Peter; Himmel, Anne; Rudolph, Carsten",Expert opinion on drug delivery,341,17

Using the texture feature extraction method of radiomics, i.e., the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), texture features can be extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images with high spatial resolution. In this work, we propose a kernel reconstruction method combining autocorrelation texture features derived from the GLCM. The new kernel function includes the correlations of both the intensity and texture features from the prior image. By regarding the GLCM as a discrete approximation of a probability density function, the asymptotically gray-level-invariant autocorrelation texture feature is generated, which can maintain the accuracy of texture features extracted from small image regions by reducing the number of quantized image gray levels. A computer simulation shows that the proposed method can effectively reduce the noise in the reconstructed image compared to the maximum likelihood expectation maximum (MLEM) method and improve the image quality and tumor region accuracy compared to the original kernel method for low-count PET reconstruction. A simulation study on clinical patient images also shows that the proposed method can improve the whole image quality and that the reconstruction of a high-uptake lesion is more accurate than that achieved by the original kernel method.","Gao, Dongfang; Zhang, Xu; Zhou, Chao; Fan, Wei; Zeng, Tianyi; Yang, Qian; Yuan, Jianmin; He, Qiang; Liang, Dong; Liu, Xin; Yang, Yongfeng; Zheng, Hairong; Hu, Zhanli",Physics in medicine and biology,341,20

METHODS This was a secondary analysis of data from a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled patients who had persistent moderate pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, despite having received nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. The pain measures used in this study (focusing on the drug-placebo difference at week 8) were patient-rated pain severity, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and the ICOAP. RESULTS The mean difference between duloxetine and placebo at week 8 for patient-rated pain severity, the BPI average pain, WOMAC pain, and each ICOAP scale was statistically significant (P < 0.001 for each). The ICOAP total showed a moderate effect size of 0.53, whereas the constant and intermittent scores showed effect sizes of 0.47 and 0.49, respectively. The patient-rated pain severity and the BPI average pain showed similar moderate effect sizes of 0.59 and 0.53, respectively. CONCLUSION The study demonstrated efficacy of duloxetine compared with placebo when using the ICOAP scale in a placebo-controlled trial. The observed treatment effect size for the ICOAP scores was similar to that for other reliable, valid and responsive pain assessments.

PURPOSE The primary purpose of this study was to analyze if the DOS has any effect on clinical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING A post hoc analysis was performed on an original prospective clinical study analyzing clinical outcomes and cervical sagittal alignment correlations. PATIENTS SAMPLE Fifty-eight patients undergoing one- or two-level ACDF surgeries for cervical degenerative radiculopathy were analyzed. OUTCOME MEASURES Standardized questionnaires were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. Neck and arm pain was evaluated using (Visual Analog Scale [VAS]). Two scales of Health-Related Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (Short-Form 36 Health Survey [SF-36]) were used for this study: the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Neck disability index (NDI) was used to evaluate chronic disability in activities of daily living. The patients completed a self-reported Patient Satisfaction with Results Survey. METHODS Patients who had previous or redo surgeries, were diagnosed with myelopathy or had more than two-level ACDF surgeries were excluded, leaving a total of 58 patients. The mean follow-up was 37.2 months (range 12-54). Patients were divided into two groups for clinical outcome analyses according to the DOS: patients who had surgery within 6 months (n=29) or more than 6 months (n=29) after becoming symptomatic. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in any demographic or clinical parameters among the patient groups. Controlling for preoperative scores, the patients who had surgery within 6 months reported significantly higher reduction (p=.04) in arm pain scores compared with the patients who waited more than 6 months. No significant differences were detected in postoperative neck pain VAS (p=.3), NDI (p=.06), SF-36 PCS (p=.08), and MCS (p=.8) scores. CONCLUSIONS Neck and upper extremity pain can be successfully treated conservatively. In those cases, when surgical intervention is pursued, patients with shorter DOS have better improvement in radiculopathy symptoms that is statistically significant.","Burneikiene, Sigita; Nelson, E Lee; Mason, Alexander; Rajpal, Sharad; Villavicencio, Alan T",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,341,1

This study aims to quantitate circulating levels of IgA/IgG and IgG subtypes induced at different days postonset of symptoms, in severe and nonsevere patients. For this, serum or plasma samples (n = 146) collected from 79 COVID-19 patients were used. Indirect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific IgA, IgG, and IgG subtype specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed. Antibody titers between severe and nonsevere patients were compared at different times postonset of clinical symptoms. Titers in ELISA were compared to neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Over 75% patients were positive for IgA/IgG antibodies in the first week. The ELISA titers did not differ during the first week; however, severe disease exhibited raised titers thereafter. Nab titers correlated with the ELISA titers in mild presentation but not in severe disease. IgA and IgG1 antibodies correlated stronger with Nabs. The findings highlighted that IgA together with IgG play an important in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. These results will prove useful in assessing efficacy of vaccines and understanding disease pathogenesis.","Patil, Harshad P; Rane, Prajakta S; Shrivastava, Shubham; Palkar, Sonali; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh C; Arankalle, Vidya A",Viral immunology,341,16

The purpose of this study was to compare lead damage from an insulated cautery blade when used with several different techniques that included coagulation (COAG) versus cutting (CUT) mode, perpendicular active edge (active) versus parallel flat blade (flat) orientation (phase 1), and using one commercially available blade (PhotonBlade) versus another (PlasmaBlade) (phase 2). METHODS In phase 1, lesions were delivered using combinations of: (1) COAG and CUT; (2) active and flat orientation; and (3) polyurethane, silicone, and copolymer insulation. In phase 2, lesions were delivered using combinations of: (1) PlasmaBlade and PhotonBlade, (2) four power output levels, and (3) eight different lead models. Lead damage was scored on an ordinal scale of 0 to 4. RESULTS Phase 1: more leads were damaged using COAG than CUT (48% vs 2%, P < 0.0001). When using COAG, 74% of lesions using active orientation had damage versus 22% of lesions using flat orientation (P = 0.0002). COAG lesions to copolymer (61%) and polyurethane (68%) leads had greater damage than silicone (17%) (P = 0.006 and P = 0.003, respectively). Phase 2: 75% of treatments using PlasmaBlade had damage versus 40% of treatments with PhotonBlade (P < 0.0001). Higher power resulted in more damage. At the commonly used setting of CUT 20 W, damage occurred in 39% of treatments using PlasmaBlade versus 13% using PhotonBlade (P = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS COAG resulted in more damage than CUT; this effect was greatest with the active edge, and with polyurethane or copolymer insulation. PhotonBlade was associated with less damage to leads than PlasmaBlade.","Wasserlauf, Jeremiah; Esheim, Taiki; Jarett, Natasha M; Chan, Eric K Y; Schaller, Robert D; Garcia, Fermin C; Knight, Bradley P",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,341,17

Reasons for variation in radiosensitivity are not well known. We examined preirradiation gene expression in peripheral blood among male and female rhesus macaques which did or did not survive (up to 60 days) after whole-body irradiation with 700 cGy (LD66/60). RNA samples originated from a blinded randomized Good Laboratory Practice study in 142 irradiated rhesus macaques. Animals were untreated (placebo), or treated using recombinant human IL-12, G-CSF or combination of the two. We evaluated gene expression in a two-phase study design where phase I was a whole genome screen [next generation sequencing (NGS)] for mRNAs (RNA-seq) using five RNA samples from untreated male and female animals per group of survivor and non-survivor (total n = 20). Differential gene expression (DGE) was defined as a statistically significant and ≥2-fold up- or downregulation of mRNA species and was calculated between groups of survivors and non-survivors (reference) and by gender. Altogether 659 genes were identified, but the overlapping number of differentially expressed genes (DGE) observed in both genders was small (n = 36). Fifty-eight candidate mRNAs were chosen for independent validation in phase II using the remaining samples (n = 122) evaluated with qRT-PCR. Among the 58 candidates, 16 were of significance or borderline significance (t test) by DGE. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis further refined and identified the most outstanding validated genes and gene combinations. For untreated male macaques, we identified EPX (P = 0.005, ROC=1.0), IGF2BP1 (P = 0.05, ROC=0.74) and the combination of EPX with SLC22A4 (P = 0.03, ROC=0.85) which appeared most predictive for the clinical outcome for treated and combined (untreated and treated) male macaque groups, respectively. For untreated, treated and both combined female macaque groups the same gene (MBOAT4, P = 0.0004, ROC = 0.81) was most predictive. Based on the probability function of the ROC curves, up to 74% of preirradiation RNA measurements predicted survival with a positive and negative predictive value ranging between 85-100% and associated odds ratios reflecting a 2-3-fold elevated risk for surviving per unit change (cycle threshold value) in gene expression. In conclusion, we identified gender-dependent genes and gene combinations in preirradiation blood samples for survival prediction after irradiation in rhesus macaques.","Ostheim, P; Majewski, M; Gluzman-Poltorak, Z; Vainstein, V; Basile, L A; Lamkowski, A; Schüle, S; Kaatsch, H L; Haimerl, M; Stroszczynski, C; Port, M; Abend, M",Radiation research,341,16

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Postoperative wound dehiscence represents a major complication in spinal surgery, particularly after en bloc tumor resection, because of the extended sacrifice of soft tissues and adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. METHODS Five patients, with a mean age of 52 years (range, 24-71 years), who underwent omental flaps for the treatment of postoperative complication in spine tumor resections were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Four of 5 patients underwent omental transposition after a mean of 15 months (range, 4-27) from the previous surgery because of dehiscence of the wound (all of them had cerebrospinal fluid leak: 1 transpleural and in 3 cases, associated with deep infection), whereas one patient underwent the omental flap procedure at the time of elective spinal surgery because of several contemporary risk factors for wound healing. At the time of discharge after a mean of 36 days (range, 23-53), all patients had well-healed surgical wounds with an acceptable structural and aesthetic result. One of the patients had ileus, requiring surgical lysis of abdominal adhesions 3 months after omentum flap procedure. No other complications were observed. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that pedicled omental flap is a viable option for the treatment of complicated spinal wounds, helping in the resolution of the infection and CSF leak.","Sambri, Andrea; Gasbarrini, Alessandro; Cialdella, Sergio; De Iaco, Pierandrea; Boriani, Stefano","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",341,30

OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the effects of HP eradication on PD symptoms. METHODS In this parallel-group, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled, single-center trial, patients with PD with positive HP urea breath test and serology were block randomized (1:1) to receive standard eradication triple therapy or identically appearing placebo capsules for 1 week. Prespecified motor (International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], timed tests, and home-based wearable sensor measurements), nonmotor (Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and quality-of-life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39) outcome measures were assessed at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was the baseline-to-week 12 change in ON medication MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for concomitant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was performed at baseline and repeated at week 24, together with the urea breath test. RESULTS A total of 310 patients were screened for eligibility and 80 were randomly assigned, of whom 67 were included in the full-analysis set (32 treatment group patients, 35 placebo patients). HP eradication did not improve MDS-UPDRS motor scores at week 12 (mean difference 2.6 points in favor of placebo, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 5.6, P = 0.089). There was no significant improvement in any motor, nonmotor, or quality-of-life outcome at weeks 12 and 52. Both the full-analysis and per-protocol analyses (based on eradication status) supported these conclusions. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth status did not influence treatment results. CONCLUSIONS HP eradication does not improve clinical outcomes in PD, suggesting that there is no justification for routine HP screening or eradication with the goal of improving PD symptoms. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","Tan, Ai Huey; Lim, Shen-Yang; Mahadeva, Sanjiv; Loke, Mun Fai; Tan, Jiun Yan; Ang, Ban Hong; Chin, Kok Ping; Mohammad Adnan, Amni Fatihah; Ong, Shawna Mei Chien; Ibrahim, Aimi Izzah; Zulkifli, Nusyaibah; Lee, Jing Kun; Lim, Wan Ting; Teo, Yong Teck; Kok, Yong Leng; Ng, Tze Ying; Tan, Aaron Guan Siang; Zulkifle, Intan Maisara; Ng, Chin Khoon; Ee, Soon Sean; Arafin, Shuhaina; Mohamad Shukori, Khairunnisa; Vadivelu, Jamunarani S; Marras, Connie; Fox, Susan H; Lang, Anthony E",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,341,31

These behavioral adaptations counteract spontaneous self-touching reflex gestures. I propose to explore the mind-body experience generated by these gesture changes in this health context.Method : I conducted a qualitative study with nine nurses who volunteered as reinforcements. The semistructured interviews I carried out were analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach.Results : The perception of the risk of self-inoculation is not related to the level of virus exposure. Facial PPE is perceived both as reassuring and difficult to put up with. The experience of self-touches is influenced by the level of attention the subject pays to his or her face and by the medical background related to this. Three kinds of mind-body adaptations are used to control self-touching : control by avoidance, control by keeping one’s hands busy, and compensatory bodily strategies. The representations of the bodily self are modified in terms of gestures and of the feeling of humanness. This generates a form of bodily abandonment and a lived experience of soiled bodies.Conclusion : The results highlight the cognitive load involved in refraining from self-touching and with the wearing of facial PPE. They emphasize the importance of questioning the implications of these sensorimotor modifications. Supporting health professionals in assessing the mind-body repercussions in a pandemic situation appears key.","Liné, Claire; Andrieu, Bernard; Moro, Marie Rose; Lachal, Jonathan",Recherche en soins infirmiers,341,31

Radiomics exploits sophisticated image analysis tools coupled with statistical elaboration to extract the wealth of information hidden inside medical images, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and/or Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, routinely performed in the everyday clinical practice. Many efforts have been devoted in recent years to the standardization and validation of radiomics approaches, to demonstrate their usefulness and robustness beyond any reasonable doubts. However, the booming of publications and commercial applications of radiomics approaches warrant caution and proper understanding of all the factors involved to avoid ""scientific pollution"" and overly enthusiastic claims by researchers and clinicians alike.

OBJECTIVE To clarify the effectiveness of the soft coagulation system for stopping bleeding from the epidural vein using different outputs and the safety in terms of tissue damage including spinal cord injury. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Problems associated with coagulation using an electrosurgical device, such as carbonization of tissue or adhesion to the electrode, have been highlighted. So called ""soft coagulation"" has been developed to solve these problems. Its' utility as well as the safety of the neural structure in spine surgery has never been reported. METHODS A total of 3 animals and 45 spinal segments were used. Total laminectomy was performed to expose the dural tube and epidural venous plexus. Stable bleeding was induced by a 22 G needle puncture. Soft coagulation monopolar output (SCM), soft coagulation bipolar output (SCB), and conventional bipolar output (CB) were used as the coagulators. Valid hemostasis was defined as macroscopically complete bleeding stoppage by coagulation within 3 minutes. The neurological assessment was evaluated by somatosensory evoked potential. Histologic analysis was performed to determine the area of thermal damage. RESULTS Valid hemostasis ratio was 75.0% of SCM group, 68.8% of SCB group, and 30.8% of CB group. Somatosensory evoked potential monitoring revealed that spinal cord injury was observed in 4 lesions (25%) of the SCM group. Neither bipolar groups (SCB and CB) showed any changes in waveform pattern. Histologic analysis revealed that severe thermal damages were observed in the epidural space of the SCM group. CONCLUSIONS The usefulness of soft coagulation is revealed in terms of bleeding stoppage from epidural vessels and reduced soft-tissue damage compared with the conventional electric device. However, assessing the potential risk of severe neural tissue damage including spinal cord injury, a bipolar soft coagulation is strongly recommended for use in spine surgery.","Nishida, Kotaro; Kakutani, Kenichiro; Maeno, Koichiro; Takada, Toru; Yurube, Takashi; Kuroda, Ryosuke; Kurosaka, Masahiro",Journal of spinal disorders & techniques,341,24

Many older adults worldwide are continuing to work past traditional retirement age, raising the question whether older adults experience depression, anxiety, or burnout at the same or greater levels as younger workers, and whether there are differences by age in these levels over time. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal survey of 1161 currently employed US clergy followed every 6-12 months for up to 66 months. MEASUREMENTS Depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Anxiety was measured using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Burnout symptoms were assessed using the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and sense of personal accomplishment (PA). RESULTS Older participants had lower scores of depression, anxiety, EE, and DP and higher levels of PA over time compared to younger adults. Levels of EE decreased for older working adults, while not significantly changing over time for those younger. DP symptoms decreased over time among those 55 years or older but increased among those 25-54 years. CONCLUSIONS Older working adults may have higher levels of resilience and be able to balance personal life with their occupation as well as may engage in certain behaviors that increase social support and, for clergy, spiritual well-being that may decrease stress in a way that allows these older adults to appear to tolerate working longer without poorer mental health outcomes.","Hybels, Celia F; Blazer, Dan G; Eagle, David E; Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean",International psychogeriatrics,341,1

Recently, embroidered electrodes have been presented as a low-cost alternative to the current commercial solutions. However, the high cost of equipment used in their fabrication forms a barrier to deployment. To address this, this paper presents the first study into the hand-sewing of electrodes for surface electromyography to assess its feasibility as an affordable, alternative means of production. In experiments reported here, batches of hand-sewn electrodes from six novice embroiderers are tested for (i) manufacturing consistency, and (ii) myographic data acquisition against conventional gelled and machine-sewn electrodes. First, the electrical properties of the created electrodes are assessed through simple resistance measurements. Then, linear regression is performed using electromyography data to test if force-variation detection is feasible. The results demonstrate that hand-sewn electrodes provide similar sensitivity to force variation as their machine-sewn counterparts according to the linear regression gradients calculated ( 8.84 using the hand-sewn electrodes and 9.38 using the machine-sewn electrodes, on the flexor muscles of the forearm).

RECENT FINDINGS Through this analysis, the authors propose enhancements to PBL sessions that may make them more optimal for developing knowledge in pediatric medicine. These include utilizing an interactive video of the clinical problem to more uniformly assess the learner's knowledge gaps, supporting the creation and evolution of peer-to-peer learning communities, and helping to educate facilitators in how to guide dialogue in this type of educational setting.

Beginning in 2004 with preclinical feasibility studies, and followed by the creation of the NOSCAR® collaboration between The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, procedural development followed a stepwise incremental pathway. The work of this consortium has included white paper analyses, obtaining outside independent funding for basic science and procedural development, and, ultimately, the initiation of a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing NOTES® cholecystectomy as an alternative procedure to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS Ninety patients were randomized into a randomized clinical trial with the primary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority of the transvaginal and transgastric arms to the laparoscopic arm. In the original trial design, there were both transgastric and transvaginal groups to be compared to the laparoscopic control group. However, after enrollment and randomization of 6 laparoscopic controls and 4 transgastric cases into the transgastric group, this arm was ultimately deemed not practical due to lagging enrollment, and the arm was closed. Three transgastric via the transgastric approach were performed in total with 9 laparoscopic control cases enrolled through the TG arm. Overall a total of 41 transvaginal and their 39 laparoscopic cholecystectomy controls were randomized into the study with 37 transvaginal and 33 laparoscopic cholecystectomies being ultimately performed. Overall total operating time was statistically longer in the NOTES® group: 96.9 (64.97) minutes versus 52.1 (19.91) minutes. RESULTS There were no major adverse events such as common bile duct injury or return to the operating room for hemorrhage. Intraoperative blood loss, length of stay, and total medication given in the PACU were not statistically different. There were no conversions in the NOTES® group to a laparoscopic or open procedure, nor were there any injuries, bile leaks, hemorrhagic complications, wound infections, or wound dehiscence in either group. There were no readmissions. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores were 3.4 (CI 2.82) in the laparoscopic group and 2.9 (CI 1.96) in the transvaginal group (p = 0.41). The clinical assessment on cosmesis scores was not statistically different when recorded by clinical observers for most characteristics measured when the transvaginal group was compared to the laparoscopic group. Taken as a whole, the results slightly favor the transvaginal group. SF-12 scores were not statistically different at all postoperative time points except for the SF-12 mental component which was superior in the transvaginal group at all time points (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The safety profile for transvaginal cholecystectomy demonstrates that this approach is safe and produces at least non-inferior clinical results with superior cosmesis, with a transient reduction in discomfort. The transvaginal approach to cholecystectomy should no longer be considered experimental. As a model for intersociety collaboration, the study demonstrated the ultimate feasibility and success of partnership as a model for basic research, procedural development, fundraising, and clinical trial execution for novel interventional concepts, regardless of physician board certification.","Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Roberts, Kurt; Romanelli, John R; Desilets, David J; Earle, David; Horgan, Santiago; Swanstrom, Lee; Hungness, Eric; Soper, Nathaniel; Kochman, Michael L",Surgical endoscopy,341,24

Method: s Organized by maternal and child health care institute in the 16 districts of Shanghai, a cross sectional study was conducted among pregnant women who came to pregnancy registration in the community health centers or attended ANC in midwifery hospitals from February 7 to February 12, 2020. Consented participating women completed a semi-structured online questionnaire voluntarily. Data was analyzed using frequency,chi-square test and scoring. Result: s A total of 2 002 valid questionnaires were collected from 183 community health centers and 67 midwifery hospitals. About 94.6%(1 894/2 002) of the pregnant women worried about being infected during the COVID-19 epidemic, and 14.7% (294/2 002) demanded for psychological consultation. Time-lapse appointments for ANC were requested by 87.7% (1 756/2 002) of the participants for avoiding presenting themselves in people-density places. Compared with other pregnancy trimesters, pregnant women in the second trimester were more willing to reduce the frequency of ANC (35.2% versus 39.5% versus 48.1%, P<0.01). Compared with multiparas, primiparas were more willing to have online consultation and guidance (49.2% versus 63.8%, P<0.01). Regarding the needs for health knowledge on COVID-19, personal protection against 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the most concerned for pregnant women, and 71.0% (1 421/2 002) of them preferred to obtain knowledge through health applications, official Weibo and WeChat. Conclusions: Pregnant women in Shanghai critically concern about the risk of 2019-nCoV infections, and highly demand knowledge and measures on prevention and protection from COVID-19. They ask for having time-lapse appointments for ANC and online access to health information and services. Maternal and child care institutes should understand the demands of pregnant women, optimize the means of ANC service, and provide tailored and accessible health education and service for the safety of mother and child.","Du, L; Gu, Y B; Cui, M Q; Li, W X; Wang, J; Zhu, L P; Xu, B",Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,341,1

This technique enables complete surgical excision and can be used for exophytic submucosal tumors of the stomach. Four patients underwent RPS with this technique, and the outcomes were good. DISCUSSION Our cowboy technique enables the safe full-thickness excision of gastric submucosal tumors with exophytic growth and is very useful in performing RPS.","Tsuboi, Kazuto; Yano, Fumiaki; Omura, Nobuo; Misawa, Takeyuki; Kashiwagi, Hideyuki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,341,1

A pseudo reproductive number (R) was used to compare outcomes under various parameter conditions. We also expanded the simulation to a specific real-world scenario; namely airport self check-in and baggage drop. Results revealed that the required rate of cleaning/disinfecting of screens to effectively mitigate R can be inordinately high.

It is essential to understand the relationship between specific processes that have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the level of burnout of health workers. This study aims to determine health workers’ perceptions regarding changing processes and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study was carried out in a descriptive design. The research population consists of health workers who are actively working in Turkey. A web-based survey sampled 537 health workers who agreed to participate in the study. Research data was collected during dates between December 31, 2020, and January 10, 2021. This study measured health workers’ perceptions of burnout and their experiences and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: According to the findings of the study, 52% of health workers reported burnout. As a result of the regression analysis, we found that increased workload in nurses (B=1.12, t=0.56, p<0.05), failure to provide a safe work environment to physicians (B=1.04, t=2.28, p<0.05), increased mobbing on non-healthcare workers (B=0.74, t=2.31, p<0.05) and management vulnerabilities (B=0.71, t=2.02, p<0.05) had a positive impact on health care workers’ burnout levels. Conclusion: The changing processes in the COVID-19 pandemic have increased burnout rates in health professionals. Health care workers should be given the support they need to do their jobs, stay safe.","Sengul, H.; Bulut, A.; Kahraman, B.",Haseki Tip Bulteni,341,7

Also, a novel method is presented to define the fitness function, i.e. the function which measures quantitatively the accuracy of the rule. The proposed fitness function is benefited from parallelism due to the parallel execution of data instances. To this end, two novel concepts;coverage matrix and reduction vectors are used and an altered form of the reduction vector is compared with previous works. Our CUDA program performs operations on coverage matrix and reduction vector in parallel. Also these data structures are used for evaluation of fitness function and calculation of genetic operators in parallel. We proposed a vector called average coverage to handle crossover and mutation properly. Our proposed method obtained a maximum accuracy of 99.74% for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) dataset, 95.73% for Poker dataset, and 100% for Covid-19 dataset.

It should also be well accepted by the population and have a simple logistic chain. To fulfill these criteria, we developed a thermostable, orally administered vaccine that can induce a robust mucosal neutralizing immune response. We used our platform based on retrovirus-derived enveloped virus-like particles (e-VLPs) harnessed with variable surface proteins (VSPs) from the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, affording them resistance to degradation and the triggering of robust mucosal cellular and antibody immune responses after oral administration. We made e-VLPs expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), with or without membrane protein (M) expression. We found that prime-boost administration of VSP-decorated e-VLPs expressing a pre-fusion stabilized form of S and M triggers robust mucosal responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters, which translate into complete protection from a viral challenge. Moreover, they dramatically boosted the IgA mucosal response of intramuscularly injected vaccines. We conclude that our thermostable orally administered e-VLP vaccine could be a valuable addition to the current arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, in a stand-alone prime-boost vaccination strategy or as a boost for existing vaccines.","Bellier, Bertrand; Saura, Alicia; Luján, Lucas A.; Molina, Cecilia R.; Lujan, Hugo D.; Klatzmann, David",bioRxiv,341,16

However, existing video-music retrieval methods only based on the visual modality cannot show promising performance regarding videos with fine-grained virtual contents. In this paper, we also investigate the widely added voice-overs in short videos and propose a novel framework to retrieve BGM for fine-grained short videos. In our framework, we use the self-attention (SA) and the cross-modal attention (CMA) modules to explore the intra- and the inter-relationships of different modalities respectively. For balancing the modalities, we dynamically assign different weights to the modal features via a fusion gate. For paring the query and the BGM embeddings, we introduce a triplet pseudo-label loss to constrain the semantics of the modal embeddings. As there are no existing virtual-content video-BGM retrieval datasets, we build and release two virtual-content video datasets HoK400 and CFM400. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with large margins.","Li, Tingtian; Sun, Zixun; Zhang, Haoruo; Li, Jin; Wu, Ziming; Zhan, Hui; Yu, Yipeng; Shi, Hengcan",,341,24

Utilizing data on people’s mobility could provide unique and valuable insights to governments and institutions to better manage the crisis. These entities, however, have not traditionally had access to, nor the experience of applying, continuous anonymized and aggregated data on people mobility. This article aims to show how the Public Health Agency in Sweden successfully collaborated with a Nordic Telecoms operator to make use of such data during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it investigates how the collaboration started, approaches used to go from data to insight, outcomes and impact, and lessons learned on both sides. Telia, the largest telecom operator in the Nordics, had an existing product commercially available that provided anonymized and aggregated insights about people’s movement. Several challenges existed within Telia as it was the first time worldwide a collaboration with a Public Health Agency would take place and social benefits had to be weighed against commercial and reputational risks. The hypothesis at the beginning of the pandemic was that the solution could be adapted to fit the needs of policymakers and the internal challenges could be overcome, while providing a meaningful contribution to the fight against the virus. The results show that it is possible to both form a mutually beneficial collaboration between a telecom operator and a public institution, and to make use of mobility data in evidence-based policymaking without compromising applicable personal data protection laws.","Ågren, Kristofer Bjelkmar Pär Allison Elin",Data & Policy,341,16

Initial local and global evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients who undergo surgery, and those who become infected perioperatively, have an increased mortality risk post surgery. Objectives. To analyse and describe the 30-day mortality, presurgical COVID-19 status and hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of patients, both SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative, undergoing orthopaedic surgery at a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa (SA) during the first COVID-19 peak. Methods. This single-centre, observational, prospective study included patients who underwent orthopaedic procedures from 1 April 2020 (beginning of the COVID-19 case increase in SA) to 31 July 2020 (first COVID-19 peak in SA). All patients were screened for COVID-19 and were confirmed positive if they had a positive laboratory quantitative polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on a nasopharyngeal or oral swab. Thirty-day mortality, presurgical COVID-19 status and hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed. Results. Overall, a total of 433 operations were performed on 346 patients during the timeframe. Of these patients, 65.9% (n=228) were male and 34.1% (n=118) were female. The mean (standard deviation) age was 42.5 (16.8) years (range 9 - 89). Of the patients, 5 (1.4%) were identified as COVID-19 patients under investigation (PUI) on admission and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before surgery, and 1 (0.3%) contracted SARS-CoV-2 perioperatively;all survived 30 days post surgery. Twenty-nine patients were lost to follow-up, and data were missing for 6 patients. The final analysis was performed excluding these 35 patients. Of the 311 patients included in the final 30-day mortality analysis, 303 (97%) had a follow-up observation ≥30 days after the operation. The overall 30-day mortality for these patients was 2.5% (n=8 deaths). None of the recorded deaths were of screened COVID-19 PUI. Conclusions. We report a low 30-day mortality rate of 2.5% (n=8) for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery at our hospital during the first COVID-19 peak. None of the deaths were COVID-19 related, and all patients who tested SARS-CoV-2-positive, before or after surgery, survived. Our overall 30-day mortality rate correlates with several other reports of orthopaedic centres analysing over similar timeframes during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding mortality and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, we can conclude that with the appropriate measures taken, it was safe to undergo orthopaedic procedures at our hospital during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in SA.","Waters, R.; Dey, R.; Laubscher, M.; Dunn, R.; Maqungo, S.; McCollum, G.; Nortje, M.; Roche, S.; Hilton, T.; Mugla, W.; Held, M.",South African Medical Journal,341,10

We compared the sensitivity and specificity of the two rapid antigen tests against RT-PCR results in 130 symptomatic and 130 asymptomatic adults. In addition, we evaluated the suitability and ease-of-use of the BD Veritor test in a subsample of study participants (n=42) and implementers (n=5). The sensitivity of the BD Veritor rapid antigen 66 test was 70% in symptomatic (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51-85%) and 87% (95% CI: 69-96%) in asymptomatic individuals with positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR, for overall sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 66-88%).

We showed previously that healthy older humans (>65 years old) have reduced antigen-specific cutaneous immunity to varicella zoster virus (VZV) antigen challenge. This was associated with p38 MAP kinase driven inflammation that was induced by mild tissue injury caused by the injection of the antigen itself. Here we show that non-specific injury induced by injection of air or saline into the skin of older adults recruits CCR2+CD14+ monocytes by CCL2 produced by senescent fibroblasts. These monocytes reduced TRM proliferation via secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Pre-treatment with a p38-MAPK inhibitor (Losmapimod) in older adults in vivo significantly decreased CCL2 expression, recruitment of monocyte into the skin, COX2 expression and PGE2 production. This enhanced the VZV response in the skin. Therefore, local inflammation arising from interaction between senescent cells and monocytes leads to immune decline in the skin during ageing, a process that can be reversed. Summary Inflammation resulting from tissue injury blocks antigen-specific cutaneous immunity during ageing. Monocytes recruited to the skin inhibit TRM function through COX2-derived prostaglandin E2 production. Blocking inflammation and resulting prostaglandin E2 production with a p38-MAP kinase inhibitor significantly enhances cutaneous antigen-specific responses.","Chambers, Emma S; Vukmanovic-Stejic, Milica; Shih, Barbara B; Trahair, Hugh; Subramanian, Priya; Devine, Oliver P; Glanville, James; Gilroy, Derek; Rustin, Malcom; Freeman, Tom C; Mabbot, Neil A; Akbar, Arne N",bioRxiv,341,17

It is unclear how they are searching for and finding meaning in the face of this adversity. This study sought to understand how African immigrants in the United States are searching for and making meaning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews remotely with 20 immigrants from West Africa (Nigeria and Ghana), East Africa (Somali and Rwanda), and Central Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo). The meaning-making model was used as a framework to understand the processes of coping during a significant, adverse life event. The study found that some participants attempted to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their global meaning by seeking answers as to why the pandemic occurred and creating positive illusions. Some redefined their priorities and reframed the pandemic in a positive light. Participants found meaning in the form of accepting the pandemic as a reality of life, appreciating events previously taken for granted, and making positive changes in their lives. This study’s findings can inform health care providers of the meaning-making processes of African immigrants’ and the need to assist them in their search for meaning.

However, around 27% of the fetuses from pregnant infected mothers may develop several fetal brain and ocular pathology. Here we show that murine and peripheral blood human neutrophils support ZIKV infection and replication both in vitro and in vivo, which may correlate to the facilitation of vertical transmission. ZIKV did not interfere with cell viability, neither induced ROS production nor the release of NETs by infected neutrophils. Also, ZIKV infection of neutrophils did not trigger a pro-inflammatory profile, as evidenced by qPCR and proteomic analysis. Interestingly, ZIKV-infected neutrophils were isolated from the placenta were highly infected. The transference of in vitro ZIKV-infected neutrophils to pregnant female mice favored the transference of viral particles to the fetus. Conversely, neutrophil depletion with monoclonal antibodies reduced fetal viral loads whereas the treatment with recombinant G-CSF has the opposite effect.

Based on comparisons with visitation statistics released by the U.S. National Park Service, our results confirmed that mobility records from digital devices can effectively capture park visitation patterns but with much finer spatiotemporal granularity. In general, triggers of visitation changes corresponded well with the parks’ management responses to COVID-19, with all six parks showing dramatic decreases in the number of visitors (compared to 2019) beginning in March 2020 and continuing through April and May. As restrictions were eased to promote access to the parks and the benefits associated with outdoor recreation, visitation in 2020 approached or even passed that from 2019 by late summer or early autumn at most of the parks.

The survey captured data on patients pain impact, hurts, management, treatments, communication with their caregivers and their guardians perception. The survey was performed online, or face to face and telephone interview if online was not possible. Contacts of patients and parents were obtained from the database of Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria. A total of 105 (80 patients and 25 parents) participants responded to the survey. The age distribution of respondents was highest at 56 percent in the age bracket of 13 to 18 years old. Pain crisis were very common amongst patients. The survey revealed that the type of treatment or care received at these times determined whether or not the patients visited the hospital when they had pain crises. In addition, as patients reports an increase in ill treatment they experienced in the hands of health care givers, so did the fear of accessing treatment during the COVID pandemic. It was observed that the frequency of pain crises experienced by SCD patients was proportional to the patients quality of life (the higher the frequency of pains, the worse the QoL). As a follow-up, a more detailed study would be required, as this study was limited in the capturing of the demographics, sex and number of participants; Considering the number of persons living with SCD that visit the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria, (approx. 3,000 patients), the number of responses in this study was low (105). It is believed that a higher number of responses would have given more information about the Sickle Cell burden and the QoL of persons living with SCD in Lagos during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lagos was the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.","Akinsete, A.; Ottun, M.; Hameed, A.; Veeneman, J.; Ajuwon, L.",,341,19

As the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for cancer patients, we aimed to evaluate the unique experience for women on maintenance PARP inhibitors. Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life (QOL). QOL was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. The chi-square and ANOVA test were used with a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparison testing. Six hundred and three women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30 and April 13, 2020 and 525 (87%) completed the survey and provided information on current treatment status. Sixty-four women (12%) were on PARPm, 153 (29%) on other anti-cancer therapy and 308 (59%) on no treatment. Other anticancer therapies included intravenous chemotherapy (61, 40%), anti-angiogenic (29, 19%), hormonal (25, 16%), oral chemotherapy (12, 8%), immunotherapy (10, 6.5%) and other (16, 10%). There were no differences among women on PARPm, no treatment or other treatment for disease stage, medical comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms or treatment delays. Women on PARPm were more likely to be self-described as immunocompromised versus women not on treatment (79% vs. 34%, P<0.001) and women on hormonal therapy (79% vs. 40%, P=0.002) and similar to women on oral -anti-cancer therapy (78% vs. 58%, P=0.336). Women on PARPm were more likely to use telemedicine versus women not on treatment (44% vs. 16%, P<0.001) and had similar use of telemedicine compared to all other treatment groups. For women on PARPm, higher cancer worry scores were associated with increased use of telemedicine (used telemedicine - 14.4 vs. did not use telemedicine - 13.3, P=0.007). There were no significant differences in reported cancer worry, anxiety or depression between women on PARPm, other anti-cancer therapy and no treatment. [Display omitted] The COVID-19 crisis is impacting cancer care and it is critical that providers consider and address the unique stressors facing women with ovarian cancer during this challenging time. Women on PARPm, in particular, perceive themselves as immunocompromised, perhaps making them more open to alternative means of care delivery, as demonstrated by their willingness to adopt telemedicine. Women with ovarian cancer on PARPm report similar cancer worry, anxiety and depression to women not on treatment and those on other anti-cancer treatment.

We examined the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric endocrinology practice and the challenges faced in pediatric diabetes care. Methods: A 27-item electronic survey was designed, pilot-tested, and deployed to pediatric endocrinology providers using the e-mail discussion lists of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Section on Endocrinology, and the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinical Case Mailing List (May and June 2020). The survey had questions regarding changes in practice, telemedicine use, and observed changes in diabetes disease manifestation. Results: 114 unique responses were analyzed, 79.3% were female respondents. Most (95.6%) providers surveyed were practicing in the United States, and 87.7% reported a decline in their patient volume. Telemedicine use was common [97% (95% CI: 92.4% - 99.4%)] and recent [83.3% (95% CI: 75.2% - 89.7%)] with 98% utilizing remote glycemia monitoring tools. Children with diabetes in underserved and remote locations faced significant barriers to telemedicine use such as lack of connectivity (61%), and devices (59%). Negative consequences on health due to the pandemic included, delay in diabetes diagnosis (33.3%), lack of follow-up (22.0%) and higher diabetic ketoacidosis cases (22.0%). Increased anxiety was commonly reported (66%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to decline in patient volumes, with rapid adaptation to telemedicine use. Providers noted negative effects due to the pandemic on diabetes care including mental health. Benefits from telemedicine use were observed with a digital divide in underserved populations.","Chambers, Melissa Sinha Madhumita",Diabetes,341,24

We collected a dataset of 257 SARS-CoV-2 transmission pairs in Japan and jointly estimated the mean generation interval (3.7-5.1 days) and mean incubation period (4.4-5.7 days) as well as measured their dependence (Kendall's tau of 0.4-0.6), taking into consideration demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the pairs. The positive correlation between the two parameters demonstrates that reliance on isolation of symptomatic COVID-19 cases as a focal point of control efforts is insufficient to address the challenges posed by SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Accounting for this dependence within SARS-CoV-2 epidemic models can also improve model estimates.","Linton, N. M.; Akhmetzhanov, A. R.; Nishiura, H.",,341,1

As initially negotiated with students, feedback was learner-centred and involved a formative intervention approach applied iteratively by the teacher educator over the course of one semester. Although such feedback was initially face-to-face, it had to be given exclusively online following the unexpected closure of the university. Analysis of student teachers’ perspectives, which were collected through an online questionnaire completed after their final assessment, reveals both positive and critical aspects regarding the feedback provided by the teacher educator. While reaffirming the significance of feedback as a crucial element for learning in online teacher education contexts, the findings also show that the clarity, affective bonding and multimodal meaning-making involved in face-to-face interaction are particularly challenging when the communication of feedback is digitally mediated. The implications and limitations of such findings are discussed.","Pereira, Íris Susana Pires Fernandes Eva Lopes Flores Maria Assunção",Education Sciences,341,5

Schools pivoted to remote delivery of learning using a variety of online and offline resources. PE is vital in providing motor development opportunities for children and it is essential to ensure that the provision of quality PE experiences is continued, even in the context of a pandemic. It was in this context that the PE at Home lessons were developed.This study examined teachers' and parents’ experiences of using the PE at Home resource and contributes to documenting the PE home-learning experience and can inform how the education system might respond and incorporate remote teaching into the future.A mixed-methods study utilising online surveys with 29 teachers and 173 parents/guardians and online interviews with five teachers, five parents and seven resource developers was undertaken. Quantitative data were descriptively analysed while qualitative data were analysed using a thematic approach (Braun, V., and V. Clarke. 2006. “Using Thematic Analysis in Psychology.” Qualitative Research in Psychology 3 (2): 77–101).The PE at Home lessons had excellent viewership with over 27,000 Facebook and 937 website views. Three themes (i) ensuring the ‘E’ remained in PE;(ii) home-schooling and physical education;(ii) and context and relatability were developed from the data. While some parents demonstrated that their knowledge of PE was that it consisted of physical activity, other parents along with teachers and developers reflected on the educative component of the lessons. The PE at Home lessons provided teachers with a resource to share with parents to support parents home-school during Covid-19 school closures. An Irish resource featuring Irish children and aligned with the Irish curriculum was seen as a strength by both parents and teachers.The PE at Home lessons address the teaching and learning of PE in multiple contexts, particularly in an online environment, and they can be used in multiple ways to promote learning.

Development of effective and safe anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies remains an urgent need. SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells requires specific host proteases including TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin L (Ctsl)1–3, but there has been no reported success in inhibiting host proteases for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in vivo. Here we have developed a lung Ctsl mRNA-targeted, CRISPR/Cas13d-based nanoparticle therapy to curb fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection in a mouse model. We show that this nanotherapy can decrease lung Ctsl expression in normal mice efficiently, specifically, and safely. Importantly, this lung-selective Ctsl-targeted nanotherapy significantly extended the survival of lethally SARS-CoV-2 infected mice by decreasing lung virus burden, reducing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and diminishing the severity of pulmonary interstitial inflammation. Additional in vitro analyses demonstrated that Cas13d-mediated Ctsl knockdown inhibited infection mediated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and more importantly, the authentic SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 Delta variant, regardless of TMPRSS2 expression status. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a lung-selective, Ctsl-targeted nanotherapy against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and likely other emerging coronaviruses, forming a basis for investigation of this approach in clinical trials.","Cui, Zhifen; Zeng, Cong; Huang, Furong; Yuan, Fuwen; Yan, Jingyue; Zhao, Yue; Huang, Jiaoti; Staats, Herman F.; Everitt, Jeffrey I.; Sempowski, Gregory D.; Wang, Hongyan; Dong, Yizhou; Liu, Shan-Lu; Wang, Qianben",bioRxiv,341,1

Human heterozygote-carriers of ASGR1-deletions exhibited ∼34% lower risk of coronary artery disease and ∼10-14% non-HDL-cholesterol reduction. Since PCSK9 is a major degrader of LDLR, the regulation of LDLR and/or PCSK9 by ASGR1 was studied. Thus, we investigated the role of endogenous/overexpressed ASGR1 on LDLR degradation and functionality by Western-blot and immunofluorescence in HepG2 naïve and HepG2-PCSK9-knockout cells. ASGR1, like PCSK9, targets LDLR and both interact with/enhance the degradation of the receptor independently. Such lack of cooperativity between PCSK9 and ASGR1 on LDLR expression was confirmed in livers of wild-type (WT) versus Pcsk9-/- mice. ASGR1-knockdown in HepG2 naïve cells significantly increased total (∼1.2-fold) and cell-surface (∼4-fold) LDLR protein. In HepG2-PCSK9-knockout cells ASGR1-silencing led to ∼2-fold higher levels of LDLR protein and DiI-LDL uptake, associated with ∼9-fold increased cell-surface LDLR. Overexpression of WT-ASGR1/2 reduced primarily the immature non-O-glycosylated LDLR (∼110 kDa), whereas the triple Gln240/Trp244/Glu253 Ala-mutant (loss of carbohydrate-binding) reduced the mature form of the LDLR (∼150 kDa), suggesting that ASGR1 binds the LDLR in sugar-dependent and -independent fashion. Furin sheds ASGR1 at RKMK103↓ into a secreted form, likely resulting in a loss-of-function on LDLR. LDLR is the first example of a liver-receptor ligand of ASGR1. Additionally, we demonstrate that lack of ASGR1 enhances LDLR levels and DiI-LDL incorporation, independently of PCSK9. Overall, silencing of ASGR1 and PCSK9 may lead to higher LDL-uptake by hepatocytes, thereby providing a novel approach to further reduce LDL-cholesterol.","Susan-Resiga, Delia; Girard, Emmanuelle; Essalmani, Rachid; Roubtsova, Anna; Marcinkiewicz, Jadwiga; Derbali, Rabeb M.; Evagelidis, Alexandra; Byun, Jae H.; Lebeau, Paul F.; Austin, Richard C.; Seidah, Nabil G.",bioRxiv,341,25

In the wake of COVID‐19, an opportunity to compare a virtual reality activity for nursing students in the traditional classroom and in an online environment took place.The goal of this study was to examine the effects of incorporating a virtual reality activity into the traditional classroom and in an online environment to enhance nursing education.Fifty nursing students participated in an exploratory descriptive study. Twenty‐five students participated face‐to‐face while in the traditional classroom setting and 25‐students participated in an online environment using a communication platform. Through a virtual reality activity, nursing students successfully created a tour which demonstrated identifying infectious sites in a hospital room setting.Results of the pre‐and post‐test showed students’ positive perceptions and performances in both traditional classroom and online settings. However, the study revealed a statistical difference between the two group perceptions towards the use of the virtual reality tour creator. Nursing students who were in the traditional classroom group found that the use the virtual reality tour creator was easier.Designing a meaningful virtual reality activity has a positive impact of the student learning experience. Students may benefit from a more through orientation to the technology prior to engaging in the activity. A carefully constructed activity can enhance student learning outside of the hospital room.

Of course, the implementation of online learning cannot be separated from the obstacles and threats of decreasing the quality of education, one of which is the threat of learning loss and anxiety. This study aims to see and reduce learning loss and learning anxiety in higher education through the application of Heroe’s math online learning model. This study is a qualitative descriptive study using diagnostic tests, self-development tests, self-rating anxiety scale test, self-assessment questionnaires and interviews as data collection instruments. Data analysis used technical triangulation. The results showed that with the application of Heroe’s math online learning model there were no learning loss symptoms and showed a decrease in students’ anxiety levels.

For service learning classes, generally defined as students learning as they provide service to a community partner, these large scale disruptions create special challenges even when it is possible to move classes online. The COVID-19 pandemic seriously affected the active involvement of community partners, including non-profit organizations, local schools and hospitals, and local governments. Many community organizations struggled to meet increased demand for their assistance while simultaneously cutting personnel due to budget shortfalls. In this paper, we report results from 34 survey respondents who offered service learning classes in undergraduate computer and information science during spring 2020. Despite the turmoil, only three faculty respondents lost their community partner entirely. In response to disruption, nearly half of faculty removed some of the assignments' requirements, while others made the service project optional or removed it completely. Going online negatively affected students' ability to collaborate with each other and interact with community partners, activities that are considered important for reaching learning outcomes for service learning. Nevertheless, about two-thirds of faculty reported that their students completed their service assignments and described conditions that led to or detracted from their success. Based on the findings, the authors present several implications for development of future computer and information science service learning offerings that are resilient during times of crisis. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Barker, L.

Alongside the increased use of such applications to facilitate the process of conducting interviews, the quality interview has taken a hit overall. This is largely because prospective candidates resort to fraud by switching tabs and using their phones during the course of an interview, and so come through with flying colors despite a clear lack of skills. Consequently, deserving candidates with the requisite skill set lose out to impostors who manage to clear the interviews. In this paper, we propose an approach to make interviews straightforward and fair to all candidates. Our Online Interview Platform, a web application built using Node.js and Express.js, offers indispensable features that are prerequisites for an interview. These include a real-time collaborative code editor that uses an operational transformation algorithm which allows users to collaborate in real time, test and run code;a video/audio conferencing feature using Peer JS;a chat box for communication, and a real-time collaborative whiteboard that lets users design or draw diagrams. The features are included in the same tab, thus ensuring that the candidate does not switch tabs. Using this application, candidates will be screened based on their technical knowledge, appropriately assessed, and performance-based hiring decisions made. The proposed approach proved that the malpractices strictly restricted while comparing with existing approaches.","Kathiravan, M.; Madhurani, M.; Kalyan, Sathya Raj Rahul Jayan Siddharth",Materials Today: Proceedings,341,13

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the social orientation of universities as intellectual leaders in the development of society gains particular importance. The research purpose is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the university activity directions in the framework of strategies (USR). An empirical assessment of the level and complementary factors of USR in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) was conducted, using the method of integral and expert assessment. Grounded on scoring according to the principal component analysis, the structure of the factors of the USR development in the BRICS countries was determined. Multifactor regression modeling allowed substantiating the priority of factors stimulating the development of USR in the BRICS countries in modern conditions and arguing the main barriers to introducing the concept of social responsibility into university activities and expanding the stakeholders’ circle in it. The research results showed that the university management creativity, effective communication with the public and stakeholders, the quality of the educational process and the development of scientific activities stimulate USR development in the BRICS countries and should be used as the basis for the strategic planning of activities in the context of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.

However, it is unclear whether risk is accumulated through long-term exposure or whether there are sensitive/critical periods. A key barrier to clarifying this relationship is the dearth of historical air pollution data. Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of modelling historical air pollution data and using them in epidemiological models. Methods: Using the EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model, we modelled historical fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations for the years 1935, 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990 and combined these with contemporary modelled data from 2001 to estimate life course exposure in 572 participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 with lifetime residential history recorded. Linear regression and latent growth models were constructed using cognitive ability (IQ) measured by the Moray House Test at the ages of 11, 70, 76, and 79 years to explore the effects of historical air pollution exposure. Covariates included sex, IQ at age 11 years, social class, and smoking. Results: Higher air pollution modelled for 1935 (when participants would have been in utero) was associated with worse change in IQ from age 11-70 years (Beta=-0.006, SE=0.002, P=0.03) but not cognitive trajectories from age 70-79 years (P>0.05). There was no support for other critical/sensitive periods of exposure or an accumulation of risk (all P>0.05). Conclusions: The life course paradigm is essential in understanding cognitive decline and this is the first study to examine life course air pollution exposure in relation to cognitive health.","Russ, T.

However, informal groups and associations tried to keep them alive with the help of digital communication technologies, used to enhance conviviality and to support and organize forms of mutual help. This article aims to analyse how Social Streets promoted sociality and mutual help among neighbours in time of lockdown, and how Streeters, here defined as people who are at least inscribed at the Facebook group of their Social Street, have profited from the possibility to have at their disposal an online social place where to interact and be informed about the possibility of giving and receiving help. This article draws from data gathered through two online surveys, administered, respectively, during lockdown phase in the second half of April (838 respondents) and in June 2020, after its end (371 respondents). Our results show that, after seven years since their foundation in 2013, Social Streets still play a pivotal role in the neighbourhood. During lockdown, they gave a contribution in keeping neighbours informed about what was going on in the neighbourhood, in sustaining and producing convivial ties, in organizing mutual help services. In the hard time of lockdown, when most of the usual habits and practices were forcefully suspended, Social Streets proved very important in setting a cognitive, emotional, and organizational framework inside which conviviality and collaboration among neighbours could find greater plausibility.","Introini, F.; Morelli, N.; Pasqualini, C.",Partecipazione E Conflitto,341,33

Standard of care (SOC) for LA-HNSCC pts had to be adapted as operating rooms were temporarily unavailable, and to reduce risk of COVID19 exposure. The IMPACCT study evaluated the outcome of LA-HNSCC pts treated at the Catalan Institute of Oncology during the first semester of 2020 and compared it to a control cohort previously treated in the same institution. Methods: Retrospective single institution analysis of two consecutively-treated cohorts of newly-diagnosed HNSCC pts: from January to June of 2020 (CT20) and same period of 2018 and 2019 (CT18-19). Pt demographics and disease characteristics were obtained from our in-site prospective database. Ttm modifications from SOC as per COVID19- contingency protocol in CT20 for LA-HNSCC were collected. Chi-squared was used to compare variables and ttm response between cohorts. One-year recurrence-free survival (1yRFS) and overall survival (1yOS) of LA-HNSCC pts were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by Log-rank test. Results: A total of 306 pts were included: CT20=99;CT18- 19=207. Baseline characteristics were balanced between cohorts (Table1). In pts treated with conservative ttm (non-surgical approach), persistence disease was higher in CT20 vs CT18- 19 (26 vs. 10% p=0.02). Median follow-up of CT20 and CT18-19 was 6.8 months (IQR 5.1-7.9) and 12.3 (6.7-18.4), respectively. A trend towards lower 1yRFS and 1yOS was observed in CT20 vs CT18-19 (72 vs 83% p=0.06;80 vs 84% p=0.07), respectively. Within CT20, 37 pts (37%) had one or more ttm modifications: switch from surgery to conservative ttm (n=13);altered radiotherapy fractionation (n=14);reduced cisplatin cumulative dose to 200mg/m2 (n=19);no adjuvant ttm (n=1). Pts who received modified ttm had no differences in 1yRFS vs those who did not (80 vs 66% p=0.31), but higher 1yOS was observed (97 vs 67% p&lt;0.01). When stratified by stage, 1yOS difference remained significant in stage III/IVA (100 vs 61% p&lt;0.01) but not in I/II (100 vs 77% p=0.28) or IVB (67 vs 50% p=0.54). Conclusions: COVID19 pandemic had a negative impact on ttm outcomes and survival in LA-HNSCC pts when compared to our historical cohort. Ttm modifications based on COVID19-contingency protocol did not compromise ttm efficacy in terms of RFS and was associated with better OS in Stage III/IVA.","Sentis, P. G.; Manzano, C.

Real world data specific to BC is needed to counsel patients (pts) with BC on their risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: In this retrospective study, we abstracted clinical data including demographics, tumor histology, cancer treatment, and COVID-19 testing results status from the electronic medical record of 3778 BC patients who received cancer care from 02/01/2020 - 05/01/2020 in New York City at our cancer center. The primary endpoint of the study was incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection by treatment type (cytotoxic chemotherapy (CT) vs non-cytotoxic therapies (endocrine and/or HER2 directed therapy (E/H)) diagnosed by either serology, RT-PCR, or documented clinical diagnosis. Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and Mann-Whitney Test were used to assess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by treatment and assess outcomes based on oncologic and non-oncologic risk factors respectively. Results: 3062 patients met inclusion criteria with 379 pts in CT, 2343 pts in E/H and 340 in NT groups. During study period 641 patients (20.9%) were tested by either PCR or serology with 64 patients (2.1%) diagnosed with COVID-19. All pts who tested positive by PCR and subsequently had serology testing were positive for IgG. The weighted risk of SARS-COV-2 infection was 3.5% in CT vs. 2.7% in E/H (p=0.523). 27 patients (0.9%) expired over follow up, with 10 deaths attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The weighted risk for death was 0.7% with CT vs. 0.1% with E/H, p=0.24 (Table A). Age, BMI,CCI and advanced cancer stage were associated with increased mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table). Conclusions: CT was not associated with increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection or death following infection.

The study showed that Ukraine and Moldova are gaining huge rates of development in the internet trade sector, which is further intensified in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of lockdown. In this regard, the issue of compliance with consumer rights on the Internet is extremely relevant today. When studying the issue of consumer protection upon purchasing goods on the Internet, the author used a formal and logical method to determine the content of the main concepts, systematise the material, and obtain generalising conclusions within the framework of the subject matter. The comparative legal method helped identify trends and compare the legislation of Ukraine and the legislation of the Republic of Moldova in the context of consumer protection when purchasing goods on the Internet. According to the findings of the study, the legislative framework in the area of protecting the rights of consumers who purchase goods via the internet should be one of the priority areas of the world’s states.

The joint return distribution of the global financial system can be characterized using a directed acyclic graph approach. However, since assets tend to be highly correlated during market turbulence, when adopting a nodewise penalized regression approach for neighborhood estimation, parameter estimates will receive large standard errors, and edges cannot be reliably estimated. In this work, we propose a two-stage approach for directed acyclic graph skeleton estimation for highly correlated variables. In the first stage, a variable screening ensemble is incorporated into the sparse partial least squares regression method to both reduce the size of the active variables set and impose an adaptive penalization on the weight vectors. In the second stage, a modified PC algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is applied to remove the false positive edges. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we apply our method to analyze the asset risk spillover channels for international financial assets during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Xiaokang Wang Huiwen Wang Zhichao Lu Shan Fan Ying",Information Sciences,341,16

To investigate the underlying basis for this vulnerability, we performed multimodal data analyses on immunity, inflammation, and COVID-19 incidence and severity as a function of age. Our analysis leveraged age-specific COVID-19 mortality and laboratory testing from a large COVID-19 registry, along with epidemiological data of ~3.4 million individuals, large-scale deep immune cell profiling data, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from aged COVID-19 patients across diverse populations. We found that decreased lymphocyte count and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio) are significantly associated with age-specific COVID-19 severities. We identified the reduced abundance of naive CD8 T cells with decreased expression of antiviral defense genes (i.e., IFITM3 and TRIM22) in aged severe COVID-19 patients. Older individuals with severe COVID-19 displayed type I & II interferons deficiencies, which is correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Elevated expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and reduced expression of antiviral defense genes (LY6E and IFNAR1) in the secretory cells are associated with critical COVID-19 in aged individuals. Mechanistically, we identified strong TGF-beta mediated immune-epithelial cell interactions (i.e., secretory-T regulatory cells) in aged individuals with critical COVID-19. Taken together, our findings point to immuno-inflammatory factors that could be targeted therapeutically to reduce morbidity and mortality in aged COVID-19 patients.","Hou, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Gack, M.

Methods: Fifty-two handball coaches participated in this study (Mage=37.4 years; SDage=8.4), who coach U-8 to adult teams, and answered an online survey divided into two main sections: a) coaches' actions with athletes and/or teams throughout social isolation; b) professional learning during social isolation. Descriptive statistics were used for quantitative data analysis and Thematic Analysis for qualitative data analysis. Results: The coaches mentioned that the contact with the teams has been made mostly with WhatsApp (94.2%) and Google Meet or Zoom (75.0%), in which coaches mainly emphasize physical fitness (69.2%) and tactical knowledge (67.3%). For professional learning, coaches are participating in online lectures (96.2%), and virtual meetings (92.3%). Coaches also seek content mainly related to teaching approaches (82.7%), and specific handball exercises (75.0%). Regarding expectations after the social isolation, coaches reported concern about uncertainties for sports practice (restriction of physical contact, decreased incentives for teams, and competitions) and possible psychological benefits (motivation to practice, overcoming difficulties, and learning new resources). Conclusion: The coaches revealed the concern about maintaining the athletes' performance during the social isolation, the uncertainties for the future of the teams, and the difficulties to use different resources for training. We suggested that the courses for coaches emphasize aspects that enable the learning of new technologies (e.g. social networks, video edition, and research platforms).","Musa, Vinicius da Silva; Santos, Walmir Romário dos; Menezes, Rodolfo Pombo; Costa, Valter; Aquino, Rodrigo; Menezes, Rafael Pombo",Motriz (Online),341,16

Although there are compelling reasons why providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids may affect COVID-19-related outcomes, evidence is lacking. The objective of this scoping review is to explore and describe the literature examining the effect of providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids (glutamine, arginine) in adults with conditions or infections similar to COVID-19 infection on COVID-19-related health outcomes. A literature search of the MEDLINE database and hand search of Cochrane Database of systematic reviews retrieved 1,423 unique studies, and 8 studies were included in this scoping review. Four studies examined a target population with ventilator-related pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the other 4 studies included patients who were at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Interventions included intravenous ascorbic acid, intramuscular cholecalciferol, enteral and intramuscular vitamin E, enteral zinc sulfate, and oral and parenteral glutamine. In 6 of the 8 included studies, baseline status of the nutrient of interest was not reported and, thus, it is uncertain how outcomes may vary in the context of nutrient deficiency or insufficiency compared with sufficiency.

A previous study showed that despite a plausible role for high-flow humidified nasal oxygen (HFNO) in this context, only 60% of participants achieved this target after t hree minutes of HFNO.1 This was vastly lower than reported rates with face mask (FM) oxygen. We conducted a randomised controlled crossover trial to determine if HFNO is non-inferior to FM oxygen for increasing etO2 concentration after simulated preoxygenation of women in late pregnancy (gestational age [Formula presented]6 weeks). Methods: After ethics approval, trial registration and consent, 70 women underwent simulated preoxygenation protocols with HFNO and FM oxygen sequentially. They were randomised to receive HFNO first then FM oxygen or vice versa. Baseline variables were measured before each protocol including etO2 concentration to ensure adequate oxygen washout between protocols. Protocols were three minutes long and conducted with the women in a ramped position and left lateral tilt. HFNO was delivered at highest tolerable flow rate with a maximum of 70 L/min and FM oxygen was delivered at 10 L/min. The primary outcome was first etO2 concentration after each protocol with a chosen non-inferiority margin of 5%. Recruitment occurred prior to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Results: 70 women were randomised. 62 women completed the study protocols without complications. Eight women were excluded due to technical faults or incomplete protocols. Participant characteristics were age (mean ± SD, 34.7 ± 4.6 years) and body mass index (BMI) (median (IQR), 28.5 (26.6–32.4 kg/m2). First etO2 concentration after HFNO protocol was non-inferior to first etO2 concentration after FM oxygen protocol (mean difference, 1.45;95% CI, 0.19–2.72;two-tailed [Formula presented]value, 0.025). 71% of participants achieved first etO2 concentration of [Formula presented]0% after the HFNO protocol versus 43.5% after the FM protocol. There was no evidence of correlation between first etO2 concentration after either modality and BMI or gestation. First etO2 concentration after HFNO was weakly correlated to percentage of time of mouth closure (Pearson’s coefficient, 0.287). First etO2 concentration after FM oxygen was moderately correlated to respiratory rate in the final protocol minute and minute ventilation (Pearson’s coefficient, 0.426 and 0.339 respectively). Discussion: HFNO was non-inferior to FM oxygen for increasing etO2 concentration after simulated preoxygenation of women in late pregnancy. These results suggest that HFNO may be a suitable alternative to FM oxygen for preoxygenation of pregnant women prior to general anaesthesia.

Older adults’ SI maps showed similar amplitude and size to younger adults’ maps, but presented with less representational similarity between distant fingers. Larger population receptive field sizes in older adults’ maps did not correlate with behavior, whereas reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 related to worse finger individuation but better motor performance.

Approximately 61% were not offered ST3 posts (n = 326), a similar proportion to that previously reported. We asked all respondents what their potential career plans were for the next 12 to 24 months. The majority expressed intentions to take up either CT3 top-up posts or non-training fellow posts from August 2021 (79%). Other options considered by respondents included: pursuing work abroad (17%), embarking on a career break (16%), taking up an ST3 post in intensive care medicine instead of anaesthetics (15%) and permanently leaving the medical profession (9%). A number of respondents expressed a desire to pursue training in a different medical specialty (9%). Some respondents expressed an intention to pursue further education or research (10%).

SARS-CoV-2 and its variants have particularly exerted tremendous pressure on global healthcare system owing to their life threatening and debilitating implications. The sheer plurality of the variants and huge scale of genome sequence data available for Covid19 have added to the challenges of traceability of mutations of concern. The latter however provides an opportunity to utilize SARS-CoV-2 genomes and the mutations therein as ‘big data records’ to comprehensively classify the variants through the (machine) learning of mutation patterns. The unprecedented sequencing effort and tracing of disease outcomes provide an excellent ground for identifying important mutations by developing machine learnt models or severity classifiers using mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2. This is expected to provide a significant impetus to the efforts towards not only identifying the mutations of concern but also exploring the potential of mutation driven predictive prognosis of SARS-CoV-2. Results We describe how a graduated approach of building various severity specific machine learning classifiers, using only the mutation corpus of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, can potentially lead to the identification of important mutations and guide potential prognosis of infection. We demonstrate the applicability of model derived important mutations and use of Shapley values in order to identify the significant mutations of concern as well as for developing sparse models of outcome classification. A total of 77,284 outcome traced SARS-CoV-2 genomes were employed in this study which represented a total corpus of 30346 unique nucleotide mutations and 18647 amino acid mutations. Machine learning models pertaining to graduated classifiers of target outcomes namely ‘Asymptomatic, Mild, Symptomatic/Moderate, Severe and Fatal’ were built considering the TRIPOD guidelines for predictive prognosis. Shapley values for model linked important mutations were employed to select significant mutations leading to identification of less than 20 outcome driving mutations from each classifier. We additionally describe the significance of adopting a ‘temporal modeling approach’ to benchmark the predictive prognosis linked with continuously evolving pathogens. A chronologically distinct sampling is important in evaluating the performance of models trained on ‘past data’ in accurately classifying prognosis linked with genomes of future (observed with new mutations). We conclude that while machine learning approach can play a vital role in identifying relevant mutations, caution should be exercised in using the mutation signatures for predictive prognosis in cases where new mutations have accumulated along with the previously observed mutations of concern.

The diffusive epidemic process describes the epidemic spreading in a non-sedentary population, and it is a reaction-diffusion process. In the diffusion stage, the individuals can jump between connected nodes, according to different diffusive rates for the infected and susceptible individuals. In the reaction stage, the contagion can happen if there is an infected individual sharing the same node, and infected individuals can spontaneously recover. Our main modification is to turn the number of individuals' interactions independent on the population size by using Gillespie algorithm with a reaction time $t_\mathrm{max}$, exponentially distributed with mean inversely proportional to the node concentration. Our simulation results of the modified model on Barabasi-Albert networks are compatible with a continuous phase transition with a finite threshold from an absorbing phase to an active phase when increasing the concentration. The transition obeys the mean-field critical exponents of the order parameter, its fluctuations and the spatial correlation length, whose values are $\beta=1$, $\gamma'=0$ and $\nu_\perp=1/2$, respectively. In addition, the system presents logarithmic corrections with pseudo-exponents $\widehat{\beta}=\widehat{\gamma}'=-3/2$ on the order parameter and its fluctuations, respectively. The most evident implication of our simulation results is if the individuals avoid social interactions in order to not spread a disease, this leads the system to have a finite threshold in scale-free graphs, allowing for epidemic control.","Alves, Tayroni F.

Of these isolates, 736 (14%) were resistant to tebuconazole: the third most-sprayed triazole fungicide in the UK, which confers cross-resistance to the medical triazoles used to treat A. fumigatus lung infections in humans. These isolates were found to contain the common resistance mechanisms in the A. fumigatus cyp51A gene TR34/L98H or TR46/Y121F/T289A, and less common resistance mechanisms TR34, TR53, TR46/Y121F/T289A/S363P/I364V/G448S and (TR46)2/Y121F/M172I/T289A/G448S. Regression analyses found that soil samples containing compost were significantly more likely to grow susceptible and tebuconazole-resistant A. fumigatus than those that did not, and that compost samples grew significantly higher numbers of A. fumigatus than other samples. Importance These findings highlight compost as a potential health hazard to individuals with pre-disposing factors to A. fumigatus lung infections, and a potential health hazard to immunocompetent individuals who could be exposed to sufficiently high numbers of spores to develop infection. This raises the question of whether compost bags should carry additional health warnings regarding inhalation of A. fumigatus spores, whether individuals should be advised to wear facemasks whilst handling compost or whether commercial producers should be responsible for sterilising compost before shipping. The findings support increasing public awareness of the hazard posed by compost and investigating measures that can be taken to reduce the exposure risk.","Shelton, Jennifer M.

After performing a dialectical analysis on mass media discourses about the pandemic, we argue that sustainability must be understood in relation to tensions such as (a) health and economy, (b) isolation and interconnectedness of health management, and (c) access to and excess of information about the pandemic. Based on this analysis, we suggest that if health is to be considered a fourth pillar of sustainability, it needs to be approached in close connection with these inseparable and irreducible tensions in order to broaden the way in which it has been approached in global sustainable development agendas and to recognize the role of individuals and communities in health issues.","Angel, Adriana Marroquin-Velasquez Lissette Idrovo Sandra",Sustainability,341,1

The media hype index, fake news index, country sentiment index, infodemic index, and media coverage index provided by the RavenPack data platform are used for the analysis. In this research, 2,996 observations from 80 countries, consisting of daily data from January 22, 2020, to April 17, 2020, were used. The results show that the impact of Covid-19-related news on market returns varies among the quantiles of the stock market;in other words, there is an asymmetric dependency between the news and financial markets. With the increase in coverage about the pandemic in the media, the negative impact on market returns exhibits a decreasing trend from low quantiles to high quantiles. More intense use of effective communication channels is required to alleviate the financial crash caused by Covid-19. To capture the effect of the news on financial markets, this analysis also categorized countries according to the Morgan Stanley Classification Index (MSCI, n.d.), such as by developed, emerging, standalone, and frontier markets and by geographical location, including Europe, Africa, North and South America, Asia, and the Middle East.

We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics in breakthrough infections. Methods We conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared the clinical features, virological and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Results Of 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection, 84 had received a mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 were unvaccinated and 4 received a non-mRNA. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine breakthrough group, the odds of severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation was significantly lower following vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95%CI: 0.015-0.335, p=0.001). PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were similar between both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in vaccinated patients, however, these titers were significantly lower against B.1.617.2 as compared with the wildtype vaccine strain. Conclusion The mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection. Vaccination is associated with faster decline in viral RNA load and a robust serological response. Vaccination remains a key strategy for control of COVID-19 pandemic.","Chia, P.

Although disease is often very dynamic, classical theory examines the long-term outcome of evolution at equilibrium and, in simple models, typically predicts that R0 is maximized. For example, immune escape may lead to complex disease dynamics including repeated epidemics, fluctuating selection and diversification. Here we model the impact of antigenic drift and escape on the evolution of virulence and show analytically that these non-equilibrium dynamics select for more acute pathogens with higher virulence. Specifically, under antigenic drift and when partial cross immunity leads to antigenic escape, our analysis predicts the long-term maximization of the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite resulting in more acute and virulent pathogens than those predicted by classic R0 maximization. Furthermore, it follows that these pathogens will have a lower R0 leading to implications for epidemic, endemic behavior and control. Our analysis predicts both the timings and outcomes of antigenic shifts leading to repeated epidemics and predicts the increase in variation in both antigenicity and virulence before antigenic escape. There is considerable variation in the degree of antigenic escape that occurs across pathogens and our results may help to explain the difference in virulence between related pathogens most clearly seen in the human A, B and C influenzas. More generally our results show the importance of examining the evolutionary consequences of non-equilibrium dynamics.","Sasaki, Akira; Lion, Sébastien; Boots, Mike",bioRxiv,341,23

It begins with the proposition that recent historical events of global significance such as the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic of 2020, and the extreme weather events of 2021, were widely predicted and foreseen in the media by way of political reporting as much as popular social and natural science reporting in the years and decades prior. The same tropes were also present in the plotlines of popular literature, television, and film during that period. The central argument of the paper is that before media pundits and policy-makers expressed their surprise at the fragility of the Rule of Law in the “unprecedented” ascent of Trump, the lethal capacity and transmissibility of a “novel” coronavirus, and the “sudden” arrival of climate change in the daily lives of North Americans and Europeans, the spectre of these menaces had already penetrated our collective conscious in a way that ought to have changed outcomes. Neil Postman’s conceptualization of the present epoch as “Technopoly” is a means of explaining how, despite ample warnings, we were not ready for much. Technopoly refers to the historical present as the historical moment in which the technocratic capacity of individuals, states, and markets to respond to existential problems is hindered by information overload, e.g., the threat to the Rule of Law presented by an outgoing American President who refuses to accept the verdict of the electorate;the threat to public health posed by persistent vaccine misinformation and inequitable global vaccine distribution;and, the threat posed to our collective habitat by extreme climate events. The paper concludes that fiction is a powerful potential antidote to the numbing effects of information overload in Technopoly if it is treated seriously as a source of normative authority rather than dismissed as pure diversion.","Meyers, Jeffrey Benjamin",Laws,341,16

Patients undergoing elective resection of an intra-abdominal cancer with curative intent across five surgical oncology disciplines were included in analysis. The primary outcome measure was the mortality within 30 days of surgery Result: This study included 7402 patients from 50 countries;3031 (40.9%) were operated pre-pandemic and 4371 (59.1%) during the pandemic 5.1% (n=224/4371) of patients during the pandemic developed a postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite selection of lower risk cases during the pandemic, the rates of pulmonary complications pre were similar (6.3% vs 6.9%, P=0.280). However, the risk of death after surgery was higher during the pandemic (2.0% vs 0.7%, P<0.001). The population attributable fraction of deaths due to pulmonary complications was 37.7% (95% CI: 15.2-64.7%) pre-pandemic and 66.0% (95% CI: 48.6-79.3%) during the pandemic.

The implementation of eMH has been slow and varies considerably between EU countries, even though this technology has been on the market for over 20 years. The reasons for this are related to quality problems (e.g. validation, usability), resistance from clinicians, lack of blended care treatment protocols, digital skills, reimbursement systems and policies and other barriers.

However, it is difficult to determine the tongue CKC because an accelerometer yields excessive magnetic artifacts. We introduce and validate a novel approach for measuring the tongue CKC using a deep learning-assisted motion capture system with videography, and compare it with an accelerometer in a control task measuring finger movement. Twelve healthy volunteers performed rhythmical side-to-side tongue movements in the whole-head magnetoencephalographic system, which were simultaneously recorded using a video camera and examined offline using a deep learning-assisted motion capture system. In the control task, right finger CKC measurements were simultaneously evaluated via motion capture and an accelerometer. The right finger CKC with motion capture was significant at the movement frequency peaks or its harmonics over the contralateral hemisphere; the motion-captured CKC was 84.9% similar to that with the accelerometer. The tongue CKC was significant at the movement frequency peaks or its harmonics over both hemispheres, with no difference between the left and right hemispheres. The CKC sources of the tongue were considerably lateral and inferior to those of the finger. Thus, the CKC based on deep learning-assisted motion capture can evaluate the functional localization of the tongue SM1. In this approach, because no devices are placed on the tongue, magnetic noise, disturbances due to tongue movements, risk of aspiration of the device, and risk of infection to the experimenter are eliminated.","Maezawa, Hitoshi; Fujimoto, Momoka; Hata, Yutaka; Matsuhashi, Masao; Hashimoto, Hiroaki; Kashioka, Hideki; Yanagida, Toshio; Hirata, Masayuki",bioRxiv,341,26

The cDNA of the Spike protein harbors over a hundred predicted splice sites and produces mostly aberrant mRNA transcripts when expressed in the nucleus. While different codon optimization strategies increase the proportion of full-length mRNA, they do not directly address the underlying splicing issue with commonly detected cryptic splicing events hindering the full expression potential. Similar splicing characteristics were also observed in other transgenes. By inserting multiple short introns throughout different transgenes, significant improvement in expression was achieved, including >7-fold increase for Spike transgene.

As many of these recent advances likely stalled with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I discuss various policy options.","Ziliak, James P.",Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,341,1

There was an aggregate trend toward increased wellbeing, with considerable variation within and across participants. Teens reported greater reliance on networked technologies as their unstructured time increased during lockdown. Using multilevel growth modeling, we found that how much total time teens spent with technology had less bearing on daily fluctuations in wellbeing than the satisfaction and meaning they derived from their technology use. Ultimately, teens felt online communication could not replace face-to-face interactions. We conducted two follow-up participatory design sessions with nine teens to explore these insights in greater depth and reflect on general implications for design to support teens' meaningful technology experiences and wellbeing during disruptive life events.","Pitt, Caroline; Hock, Ari; Zelnick, Leila; School, Katie Davis The Information; Washington, University of; Education, College of; Medicine, Department of",,341,1

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases and it includes disabling complications and chronic and invisible progression. On the one hand, this disease imposes high financial expenses on the patient and, on the other hand, reduces the quality of life. Presently, the COVID-19 epidemic has been an international concern, and evidence implies that people who have the underlying disease are at higher risk for the virus and will experience serious problems if they develop the disease. Methods. This research is a qualitative study with a kind of phenomenological investigation that has been conducted to investigate the patient's experiences and personal feelings with diabetes in terms of the effects of corona disease on their quality of life. In this study, the semi-structured interview method was utilized to collect information. The number of sample included 15 patients referred to health centers, and each interview was recorded with the patient's consent and was written on paper and analyzed. Results. The data of this study were classified into 6 main themes and 19 sub-themes after analysis. The main themes of the information obtained from this study included knowledge and awareness, psychological effects, entertainment, and recreational programs, patient's family, medical care, and communication with patients placing the greatest emphasis on medical care. Stress caused by corona disease and depression were the most important psychological effects expressed by diabetic patients. They also expressed some serious medical care problems, including the reduction of referrals to health centers for follow-up and care and the shortage of physicians and health personnel to provide services. Conclusion. This study suggests that diabetic patients experience many different problems due to corona disease. These problems influence the diabetic patients' quality of life, so we need to understand better and solve the diabetic patients' problems, make more effort, and perform more suitable planning to improve their health and quality of life.","Alimehr, M.; Malayen, S.; Vafa, F.

Based on the number of passengers who flew from China to these five countries during December 31, 2019 to January 22, 2020 and China's reported case rate, it is calculated that the expected COVID-19 exportation rate would be less than one case in all five countries combined. However, since all five countries had reported COVID-19 cases by January 22, 2020, it is estimated that the actual case rate in China would need to be approximately 37 times higher than reported (18,700 cases versus 503 cases reported on January 22, 2020) to reach the odds of a COVID-19 case appearing in each country.","Mouton, Christopher A.; Hanson, Russell Grissom Adam R.; Godges, John P.; Corporation, Rand",,341,1

An antisense gene in HIV-1 (Hap) induces apoptosis in human cells. Apoptotic T cell death following HIV-1 infection leads to a compromised immune system and eventually AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). A review of several studies that focused on long-term survivors of HIV-1 reveals that these survivors had deletion-mutations in Hap. A subset of these survivors changed course and experienced CD4+ T cell death and progression to AIDS. These individuals had virus that regained Hap gene sequence that had previously been deleted. Analysis of the changes in the genetic sequences with in vivo progression of the revertant HIV-1 virus allowed identification of a specific region in Hap we are calling MORT. MORT, in Hap RNA forms a primary microRNA-like structure. Potential human mRNAs targeted by MORT mi/siRNAs include gene/RNA sequences of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), survivin, and apollon, along with many other human gene sites/RNAs. Thus MORT may be acting as an RNA antagonist to cellular IAPs thereby inducing apoptotic cell death. Surprisingly, additional potential MORT targets include viral sites in human SARS-CoV-2, including the protease, nsp5 RNA. Future uses for RNA therapy and a hypothesis for an HIV intrinsic mechanism utilizing MORT for viral anti-viral (or anti-microbial) and HIV anti-immune cell defense are proposed.","Ludwig, Linda B.; Albert, Michael S.",bioRxiv,341,1

This article focuses on a subset of multiphase flows called particle-laden suspensions involving non-deforming particles in a carrier fluid. The hydrodynamic interactions in these flows result in rich multiscale physics, such as clustering and pseudo-turbulence, with important practical implications. Theoretical formulations to represent, explain and predict these phenomena encounter peculiar challenges that multiphase flows pose for classical statistical mechanics. A critical analysis of existing approaches leads to the identification of key desirable characteristics that a formulation must possess in order to be successful at representing these physical phenomena. The need to build accurate closure models for unclosed terms that arise in statistical theories has motivated the development of particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR--DNS) for model-free simulation at the microscale. A critical perspective on outstanding questions and potential limitations of PR-DNS for model development is provided. Selected highlights of recent progress using PR-DNS to discover new multiphase flow physics and develop models are reviewed. Alternative theoretical formulations and extensions to current formulations are outlined as promising future research directions. The article concludes with a summary perspective on the importance of integrating theoretical, modeling, computational, and experimental efforts at different scales.

Manning and colleagues' outdoor recreation strategies and practices framework provides parks with up to 24 response options to an issue: four strategies intersecting with six practices. This framework has been limited to common in-park concerns and visitors. We examined how park systems communicate with potential visitors about COVID-19, to advance the framework toward broader concerns and scales. We analyzed the 50 U.S. state park systems' official COVID-19 communications at the traditional start of the peak use season (summer 2020). We qualitatively coded these for reference to the framework's components and mentions of scale. This highlighted that while “limit use” and “reduce impact of use” were the only strategies used, different practices and recognitions of beyond-park and beyond-visit scales were acknowledged (e.g., “please recreate close to home”). We suggest the data reveal a seventh practice in use and for framework inclusion: “influence pre-visit decisions.” The pandemic provided an opportunity for parks to communicate their managerial responses with consistency and creativity, as well as an opportunity for researchers and managers to advance the strategies and practices framework.","Perry, Elizabeth E.; Coleman, Kimberly J.; Iretskaia, Tatiana A.; Baer, Jordan; Magnus, Liesl F.; Pettengill, Peter R.",,341,13

The aim of this paper is to determine which of the two types of fears exist in certain psychological groups, and which of the fears strongly influence the decision to travel. Design/methodology/approach: The VALS 2 method and standardized questionnaire were used for the segmentation of the tourist market or for the determination of the psychographic profiles of the consumers, and three additional questions were joined to it as they were vital for the research of the type of fear and its impact on the decision for traveling. When the reliability of the questionnaire and the validity of the sample were determined, the data were further processed using a computer program package IMB AMOS SPSS 21.00, and then, based on the theoretical suppositions and hypotheses, the SEM structural model was created. Findings: The paper indicates the existence of established types of fears in humans, when it comes to pandemics and similar crisis situations. People are most afraid of infection during travel, and lack of funds and job loss during the critical period of the pandemic. The research conducted confirms that all groups of people, who are determined by the psychological technique VALS 2, react with a certain dose of fear and make decisions under the pressure of fears. Research limitations/implications: The research had limitations in terms of contact with people and conducting live surveys. The measures during the pandemic, which were carried out by the state, included social distance and limited movement of people. Practical implications: The work can contribute to the community, along with similar research. The results of the research will be available, and it will be possible to see the behavior of people during crisis situations, and the impact of fears on making decisions, both travel decisions and decisions related to other areas of life. Originality/value: The paper provides research results on a large sample of respondents, and can serve as a basis for further research in the field of tourism, psychology and similar fields.

The authors demonstrate how the middle-class potential can help achieve the indicators set in the social and economic development strategy of the Vologda Oblast until 2030, as well as implement its main goal, population saving. The authors found out that the middle-class potential includes a lot of useful characteristics to facilitate the successful implementation of the social and economic development of Vologda Oblast until 2030, which makes it one of the key development factors in the territory. Thus, the authors conclude that it is feasible to develop and implement a regional social and economic development strategy based on the middle-class potential. For the convenience of the middle-class characteristics analysis, the authors suggest classifying it according to the areas of life. The analysis of middle-class characteristics showed that they currently do not comply with the desired or optimal level and tend to deteriorate due to the forecast economic downturn in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimization of middle-class parameters can be seen as a priority in the regional social and economic development strategy based on the middle-class potential. Creating a list of actions to transform the middle-class characteristics from their current state to the optimal state will be the final stage of developing the regional strategy based on the improvement of resource potential. This paper also analyzes the components of middle-class potential and, apart from the two existing components, the ‘traditional’ and the ‘new’ middle class, a third component was suggested, i.e., the retirees.

Methods: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age 18 to 98 years) randomised 1:1 using a sponsor-supplied randomisation scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory confirmed symptomatic COVID 19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary outcomes were efficacy in subgroups for age (18 to < 60 years and >=60 years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses for three consecutive manufacturing lots. Findings: Between November 16, 2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198). In a case-driven analysis, 130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in 16,973 (0.77%) participants with follow-up at least two weeks after the second vaccination; 24 occurred in the vaccine group and 106 in placebo recipients giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI: 65.2,86.4). Sixteen cases, one vaccinee and 15 placebo recipients, met the severe symptomatic COVID-19 case definition giving a vaccine efficacy of 93.4% (57.1,99.8). Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID 19 was 63.6% (29.0, 82.4). BBV152 conferred 65.2% (95% CI: 33.1, 83.0) protection against the SARS CoV 2 Variant of Concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta). BBV152 was well tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths were reported. Interpretation: BBV152 was immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID 19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that observed with other COVID-19 vaccines.","Ella, R.; Reddy, S.; Blackwelder, W.; Potdar, V.; Yadav, P.; Sarangi, V.; Aileni, V.

This article presents an integer programming formulation for both type-1 and type-2 ALB problems and metaheuristics to solve this complex problem. Even if ALB gives better results than the current line balance that our industry partner applied, it cannot be guaranteed that the amount of daily production will increase due to randomness in the line.

This problem is traditionally addressed using docking tools, where the quality of the models is based on their similarity to a single reference experimental structure. However, using a static reference does not take into account the dynamic quality of the protein interface. Here, we used all-atom classical Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of the reference interface for three complexes that previously served as targets in the CAPRI competition. For each one of these targets, we also ran MD simulations for ten models that are distributed over the High, Medium and Acceptable accuracy categories. To assess the quality of these models from a dynamic perspective, we set up new criteria which take into account the stability of the reference experimental protein interface. We show that, when the protein interfaces are allowed to evolve along time, the original ranking based on the static CAPRI criteria no longer holds as over 50% of the docking models undergo a category change (which can be either toward a better or a lower accuracy group) when reassessing their quality using dynamic information.","Prévost, Chantal; Sacquin-Mora, Sophie",bioRxiv,341,16

We employ the SERVQUAL measurement model, a universal method with the longest history. In measuring acceptance intention, we use the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), an accurate measurement method for the effect on acceptance intention of introducing new technology. So, this study mainly focuses on SERVQUAL and UTAUT as these tools relate to online education. The research results show that all five sub-factors of the online education service quality have positive correlations with acceptance intention. The higher the empathy with the online education service quality and the higher the performance expectancy and social influence in the UTAUT model, the higher the college students' intention to accept the online education service.

Methods: We analyzed a subset of qualitative interview data from a study across British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. A total of 22 resident family physicians and 38 early-career family physicians in their first 10 years of practice who intend to or currently practice in a focused area were included in our analysis. We compared participant types, provinces, and the degree of focused practice while identifying themes related to factors influencing the pursuit of focused practice. Results: We identified three key themes of factors contributing to choices of focused practice: self-preservation within the current health care system, support from colleagues, and experiences in medical school and/or residency. Minor themes included alignment of practice with skills, personal values, or ability to derive professional satisfaction; personal lived experiences; and having many attractive opportunities for focused practice. Interpretation: Both groups of participants unanimously viewed focused practice as a way to circumvent the burnout or exhaustion they associated with comprehensive practice in the current structure of the health care. This finding, in addition to other influential factors, was consistent across the three provinces. More research is needed to understand the implications of resident and early-career family physician choices of focused practice within the physician workforce.","Kabir, M.; Randall, E.; Mitra, G.; Lavergne, M.

Methods: Patients followed in the “Early Arthritis Clinic” of our hospital were invited to participate to an online survey. They were asked also to invite their best friend (BF), matched for age and sex, to participate the survey, as control group. Moreover, clinical records from the same “Early Arthritis Clinic” cohort were used as pre-pandemic group. The online survey included demographic questions and, for RA patients, the evaluation of perceived pain (P-VAS) and disease activity (DA-VAS) on a scale of 1-10 as well as Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index-5 (RADAI-5), a validated self-reported disease activity measure. Both RA patients and BF responded also to validated, psychometric scales for stress vulnerability (Stress Vulnerability Scale-SVS), resilience (Resilience Scale-RS), depression (Zung's depression questionnaire-Zung-D) and anxiety (Zung's anxiety questionnaire-Zung-A) evaluation. Results: The cohort was composed by 76 RA patients who answered the survey, 32 BF and 170 RA patients from historical cohort. There were no differences in demographic characteristics, SVS, RS, Zung-D and Zung-A between RA patients and BF. RADAI-5 correlated positively with SVS (r=0,29;p=0,01), P-VAS (r=0,8;p<0,0001) and DA-VAS (r=0,8;p<0,0001) and negatively with RS (r=-0,23;p=0,04). Patients with higher disease activity showed higher classes of Zung-D (p=0,03) and SVS (p=0,006), and lower classes of RS(p=0,001). P-VAS was the only significant predictor of RADAI-5 (β=0,83;CI=0,53-0,76;p<0,001), and the concordance between RADAI-5, P-VAS and DA-VAS was high (K=0,94;p<0,001). Compared with the historical cohort, RA patients involved in the survey showed higher frequencies of moderate and elevated disease activity classes (p<0,001;Figure 1) despite there were no differences in P-VAS and DA-VAS. Conclusion: These results suggest that lockdown did not affect differently emotional well-being of RA patients compared to healthy subjects. RA patients with elevated disease activity report higher stress and depressive symptoms, and SVS and RS may be useful to identify patients at higher risk. The higher self-reported disease activity measured through RADAI-5 may be the result of an overestimation of disease severity by patients, which depends mostly from pain. This should be considered in the assessment of disease activity through telemedicine.

In this regard, molecular orbital features and atomic-scale quadrupole coupling constants were evaluated for geometrically optimized structures to see the impact of structural modification on the whole structure. The results indicated that the main impact of such modification was significant only for the modification region, whereas the impact on the rest of the structure was almost negligible. However, electronic features indicated a different tendency for Vanl derivatives for involving in interaction with enzymatic targets. Because of the importance of innovating medication for COVID-19, main protease (MPro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were chosen for the enzymatic target of Vanl ligands for the formation of ligand-target complexes through performing molecular docking (MD) simulations. The results indicated that among the complexes, Vanl 9 (–NHNH2) and 11 (–CH2Cl) could work as the best ligands for interacting with each of RdRp and MPro, respectively. Consequently, optimization of Vanl derivatives could help innovate new compounds for the possible medication of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.","Harismah, K.; Fazeli, F.; Zandi, H.",Biointerface Research in Applied Chemistry,341,1

Despite the computing power of supercomputers, computationally predicting secondary structures with thermodynamic methods is still not feasible when the RNA molecules have long nucleotide sequences and include complex motifs such as pseudoknots. This paper presents RNAVLab (RNA Virtual Laboratory), a virtual laboratory for studying RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots that allows scientists to address this challenge. Two important case studies show the versatility and functionalities of RNAVLab. The first study quantifies its capability to rebuild longer secondary structures from motifs found in systematically sampled nucleotide segments. The extensive sampling and predictions are made feasible in a short turnaround time because of the grid technology used. The second study shows how RNAVLab allows scientists to study the viral RNA genome replication mechanisms used by members of the virus family Nodaviridae.","Taufer, Michela; Leung, Ming-Ying; Solorio, Thamar; Licon, Abel; Mireles, David; Araiza, Roberto; Johnson, Kyle L.",Parallel Computing,341,16

Despite this, bike riding participation in the state of Victoria, Australia, is low. To inform planning and practice, there is a need to understand the proportion of the population (""the near-market"") that are interested in riding a bike, and how this varies across regions. The Geller typology classifies individuals into one of four groups, based on their confidence to ride a bike in various infrastructure types, and frequency of bike riding. The typology has been used at a city, state and country-wide scale, however not at a smaller spatial scale. We aimed to characterise and quantify the distribution of the Geller typology within Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the state of Victoria, Australia. Methods: An online survey was conducted in 37 LGAs in Victoria, including all LGAs in Greater Melbourne, and a selection of six key regional centres. Participants were recruited from an opt-in online research company panel with the objective of recruiting a representative sample of adults across each LGA. The Geller typology classified individuals as either: ""Strong and Fearless"", ""Enthused and Confident"", ""Interested but Concerned"", or ""No Way No How"". ""Interested but Concerned"" participants are those that would ride a bike if protected infrastructure were provided. Results: The survey was completed by 3999 individuals. Most participants owned a bike (58%), however only 20% rode at least once per week. The distribution of the Geller groups was: ""Strong and Fearless"" (3%), ""Enthused and Confident"" (3%), ""Interested but Concerned"" (78%), and ""No Way No How"" (16%). While variation in the distributions of the Geller groups was observed between LGAs within Greater Melbourne., the ""Interested but Concerned"" group, reflecting people who are comfortable riding only in protected lanes or off-road paths, was high across all LGAs and all demographic sub-groups. Even though the frequency of riding a bike was lower in women, interest in riding a bike was high and comparable to men. Participants who resided in the outer urban fringe regions of Greater Melbourne had high interest, but low participation in bike riding. Conclusions: While there was variation in interest in bike riding across an entire metropolitan region and across population groups, interest was high across all areas and demographics. Our results show the potential for substantial increases in cycling participation, but only when high-quality cycling infrastructure is provided. Further research is required to understand the policy and practice barriers to equitable provision of protected infrastructure.","Pearson, L. K.; Dipnall, J.; Gabbe, B.

India has been setting up multiple strategies to contain this pandemic. Active community-level surveillance is a vital strategy to prevent, control, and manage the outbreak of COVID-19. This study explores the perspectives and describes budding doctors' field experience who worked in the community surveillance activity during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: We used a mixed-method research design wherein 67 medical interns of a tertiary care teaching institute participated in the COVID-19 pandemic surveillance activity were included in the study. Their field experience, perspectives, and opinions were captured using pretested questionnaires, participants' interviews, and focused group discussions. Results: More than one-third of medical interns (41.8%) felt that the government could better handle the surveillance process, while around two-thirds (65.6%) were satisfied with their work. Notably, 40 (59%) were not happy/clear with the training and orientation on the job before engaging in surveillance activity. A majority of 47 (70.1%) interns reported inadequate personal protective equipment, which raised the fear of transmission. While they felt that surveillance provided health services close to the community and addressed the public's pandemic concerns, they said the lack of basic training, an inadequate workforce, and resources were detrimental to the response. Conclusions: This pandemic has exposed the naive interns to the community health surveillance process's ground realities. This experience has changed their perception of the profession and given them the impetus to become a future workforce. Strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis of the surveillance process provided vital inputs to act and prepare for future public health emergencies.

Eighteen months (2020 January 1-2021 June 30) COVID-19 publication data of 46 Sub-Saharan African countries was collected from Scopus for analysis. Country of affiliation of the authors and funding agencies data was analyzed to understand country contributions, collaboration pattern and funding sources. USA (23.08%) and the UK (19.63%), the top two external contributors, collaborated with Sub-Saharan African countries about three times more than other countries. Collaborative papers between Sub-Saharan African countries - without contributions from outside the region- made up less than five percent of the sample, whereas over 50% of the papers were written in collaboration with researchers from outside the region. Organizations that are in USA and the UK funded 45% of all the COVID-19 research from Sub-Saharan Africa. 53.44% of all the funding from Sub-Saharan African countries came from South African organizations. This study provides evidence that pan-African COVID-19 research collaboration is low, perhaps due to poor funding and lack of institutional support within Sub-Saharan Africa. This mirrors the collaborative features of science in Sub-Saharan Africa before the COVID-19 pandemic. The high volume of international collaboration during the pandemic is a good development. There is also a strong need to forge more robust pan-African research collaboration networks, through funding from Africa's national and regional government organizations, with the specific objective of meeting local COVID-19 and other healthcare needs.","Asubiaro, T.

Currently, near 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities. Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type C$>$T over T$>$C.","Wang, Rui; Hozumi, Yuta; Zheng, Yong-Hui; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",ArXiv,341,1

Here, we present reconstituted viral envelopes (virosomes) derived from influenza virus as suitable vehicles for in vitro as well as in vivo delivery of siRNAs. Virosomes are vesicles that bear in their membrane the influenza virus spike protein hemagglutinin (HA). This protein mediates binding of native virus to and fusion with cellular target membranes. Accordingly, virosomes with membrane-incorporated HA bind to cells, are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and fuse with the endosomal membrane to release their contents into the cytoplasm. When complexed to cationic lipids, siRNA was successfully encapsulated in virosomes. Virosomes with encapsulated siRNA fused with target membranes in a pH-dependent manner and delivered the encapsulated siRNA to several cell lines in vitro. Virosome-delivered siRNA markedly downregulated the synthesis of newly induced and constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of siRNA-loaded virosomes resulted in delivery of the nucleotides to cells in the peritoneal cavity. Our results indicate that virosomes are a promising delivery device for in vivo application, especially where topical administration of siRNA, for example, to the respiratory tract is envisaged.","de Jonge, J; Holtrop, M; Wilschut, J; Huckriede, A",Gene therapy,341,7

The authors describe their endovascular experience managing ICA injuries after transsphenoidal surgery; they review and summarize the current literature regarding endovascular techniques; and they propose a treatment algorithm based on the available evidence. METHODS A retrospective review of 576 transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resections was performed. Cases of ICA injury occurring at our institution and transfers from other hospitals were evaluated. Endovascular treatments for ICA injury reported in the literature were also reviewed and summarized. RESULTS Seven cases were identified from the institutional cohort (mean age 46.3 years, mean follow-up 43.4 months [1-107 months]) that received endovascular treatment for ICA injury. Five injuries occurred at our institution (5 [0.9%] of 576), and 2 injuries occurred at outside hospitals. Three patients underwent ICA sacrifice by coil placement, 2 underwent lesion embolization (coil or stent-assisted coil placement), and 2 underwent endoluminal reconstruction (both with flow diversion devices). Review of the literature identified 98 cases of ICA injury treated with endovascular methods. Of the 105 total cases, 46 patients underwent ICA sacrifice, 28 underwent lesion embolization, and 31 underwent endoluminal reconstruction. Sacrifice of the ICA proved a durable solution in all cases; however, the rate of persistent neurological complications was relatively high (10 [21.7%] of 46). Lesion embolization was primarily performed by coil embolization without stenting (16 cases) and stent-assisted coiling (9 cases). Both techniques had a relatively high rate of at least some technical complication (6 [37.5%] of 16 and 5 [55.6%] of 9, respectively) and major technical complications (i.e., injury, new neurological deficit, or ICA sacrifice) (5 [31.3%] of 16 and 2 [22.2%] of 9, respectively). Endoluminal reconstruction was performed by covered stent (24 cases) and flow diverter (5 cases) placement. Covered stents showed a reasonably high rate of technical complications (10 [41.7%] of 24); however, 8 of these problems were resolved, leaving a small percentage with major technical complications (2 [8.3%] of 24). Flow diverter placement was also well tolerated, with only 1 minor technical complication. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatments including vessel sacrifice, coil embolization (with or without stent assistance), and endoluminal reconstruction offer a tailored approach to ICA injury management after endonasal surgery. Vessel sacrifice remains the definitive treatment for acute, uncontrolled bleeding; however, vessel preservation techniques should be considered carefully in select patients. Multiple factors including vascular anatomy, injury characteristics, and risk of dual antiplatelet therapy should guide best treatment, but more study is needed (particularly with flow diverters) to refine this decision-making process. Ideally, all endovascular treatment options should be available at institutions performing endonasal surgery.","Sylvester, Peter T; Moran, Christopher J; Derdeyn, Colin P; Cross, DeWitte T; Dacey, Ralph G; Zipfel, Gregory J; Kim, Albert H; Uppaluri, Ravi; Haughey, Bruce H; Tempelhoff, Rene; Rich, Keith M; Schneider, John; Chole, Richard A; Chicoine, Michael R",Journal of neurosurgery,341,9

A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed during the past 30 years to account for the antiviral activity of ribavirin, including the possibility that ribavirin might have a negative effect on the synthesis of the RNA cap structure of viral RNA transcripts. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that ribavirin can directly serve as a substrate for the vaccinia virus RNA capping enzyme. We demonstrate that ribavirin triphosphate can be used as a substrate by the capping enzyme and can form a covalent ribavirin monophosphate-enzyme intermediate reminiscent of the classical GMP-enzyme intermediate. Furthermore, our data indicate that ribavirin monophosphate can be transferred to the diphosphate end of an RNA transcript to form the unusual RpppN structure. Finally, we provide evidence that RNA transcripts that possess ribavirin as the blocking nucleoside are more stable than unblocked transcripts. However, in vitro translation assays indicate that RNA transcripts blocked with ribavirin are not translated efficiently. Our study provides the first biochemical evidences that ribavirin can directly interact with a viral capping enzyme. The ability of a purified RNA capping enzyme to utilize ribavirin as a substrate has not been previously documented and has implications for our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of RNA capping enzymes. The biological implications of these findings for the proposed ribavirin-mediated inhibition of capping are discussed.","Bougie, Isabelle; Bisaillon, Martin",The Journal of biological chemistry,341,16

Improving IHR compliance provides grounds for better health system strengthening, which is key to moving countries closer towards Universal Health Coverage. Multisectoral, collaborative working within and across sectors is fundamental to improving IHR (2005) compliance, and for that, governance is the best lever of the health system. This paper highlights the importance of the relationship between governance and IHR in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which follow the fundamental principle of interdependence; SDGs interlink with one another. We consider governance (SDG 16) and how it influences the IHR capacity of SDG 3 (health and well-being for all at all ages). This paper considers the successes of the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports thus far in improving IHR compliance and highlights that an even greater focus on health system governance would lead to more sustainable outcomes. Nurturing an institutional culture with enforced rules, which are conducive for improved accountability through inclusive participation would further improve Myanmar IHR strengthening efforts.

High immunization coverage is essential for reducing the risk of vaccine preventable diseases. METHODS: We used data from two nationwide sources covering the whole of Brazil. Data from the Information System of the National Immunization Program (SIPNI) on the monthly number of vaccine doses administered to young children were analyzed. The second source was a survey in 133 large cities in the 27 states in the country, carried out from August 24-27. Respondents answered a question on whether children under the age of three years had missed any scheduled vaccinations during the pandemic, and available vaccination cards were photographed for later examination. RESULTS: SIPNI data showed that, relative to January and February 2020, there was a decline of about 20% in vaccines administered to children aged two months or older during March and April, when social distancing was at the highest level in the country. After May, vaccination levels returned to pre-pandemic values. Survey data, based on the interviews and on examination of the vaccine cards, showed that 19.0% (95% CI 17.0;21.1%) and 20.6% (95% CI 19.0;23.1%) of children, respectively, had missed immunizations. Missed doses were most common in the North (Amazon) region and least common in the South and Southeast, and also more common among children from poor than from wealthy families. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that the pandemic was associated with a reduction of about 20% in child vaccinations, but this was reverted in recent months. Children from poor families and from the least developed regions of the country were most affected. There is an urgent need to booster immunization activities in the country to compensate for missed doses, and to reduce geographic and socioeconomic inequalities.","Silveira, Mariangela F; Tonial, Cristian T; Goretti K Maranhão, Ana; Teixeira, Antonia M S; Hallal, Pedro C; Maria B Menezes, Ana; Horta, Bernardo L; Hartwig, Fernando P; Barros, Aluisio J D; Victora, Cesar G",Vaccine,341,6

Despite the growing evidence about the link between the pandemic, its control measures, and mental health worldwide, there is still no regional evidence of the potential mental health impact. We describe the prevalence and distribution of depressive symptoms across demographic and socioeconomic risk factors in the Peruvian population amidst a national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted during the community transmission phase and national lockdown in Peru (May 4th-16th, 2020). We recorded 64,493 responses from adult Peruvian residents through an opt-in online questionnaire. All analyses were weighted using raking based on proportions of sociodemographic variables from the last Peruvian census in 2017. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was calculated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 10 or more. We identified associated demographic and socioeconomic factors by prior mental health diagnosis. Sensitivity analysis considered an alternative cut-off point for depressive symptoms of PHQ-9 &#8805; 14. RESULTS: A total of 57,446 participants were included in the analytical sample. A third of the participants (n = 23,526, unweighted) showed depressive symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the study. Participants who reported a previous mental health diagnosis doubled the sample prevalence of depressive symptoms (59, 95%CI 56.7, 61.4%) of those without a prior diagnosis. Psychosocial and functioning reactions were largely more prevalent among females and young adults. A dose-response relationship was found between household income and depressive symptoms across previous mental health diagnosis strata, being as low as 32% less in the wealthiest than the most impoverished group (PR: 0.68, 95%CI 0.58,0.79). Other critical factors associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms were lower education level, single, unemployed, and chronic comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: An increased burden of depressive symptoms and psychosocial reactions has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru compared to previous years. The mental health burden disproportionately affects women, the younger population, and those with low income and education. As the country eases the social distancing measures, it is crucial to use local evidence to adjust public health policies and mental health services to the renewed population needs.","Antiporta, Daniel A; Cutipé, Yuri L; Mendoza, Maria; Celentano, David D; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Bruni, Andrea",BMC Psychiatry,341,21

It is motivated by the ongoing covid-19 global epidemic, but expands to a broader view on the crises that disrupt food systems and threaten food security, locally to globally. Beyond the public health crisis it is causing, the current global pandemic is impacting food systems, locally and globally. Crises such as the present one can, and do, affect the stability of food production. One of the worst fears is the impacts that crises could have on the potential to produce food, that is, on the primary production of food itself, for example, if material and non-material infrastructure on which agriculture depends were to be damaged, weakened, or fall in disarray. Looking beyond the present, and not minimising its importance, the covid-19 crisis may turn out to be the trigger for overdue fundamental transformations of agriculture and the global food system. This is because the global food system does not work well today: the number of hungry people in the world has increased substantially, with the World Food Programme warning of the possibility of a ""hunger pandemic"". Food also must be nutritious, yet unhealthy diets are a leading cause of death. Deepening crises impoverish the poorest, disrupt food systems, and expand ""food deserts"". A focus on healthy diets for all is all the more relevant when everyone's immune system must react to infection during a global pandemic. There is also accumulating and compelling evidence that the global food system is pushing the Earth system beyond the boundaries of sustainability. In the past twenty years, the growing demand for food has increasingly been met through the destruction of Earth's natural environment, and much less through progress in agricultural productivity generated by scientific research, as was the case during the two previous decades. There is an urgent need to reduce the environmental footprint of the global food system: if its performances are not improved rapidly, the food system could itself be one main cause for food crises in the near future. The article concludes with a series of recommendations intended for policy makers and science leaders to improve the resilience of the food system, global to local, and in the short, medium and long term.","Savary, Serge; Akter, Sonia; Almekinders, Conny; Harris, Jody; Korsten, Lise; Rötter, Reimund; Waddington, Stephen; Watson, Derrill",Food Secur,341,1

METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged younger than 22 years with COVID-19 infection at Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center at Northwell Health. Cases were identified from patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms who underwent a nucleic acid amplification-based test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were identified. The median age was 10.3 years (interquartile range, 1.4 months to 16.3 years), with 48% of patients older than 12 years and 29% of patients younger than 60 days of age. Fever was present in 86% of patients, lower respiratory symptoms or signs in 60%, and gastrointestinal symptoms in 62%. Thirty-five percent of patients required ICU care. The white blood cell count was elevated in severe disease (P = .0027), as was the C-reactive protein level (P = .0192), compared with mild and moderate disease. Respiratory support was required in 34% of patients. Severity was lowest in infants younger than 60 days of age and highest in chronically ill children; 79% of immunocompromised children had mild disease. One death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among children who are hospitalized for COVID-19, most are younger than 60 days or older than 12 years of age. Children may have severe infection requiring intensive care support. The clinical course of immunocompromised patients was not more severe than that of other children. Elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level are associated with greater illness severity.","Kainth, Mundeep K; Goenka, Pratichi K; Williamson, Kristy A; Fishbein, Joanna S; Subramony, Anupama; Barone, Stephen; Belfer, Joshua A; Feld, Lance M; Krief, William I; Palumbo, Nancy; Rajan, Sujatha; Rocker, Joshua; Scotto, Tiffany; Sharma, Smiriti; Sokoloff, William C; Schleien, Charles; Rubin, Lorry G",Pediatrics,341,21

To address preanalytic challenges, we first consider alternative anatomic sites for specimen collection, then discuss self-collection, alternative sampling devices, and transport media. Strengths and limitations of various analytic test systems are considered in the context of postanalytic challenges associated with making test results meaningful, specifically considering the complex relationship between ""positive"" test results and reproduction and shedding of intact virus. Finally, we provide recommendations regarding healthcare worker surveillance and release of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from isolation. DATA SOURCES: Material was derived from a Webinar available to the public, manufacturer's websites, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites and from both peer-reviewed papers identified by PubMed search and nonpeer-reviewed papers posted on Biorxiv and Medrxiv. Unpublished data came from the Washington State Department of Health. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies that compared diagnostic performance strategies without introducing bias due to use of an imperfect gold standard. Case series and case reports were included as necessary to illuminate the significance of results. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted manually. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sensitivity, specificity, and CIs were computed from article data using a composite reference standard. Nucleic acid-based tests were assumed to perform at 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Although sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples provide the highest diagnostic sensitivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, nasopharyngeal, mid turbinate, and nasal specimens are suitable in most cases and require less use of personal protective equipment. When desired sampling materials are unavailable, alternatives may be substituted with no loss of performance. Both reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests and rapid nucleic acid-based tests offer good performance in most circumstances. Testing is not required to release most patients from isolation.","Tu, Yuan-Po; O039,; Leary, Timothy J",Crit Care Med,341,16

This qualitative study comprised of four rapid online focus groups conducted at a higher education institution in England, during high alert (tier 2) national COVID-19 restrictions. Participants were purposively sampled university students (n = 25) representing a range of gender, age, living circumstances (on/off campus), and SARS-CoV-2 testing/self-isolation experiences. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Six themes with 16 sub-themes emerged from the analysis of the qualitative data: 'Term-time Experiences', 'Risk Perception and Worry', 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours', 'Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing' and 'General Wellbeing'. Students described feeling safe on campus, believed most of their peers are adherent to protective behaviours and were positive towards asymptomatic testing in university settings. University communications about COVID-19 testing and social behaviours need to be timely and presented in a more inclusive way to reach groups of students who currently feel marginalised. Barriers to engagement with SARS-CoV-2 testing, social distancing and self-isolation were primarily associated with fear of the mental health impacts of self-isolation, including worry about how they will cope, high anxiety, low mood, guilt relating to impact on others and loneliness. Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low COVID-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. These findings are particularly pertinent in the context of mass asymptomatic testing programmes being implemented in educational settings and high numbers of students being required to self-isolate. Universities need to determine the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student mental health and welfare support services.","Blake, H.; Knight, H.; Jia, R.; Corner, J.; Morling, J.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in the Community of Madrid, which has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Spain. We included 143 adult patients with ITP (130 with chronic ITP, 8 with persistent ITP, and 5 with newly diagnosed ITP). We conducted a telephone survey to collect the data and created a registry. Materials and Methods: Overall, 24 patients presented symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, which was confirmed by RT-PCR in 8 cases. The cumulative incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in the patients with ITP than in the Madrid population. There were no differences in the disease incidence or clinical course of infection in the patients treated with immunosuppressants. Almost all of the patients reported adherence to the prescribed treatment, although 49.2% of the hospital visits were either cancelled or postponed, 17.2% because of the patients' fear of coming to the centre. Nearly half of the cohort was considered vulnerable, and 17% had been granted a dependency or disability benefit. Conclusions: COVID-19 had a major impact on the psychosocial, occupational, and quality of care of patients with ITP.","Román, María-Teresa Álvarez; Jiménez Yuste, Víctor; García Barcenilla, Sara; Ramírez López, Andrés; Monzón Manzano, Elena; de la Cruz Benito, Beatriz; Butta, Paula Acuña; Rivas Pollmar, María Isabel; Trelles Martínez, Roberto; González Zorrilla, Elena; Martín Salces, Mónica; Cebanu, Tamara; Butta, Nora V",Medicina (Kaunas),341,6

We estimated the accuracy of five risk-stratification tools recommended to predict severe illness and compare accuracy to existing clinical decision-making in a pre-hospital setting. MethodsAn observational cohort study using linked ambulance service data for patients attended by EMS crews in the Yorkshire and Humber region of England between 18th March 2020 and 29th June 2020 was conducted to assess performance of the PRIEST tool, NEWS2, the WHO algorithm, CRB-65 and PMEWS in patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was death or need for organ support. ResultsOf 7549 patients in our cohort, 17.6% (95% CI:16.8% to 18.5%) experienced the primary outcome. The NEWS2, PMEWS, PRIEST tool and WHO algorithm identified patients at risk of adverse outcomes with a high sensitivity (>0.95) and specificity ranging from 0.3 (NEWS2) to 0.41 (PRIEST tool). The high sensitivity of NEWS2 and PMEWS was achieved by using lower thresholds than previously recommended. On index assessment, 65% of patients were transported to hospital and EMS decision to transfer patients achieved a sensitivity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.85) and specificity of 0.39 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.40). ConclusionUse of NEWS2, PMEWS, PRIEST tool and WHO algorithm could improve sensitivity of EMS triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Use of the PRIEST tool would improve sensitivity of triage without increasing the number of patients conveyed to hospital.","Marincowitz, Carl; Sutton, Laura; Stone, Tony; Pilbery, Richard; Campbell, Richard; Thomas, Ben; Turner, Janette; Bath, Peter; Bell, Fiona; Biggs, Katie; Hasan, Madina; Hopfgartner, Frank; Mazumdar, Suvodeep; Petrie, Jennifer; Goodacre, Steve",,341,24

In non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, RV dysfunction develops due to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, inflammation, and alveolar overdistension or atelectasis. Although similar pathogenic mechanisms may induce RV dysfunction in COVID-19, other COVID-19-specific pathology, such as pulmonary endothelialitis, thrombosis, or myocarditis, may also affect RV function. We quantified RV dysfunction by echocardiographic strain analysis and investigated its correlation with disease severity, ventilatory parameters, biomarkers, and imaging findings in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We determined RV free wall longitudinal strain (FWLS) in 32 patients receiving mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Demographics, comorbid conditions, ventilatory parameters, medications, and laboratory findings were extracted from the medical record. Chest imaging was assessed to determine the severity of lung disease and the presence of pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: Abnormal FWLS was present in 66% of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and was associated with higher lung compliance (39.6 vs 29.4 mL/cmH2O, P = 0.016), lower airway plateau pressures (21 vs 24 cmH2O, P = 0.043), lower tidal volume ventilation (5.74 vs 6.17 cc/kg, P = 0.031), and reduced left ventricular function. FWLS correlated negatively with age (r = -0.414, P = 0.018) and with serum troponin (r = 0.402, P = 0.034). Patients with abnormal RV strain did not exhibit decreased oxygenation or increased disease severity based on inflammatory markers, vasopressor requirements, or chest imaging findings. CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction is common among critically ill COVID-19 patients and is not related to abnormal lung mechanics or ventilatory pressures. Instead, patients with abnormal FWLS had more favorable lung compliance. RV dysfunction may be secondary to diffuse intravascular micro- and macro-thrombosis or direct myocardial damage.

Case presentation: A 54-year-old male, COVID-19-confirmed patient complaining of abdominal pain since two days prior was transferred to our hospital. Perforated appendicitis with a periappendiceal abscess was diagnosed by computed tomography. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in a negative-pressure operating room. The surgical team wore enhanced personal protective equipment. Electrocautery was not used during surgery and no other special instruments were applied to reduce aerosol generation. No special instruments or filters were used for the removal of intra-abdominal gas. The operation was completed successfully and no immediate surgical complications occurred. The patient advanced to a normal diet on the 4th postoperative day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for bacteremia and antiviral therapy for underlying pneumonia in the setting of COVID-19 with most symptoms dissipating by the 7th postoperative day. The patient was discharged on the 30th postoperative day without any complications. Discussion: A well-designed manual, a well-trained surgical team, and a negative-pressure operating room are essential for safe laparoscopic appendectomies in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: When surgery is performed in a negative-pressure operating room by a well-trained surgical team, a laparoscopic appendectomy can be successfully performed under the principles of obtaining optimum clinical outcomes while faithfully ensuring the safety of healthcare providers and the hospital environment.","Oh, Dongkyu; Kang, Yu Min; Choi, Jin Yong; Lee, Wang Jun",,341,16

While pediatric patients are reported to have lower rates of COVID-19 mortality, the presence of pre-existing conditions can heighten the severity of their clinical presentation. Case Report: Our patient, a six year old female with known type 1 diabetes, presented with acute onset of abnormal breathing and altered mental status. The day prior, she had one episode of emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but no fever. She presented to an outside hospital and was reported to have agonal breathing with a GCS of 8 (eyes open to pain, no verbal response to stimuli, and localizes pain). She was promptly intubated and initial labs revealed severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). With a family member with COVID-19, she tested COVID-19 positive. Results: Our patient's rapid progression and severity of illness requires discussion of how COVID-19 might affect diabetes and indicates opportunities for improving clinical practice in children with preexisting diabetes. We discuss how COVID-19 might change the underlying pathophysiology of DKA and cause metabolic complications. Possible mechanisms include binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and enabling a proinflammatory ""cytokine storm"". Additionally, ketoacidosis and altered mental status have been present in patients with COVID-19 without diabetes, which might potentiate the symptoms in developing DKA. Conclusion: Prompt recognition of DKA is warranted as caregivers may attribute the symptoms to COVID-19 rather than DKA, resulting in increased severity of illness on presentation with acute symptom onset, as described in this report.","Modarelli, Rachel; Balikcioglu, Pinar Gumus; Hendrix, Grace; DeRusso, Michelle; Ozment, Caroline",,341,23

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical information and CT findings of a total of 14 patients with COVID-19 infection (age range, 12-83 years; females 6) were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical information includes the history of exposure, laboratory results, and the symptoms (such as fever, cough, headache, etc.); CT findings of chest include the extension and distribution of lesion, the ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, bronchovascular enlarged, irregular linear appearances, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. RESULTS: Eight patients had the exposure history for recent travel to Wuhan of Hubei province (8/14, 57%), 6 had the exposure to patients with COVID-19 infection. Significant statistical differences were observed in lymphocyte percentage decreased and C-reactive protein elevated (pâ=â0.015). Seven patients had fever, 7 had cough, 2 had headache, 3 had fatigue, 1 had body soreness, 3 had diarrhea, and 2 had no obvious symptoms. In chest CT examination, 10 patients were positive (10/14, 71.43%). Among these patients, 9 had lesions involving both lungs (9/10, 90%), 8 had lesions involving 4 to 5 lobes (8/10, 80%). Most of lesions were distributed peripherally and the most significant lesions were observed in the right lower lobe in 9 patients (9/10, 90%). Nodules were observed in 5 patients (5/10, 50%); GGO, consolidation, and bronchovascular enlarged were shown in 9 patients (9/10, 90%); irregular linear appearances were revealed in 7 patients (7/10, 70%); and pleural effusions were exhibited in 2 patients (2/10, 20%). Last, no patients showed lymphadenopathy. CONCLUSION: There were some typical CT features for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The radiologists should know these CT findings and clinical information, which could help for accurate analysis in the patients with 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","Lei, Pinggui; Huang, Zhaoshu; Liu, Guoli; Wang, Pingxian; Song, Wen; Mao, Jujiang; Shen, Guiquan; Zhou, Shi; Qian, Wei; Jiao, Jun",J Xray Sci Technol,341,24

The authors assessed students' reactions and comparative performance. Materials and Methods: OSCE and telehealth educators used draft Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) telehealth competencies to create educational materials and adapt OSCE cases. Students anonymously answered queries about the challenges of the telehealth encounters, confidence in basic telehealth competencies, and educational value of the experience. Cohort-level performance data were compared between the January in-person and June telehealth OSCEs. Results: One hundred sixty students participated in 29 Zoom® two-case telehealth OSCEs, equaling 58 h of assessment time. Survey response rate: 59%. Students indicated moderate challenge in adapting physical examinations to the telehealth format and indicated it to be cognitively challenging. Confidence in telehealth competencies was rated ""moderate"" to ""very,"" but was most pronounced for the technical aspects of telehealth, rather than safety engagement with a patient. Although authors found no significant difference in cohort-level performance in total scores and history-taking between the OSCEs, physical examination and communication scores differed between the two assessments. Discussion: It was feasible to adapt a standardized OSCE to a telehealth format when in-person clinical skills assessment was impossible. Students rated this necessary innovation positively, and it adequately assessed foundational clinical skills performance.

So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n &#8776; 350,000). We use the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 wk) and features an equitable system of school funding and the world's highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.","Engzell, Per; Frey, Arun; Verhagen, Mark D",Proc.

Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity in COVID-19, and obesity is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis (HS). However, how HS alters the natural history of COVID-19 is not well characterized, especially in Western populations. AIMS: To characterize the impact of HS on disease severity and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: We examined the association between HS and disease severity in a single-center cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Michigan Medicine. HS was defined by either hepatic steatosis index > 36 (for Asians) or > 39 (for non-Asians) or liver imaging demonstrating steatosis > 30 days before onset of COVID-19. The primary predictor was HS. The primary outcomes were severity of cardiopulmonary disease, transaminitis, jaundice, and portal hypertensive complications. RESULTS: In a cohort of 342 patients, metabolic disease was highly prevalent including nearly 90% overweight. HS was associated with increased transaminitis and need for intubation, dialysis, and vasopressors. There was no association between HS and jaundice or portal hypertensive complications. In a sensitivity analysis including only patients with liver imaging > 30 days before onset of COVID-19, imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis remained associated with disease severity and risk of transaminitis. CONCLUSIONS: HS was associated with increased disease severity and transaminitis in COVID-19.

However, the association between stress and seizures has not been thoroughly investigated. In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing tremendous collateral stress. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on seizures in PWE in the most severely affected area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities. METHODS: In this single-center, cross-sectional study, PWE were surveyed via online questionnaires between February 23 and March 5, 2020. Collected data included demographic information, epilepsy-related characteristics (seizure type, frequency, antiepileptic drugs [AEDs], and medication management), direct and perceived threat of COVID-19, and changes in seizures during the outbreak. Psychological comorbidities were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify precipitants for seizure exacerbation. RESULTS: We received 362 completed questionnaires after excluding 12 duplicates (response rate = 63.51%). A total of 31 (8.56%) patients had increased seizures during the outbreak. Exposure history to COVID-19 (P = .001), uncontrolled seizure after AED therapy (P = .020), seizure frequency of two or more times per month before the outbreak (P = .005), change of AED regimen during the outbreak (AED reduction, withdrawal, replacement, skipping altogether; P = .002), and worry about the adverse effect of the outbreak on overall seizure-related issues (severity = moderate to critical; P = .038) were risk factors for increased seizures. SIGNIFICANCE: A minority of PWE experienced seizure exacerbation during the outbreak of COVID-19. Stress, uncontrolled seizures, and inappropriate change in AED regimen were associated with increased seizures. Based on these findings, stress might be an independent precipitant for triggering seizures in some PWE.","Huang, Shanshan; Wu, Chunmei; Jia, Yuchao; Li, Guo; Zhu, Zhou; Lu, Kai; Yang, Yuyan; Wang, Furong; Zhu, Suiqiang",Epilepsia,341,30

DESIGN, SETTING: Observational study in the two COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhu, Anhui province, China, 24 January - 24 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one patients infected with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) treated at the two designated hospitals. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, and duration of symptoms, by treatment type (including or not including corticosteroid therapy). RESULTS: Eleven of 31 patients with COVID-19 received corticosteroid treatment. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated no association between corticosteroid treatment and virus clearance time (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74), hospital length of stay (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.33-1.78), or duration of symptoms (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.40-1.83). Univariate analysis indicated that virus clearance was slower in two patients with chronic hepatitis B infections (mean difference, 10.6 days; 95% CI, 6.2-15.1 days). CONCLUSIONS: Corticosteroids are widely used when treating patients with COVID-19, but we found no association between therapy and outcomes in patients without acute respiratory distress syndrome. An existing HBV infection may delay SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and this association should be further investigated.","Zha, Lei; Li, Shirong; Pan, Lingling; Tefsen, Boris; Li, Yeshan; French, Neil; Chen, Liyun; Yang, Gang; Villanueva, Elmer V",Med J Aust,341,1

While first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results, accurate seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and quantitative test setups. METHODS: We have developed two quantitative, easy-to-implement SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, based on the spike receptor binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comprehensive evaluation of antigens from several biotechnological platforms enabled the identification of superior antigen designs for reliable serodiagnostic. Cut-off modelling based on unprecedented large and heterogeneous multicentric validation cohorts allowed us to define optimal thresholds for the tests' broad applications in different aspects of clinical use, such as seroprevalence studies and convalescent plasma donor qualification. FINDINGS: Both developed serotests individually performed similarly-well as fully-automated CE-marked test systems. Our described sensitivity-improved orthogonal test approach assures highest specificity (99.8%); thereby enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings with simple test formats. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19 and disclosed antibody level thresholds that correlate well with robust neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that antigen source and purity strongly impact serotest performance. Comprehensive biotechnology-assisted selection of antigens and in-depth characterisation of the assays allowed us to overcome limitations of simple ELISA-based antibody test formats based on chromometric reporters, to yield comparable assay performance as fully-automated platforms.

This opinion paper hence aims to discuss aspects related to the opportunity of monitoring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after COVID-19 vaccination, highlighting the pros and cons of this strategy. In summary, the advantages of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies’ testing in recipients of COVID-19 vaccination encompass an assessment of baseline seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-vaccinated individuals;early identification of low or non-responders to COVID-19 vaccination;and timely detection of faster decay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. In contrast, potential drawbacks to date include an unproven equivalence between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer, neutralizing activity, and vaccine efficiency;the lack of cost-effective analyses of different testing strategies;the enormous volume of blood drawings and increase of laboratory workload that would be needed to support universal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing. A potential solution entails the identification of cohorts to be prioritized for testing, including those at higher risk of being infected by variants of concern, those at higher risk of unfavorable disease progression, and subjects in whom vaccine immunogenicity may be expectedly lower and/or shorter.","Lippi, Giuseppe Henry Brandon Michael Plebani Mario",Diagnostics,341,5

OBJECTIVES: To investigate antibiotic prescribing practices in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an international web-based survey and investigated the pattern of antibiotic use as reported by physicians involved in treatment of COVID-19. SPSS Statistics version 25 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 166 participants from 23 countries and 82 different hospitals. Local guidelines for antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients were reported by 61.8% (n = 102) of participants and for 82.9% (n = 136) they did not differ from local community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. Clinical presentation was recognized as the most important reason for the start of antibiotics (mean score = 4.07 and SD = 1.095 on grading scale from 1 to 5). When antibiotics were started, most respondents rated as the highest the need for coverage of atypical pathogens (mean score = 2.8 and SD = 0.99), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (mean score = 2.67 and SD = 1.05 on bi-modal scale, with values 1 and 2 for disagreement and values 3 and 4 for agreement). In the patients on the ward, 29.1% of respondents chose not to prescribe any antibiotic. Combination of ß-lactams and macrolides or fluoroquinolones was reported by 52.4% (n = 87) of respondents. In patients in the ICU, piperacillin/tazobactam was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic. The mean reported duration of antibiotic treatment was 7.12 (SD = 2.44) days.

METHODS: The authors performed a single-center retrospective case-control study. The outcome of interest was seizure associated with DBS implantation. Univariate analyses were performed using the Student t-test for parametric continuous outcomes. The authors used the Kruskal-Wallis test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for nonparametric continuous outcomes, chi-square statistics for categorical outcomes, and multivariate logistic regression for binomial variables. RESULTS: A total of 814 DBS electrode implantations were performed in 645 patients (478 [58.7%] in men and 520 [63.9%] in patients with Parkinson's disease). In total, 22 (3.4%) patients who had undergone 23 (2.8%) placements experienced seizure. Of the 23 DBS implantation-related seizures, 21 were new-onset seizures (3.3% of 645 patients) and 2 were recurrence or worsening of a prior seizure disorder. Among the 23 cases with postimplantation-related seizure, epilepsy developed in 4 (17.4%) postoperatively; the risk of DBS-associated epilepsy was 0.50% per DBS electrode placement and 0.63% per patient. Nine (39.1%) implantation-related seizures had associated postoperative radiographic abnormalities. Multivariate analyses suggested that age at surgery conferred a modest increased risk for postoperative seizures (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10). Sex, primary diagnosis, electrode location and sidedness, and the number of trajectories were not significantly associated with seizures after DBS surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures associated with DBS electrode placement are uncommon, typically occur early within the postoperative period, and seldom lead to epilepsy. This study suggests that patient characteristics, such as age, may play a greater role than perioperative variables in determining seizure risk. Multiinstitutional studies may help better define and mitigate the risk of seizures after DBS surgery.","Atchley, Travis J; Elsayed, Galal A; Sowers, Blake; Walker, Harrison C; Chagoya, Gustavo; Davis, Matthew C; Bernstock, Joshua D; Omar, Nidal B; Patel, Daxa M; Guthrie, Barton L",J Neurosurg,341,1

The aim of this study is to assess lung perfusion changes with sCTA seen in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate them with clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out with 45 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization at three different hospitals, between April and May 2020. In all cases, a basic clinical and demographic profile was obtained. Lung perfusion was assessed using sCTA. Evaluated imaging features included: Pattern predominance of injured lung parenchyma in both lungs (ground-glass opacities, consolidation and mixed pattern) and anatomical extension; predominant type of perfusion abnormality (increased perfusion or hypoperfusion), perfusion abnormality distribution (focal or diffuse), extension of perfusion abnormalities (mild, moderate and severe involvement); presence of vascular dilatation and vascular tortuosity. All participants were followed-up until hospital discharge searching for the development of any of the study endpoints. These endpoints included intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (55.2 ± 16.5 years, 22 men) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an interpretable iodine map were included. Patients with perfusion anomalies on sCTA in morphologically normal lung parenchyma showed lower Pa/Fi values (294 ± 111.3 vs. 397 ± 37.7, p = 0.035), and higher D-dimer levels (1156 ± 1018 vs. 378 ± 60.2, p < 0.01). The main common patterns seen in lung CT scans were ground-glass opacities, mixed pattern with predominant ground-glass opacities and mixed pattern with predominant consolidation in 56.1%, 24.4% and 19.5% respectively. Perfusion abnormalities were common (36 patients, 87.8%), mainly hypoperfusion in areas of apparently healthy lung. Patients with severe hypoperfusion in areas of apparently healthy lung parenchyma had an increased probability of being admitted to ICU and to initiate IMV (HR of 11.9 (95% CI 1.55-91.9) and HR 7.8 (95% CI 1.05-61.1), respectively). CONCLUSION: Perfusion abnormalities evidenced in iodine maps obtained by sCTA are associated with increased admission to ICU and initiation of IMV in COVID-19 patients.","Santamarina, Mario G; Boisier Riscal, Dominique; Beddings, Ignacio; Contreras, Roberto; Baque, Martiniano; Volpacchio, Mariano; Martinez Lomakin, Felipe",Crit Care,341,24

The Pearson and Poisson regression models were used accordingly to understand the association between COVID-19 deaths and each risk factor. The daily COVID-19 deaths were positively correlated with AQI (slope = 0.4 ± 0.09, R 2 = 0.24, p < 0.01). Detailedly, PM2.5 was the only pollutant exhibiting a positive association (relative risk (RR) = 1.079, 95%CI 1.071-1.086, p < 0.01) with COVID-19 deaths. The PM10, SO2, and CO were all also significantly associated with COVID-19 deaths, but in negative pattern (p < 0.01).

A key portion of the medical work force on the frontline is composed of resident physicians. Thus, it becomes imperative to create an adequate and effective action plan to restructure this valuable human resource amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We sought to describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused in resident training and support. OBJECTIVE: To describe a comprehensive approach taken by a Neurosurgery Department in quaternary care academic institution in the United States of America amid the SARS-CoV2 pandemic focused on resident training and support. RESULTS: A restructuring of the Neurosurgery Department at our academic institution was performed focused on decreasing their risk of infection/exposure and transmission to others, while minimizing negative consequences in the training experience. An online academic platform was built for resident education, guidance, and support, as well as continue channel for pandemic update by the department leadership. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic constitutes a global health emergency full of uncertainty. Treatment, scope, duration, and economic burden forced a major restructuring of our medical practice. In this regard, academic institutions must direct efforts to diminish further negative impact in the training and education of the upcoming generation of physicians, including those currently in medical school. Perhaps the only silver lining in this terrible disruption will be greater appreciation of the role of current health care providers and educators, whose contributions to our society are often neglected or unrecognized.","Fernandes Cabral, David T; Alan, Nima; Agarwal, Nitin; Lunsford, L Dade; Monaco, Edward A",World Neurosurg,341,24

Out of these, COVID-19 is viewed as the most critical and novel infection nowadays. The current investigation gives an effective framework for the monitoring and prediction of COVID-19 virus infection (C-19VI). To the best of our knowledge, no research work is focused on incorporating IoT technology for C-19 outspread over spatial-temporal patterns. Moreover, limited work has been done in the direction of prediction of C-19 in humans for controlling the spread of COVID-19. The proposed framework includes a four-level architecture for the expectation and avoidance of COVID-19 contamination. The presented model comprises COVID-19 Data Collection (C-19DC) level, COVID-19 Information Classification (C-19IC) level, COVID-19-Mining and Extraction (C-19ME) level, and COVID-19 Prediction and Decision Modeling (C-19PDM) level. Specifically, the presented model is used to empower a person/community to intermittently screen COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM) and forecast it so that proactive measures are taken in advance. Additionally, for prescient purposes, the probabilistic examination of C-19VI is quantified as degree of membership, which is cumulatively characterized as a COVID-19 Fever Measure (C-19FM). Moreover, the prediction is realized utilizing the temporal recurrent neural network. Additionally, based on the self-organized mapping technique, the presence of C-19VI is determined over a geographical area. Simulation is performed over four challenging datasets. In contrast to other strategies, altogether improved outcomes in terms of classification efficiency, prediction viability, and reliability were registered for the introduced model.","Ahanger, Tariq Ahamed; Tariq, Usman; Nusir, Muneer; Aldaej, Abdulaziz; Ullah, Imdad; Sulman, Abdullah",J Supercomput,341,26

METHODS: In the present single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we reported findings from 87 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory syndrome hospitalized in an intermediate Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU), subdividing the patients in two groups according to the admission date (before and after March 29, 2020). RESULTS: With improved skills in the clinical management of COVID-19, we observed a significant lower mortality in the T2 group compared with the T1 group and a significantly difference in terms of mortality among the patients transferred in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from our intermediate RICU (100% in T1 group vs. 33.3% in T2 group). The average length of stay in intermediate RICU of ICU-transferred patients who survived in T1 and T2 was significantly longer than those who died (who died 3.3 ± 2.8 days vs. who survived 6.4 ± 3.3 days).

While there is an increase in the usage of cosmetic products, it is concerning whether the consumers are aware of the safety of the products. AIMS: This study aimed to widely explore consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward cosmetics within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among adults in Selangor, Malaysia. 33 questions divided in three dimensions (socio-demographic parameters, assessment of perception and assessment of attitude) were developed and validated to be answered by cosmetics consumers. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done using SPSS. RESULTS: A response rate of 87% was achieved, and the mean age of participants was 33± 7.2. The overall perception of consumers indicates low levels of perception and moderate level of attitude toward cosmetic products. There was a positive correlation and high relationship between participants' perception and attitude (P = 0.001, r = 0.72). A Significant association was observed between demographic data of respondents and their attitude and perception towards cosmetic products. Participants were unaware that sharing of cosmetic products could lead to bacterial infection and possibly increased the chance of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study displayed a nonchalant perception and attitude of Malaysian adults toward cosmetic products by focusing on aesthetics rather than health safety. Therefore, it is recommended to raise awareness on the composition and effects of cosmetic products, increase the practice of hygiene and dissuaded the sharing of cosmetics to reduce transmissions of COVID-19.","Mohammed, Ali Haider; Blebil, Ali; Dujaili, Juman; Hassan, Bassam Abdul Rasool",J. cosmet. dermatol,341,6

In this study, proteomic profiles of plasma sEVs from normal subjects and diabetic patients with or without diabetic retinopathy (DR) were systematically compared using iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics. Among a total of 901 identified proteins in plasma sEVs (false discovery rate (FDR) < 1%), 90 proteins were found to have significantly changed levels in DR. Based on the findings from the proteomic analysis, the role of tumor necrosis factor-&#945;-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8) in promoting human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) proliferation was investigated. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that TNFAIP8 levels in plasma sEVs and vitreous are elevated in DR, whereas not statistically different in large EVs (lEVs) and plasma. In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) increased the expression of TNFAIP8 in HRMECs. TNFAIP8 significantly increased HRMECs cell viability and promote cell migration and tube formation, and the depletion of TNFAIP8 impaired HRMEC proliferation. We demonstrated that TNFAIP8 in plasma sEVs could be used as a potential biomarker of DR. Functional studies suggested that TNFAIP8 might be an important mediator of angiogenesis in DR.","Xiao, Jing; Zhang, Hui; Yang, Fuhua; Xiao, Mengran; Zhou, Lei; Yu, Rongguo; Shao, Xianfeng; Ea, Vicki; Su, Lin; Zhang, Xiaomin; Li, Xiaorong",J. proteome res,341,1

The main symptoms and the primary cause of death are related to interstitial pneumonia. Viral entry also into myocardial cells mainly via the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) receptor and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however, also make the heart susceptible to injury. In addition to the immediate damage caused by the acute inflammatory response, the heart may also suffer from long-term consequences of COVID-19, potentially causing a post-pandemic increase in cardiac complications. Although the main cause of cardiac damage in COVID-19 remains coagulopathy with micro- (and to a lesser extent macro-) vascular occlusion, open questions remain about other possible modalities of cardiac dysfunction, such as direct infection of myocardial cells, effects of cytokines storm, and mechanisms related to enhanced coagulopathy. In this opinion paper, we focus on these lesser appreciated possibilities and propose experimental approaches that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular bases of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. We first discuss approaches to characterize cardiac damage caused by possible direct viral infection of cardiac cells, followed by formulating hypotheses on how to reproduce and investigate the hyperinflammatory and pro-thrombotic conditions observed in the heart of COVID-19 patients using experimental in vitro systems.

First, to verify the prediction accuracy of the gas diffusion using RIAM-COMPACT, comparisons with past wind tunnel test results conducted on simple and complex terrains are presented under neutral atmospheric stability. The results of the numerical simulations carried out in this study show good agreement with the wind tunnel experiments for both simple and complex terrains. Next, a model of the Japan National Stadium (Tokyo Olympic Stadium) was constructed using 3D detailed topographic Advanced World 3D Map (AW3D) data generated by combining high-resolution satellite images. We tried to reproduce the hypothetical spread and dissipation of the fluid layer (assuming the fluid layer contains COVID-19 particles) inside and outside of the Japan National Stadium using Airflow Analyst implemented with the RIAM-COMPACT analysis function for gas diffusion. We paid special attention to the effect of wind ventilation driven by natural wind. The numerical results under various scenarios show that ventilation driven by natural wind is very effective for the Japan National Stadium.

We train the model with a novel algorithm to optimize the reward (k-SCST), in which the model proposes several candidate simplifications, computes each candidate's reward, and encourages candidates that outperform the mean reward. Finally, we propose a realistic text comprehension task as an evaluation method for text simplification. When tested on the English news domain, the KiS model outperforms strong supervised baselines by more than 4 SARI points, and can help people complete a comprehension task an average of 18% faster while retaining accuracy, when compared to the original text.

Here, we evaluated the prevalence and related risk factors of UTI associated with LRTI in children under 36 months of age. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 1574 patients under 36 months of age who were hospitalised with LRTI from January 2017 to December 2019 in a single centre, Seoul, South Korea. Among them, we analysed 278 patients who showed fever and performed urine evaluation. Urine was collected by catheterisation in children under 24 months of age and by voided urine between 24 and 36 months of age. RESULTS: The prevalence of concomitant UTI and LRTI was 13.6% in children under 24 months of age. Mean age was significantly younger in the UTI versus non-UTI group (6.93 ± 7.26 months vs. 12.61 ± 11.70 months; P < 0.001). When the participants were stratified by age, the prevalence of UTI was significantly higher in children younger than 24 months of age compared to older ones (P = 0.006). UTIs were more prevalent in boys than in girls (14.6% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.018). Peak body temperature, fever duration, premature birth and detected respiratory virus type did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is not uncommon for children with LRTI with fever to be accompanied by UTI. When evaluating for UTI in children with febrile LRTI, age and sex must be considered.","Kim, Jeong Min; Koo, Ja Wook; Kim, Hyo-Bin",J. paediatr. child health,341,19

METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey of 2777 self-selected UK adults. RESULTS: Thirty percent of participants reported drinking more frequently in lockdown, 16% reported drinking more units per drinking occasion and 14% reported more frequent HED. For men and women, increased frequency of drinking was associated with being less likely to believe alcohol drinking would lead to greater chance of catching COVID-19 (men: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98, 1.00; women: OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.99, 1.00) and deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.54; OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.51); increased unit consumption was associated with deterioration in financial situation (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.21, 1.86; OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.64) and physical health (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.67; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.31, 2.10). Finally, increases in the frequency of HED were associated with deterioration in psychological wellbeing (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.25, 2.18; OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.82) and being furloughed (OR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.80, 5.86; OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.19, 3.56). Other gender differences were detected, for example, living with children was associated with an increase in units consumed (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.09, 2.73) and the frequency of HED (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.44, 3.99) for men, but not women. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this self-selected UK sample, a significant proportion of individuals reported drinking more frequently in lockdown, drinking more units per drinking occasion and more frequent HED. There were consistent predictors of increased consumption across men and women, but other gender differences were detected. This study identifies groups that may require targeted support in future lockdowns.","Oldham, Melissa; Garnett, Claire; Brown, Jamie; Kale, Dimitra; Shahab, Lion; Herbec, Aleksandra",Drug alcohol rev,341,1

No study has evaluated the time required to reverse this downward curve of MI admissions. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis on patients (N = 2415) admitted to the Emergency Departments for acute MI in nine Italian centers. Primary endpoint was the incidence rates (IRs) of MI admissions in the post-lockdown COVID-19 period (case-period: from May 4 to July 12, 2020) vs. the following control periods: January 1-February 19, 2020 (pre-lockdown period);February 20-May 3, 2020 (intra-lockdown period);May 4-July 12, 2019 (inter-year non-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: IR of admissions for MI in the post-lockdown period was higher than the intra-lockdown period (IR ratio, IRR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.42-1.81;p = 0.0001), was lower than the pre-lockdown period (IRR: 0.86, 0.77-0.96;p = 0.009) and similar to the inter-year non-COVID-19 period (IRR: 0.96, 0.87-1.07;p = 0.47). Within the case period, the increase in MI admissions was more pronounced in earlier vs later weeks (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02-1.38, p = 0.024) and, compared to the inter-year control period, was significant for non ST-segment elevation MI (IRR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.08-1.46, p = 0.004), but was not observed for ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), where hospitalizations were reduced (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study first indicates an increase in the number of admissions for MI after the removal of the national lockdown for COVID-19 in Italy. This increase was prevalent in the first weeks following the lockdown removal, but was under-represented in STEMI patients.","Rognoni, A.; D039,; Ascenzo, F.; Solli, M.; Mennuni, M.

Coronin and Aip1 promote cofilin mediated actin filament disassembly, but the mechanism is somewhat controversial. An early model proposed that the combination of cofilin, coronin, and Aip1 disassembled filaments in bursts. A subsequent study only reported severing. Here, we used electron microscopy to show that actin filaments convert directly into globular material. A monomer trap assay also shows that the combination of all three factors produces actin monomers faster than any two factors alone. We show that coronin accelerates the release of inorganic phosphate from actin filaments and promotes highly cooperative cofilin binding to actin to create long stretches of polymer with a hypertwisted morphology. Aip1 attacks these hypertwisted regions along their sides, disintegrating them into monomers or short oligomers. The results are consistent with a catastrophic mode of disassembly, not enhanced severing alone.","Tang, Vivian W; Nadkarni, Ambika V; Brieher, William M",J. biol. chem,341,14

Despite intense promotion to opt for the vouchers in digital form, Taiwanese public overwhelmingly chose the paper form. This study considers the reasons that influenced their decision comfort in choosing paper rather than digital vouchers based on two categories: rational (promotion depth and ease of use) and behavioral economics factors (analysis paralysis, mental accounting related to ease of tracking expenses, social influence and payment habits). Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares (PLS) method was utilized to analyze survey information obtained from 183 individuals who chose paper vouchers. Findings: Individuals consider rational and behavioral economic factors in their perception of decision comfort while choosing paper over digital vouchers. Decision comfort is driven more by behavioral economics than rational factors such as ease of use. Interestingly, analysis paralysis related to paper vouchers has the greatest impact, but it positively influences decision comfort, indicating that Taiwanese people view paper vouchers as a safe haven in the midst of uncertainties and information overload. Therefore, when designing public policies or promotional campaigns, possible behavior outcomes should be considered from both rational and behavioral economic perspectives. Originality/value: This study provides insights into the dynamics of how individuals arrive at their decision of opting paper vouchers over digital ones and offers theoretical contributions related to system adoption and behavioral economics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Tan, W.

However, chemotherapy is often omitted either because of physician bias or because of its underlying comorbidity, thus compromising their survival. The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is compounding this issue because of the fear of immunosuppression induced by chemotherapy on the elderly which makes them more vulnerable to the virus. SUMMARY: Immunotherapy has less effect on the patient bone marrow compared to chemotherapy. The potential synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy may improve local control and survival for older patients with selected cancer. Preliminary data are encouraging because of better survival and local control in diseases which are traditionally resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Key Message: We propose a new paradigm combining immunotherapy at a reduced dose and/or extended dosing intervals and hypofractionated radiotherapy for older patients with selected cancer which needs to be tested in future clinical trials.","Nguyen, Nam Phong; Baumert, Brigitta G; Oboite, Eromosele; Motta, Micaela; Appalanaido, Gokula Kumar; Arenas, Meritxell; Lara, Pedro Carlos; Bonet, Marta; Zamagni, Alice; Vuong, Te; Popescu, Tiberiu; Karlsson, Ulf; Trigo, Lurdes; Sun Myint, Arthur; Thariat, Juliette; Vinh-Hung, Vincent",Gerontology,341,4

Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to co-morbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield.

A critical step in the treatment and management of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline, with computed tomography (CT) imaging being a particularly effective method for determining the extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression from chest CT images. More specifically, machine-driven design exploration was leveraged to determine a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we build a customized network design tailored for predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) based on a patient's CT scan, initial spirometry measurement, and clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to study the decision-making behaviour of Fibrosis-Net as to verify that predictions are based on relevant visual indicators in CT images. Experiments using the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression Challenge benchmark dataset showed that the proposed Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the challenge leaderboard. Furthermore, explainability-driven performance validation demonstrated that the proposed Fibrosis-Net exhibits correct decision-making behaviour by leveraging clinically-relevant visual indicators in CT images when making predictions on pulmonary fibrosis progress. While Fibrosis-Net is not yet a production-ready clinical assessment solution, we hope that releasing the model in open source manner will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon it.","Wong, Alexander; Lu, Jack; Dorfman, Adam; McInnis, Paul; Famouri, Mahmoud; Manary, Daniel; Lee, James Ren Hou; Lynch, Michael",,341,20

The ease with which this type of coronavirus can spread has exposed weaknesses of many healthcare systems around the world. Since its emergence, many governments, research communities, commercial enterprises, and other institutions and stakeholders around the world have been fighting in various ways to curb the spread of the disease. Science and technology have helped in the implementation of policies of many governments that are directed toward mitigating the impacts of the pandemic and in diagnosing and providing care for the disease. Recent technological tools, artificial intelligence (AI) tools in particular, have also been explored to track the spread of the coronavirus, identify patients with high mortality risk and diagnose patients for the disease. In this paper, areas where AI techniques are being used in the detection, diagnosis and epidemiological predictions, forecasting and social control for combating COVID-19 are discussed, highlighting areas of successful applications and underscoring issues that need to be addressed to achieve significant progress in battling COVID-19 and future pandemics. Several AI systems have been developed for diagnosing COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest CT and X-ray images. These AI systems mainly differ in their choices of the algorithms for image segmentation, classification and disease diagnosis. Other AI-based systems have focused on predicting mortality rate, long-term patient hospitalization and patient outcomes for COVID-19. AI has huge potential in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic but successful practical deployments of these AI-based tools have so far been limited due to challenges such as limited data accessibility, the need for external evaluation of AI models, the lack of awareness of AI experts of the regulatory landscape governing the deployment of AI tools in healthcare, the need for clinicians and other experts to work with AI experts in a multidisciplinary context and the need to address public concerns over data collection, privacy, and protection. Having a dedicated team with expertise in medical data collection, privacy, access and sharing, using federated learning whereby AI scientists hand over training algorithms to the healthcare institutions to train models locally, and taking full advantage of biomedical data stored in biobanks can alleviate some of problems posed by these challenges. Addressing these challenges will ultimately accelerate the translation of AI research into practical and useful solutions for combating pandemics.","Abdulkareem, M.; Petersen, S.

At present, no vaccine is available to protect against MERS-CoV infections. Therefore, an in silico search for potential antigenic epitopes in the non-redundant proteome of MERS-CoV was performed herein. First, a subtractive proteome-based approach was employed to look for the surface exposed and host non-homologous proteins. Following, immunoinformatics analysis was performed to predict antigenic B and T cell epitopes that were used in the design of a multi-epitopes peptide. Molecular docking study was carried out to predict vaccine construct affinity of binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and understand its binding conformation to extract ideas about its processing by the host immune system. We identified membrane protein, envelope small membrane protein, non-structural protein ORF3, non-structural protein ORF5, and spike glycoprotein as potential candidates for subunit vaccine designing. The designed multi-epitope peptide then linked to ß-defensin adjuvant is showing high antigenicity. Further, the sequence of the designed vaccine construct is optimized for maximum expression in the Escherichia coli expression system. A rich pattern of hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions of the construct was observed with the TLR3 allowing stable binding of the construct at the docked site as predicted by the molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energies. We expect that the panel of subunit vaccine candidates and the designed vaccine construct could be highly effective in immunizing populations from infections caused by MERS-CoV and could possible applied on the current pandemic COVID-19.","Khan, Salman; Shaker, Bilal; Ahmad, Sajjad; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Arshad, Muhammad; Haleem, Abdul; Ismail, Saba; Zaib, Anita; Sajjad, Wasim",J Mol Liq,341,1

Furthermore, vulnerable populations, such as those served by the Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net hospital in New England, represent a high-risk group across multiple dimensions, including a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions and substance use disorders, lower health maintenance, unstable housing, and a propensity for rapid community spread, highlighting the urgent need for expedient and reliable in-house testing. Methods: We developed a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic medium-throughput qRT-PCR assay with rapid turnaround time and utilized this Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified assay for testing nasopharyngeal swab samples from BMC patients, with emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Findings: The in-house testing platform displayed robust accuracy and reliability in validation studies and reduced institutional sample turnaround time from 5-7 days to less than 24 h. Of over 1,000 unique patient samples tested, 44.1% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: This work provides a blueprint for academic centers and community hospitals lacking automated laboratory machinery to implement rapid in-house testing.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search of MEDLINE, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov was performed to identify studies between 1980 to 2020 using the following search terms: corticosteroids, COVID19, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and influenza. Pre-printed articles were also reviewed at medRxiv.org. DATA ANALYSIS: Corticosteroids were not recommended early in the COVID-19 pandemic outside of the use for concomitant indications (i.e. ARDS, septic shock) as they have been associated with delayed time to viral clearance in other viral pneumonias. A randomized trial showed a mortality benefit with dexamethasone in COVID-19. Guidelines have been updated to include a strong recommendation for their use in COVID-19 in those hospitalized requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Based on data from available randomized trials, patients that require respiratory support or mechanical ventilation benefit from corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids are an inexpensive and readily available therapy that should be standard of care in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support.","Johns, Meagan; George, Stephy; Taburyanskaya, Margarita; Poon, Yi Kee",J Pharm Pract,341,16

These interventions impact residents' lives, including an increase in depressive symptoms and other negative concomitants. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: In this study nine guideline-based interviews were conducted with residents. These were analyzed using the content-structured content analysis according to Kuckartz. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: perceptions and emotions related to the pandemic, changes and limitations due to the interventions and wishes in terms of the pandemic. The residents reported both emotional distress and not being afraid of infection and its consequences. In addition, some respondents reported unpleasant restrictions, such as wearing masks. In some cases their usefulness was critically questioned. Furthermore, various wishes of the residents in relation to the pandemic, such as leaving the nursing home, were identified. CONCLUSION: The study showed complex perceptions, changes, and wishes due to the pandemic and its interventions. Therefore, an individual approach to residents with depressive symptoms is necessary to avoid an increase in mental health problems. Against this background, there is a need for participatory implementation of health protection measures for the particularly vulnerable group of nursing home residents.","Schweighart, Roxana; Klemmt, Malte; Neuderth, Silke; Teti, Andrea",Z Gerontol Geriatr,341,16

With the rapid transmission of disease, even the off-label use of available therapies has been impeded by limited availability. Several antivirals, antimalarials, and biologics are being considered for treatment at this time. The purpose of this literature review is to synthesize the available information regarding treatment options for COVID-19 and serve as a resource for health care professionals. OBJECTIVES: This narrative review was conducted to summarize the effectiveness of current therapy options for COVID-19 and address the controversial use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). PubMed and SCOPUS were queried using a combination of the keywords ""COVID 19,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" and ""treatment."" All types of studies were evaluated including systematic reviews, case-studies, and clinical guidelines. DISCUSSION: There are currently no therapeutic drugs available that are directly active against SARS-CoV-2; however, several antivirals (remdesivir, favipiravir) and antimalarials (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine) have emerged as potential therapies. Current guidelines recommend combination treatment with hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin or chloroquine, if hydroxychloroquine is unavailable, in patients with moderate disease, although these recommendations are based on limited evidence. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma may be considered in critical patients with respiratory failure; however, access to these therapies may be limited. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antagonists may be used in patients who develop evidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Corticosteroids should be avoided unless there is evidence of refractory septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or another compelling indication for their use. ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be discontinued at this time and ibuprofen may be used for fever. CONCLUSION: There are several ongoing clinical trials that are testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments with the drugs mentioned in this review and new agents are under development. Until the results of these trials become available, we must use the best available evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, we can learn from the experiences of healthcare providers around the world to combat this pandemic.","Mehta, Nikita; Mazer-Amirshahi, Maryann; Alkindi, Nour; Pourmand, Ali",Am. j. emerg. med,341,13

The objectives of this study were to explore the experiences and emotional responses of final-year nursing students who volunteered to carry out healthcare relief tasks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify the coping strategies they adopted to deal with this situation. A qualitative study was conducted in the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used, and twenty-two students participated in semi-structured interviews, which were then content-analysed. The study is reported using the COREQ checklist. Five themes emerged in the 'Experiences and emotional response' dimension (context, patients, emotions and feelings, risk of contagion, and personal satisfaction), and three themes emerged in the 'Coping strategies' dimension strategies in the work environment, in daily life and personal life. Although the students expressed negative emotions due to the highly complex context and lack of professional experience, they evaluated the experience positively in terms of learning and usefulness.

METHODS: This is an observational study of 921 consecutive patients admitted with COVID-19 respiratory infection to Hospital General Universitario Ciudad Real from March 1 to April 30, 2020. Following data were collected including patient demographic information, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, therapeutic interventions during the hospitalization and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 78years, and 59.2% of patients had a history of hypertension. Patients with previous treatment with RAS inhibitor (42.4%) showed lower risk of the primary composite endpoint (mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation). Treatment with RAS inhibitor (both outpatient treatment and during hospitalization) had neither effect on mortality nor need for invasive ventilation. There were no differences in time-to-event analysis between groups. CONCLUSIONS: RAS inhibitor treatment prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 respiratory infection was associated with lower risk of the primary composite endpoint and did not show neither impact on mortality nor need for invasive mechanical ventilation, even if these drugs were prescribed during hospitalization.","Martínez-Del Río, Jorge; Piqueras-Flores, Jesús; Nieto-Sandoval Martín de la Sierra, Patricia; Negreira-Caamaño, Martín; Águila-Gordo, Daniel; Mateo-Gómez, Cristina; Salas-Bravo, Daniel; Rodríguez-Martínez, Marta",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),341,16

Despite similar global rates of infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic), hospitalizations and mortality are higher in men than in women. Females may be less vulnerable to viral infection due to sex-based differences in immune responses and renin-angiotensin system activity. The response and side effects of currently studied potential therapies for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, likely differ by sex. Women form the majority of the health care workforce and a uniform approach to sizing of personal protective equipment may provide differing levels of protection from viral infection to health care workers of varying shapes and sizes. Important gender differences exist in the response to public health measures to prevent and contain spread of COVID-19, as well as presentation for testing and medical care, which may inadvertently propagate viral spread. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender, as well as measures of intersectionality, are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.","Ahmed, Sofia B; Dumanski, Sandra M",Can. j. public health,341,12

There are no effective pharmacologic therapies for ARDS. Colchicine is a low-cost, widely available drug, effective in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. We studied the effects of colchicine pre-treatment on oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats. Rats were treated with colchicine (1 mg/kg) or placebo for three days prior to intravenous oleic acid-induced ALI (150 mg/kg). Four hours later they were studied and compared to a sham group. Colchicine reduced the area of histological lung injury by 61%, reduced lung edema, and markedly improved oxygenation by increasing PaO2/FiO2 from 66 ± 13 mmHg (mean ± SEM) to 246 ± 45 mmHg compared to 380 ± 18 mmHg in sham animals. Colchicine also reduced PaCO2 and respiratory acidosis. Lung neutrophil recruitment, assessed by myeloperoxidase immunostaining, was greatly increased after injury from 1.16 ± 0.19% to 8.86 ± 0.66% and significantly reduced by colchicine to 5.95 ± 1.13%. Increased lung NETosis was also reduced by therapy. Circulating leukocytosis after ALI was not reduced by colchicine therapy, but neutrophils reactivity and CD4 and CD8 cell surface expression on lymphocyte populations were restored. Colchicine reduces ALI and respiratory failure in experimental ARDS in relation with reduced lung neutrophil recruitment and reduced circulating leukocyte activation. This study supports the clinical development of colchicine for the prevention of ARDS in conditions causing ALI.","Dupuis, Jocelyn; Sirois, Martin G; Rhéaume, Eric; Nguyen, Quang T; Clavet-Lanthier, Marie-Élaine; Brand, Genevieve; Mihalache-Avram, Teodora; Théberge-Julien, Gabriel; Charpentier, Daniel; Rhainds, David; Neagoe, Paul-Eduard; Tardif, Jean-Claude",PLoS One,341,6

Our aim was to compare titanium and polyetheretherketon (PEEK) cages according to their adhesion characteristics of different bacteria species in vitro. METHODS: Plates made from PEEK, polished titanium (Ti), two-surface-titanium (TiMe) (n = 2-3) and original PEEK and porous trabecular structured titanium (TiLi) interbody cages (n = 4) were inoculated in different bacterial solutions, S.aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S.epidermidis and E.coli. Growth characteristics were analysed. Biofilms and bacteria were visualised using confocal- and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Quantitative adherence of MSSA, MRSA, S.epidermidis and E.coli to Ti, TiMe and PEEK plates were different, with polished titanium being mainly advantageous over PEEK and TiMe with significantly less counts of colony forming units (CFU) for MRSA after 56 h compared to TiMe and at 72 h compared to PEEK (p = 0.04 and p = 0.005). For MSSA, more adherent bacteria were detected on PEEK than on TiMe at 32 h (p = 0.02). For PEEK and TiLi cages, significant differences were found after 8 and 72 h for S.epidermidis (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008) and after 72 h for MSSA (p = 0.002) with higher bacterial counts on PEEK, whereas E.coli showed more CFU on TiLi than PEEK (p = 0.05). Electron microscopy demonstrated enhanced adhesion in transition areas. CONCLUSION: For S.epidermidis, MSSA and MRSA PEEK cages showed a higher adherence in terms of CFU count, whereas for E.coli PEEK seemed to be advantageous. Electron microscopic visualisation shows that bacteria did not adhere at the titanium mesh structure, but at the border zones of polished material to rougher parts.","Krätzig, Theresa; Mende, Klaus Christian; Mohme, Malte; von Kroge, Simon; Stangenberg, Martin; Dreimann, Marc; Westphal, Manfred; Weisselberg, Samira; Eicker, Sven Oliver",Eur. spine j,341,14

The objective of this study was to assess the surge capacity of the Kenyan of the Kenyan health system in terms of general hospital and ICU beds in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We assumed that 2% of the Kenyan population get symptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 based on modelled estimates for Kenya and determined the health system surge capacity for COVID-19 under three transmission curve scenarios, 6, 12, and 18 months. We estimated four measures of hospital surge capacity namely: 1) hospital bed surge capacity 2) ICU bed surge capacity 3) Hospital bed tipping point, and 5) ICU bed tipping point. We computed this nationally and for all the 47 county governments. RESULTS: The capacity of Kenyan hospitals to absorb increases in caseload due to COVID-19 is constrained by the availability of oxygen, with only 58% of hospital beds in hospitals with oxygen supply. There is substantial variation in hospital bed surge capacity across counties. For example, under the 6 months transmission scenario, the percentage of available general hospital beds that would be taken up by COVID-19 cases varied from 12% Tharaka Nithi county, to 145% in Trans Nzoia county. Kenya faces substantial gaps in ICU beds and ventilator capacity. Only 22 out of the 47 counties have at least 1 ICU unit. Kenya will need an additional 1,511 ICU beds and 1,609 ventilators (6 months transmission curve) to 374 ICU beds and 472 ventilators (18 months transmission curve) to absorb caseloads due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Significant gaps exist in Kenya's capacity for hospitals to accommodate a potential surge in caseload due to COVID-19. Alongside efforts to slow and supress the transmission of the infection, the Kenyan government will need to implement adaptive measures and additional investments to expand the hospital surge capacity for COVID-19. Additional investments will however need to be strategically prioritized to focus on strengthening essential services first, such as oxygen availability before higher cost investments such as ICU beds and ventilators.","Barasa, Edwine W; Ouma, Paul O; Okiro, Emelda A",PLoS One,341,16

For medical students interested in pursuing neurosurgery as a specialty, the educational policies surrounding COVID-19 have resulted in unique challenges. The present study used a nationwide survey to identify the concerns of medical students interested in pursuing neurosurgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Students who had previously registered for medical student neurosurgery training camps were sent an online Qualtrics survey requesting them to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic was affecting their neurosurgical education. The Pearson &#967;2 test and post hoc pairwise Fisher exact test were used for analysis of categorical variables, and the 2-tailed paired Student t test was used for continuous variables. RESULTS: The survey was distributed to 852 medical students, with 127 analyzed responses. Concerns regarding conferences and networking opportunities (63%), clinical experience (59%), and board examination scores (42%) were most frequently cited. Of the third-year medical students, 76% reported &#8805;1 cancelled or postponed neurosurgery rotation. On average, students were more likely to take 1 year off from medical school after than before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, measured from 0 to 100 (25.3 ± 36.0 vs. 39.5 ± 37.5; P = 0.004). Virtual mentorship pairing was the highest rated educational intervention suggested by first- and second-year medical students. The third- and fourth-year medical students had cited virtual surgical skills workshops most frequently. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present nationwide survey have highlighted the concerns of medical students regarding their neurosurgery education during the COVID-19 pandemic. With these findings, neurosurgery organizations can consider targeted plans for students of each year to continue their education and development.","Guadix, Sergio W; Winston, Graham M; Chae, John K; Haghdel, Arsalan; Chen, Justin; Younus, Iyan; Radwanski, Ryan; Greenfield, Jeffrey P; Pannullo, Susan C",World Neurosurg,341,1

OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy and safety of early anti-inflammatory treatment (AIT) with i.v anakinra with or without glucocorticoids (GC) in COVID19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-centre cohort study on patients admitted for COVID19 pneumonia from February 26th to April 29th, 2020 to assess the efficacy of early AIT with i.v. Anakinra (100mg every 8 hours for 3 days, with tapering) alone or in combination with GC (i.v. methylprednisolone, 1-2 mg/kg daily, with tapering). Standard of care (SOC) treatment was: hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin with or without antivirals and anticoagulants. Late rescue AIT with anakinra or tocilizumab was also evaluated. Treatment effect on Overall Survival (OS) was assessed by a Propensity Score adjusted Cox model. RESULTS: 128 patients were analyzed; 63 received early AIT (30 anakinra, 33 anakinra and CG) at admission; 65 patients (44 with SOC, 21 SOC plus late rescue AIT) did not and were used as controls. After adjusting for all the unbalanced baseline covariates, early AIT reduced the hazard of mortality by 74% (adjusted HR=0.26, p<0.001).

Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.IMPORTANCE For the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the frequent organ damage in severe COVID-19 patients. Previous studies have shown that human renal tubule cells could be the potential host cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Traditional cancer cell lines or immortalized cell lines are genetically and phenotypically different from host cells. Animal models are widely used, but often fail to reflect a physiological and pathogenic status because of species tropisms. There is an unmet need for normal human epithelial cells for disease modeling. In this study, we successfully established long term cultures of normal human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells (KPTECs) in 2D and 3D culture systems using conditional reprogramming (CR) and organoids techniques. These cells had the ability to differentiate and repair DNA damage, and showed no transforming property. Importantly, the CR KPTECs maintained lineage function with expression of specific transporters (SLC34A3 and cubilin). They also expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, cancer cell line did not express endogenous SLC34A3, cubilin and ACE2. Very interestingly, ACE2 expression was around twofold higher in 3D organoids culture compared to that in 2D CR culture condition. Pseudovirion assays demonstrated that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein was able to enter CR cells with luciferase reporter. This integrated 2D CR and 3D organoid cultures provide a physiological ex vivo model to study kidney functions, innate immune response of kidney cells to viruses, and a novel platform for drug discovery and safety evaluation.","Xia, Siyu; Wu, Ming; Chen, Si; Zhang, Tao; Ye, Lina; Liu, Jun; Li, Hui",Virol Sin,341,27

Quarantine strategies play the key role on the disease controlling and public health in the world with this pandemic of the COVID-19 defined by the World Health Organization. METHODS: In this study, a SEIRQ epidemic model was developed to explore the dynamic changes of COVID-19 in Wuhan and mainland China, from January 27, 2020 to March 5, 2020. Moreover, to investigate the effects of the quarantine strategies, two perspectives are employed from the different quarantine magnitudes and quarantine time points. RESULTS: The major results suggest that the COVID-19 variations are well captured by the epidemic model with very high accuracy in the cumulative confirmed cases, confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and cumulative death cases. The quarantine magnitudes in the susceptible individuals play larger roles on the disease control than the impacts of the quarantines of the exposed individuals and infectious individuals. For the quarantine time points, it shows that the early quarantine strategy is significantly important for the disease controlling. The time delayed quarantining will seriously increase the COVID-19 disease patients and prolongs the days of the disease extinction. CONCLUSIONS: Our model can simulate and predict the COVID-19 variations and the quarantine strategies are important for the disease controlling, especially at the early period of the disease outbreak. These conclusions provide important scientific information for the government policymaker in the disease control strategies.","Cui, Qianqian; Hu, Zengyun; Li, Yingke; Han, Junmei; Teng, Zhidong; Qian, Jing",J Infect Public Health,341,21

A viral vaccine crude harvest and a cell substrate matrix were spiked with 22 viruses. Specificity was demonstrated for all 22 viruses at the species level. Our method was capable of detecting and identifying adventitious viruses spiked at 104 genome copies per milliliter in a viral vaccine crude harvest and 0.01 viral genome copies spiked per cell in a cell substrate matrix. Moreover, 9 of the 11 NIH model viruses with published in vivo data were detected by HTS with an equivalent or better sensitivity (in a viral vaccine crude harvest). Our general-purpose HTS method is unbiased and highly sensitive for the detection of adventitious viruses, and has a large breadth of detection, which may obviate the need to perform in vivo testing.","Charlebois, Robert L; Sathiamoorthy, Sarmitha; Logvinoff, Carine; Gisonni-Lex, Lucy; Mallet, Laurent; Ng, Siemon H S",NPJ Vaccines,341,21

Although measures to control SARS-CoV-2, namely, vaccination, medication, and chemical disinfectants are being investigated, there is an increase in the demand for auxiliary antiviral approaches using natural compounds. Here we have focused on hydroxytyrosol (HT)-rich aqueous olive pulp extract (HIDROX®) and evaluated its SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activity in vitro. We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities. Thus, the HIDROX-containing cream can be applied topically as an antiviral hand cream. Our findings suggest that HIDROX contributes to improving SARS-CoV-2 control measures.","Takeda, Yohei; Jamsransuren, Dulamjav; Matsuda, Sachiko; Crea, Roberto; Ogawa, Haruko",Viruses,341,24

This has generated renewed interest regarding whether corticosteroids should be used in non-COVID ARDS as well. The objective of this study was to summarize all RCTs examining the use of corticosteroids in ARDS. METHODS: The protocol of this study was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020200659). We searched online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC library of COVID research, CINAHL, and COCHRANE. We included RCTs that compared the effect of corticosteroids to placebo or usual care in adult patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19. Three reviewers abstracted data independently and in duplicate using a pre-specified standardized form. We assessed individual study risk of bias using the revised Cochrane ROB-2 tool and rated certainty in outcomes using GRADE methodology. We pooled data using a random effects model. The main outcome for this review was 28-day-mortality. RESULTS: We included 18 RCTs enrolling 2826 patients. The use of corticosteroids probably reduced mortality in patients with ARDS of any etiology (2740 patients in 16 trials, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72-0.95, ARR 8.0%, 95% CI 2.2-12.5%, moderate certainty). Patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (over 7 days) had higher rates of survival compared to a shorter course. CONCLUSION: The use of corticosteroids probably reduces mortality in patients with ARDS. This effect was consistent between patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS, corticosteroid types, and dosage.","Chaudhuri, Dipayan; Sasaki, Kiyoka; Karkar, Aram; Sharif, Sameer; Lewis, Kimberly; Mammen, Manoj J; Alexander, Paul; Ye, Zhikang; Lozano, Luis Enrique Colunga; Munch, Marie Warrer; Perner, Anders; Du, Bin; Mbuagbaw, Lawrence; Alhazzani, Waleed; Pastores, Stephen M; Marshall, John; Lamontagne, François; Annane, Djillali; Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto; Rochwerg, Bram",Intensive Care Med,341,1

In line with the One-Health concept, extending the target of the studies to the animals which humans are continuously interacting with may favor a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 biology and pathogenetic mechanisms; thus, helping to adopt the most suitable containment measures. The last two decades have already faced severe manifestations of the coronavirus infection in both humans and animals, thus, circulating epitopes from previous outbreaks might confer partial protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the present study, we provide an in-silico survey of the major nucleocapsid protein epitopes and compare them with the homologues of taxonomically-related coronaviruses with tropism for animal species that are closely inter-related with the human beings population all over the world. Protein sequence alignment provides evidence of high sequence homology for some of the investigated proteins. Moreover, structural epitope mapping by homology modelling revealed a potential immunogenic value also for specific sequences scoring a lower identity with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins. These evidence provide a molecular structural rationale for a potential role in conferring protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying potential candidates for the development of diagnostic tools and prophylactic-oriented strategies.","Tilocca, Bruno; Soggiu, Alessio; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Musella, Vincenzo; Britti, Domenico; Bonizzi, Luigi; Urbani, Andrea; Roncada, Paola",Microbes Infect,341,13

Due to the diversity in clinical presentations of COVID-19, diagnosis by RT-PCR alone might miss patients with mild or no symptoms. Serology testing may better evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and DiaSorin).The overall seroprevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-4.0), males higher than females [4.9% (95%CI 4.6-5.2) vs. 3.1% (95%CI 2.9-3.3) respectively]. Adolescents had the highest prevalence [7.8% (95%CI 7.0-8.6)] compared to other age groups. Participants who had undergone RT-PCR testing had a tenfold higher risk to be seropositive.

As the use of medication without established effectiveness may result in adverse health consequences, the development of evidence-based guidelines is of critical importance for the clinical management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This research presents methods used to develop rapid advice guidelines on treating COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We have followed the basic approach for developing WHO rapid guidelines, including preparing, developing, disseminating and updating each process. Compared with general guidelines, this rapid advice guideline is unique in formulating the body of evidence, as the available evidence for the treatment of COVID-19 with TCM is from either indirect or observational studies, clinical first-hand data together with expert experience in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, our search of evidence not only focuses on clinical studies of treating COVID-19 with TCM but also of similar diseases, such as pneumonia and influenza. Grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methodology was adopted to rate the quality of evidence and distinguish the strength of recommendations. The overall certainty of the evidence is graded as either high, moderate, low or very low, and to give either ""strong"" or ""weak"" recommendations of each TCM therapy. The output of this paper will produce the guideline on TCM for COVID-19 and will also provide some ideas for evidence collection and synthesis in the future development of rapid guidelines for COVID-19 in TCM as well as other areas.","Liang, Ning; Li, Huizhen; Wang, Jingya; Jiao, Liwen; Ma, Yanfang; Wang, Xiaohui; Liu, Bin; Luo, Xufei; Zhao, Siya; Lv, Meng; Cao, Jin; Hu, Wenpin; Zhang, Hairong; Xiong, Yibai; Tian, Yaxin; Chen, Yaolong; Wang, Yanping; Shi, Nannan",Am J Chin Med,341,20

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, a trained research team observed the dispensary teams of 12 community pharmacies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 6 of which were operating virtual pharmacy care. A standardized data collection form was used to include information about dispensing of OTC medicines and pharmacist interventions on those with abuse/misuse potential. The clinical significance of the interventions was evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee. RESULTS: The frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with abuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 83.2% versus 91.0%, respectively, whereas the frequency of pharmacist interventions on OTC medicines with misuse potential across pharmacies with and without virtual services was 79.8% versus 41.2%, respectively. The proportions of clinically significant interventions across pharmacies with and without virtual services were 19.7% versus 10.5%, respectively. Cough medicines were dispensed significantly more across pharmacies with virtual care than across pharmacies without virtual care (25.6% vs. 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.04). Asking the patient to seek the advice of an addiction specialist (adjusted odds ratio = 4.11; P = 0.001) versus refusing to sell the drug was more likely to be associated with pharmacies with virtual services than with pharmacies operating traditional pharmacy services. CONCLUSION: Virtual pharmaceutical care is a potential approach to reduce the abuse/misuse of OTC medicines but needs some improvements regarding detection of these cases. The UAE is the first country in the region to implement and regulate virtual pharmacy practice.","Al Mazrouei, Nadia; Ibrahim, Rana M; Al Meslamani, Ahmad Z; Abdel-Qader, Derar H; Mohamed Ibrahim, Osama",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),341,20

Each subject performed 1 test with an electrostatic filter in-line with the system measuring gas exchange and air flow, and 1 test without the filter in place. Oxygen uptake and minute ventilation were highly consistent when evaluated with and without use of an electrostatic filter with a >99.9% viral efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Deployment of a commercially available in-line electrostatic viral filter during cardiopulmonary exercise testing is feasible and provides consistent data compared with testing without a filter.","Bhat, Rohan R; Schoenike, Mark W; Kowal, Alyssa; White, Casey; Rouvina, Jennifer; Hardin, Charles C; Malhotra, Rajeev; Lewis, Gregory D",J Card Fail,341,22

We found that sports activity declined whereas recreational screen time increased. However, a substantial increase in habitual physical activities leads to an overall increase in physical activity among children and adolescents in Germany. The effects differ in size but not in their direction between age groups and are stable for boys and girls. We conclude from this natural experiment that physical activity among children and adolescents is highly context-driven and mutual and does not act as a functional opposite to recreational screen time.","Schmidt, Steffen C E; Anedda, Bastian; Burchartz, Alexander; Eichsteller, Ana; Kolb, Simon; Nigg, Carina; Niessner, Claudia; Oriwol, Doris; Worth, Annette; Woll, Alexander",Sci Rep,341,16

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2), leading to high morbidity and mortality worldwide. The study reveals that infected patients exhibit distinct radiographic visual characteristics along with fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnea, etc. Chest X-Ray (CXR) is one of the important, non-invasive clinical adjuncts that play an essential role in the detection of such visual responses associated with SARS-COV-2 infection. However, the limited availability of expert radiologists to interpret the CXR images and subtle appearance of disease radiographic responses remains the biggest bottlenecks in manual diagnosis. In this study, we present an automatic COVID screening (ACoS) system that uses radiomic texture descriptors extracted from CXR images to identify the normal, suspected, and nCOVID-19 infected patients. The proposed system uses two-phase classification approach (normal vs. abnormal and nCOVID-19 vs. pneumonia) using majority vote based classifier ensemble of five benchmark supervised classification algorithms. The training-testing and validation of the ACoS system are performed using 2088 (696 normal, 696 pneumonia and 696 nCOVID-19) and 258 (86 images of each category) CXR images, respectively.

The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial. RECENT FINDINGS: There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained. SUMMARY: There is a lack of clinical evidence that administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.","Chand, Ranjeeta; Swenson, Erik R; Goldfarb, David S",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,341,16

Even in countries where healthcare systems still functioned, patients avoided visiting emergency departments (EDs) because of fears of exposure to COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on admissions of surgical patients from the ED and characteristics of urgent operations performed. METHODS: A prospective registry study comparing all patients admitted for acute surgical and trauma care between 15 March and 14 April 2020 (COVID-19) with patients admitted in the parallel time a year previously (control) was conducted. RESULTS: The combined cohort included 606 patients. There were 25% fewer admissions during the COVID-19 period (P < 0.0001). The COVID-19 cohort had a longer time interval from onset of symptoms (P < 0.001) and presented in a worse clinical condition as expressed by accelerated heart rate (P = 0.023), leukocyte count disturbances (P = 0.005), higher creatinine, and CRP levels (P < 0.001) compared with the control cohort. More COVID-19 patients required urgent surgery (P = 0.03) and length of ED stay was longer (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 epidemic, fewer patients presented to the ED requiring acute surgical care. Those who did, often did so in a delayed fashion and in worse clinical condition. More patients required urgent surgical interventions compared to the control period.

Despite significant progress since the emergence of this disease, efficacious therapeutics are still urgently required. Infection is associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms and varying disease severity. In severe cases, a multi-organ disease is apparent, involving the respiratory, coagulation, immune and cardiac systems. A central tenant of severe disease is an excessive immune response to infection leading to a cytokine storm and associated organ and tissue damage. Immunological therapies capable of attenuating the cytokine storm may therefore provide novel treatment options, and the present study explored whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the amniotic fluid (AF) and their derivatives, through their immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, and regenerative functions, could provide such an option. Next Generation Sequencing analysis of MSCs isolated from human AF identified a plethora of molecules with the potential to positively influence the prognosis in SARS-Cov-2 infection patients. These included mRNAs involved in the regulation of several immune pathways that are basis of the impaired immune response and cytokine storm caused seen in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, such as: HIF-1, IL-17, Toll-like receptors, RAP1, TNF, WNT, PI3K-Akt and NF-kappa B signalling. AF-MSCs also contained bioactive molecules involved in respiratory endothelial protection and repair, such as VEGF, IL-1, TGF-?1, EGFR, in extracellular matrix re-organization or associated with cardiac muscle cell function. Analysis of non-coding RNAs identified the presence of microRNAs that regulate macrophage polarization (towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype) and attenuate inflammation, as well as regulate the host response to viral infection. Among those, exosomal miRNAs have been also identified. Building upon these observations, further efforts will be made to elucidate the potential therapeutic use of AF-MSCs and their derivatives in combating the immune-related side effects of SARS-CoV-2. The successful incorporation of such an MSC-based therapy into the treatment regimen of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients has significant potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.","Vaiasicca, Salvatore Corradetti Bruna",The FASEB Journal,341,16

Objective: To determine the developmental outcomes of HIV-exposed (HE) infants in a low-income South African context, when compared to HIV-unexposed (HU) counterparts. Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional, group comparison study, the development of 41 HE and 40 HU infants (mean age=8.4 months, SD=2.1 months) from a low-income context was assessed. Caregivers were interviewed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3) to evaluate infants' development. Results: Most HE participants had age-appropriate overall development (90.2%;n=37). Some HE participants, however, presented with delays in domains of communication (9.8%;n=4), daily living skills (2.4%;n=1), socialisation (19.5%;n=8), and motor development (7.3%;n=3). HU participants also demonstrated some domain-specific delays, thus delays were present in both groups. No statistically significant between-group differences regarding development were found. Conclusion: Findings were reassuring and suggested that HE and HU participants had similar development.

Informed implementation of government public health policies depends on accurate data on SARS-CoV-2 immunity at population scale. We hypothesized that detection of SARS-CoV-2 salivary antibodies could serve as a non-invasive alternative to serological testing for monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity at population scale. We developed a multiplex SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassay based on Luminex technology that comprised 12 CoV antigens, mostly derived from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Saliva and sera collected from confirmed COVID-19 cases and from the pre-COVID-19 era were tested for IgG, IgA and IgM to the antigen panel. Matched saliva and serum IgG responses (n=28) were significantly correlated. The salivary anti-N IgG response resulted in highest sensitivity (100%), exhibiting a positive response in 24/24 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases sampled at >14 days post-symptom onset (DPSO), whereas the salivary anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG response yielded 100% specificity. Temporal kinetics of IgG in saliva were consistent with those observed in blood and indicated that most individuals seroconvert around 10 DPSO. Algorithms employing a combination of the IgG response to N and S antigens result in high diagnostic accuracy (100%) as early as 10 DPSO. These results support the use of saliva-based antibody testing as a non-invasive and scalable alternative to blood-based antibody testing.","Pisanic, Nora; Randad, Pranay R; Kruczynski, Kate; Manabe, Yukari C; Thomas, David L; Pekosz, Andrew; Klein, Sabra L; Betenbaugh, Michael J; Clarke, William A; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Caturegli, Patrizio P; Larman, H Benjamin; Detrick, Barbara; Fairley, Jessica K; Sherman, Amy C; Rouphael, Nadine; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Granger, Douglas A; Granger, Steve W; Collins, Matthew H; Heaney, Christopher D",J. clin. microbiol,341,16

Sources of information: Program-specific documents, pre-existing, and related to COVID-19; documents from national and international kidney agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. Methods: Challenges in the care of patients with advanced CKD during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a lead with expertise in advanced CKD who identified further nephrologists and administrators to form the workgroup. A nation-wide survey of advanced CKD clinics was conducted. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via email and a virtual meeting. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist and an infection control expert. The suggestions were presented at a CSN-sponsored interactive webinar, attended by 150 kidney health care professionals, for further peer input. The document was also sent for further feedback to experts who had participated in the initial survey. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 28, 2020. Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (CJKHD) editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. Key findings: We identified 11 broad areas of advanced CKD care management that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) clinic visit type, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) bloodwork, (5) patient education/support, (6) home-based monitoring essentials, (7) new referrals to multidisciplinary care clinic, (8) kidney replacement therapy, (9) medications, (10) personal protective equipment, and (11) COVID-19 risk in CKD. We make specific suggestions for each of these areas. Limitations: The suggestions in this paper are expert opinion, and subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. To expedite the publication of this work, a parallel review process was created that may not be as robust as standard arms’ length peer-review processes. Implications: These suggestions are intended to provide guidance for advanced CKD directors, clinicians, and administrators on how to provide the best care possible during a time of altered priorities and reduced resources.","White, Christine A.; Kappel, Joanne E.; Levin, Adeera; Moran, Sarah M.; Pandeya, Sanjay; Thanabalasingam, Susan J.",Can.

Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model. METHODS: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR). RESULTS: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to ""flatten"" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat. CONCLUSIONS: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.","Bongolan, Vena Pearl; Minoza, Jose Marie Antonio; de Castro, Romulo; Sevilleja, Jesus Emmanuel",J Med Internet Res,341,24

Significant attention has been given to developing protocols for the emergency department and critical care units, but little guidance regarding establishing airway and respiratory support for patients in the prehospital setting has been made available. While some of the recommendations can be extrapolated from hospital guidelines, other factors such as environment and available resources make these protocols unfeasible.

An analysis of impediments to completion,15.606972,2.3391488,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute complication associated with poorly managed or undiagnosed diabetes. DKA is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, but can be prevented with appropriate management of diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre is flash glucose monitoring device that measures glucose levels in the interstitial subcutaneous tissue and has been shown to reduce HbA1c, time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, as well as improve health-related quality of life. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and recurrent DKA and who initiated FreeStyle Libre (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA) was conducted. DKA frequency and severity, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and frequency of blood glucose monitoring were compared between the 2-year period before FreeStyle Libre initiation and the 2-year period after FreeStyle Libre initiation. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients with T1DM with recurrent DKA were included. FreeStyle Libre was associated with a reduction in the frequency of DKA events, with a mean of 0.2 (standard deviation [SD] 0.4) events per person during the 2 years after FreeStyle Libre initiation versus 2.9 (SD 0.9) during the 2 years before FreeStyle Libre initiation. Severity of DKA events was also reduced, with fewer severe (before mean 0.3 [SD 0.5] versus after 0.0 [SD 0.0]; p < 0.001) DKA events. A reduction in HbA1c (mean 7.4% [SD 0.5] after versus 9.9% [SD 1.2] before [p < 0.001]) and an increase in frequency of blood glucose testing (mean 8.1 scans/day [SD 1.7] after versus 2.2 finger-pricks/day [SD 0.7] at before [p < 0.001]) were also observed. CONCLUSION: FreeStyle Libre is associated with a reduction in the frequency and severity of DKA events, reduction in HbA1c, and increase in frequency of blood glucose testing in patients with T1DM and recurrent DKA. The use of such a glucose monitoring tool can help to reduce the burden of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with complications of diabetes.","Al Hayek, Ayman A; Al Dawish, Mohamed A",Adv Ther,341,24

The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions).

In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.","Malloy, Giovanni S P; Puglisi, Lisa; Brandeau, Margaret L; Harvey, Tyler D; Wang, Emily A",BMJ Open,341,6

Despite there being a common goal that should have unified resources and efforts, there have been an overwhelmingly large number of clinical trials that have been registered that are of questionable methodological quality. As the final paper of this Series, we discuss how the medical research community has responded to COVID-19. We recognise the incredible pressure that this pandemic has put on researchers, regulators, and policy makers, all of whom were doing their best to move quickly but safely in a time of tremendous uncertainty. However, the research community's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has prominently highlighted many fundamental issues that exist in clinical trial research under the current system and its incentive structures. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only re-emphasised the importance of well designed randomised clinical trials but also highlighted the need for large-scale clinical trials structured according to a master protocol in a coordinated and collaborative manner. There is also a need for structures and incentives to enable faster data sharing of anonymised datasets, and a need to provide similar opportunities to those in high-income countries for clinical trial research in low-resource regions where clinical trial research receives considerably less research funding.","Park, Jay J H; Mogg, Robin; Smith, Gerald E; Nakimuli-Mpungu, Etheldreda; Jehan, Fyezah; Rayner, Craig R; Condo, Jeanine; Decloedt, Eric H; Nachega, Jean B; Reis, Gilmar; Mills, Edward J",Lancet Glob Health,341,6

Just how practical is the ideal of ‘open borders’ and is there a trade-off between justice in immigration and the stability of a liberal political order?

The symptomatology of PICS includes decreased muscle functioning, increased muscle weakness, increased states of delirium, and increased occurrence of ICU-acquired weakness. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at high risk for developing PICS due to the debilitating nature of the disease, prolonged periods of inactivity with the use of mechanical ventilation, and muscle weakness after cessation of mechanical ventilation. With the sudden pandemic of COVID-19, research on the appropriate physical therapy protocols to provide effective care for these patients during their stay in the ICU is limited. The purpose of the study was to determine if early mobilization and rehabilitation in patients with COVID-19 can reduce PICS and length of hospital stay. Using PUBMed, Google Scholar, and other databases, a systematic review of literature was conducted and ranked using the Oxford Centre of Evidence-based Medicine. Of the literature reviewed, 73% of the articles were found to have level 2B and 27% were level 1B. Preliminary results revealed that the majority of patients adhering to early intervention and mobilization yielded improvements in the form of decreased length of hospital stay in the ICU and enhanced functional mobility upon discharge. Based on the results, we can surmise that early mobilization administered to mechanically ventilated patients may provide the same benefits to patients with COVID-19 in the form of decreased length of hospital stay and reduced likelihood of developing PICS.","Affeldt, Stacey Alcorn Phillip Duke Travis Raynes Edilberto",The FASEB Journal,341,1

The unexpected fluctuations in waste composition and quantity also require a dynamic response from policymakers. This study highlights the challenges faced by the solid waste management sector during the pandemic and the underlying opportunities to fill existing loopholes in the system. The study presents specific cases for biomedical waste, plastic waste, and food waste management - all of which have been a major cause of concern during this crisis. Further, without active citizen participation and cooperation, commingled virus-laden biomedical waste with the regular solid waste stream pose significant negative health and safety issues to sanitation workers. Single-use plastic usage is set to bounce back due to growing concerns of hygiene, particularly from products used for personal protection and healthcare purposes. It is expected that household food waste generation may reduce due to increased conscious buying of more non-perishable items during lockdown and due to concerns of food shortage. However, there is a chance of increase in food waste from the broken supply chains such as food items getting stuck on road due to restriction in vehicle movements, lack of workers in the warehouse for handling the food products, etc. The study also stresses the need for building localized resilient supply chains to counter such situations during future pandemics. While offering innovative solutions to existing waste management challenges, the study also suggests some key recommendations to the policymakers to help handle probable future pandemics if any holistically.","Sharma, Hari Bhakta; Vanapalli, Kumar Raja; Cheela, VR Shankar; Ranjan, Ved Prakash; Jaglan, Amit Kumar; Dubey, Brajesh; Goel, Sudha; Bhattacharya, Jayanta",Resour.

However, inconsistency in the nomenclature limits uniformity in its epidemiological understanding. This study provides an integration of existing classifications and describes evolutionary trends of the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India. Methods: The whole genomes of 330 SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of a total of 3014 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 different States/Union Territories (January to September 2020) from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database was performed to observe the clustering of Nextstrain and Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (Pangolin) lineages with the GISAID clades. The identification of mutational sites under selection pressure was performed using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution and Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting methods available in the Datamonkey server. Results: Temporal data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that except for Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Haryana that showed the circulation of GISAID clade O even after July 2020, the rest of the States showed a complete switch to GR/GH clades. Pangolin lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 identified within GR and GH clades, respectively, were noted to be indigenous evolutions. Sites identified to be under positive selection pressure within these clades were found to occur majorly in the non-structural proteins coded by ORF1a and ORF1b. Interpretation & conclusions: This study interpreted the geographical and temporal dominance of SARS-CoV-2 strains in India over a period of nine months based on the GISAID classification. An integration of the GISAID, Nextstrain and Pangolin classifications is also provided. The emergence of new lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 was indicative of host-specific evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in India. The hotspot mutations such as those driven by positive selection need to be further characterized.","Potdar, Varsha; Vipat, Veena; Ramdasi, Ashwini; Jadhav, Santosh; Pawar-Patil, Jayashri; Walimbe, Atul; Patil, Sucheta S; Choudhury, Manohar L; Shastri, Jayanthi; Agrawal, Sachee; Pawar, Shailesh; Lole, Kavita; Abraham, Priya; Cherian, Sarah",Indian J Med Res,341,26

Study Design. We conducted a retrospective observational study of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester, who delivered at Flushing Hospital Medical Centre (FHMC) or Jamaica Hospital Medical Centre (JHMC) between March 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The study participants were symptomatic pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 via positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR) test. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed in the neonate via a SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test, with nasopharyngeal swab samples collected on the neonates after 24 hours of birth. The exclusion criteria for this study were maternal or neonate records without SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test results, neonates not delivered at FHMC or JHMC, and foetuses with suspected foetal anomalies or incomplete medical records. Results: We identified 19 symptomatic pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19, including two women with twin pregnancies. Seven patients (36.8%) were delivered via cesarean. 12 patients (63.1%) presented in spontaneous labour, and 8 (38.1%) had preterm delivery. No maternal intensive care unit admission, maternal sepsis, or maternal mortality was observed. Twenty-one neonates were evaluated for COVID-19 after birth. SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR test results were negative in 100% of the neonates. Thirteen neonates (61.9%) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Prematurity was the most common cause of NICU admission 6 (46.1%), with a length of stay of 5.5 ± 6.4 days. No invasive mechanical ventilation, neonatal sepsis, or neonatal mortality was observed. Conclusion: In our cohort, symptomatic COVID-19 during the third trimester of pregnancy was not associated with vertical transmission to the neonate.","Moreno, Sindy C; To, Justin; Chun, Hajoon; Ngai, Ivan M",Infect Dis Obstet Gynecol,341,14

While videoconferencing software has been a tremendous resource for replicating key aspects of the face-to-face focus group environment, online approaches to data collection also face unique challenges. Prior work has offered insights on the value of face-to-face versus online focus groups and strategies for improving the online focus group experience for participants and moderators. However, little has been published on the unique needs of participants from low socio-economic status (SES) populations. In light of the digital divide and the ways in which COVID-19 has exacerbated existing inequalities, researchers must seriously reflect on the ways in which SES and online methods intersect. To address this gap, we present reflections on two online focus groups conducted with low SES African American adults during COVID-19 to offer recommendations on areas of concern and potential solutions for researchers to consider. Three areas stand out as particularly important for reflection: (1) participant privacy, (2) online connectivity, (3) support and time allocations. Greater attention to the impact of SES can help ensure improved opportunities for full and equitable participation, allowing the voices of those who have been marginalized to be heard more clearly.

In this paper, we revisit the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of adjacency matrix for embedding generation of users and items and use a two-layer neural network on top of these embeddings to learn relevance between user-item pairs. Inspired by the success of higher-order learning in GRL, we further propose an extension of this method to include two-hop neighbors for SVD through the second order of the adjacency matrix and demonstrate improved performance compared with the simple SVD method which only uses one-hop neighbors. Empirical validation on three publicly available datasets of recommendation system demonstrates that the proposed methods, despite being simple, beat many state-of-the-art methods and for two of three datasets beats all of them up to a margin of 10%. Through our research, we want to shed light on the effectiveness of matrix factorization approaches, specifically SVD, in the deep learning era and show that these methods still contribute as important baselines in recommendation systems.","Budhiraja, Amar",,341,21

Clinically significant obstruction can develop anywhere throughout the upper airway, leading to asphyxia and death; this is where recognition and treatment are essential and lifesaving. The availability of advanced computer, either hardware or software, and rapid development in numerical method have encouraged researchers to simulate the airflow characteristics and properties of HUA by using various patient conditions at different ranges of geometry and operating conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has emerged as an efficient alternative tool to understand the airflow of HUA and in preparing patients to undergo surgery. The main objective of this article is to review the literature that deals with the CFD approach and modeling in analyzing HUA. METHODS: This review article discusses the experimental and computational methods in the study of HUA. The discussion includes computational fluid dynamics approach and steps involved in the modeling used to investigate the flow characteristics of HUA. From inception to May 2020, databases of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, BioMed Central, and Web of Science have been utilized to conduct a thorough investigation of the literature. There had been no language restrictions in publication and study design of the database searches. A total of 117 articles relevant to the topic under investigation were thoroughly and critically reviewed to give a clear information about the subject. The article summarizes the review in the form of method of studying the HUA, CFD approach in HUA, and the application of CFD for predicting HUA obstacle, including the type of CFD commercial software are used in this research area. RESULTS: This review found that the human upper airway was well studied through the application of computational fluid dynamics, which had considerably enhanced the understanding of flow in HUA. In addition, it assisted in making strategic and reasonable decision regarding the adoption of treatment methods in clinical settings. The literature suggests that most studies were related to HUA simulation that considerably focused on the aspects of fluid dynamics. However, there is a literature gap in obtaining information on the effects of fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The application of FSI in HUA is still limited in the literature; as such, this could be a potential area for future researchers. Furthermore, majority of researchers present the findings of their work through the mechanism of airflow, such as that of velocity, pressure, and shear stress. This includes the use of Navier-Stokes equation via CFD to help visualize the actual mechanism of the airflow. The above-mentioned technique expresses the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in its result to demonstrate the real mechanism of the airflow. Apart from that, key result such as wall shear stress (WSS) can be revealed via turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and turbulent energy dissipation (TED), where it can be suggestive of wall injury and collapsibility tissue to the HUA.","Faizal, W M; Ghazali, N N N; Khor, C Y; Badruddin, Irfan Anjum; Zainon, M Z; Yazid, Aznijar Ahmad; Ibrahim, Norliza Binti; Razi, Roziana Mohd",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,341,16

Exposure to COVID-19 has increased the risk of numerous socio-psychological problems such as the risk of domestic violence, suicidal behavior, social stigma and discrimination, human-rights-related challenges and crime, depression, anxiety, stress, phobias, confusion, traumatic events, and other mental health problems. This article describes the socio-psychological implications pertaining to the spread of coronavirus, how it has caused numerous deaths, and how developing and developed countries alike have imposed lockdowns, curfews, and restrictions on public movement, affecting markets, workplaces, construction sites, and transport facilities, while members of society have been instructed to maintain social distance, adversely affecting their day-to-day lives. This study is based on a comprehensive review of literature, as well as data regarding the socio-psychological implications of COVID-19. The study concludes that the outbreak of COVID-19 has catastrophic socio-psychological implications, especially in developing countries, where the vulnerable in society are hit hard.

We investigated this in the UK Biobank study. METHODS: The UK Biobank study recruited 40-70-year-olds in 2006-2010 from the general population, collecting information about self-defined ethnicity and socioeconomic variables (including area-level socioeconomic deprivation and educational attainment). SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England were linked to baseline UK Biobank data. Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to assess risk ratios (RRs) between the exposures and dichotomous variables for being tested, having a positive test and testing positive in hospital. We also investigated whether ethnicity and socioeconomic position were associated with having a positive test amongst those tested. We adjusted for covariates including age, sex, social variables (including healthcare work and household size), behavioural risk factors and baseline health. RESULTS: Amongst 392,116 participants in England, 2658 had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 948 tested positive (726 in hospital) between 16 March and 3 May 2020. Black and south Asian groups were more likely to test positive (RR 3.35 (95% CI 2.48-4.53) and RR 2.42 (95% CI 1.75-3.36) respectively), with Pakistani ethnicity at highest risk within the south Asian group (RR 3.24 (95% CI 1.73-6.07)). These ethnic groups were more likely to be hospital cases compared to the white British. Adjustment for baseline health and behavioural risk factors led to little change, with only modest attenuation when accounting for socioeconomic variables. Socioeconomic deprivation and having no qualifications were consistently associated with a higher risk of confirmed infection (RR 2.19 for most deprived quartile vs least (95% CI 1.80-2.66) and RR 2.00 for no qualifications vs degree (95% CI 1.66-2.42)). CONCLUSIONS: Some minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the UK Biobank study, which was not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic conditions, baseline self-reported health or behavioural risk factors. An urgent response to addressing these elevated risks is required.","Niedzwiedz, Claire L; O039,; Donnell, Catherine A; Jani, Bhautesh Dinesh; Demou, Evangelia; Ho, Frederick K; Celis-Morales, Carlos; Nicholl, Barbara I; Mair, Frances S; Welsh, Paul; Sattar, Naveed; Pell, Jill P; Katikireddi, S Vittal",BMC Med,341,1

In terms of mechanism, targeted drugs were the most popular, accounting for 76.6%, and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) were the most common targets. In addition, there were 19 anticancer drugs from 17 companies approved in China in 2019, with 10 drugs from domestic companies. Lung cancer and breast cancer are the most common indications for both registered trials and marketed drugs. No statistically significant differences were found between 2020 and 2019 in terms of the distribution of trial sponsor, scope and stage, as well as the distribution of drug type, effect and mechanism (P>0.05). Conclusions: During the Covid-19 epidemic period, clinical trials of oncology drugs in China progress smoothly and maintain a high growth rate. Series of innovative products obtained by domestic enterprises in 2020 is the main driving force of development of oncology drug clinical trials in China.","Wu, D W; Huang, H Y; Tang, Y; Wang, H X; Wang, J; Wang, S H; Fang, H; Yang, X Y; Li, J; Wang, X; Liu, L J; Yan, Y; Wang, Q; Li, N; Cao, C; Xu, B H; Sun, Y; He, J",Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,341,6

There are many indicators that are used in the decision making for the investment in the power sector, however, predominant are the economic indicators which underestimate the depreciation of natural capital (environment) and the value added generated by the public services. Many research studies have been carried out in an attempt to demonstrate the versatility of the EF by extending its applicability not only to environmental assessment, but also to use it, among other economic indicators, when assessing sustainable investment. Sustainable investment (SI) combines fundamental analysis and engagement with an evaluation of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. The purpose of this article is, upon evaluating the EF, to identify the opportunities for the EF reduction through sustainable investment in the electricity production sector in EU countries. Environmental footprint analysis has been performed by using sustainable process index program SPIonExcel (SPI), which is one of the methods in the EF family. SPI is a useful tool for assessing ecological problems and finding sustainable solutions in the life cycle of energy production process. This research has revealed that the function of the footprint reduction depends directly on investments in renewable energy source (RES) technologies, but not all investments can be sustainable. Countries mainly invest in the development of wind energy and solar PV technologies and gradually reduce their inland production capacities from fossil fuel. Although SI in RES technologies reduces the EF, this is not enough to reduce it substantially because there are limitations for installing new power capacities. Consequently, countries tend to invest in the development of electricity networks. The conclusion can be drawn as follows: the reduction of the EF of electricity could be achieved by developing RES technologies since the major part of electricity is produced by using non-renewable resources. It is essential to develop new technologies as soon as possible in order to reduce EF as much as possible, and this can only be achieved through systematic sustainable investment.","Zonienė, Aurelija Valiulė Violeta",Energies,341,20

To understand how these mutations affect Spike antigenicity, we isolated and characterized >100 monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes on RBD, NTD, and S2 from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Approximately 45% showed neutralizing activity, of which â¼20% were NTD specific. NTD-specific antibodies formed two distinct groups: the first was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred neutralization resistance to NTD-specific antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes should be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.","Graham, Carl; Seow, Jeffrey; Huettner, Isabella; Khan, Hataf; Kouphou, Neophytos; Acors, Sam; Winstone, Helena; Pickering, Suzanne; Galao, Rui Pedro; Dupont, Liane; Lista, Maria Jose; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Laing, Adam G; Wu, Yin; Joseph, Magdalene; Muir, Luke; van Gils, Marit J; Ng, Weng M; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Zhao, Yuguang; Bowden, Thomas A; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Rosa, Annachiara; Cherepanov, Peter; McCoy, Laura E; Hayday, Adrian C; Neil, Stuart J D; Malim, Michael H; Doores, Katie J",Immunity,341,24

Our analysis identified that the overarching theme, of providing quality person-centred intimate care, requires creating and maintaining a relational space that promotes integrity.Conclusions: The provision of intimate personal care consists of a complex interplay at the level of resident/care provider interaction (micro level); health care organization (meso level); and policy (macro level). Each of these levels interacts with and influences the other two. The components identified in our model may provide the basis from which to further examine resident experiences of quality intimate personal care.","Thompson, Genevieve N; McClement, Susan E; Peters, Sheryl; Hack, Thomas F; Chochinov, Harvey; Funk, Laura",Int J Qual Stud Health Well-being,341,12

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to obtain more robust estimates of the incubation period, serial interval, frequency of presymptomatic transmission, and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 based on a large case series. METHODS: We systematically retrieved and screened 20,658 reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases released by the health authorities of China, Japan, and Singapore. In addition, 9942 publications were retrieved from PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) through April 8, 2020. To be eligible, a report had to contain individual data that allowed for accurate estimation of at least one parameter. Widely used models such as gamma distributions were fitted to the data sets and the results with the best-fitting values were presented. RESULTS: In total, 1591 cases were included for the final analysis. The mean incubation period (n=687) and mean serial interval (n=1015 pairs) were estimated to be 7.04 (SD 4.27) days and 6.49 (SD 4.90) days, respectively. In 40 cases (5.82%), the incubation period was longer than 14 days. In 32 infector-infectee pairs (3.15%), infectees' symptom onsets occurred before those of infectors. Presymptomatic transmission occurred in 129 of 296 infector-infectee pairs (43.58%). R0 was estimated to be 1.85 (95% CI 1.37-2.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides robust estimates of several epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support the current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest the need for additional measures. Presymptomatic transmission together with the asymptomatic transmission reported by previous studies highlight the importance of adequate testing, strict quarantine, and social distancing.","Ma, Shujuan; Zhang, Jiayue; Zeng, Minyan; Yun, Qingping; Guo, Wei; Zheng, Yixiang; Zhao, Shi; Wang, Maggie H; Yang, Zuyao",J Med Internet Res,341,16

SARS-CoV-2 previously accumulated mutations at a much slower rate, of 1-2 per month; the sudden appearance of a large cluster of mutations was thought to be unusual. We now suspect that VOC may have arisen from immunosuppressed individuals who shed virus for longer periods. Epidemiological analyses estimate VOC to be more infectious; this is of most concern because these estimates were calculated during periods where many regions of the UK were in high social distancing restrictions. Therefore, the previous 'tiered' system implemented in the UK was ineffective at containing VOC. The most likely reason for this is that previous restrictions, no matter how strict, still allowed for gatherings in certain places. VOC also has implications for the national vaccination programme - a higher proportion of people will need to be vaccinated with a more infectious virus. Prolongation of the second dose of vaccines to increase vaccine uptake has understandably caused concern, but is based on sound immunological principles. There is now an urgent need to monitor the effect of new variants on vaccine efficacy - marking a new chapter in the global fight against COVID-19.","Pan, Daniel; Mudalige, Nadeesha Lakmal; Sze, Shirley; Koeckerling, David; Oyefeso, Oluwatobiloba; Barker, Joseph; Williams, Caroline Ml; Tang, Julian W; Pareek, Manish",Clin Med (Lond),341,3

Combining global small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis with molecular dynamics (MD), various changes in the properties of Dioleoyl-Phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers have been determined. The solubility of quercetin in DOPC membranes is assured up to 12 mol%, whereas rutin, with additional glucose and rhamnose groups, are fully soluble only up to 6 mol%. Both flavonoids induce an increase in membrane undulations and thin the bilayers slightly (< 1 Å) in a concentration dependent manner, wherein quercetin shows a stronger effect. Concomitantly, in the order of 2-4% the adjacent bilayer distance increases with the flavonoid's concentration. Partial molecular areas of quercetin and rutin are determined to be 26 and 51 Å2, respectively. Simulated averaged areas per molecule confirm these estimates. A 60° tilted orientation of quercetin is observed with respect to the bilayer normal, whereas the flavonoid moiety of rutin is oriented more perpendicular (&#945;-angle 30°) to the membrane surface. Both flavonoid moieties are located at a depth of 12 and 16 Å for quercetin and rutin, respectively, while their anionic forms display a location closer to the polar interface. Finally, at both simulated concentrations (1.5 and 12 mol%), DOPC/rutin systems induce a stronger packing of the pure DOPC lipid bilayer, mainly due to stronger attractive electrostatic interactions in the polar lipid head region.","Sanver, Didem; Sadeghpour, Amin; Rappolt, Michael; Di Meo, Florent; Trouillas, Patrick",Langmuir,341,16

Comparison with monitoring data corroborates the capability of the probabilistic model approach to predict the expected range of spatial surface water concentrations. Explicit consideration of local pharmaceutical emissions from hospitals or private doctor's offices (e.g., for X-ray contrast agents) can improve predictions on the local scale without compromising regional exposure assessment. Pharmaceuticals exhibiting low concentrations hardly detectable with established analytical methods (e.g., EE2) can be evaluated with model simulations. Management scenarios allow for a priori assessment of risk reduction measures. In combination with targeted monitoring approaches, the GREAT-ER model can serve as valuable support tool for exposure and risk assessment of pharmaceuticals in whole watersheds.","Lämmchen, Volker; Niebaum, Gunnar; Berlekamp, Jürgen; Klasmeier, Jörg",,341,1

The objective of our study was to compare COVID-19 outcomes, including the disease manifestations, hospitalization, and death, among individuals with SCD/SCT vs Black individuals who do not have SCD/SCT. We leveraged electronic health record data from a multisite research network to identify Black patients with COVID-19 who have SCD/SCT and those who do not have SCD/SCT.

The spike (S) protein interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which plays a role in the viral entry into the cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is zoonotic, the wet animal market where live animals are sold is expected to be the source of infection. It is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

Their use in the setting of COVID-19 has been heavily debated due to potential interactions with ACE2, an enzyme that links the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory arms of the renin angiotensin system, but also the entryway by which severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades cells. ACE2 expression is altered by age, hypertension, diabetes, and the virus itself. This study integrated available information about the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its comorbidities on ACE2 into a mechanistic mathematical model and aimed to quantitatively predict effects of ACEi/ARBs on the RAAS pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. RAAS blockade prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection is predicted to increase the mas-AT1 receptor occupancy ratio up to 20-fold, indicating that in patients already taking an ACEi/ARB before infection, the anti-inflammatory arm is already elevated while the pro-inflammatory arm is suppressed. Predicted pro-inflammatory shifts in the mas-AT1 ratio due to ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 were small relative to anti-inflammatory shifts induced by ACEi/ARB. Predicted effects of changes in ACE2 expression with comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or aging on mas-AT1 occupancy ratio were also relatively small. Last, predicted changes in the angiotensin (Ang(1-7)) production rate with ACEi/ARB therapy, comorbidities, or infection were all small relative to exogenous Ang(1-7) infusion rates shown experimentally to protect against acute lung injury, suggesting that any changes in the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-mas arm may not be large enough to play a major role in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Melissa Hallow, Karen; Dave, Ishaan",Clin. pharmacol. ther,341,16

Also to categorize these changes and to quantitatively and qualitatively correlate their reflectivity levels with visual function. METHODS: We manually segmented the borders, and depicted relative intensity of the inner segment ellipsoid band, and quantified the volume of edema. RESULTS: The average relative intensity of the ellipsoid zone, ISe band, for the control subject was 14.864, our patient's, with the mild disease was, 28.238 and 34.943 in OD and OS, respectively, and for the patient with severe disease was, 44.442 and 40.154 for OD and OS respectively. Thresholding showed a significant difference in edema volume between mild disease (~20%), and severe form (~50%). Relative intensity analyses are indicative of homogeneity variability. High standard deviation value illustrates the high dispersion of data values and is a safe marker of ellipsoid zone homogeneity. CONCLUSION: Data suggested that both anatomic and functional characteristic of outer macula hyperreflective bands were notably associated with the pathogenesis cascade in the photoreceptor cells. External limiting membrane line disruption is initiated by the volume of macular edema and followed by disorganization of the three lines in a stepwise pattern, first at the ellipsoid zone, followed by the cone outer segment tips zone and finally at the External limiting membrane.","Christodoulou, Panayiotis D",Eur J Ophthalmol,341,24

There is some data suggesting that ACE-2 expression by AECs is greater in adults than children, leading many to hypothesize that airway ACE-2 expression is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and COVID-19 disease. Aim: Determine whether expression of ACE-2 and/or TMPRSS2 by bronchial AECs from children and adults is associated with SARS CoV2 replication. Methods: Primary bronchial AECs from children and adults (n=18;ages 8-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 96 hrs. following infection, RNA and protein were isolated from cultures. SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultures was assessed by PCR, and quantified as viral copy number/ng RNA. ACE-2 expression was assessed by qPCR in both SARS-CoV-2 infected AEC cultures and uninfected control cultures. In a subset of subjects (n=6), ACE-2 expression was measured in paired nasal and bronchial AEC cultures. Finally, we assessed the effect of apical treatment of AEC cultures with recombinant ACE-2 (rACE-2) prior to SARS-CoV-2 and once daily for 96rs. Results: In the primary bronchial AECs studied we observed marked between subject heterogeneity in ACE-2 expression (14-fold), TMPRSS2 expression (8-fold), and SARS-CoV-2 replication (range 167-89,040 copies/ng RNA). Baseline ACE-2 expression in uninfected AECs correlated with SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected AECs (Spearman r=0.6, p=0.02), whereas TMPRSS2 expression was not associated with viral replication (r=-0.2, p=0.5). In paired nasal and bronchial AEC cultures ACE-2 expression was strongly correlated (Pearson R2=0.66, p=0.05). Treatment of AECs with rACE-2 added apically immediately prior to infection and refreshed daily for 96 hrs. across a range of concentrations (0.1-1000 ng/mL rACE in 100μL of PBS;n=4 AEC primary lines) led to a marked reduction in SARS-CoV-2 replication (mean of 5040 viral copies/ng RNA in untreated AECs to 16 viral copies/ng RNA at 10ng/mL). Conclusion: Expression of ACE-2 by primary bronchial AECs from children and adults is heterogenous, and is associated with SARS-CoV-2 replication ex vivo.

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum D-dimer levels and tomography findings at the time of admission in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study included 94 patients, 48 women (51%) and 46 men (49%), diagnosed by PCR method. Patients without any suspicious findings on thorax tomography and having oxygen saturation above 90% at the time of presentation were included as the first group. Patients with suspicious tomography findings but having oxygen saturation above 90% were designed as the second group, and patients with both suspicious tomography findings for COVID-19 and low oxygen saturation levels (<90%) at the time of admission were taken as the third group. Patients with oxygen desaturation were significantly older than the patients with normal oxygen saturations (Pâ=â0.001). Patients with thorax tomography findings were having significantly higher D-dimer levels (Pâ=â0.001). Patients with oxygen desaturation were having significantly higher D-dimer levels than the patients with normal oxygen saturations (Pâ=â0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between oxygen saturation and D-dimer levels in all patients with and without tomography findings (râ=â-0.301, Pâ=â0.016). Similarly, there was a significant positive correlation between the oxygen saturation and the lymphocyte count (râ=â0.300, Pâ<â0.017). Thorax tomography and D-dimer levels significantly correlate in patients with suspected COVID-19 admission. It should be kept in mind that patients with low oxygen saturation and high D-dimer levels may have serious lung involvement.","Yalçin, Kadir S; Kasapoglu, Benan; Alanli, Recep; Küçükay, Murat B; Kosar, Ali",Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,341,14

The 2020-entry class was the first cohort of students to supplement their digital-based anatomy curriculum with human specimens. From a student perspective, there was trepidation regarding the change and workload addition as previous cohorts did not use this educational approach yet successfully passed their board exams, were accepted into residency programs and found quality employment. Positive reports did document that the ability to conceptualize the three-dimensional anatomy was greatly enhanced. Previous cohorts informally reported that this addition would have enhanced their learning and retention. From a faculty perspective, considerations related to COVID social-distancing requirements, lecture hall availability and encouraging student preparedness were clear challenges. A regular frustration arose as plastination hinders an instructor's ability to follow structures and reflect more muscle or bone to demonstrate deeper anatomy. UNLV SDM is awaiting re-accreditation, which was delayed due to COVID, prior to executing a curriculum reorganization. Currently, first year students have a 26-credit semester with heavy workload, even in the smaller, modular courses. This creates major constraints on the students? ability to master the content for assessments and retain the content for the NBDE board exam and clinical practice. Instructors modified structures lists, lecture topics for discussion and lab expectation continually throughout the semester to help students make the experience as meaningful as possible.

In addition, we wanted to identify gaps in the terminologies and potential new nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions for future development related to nurse roles in family care during a pandemic. METHODS: Using a consensus process, seven nurse experts created the linkages focused on families during the COVID-19 pandemic using the following steps: (1) creating an initial list of potential nursing diagnoses, (2) selecting and categorizing outcomes that aligned with all components of each nursing diagnosis selected, and (3) identifying relevant nursing interventions. FINDINGS: We identified a total of seven NANDA-I nursing diagnoses as the basis for the linkage work. These are distributed in three NANDA-I Domains and based in the psychosocial dimension of the Nursing Care in Response to Pandemics model. Eighty-nine different NOC outcomes were identified to guide care based on the nursing diagnoses, and 54 different NIC interventions were suggested as possible interventions. Fifteen new proposed concepts were identified for future development across the three classifications. CONCLUSIONS: The linkages of nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventions provide a guide to enhance nursing practice and care documentation that could quantify the impact of nursing care to patient outcomes for families at risk for or infected by COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: NANDA-I, NOC, and NIC linkages identified in this paper provide resources to support clinical decisions and guide critical thinking for nurses encountering care needs of families with COVID-19. Documentation of these linkages provides data that can create new knowledge to enhance the care of families impacted by COVID-19.","Wagner, Cheryl Marie; Swanson, Elizabeth A; Moorhead, Sue; Mantovani, Vanessa Monteiro; Dunn-Lopez, Karen; Macieira, Tamara G R; Abe, Noriko; Breitenstein, Susie",International journal of nursing knowledge (Online),341,15

In this scenario, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMW/ASSM) organized guidelines based on expert opinion to identify Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) patients, which often need palliative care (PC) due to a large symptoms burden. In our specialized COVID-19 Center, we investigated characteristics and mortality of DNR patients according to SAMW/ASSM guidelines, comparing to non-DNR patients. MethodsPilot retrospective validation study, evaluating consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Internal Medicine Department. A sub-analysis of the deceased patients care was performed, using both Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale - Palliative care (RASS-PAL) for sedation and agitation (+4/-5) and modified Borg Scale for dyspnea (1-10). Primary outcome was a 30-days survival of DNR patients comparing to non-DNR patients. Secondary outcomes reported quality of PC, especially on dyspnea and restlessness. ResultsFrom March 16 to April 1 2020, 213 consecutive patients were triaged; of 40 DNR patients 25 (64%) were males with a mean age of 79.9 years. At 30-days follow-up, 9 (22.5%) of DNR patients died; 4 patients (2.2%) died in the control group. The higher mortality rate in DNR group was further confirmed by Log-Rank Mantel-Cox (23.104, p < 0.0001). PC was applied using oxygen (100%), opioids (100%) and sedatives (89%); the mean RASS-PAL improved from 2.2 to -1.8 (p < 0.0001) and Borg scale improved from 5.7 to 4.7 (p = 0.581). ConclusionThe SAMW/ASSM guidelines identified patients at higher risk of short-term death. In the end-of-life management, an early access to PC becomes crucial, both improving patients end-of-life treatment and reducing psychological families post-traumatic disorders.","Presti, Giorgia Lo; Biggiogero, Maira; Glotta, Andrea; Biondi, Carola; Horvath, Zsofia; Leo, Rosambra; Franzetti-Pellanda, Alessandra; Saporito, Andrea; Ceruti, Samuele; Capdevila, Xavier",,341,1

This calculation is then encoded to control the motors and validated in a simulator. The feedback produced by the simulation can be used to correct the code or to implement the code can be implemented directly in the robotic agent. However, the simulation process executes instructions that are not native to the robotic agents, extending development time or making it preferable to validate the code directly on the robot, which in some cases might result in severe damage to it. The use of Domain-Specific Languages help reduce development time in simulation tasks. These languages simplify code generation by describing tasks through an easy-to-understand language and free the user to use a framework or programming API directly for testing purposes. This article presents the language PyDSLRep, which is characterized by the connection and manipulation of movement in mobile robotic agents in the V-Rep simulation environment. This language is tested in three different environments by twenty people, against the framework given by V-Rep, demonstrating that PyDSLRep reduces the average development time by 45.22%, and the lines of code by 76.40% against the Python framework of V-Rep.","Jiménez, Andrés C; Anzola, John P; García-Díaz, Vicente; González Crespo, Rubén; Zhao, Liping",PLoS One,341,24

That led to an increased clothing insulation which is negatively affecting the perceived healthcare workers' thermal sensation. OBJECTIVES: While demonstrating through software simulations the potential level of thermal discomfort healthcare workers involved in the COVID-19 emergency can be subjected to, this work aims at identifying measures to improve thermal sensation perception and acceptable thermal conditions for medical personnel. METHODS: After having obtained the insulation values of individual clothing used by staff during COVID-19 emergency through the use of a thermal well-being evaluation software, the Fanger indexes (PMV - Predicted Mean Vote and PPD - Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied) were calculated in order to estimate staff satisfaction to microclimatic conditions. RESULTS: The use of COVID-19 additional PPEs with an air temperature equal to 22 °C (normally considered optimal) brings the PMV index equal to 0.6, which corresponds to 11.8 % being unsatisfied (PPD) due to perceived heat. DISCUSSION: The use of additional protective devices significantly increases the clothing insulation level, facilitating the onset of conditions of thermal discomfort in the health workers. Workers engaged in the execution of nasopharyngeal swabs were most affected by the summer weather conditions and certainly represent the most critical category, for which it would be recommended to implement a higher turnover of service to reduce individual exposure time and consequent discomfort.","Lembo, Marco; Vedetta, Carmela; Moscato, Umberto; Del Gaudio, Michele",Med Lav,341,33

DESIGN: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources. SETTING: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24·6 (sd 2·0) years, 70·2 % female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a stay-at-home order in Minnesota. RESULTS: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28·4 %. Among food-insecure respondents, 41·0 % reported both eating less and experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month. Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order. Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19.

(preprint),15.722219,2.182888,2021,"BACKGROUND: As vaccines for the coronavirus become available, it will be important to know the rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS), given that vaccination will be a key strategy for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Using a national sample of adults with MS in the United States obtained early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the current study aimed to: (1) assess willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine when available; (2) determine demographic, MS, and psychosocial correlates of vaccine willingness; and (3) measure where people with MS get their COVID-19 information and their perceived trustworthiness of such sources, which may influence COVID-19 vaccine willingness. METHODS: Adults with MS (N = 486) living in the United States completed a cross-sectional online survey (between 10 April 2020 and 06 May 2020) about their willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccination once available. Participants also completed measures to describe the sample and to assess factors potentially related to vaccine willingness, including demographics, MS-specific variables, psychological measures, COVID-19 information sources, and perceived trustworthiness of their information sources. RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds of the participants (66.0%) reported a willingness to obtain a future COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 15.4%of the sample was unwilling. Greater willingness to receive the vaccine was associated with having a higher level of education and holding a higher perception of one's risk of catching COVID-19. Participants reported accessing COVID-19 information from many different sources. Approximately a third (31.6%) of the sample reported getting their information from healthcare providers. Healthcare providers and the National MS Society had the highest perceived trustworthiness for COVID-19 information. The perceived trustworthiness of information sources was highly associated with vaccine willingness. CONCLUSION: Early in the pandemic, willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine was not universal in this large sample or people living with MS. Vaccine willingness was associated with a few variables including education level, perceived risk for COVID-19 infection, and trust in COVID-19 information sources. These results have important implications for guiding healthcare providers and the MS community as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available.","Ehde, Dawn M; Roberts, Michelle K; Herring, Tracy E; Alschuler, Kevin N",Mult Scler Relat Disord,341,16

The pathogen responsible for the COVID-19 has been found to be coronavirus (2019-nCoV) with human transmission through droplets, airway secretions, and even direct contact with host. Currently multiple drugs and their combinations are being tried for the treatment of the COVID-19 disease, but none approved. In absence of definitive and approved treatment, it is imperative that prevention of COVID-19 infection is of utmost importance. For the same, face masks, hand hygiene, isolation, and quarantine are being practiced all over the world. However much successful these methods be, they cannot be used for a very long time. Thus, it becomes necessary that a vaccine be developed for the disease so that the further spread could be halted. Some reports suggest the use of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine as the prophylaxis for coronavirus. BCG vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, used for prophylaxis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is present in the essential list of the World Health Organization as well as immunization programs of many countries. Immunostimulatory antiviral effects of BCG vaccine are well known. At present, there are no published evidence available to support the use of BCG vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus infection. However, there have been speculations on enhanced immunity with BCG vaccine, which might be useful in prevention of coronavirus infection. Results from the clinical studies of BCG vaccine in vulnerable population are required to confirm this hypothesis.","Maheshwari, Nidhi; Jain, Ayush",Viral immunol,341,1

These psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with COVID-19) and patients with COVID-19 (who are waiting for death). These psychological problems adversely affect immune functions causing more increase in the severity of COVID-19 associated disorders and death rates. Increasing the aerobic capacity is one of the effective methods that could be used to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Amro, M; Mohamed, A; Alawna, M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,341,22

There is an emergent need to search for possible medications. OBJECTIVE: This article intends to use virtual screening and molecular docking methods to find potential inhibitors that can respond to COVID-19 from existing drugs. METHODS: To tack part in the current research investigation to define a potential target drug that may protect the world from emerged pandemic corona disease, we have carried out a virtual screening study by of 129 approved drugs that their metabolic characteristics, dosages used, potential efficacy and side effects are clear as they have been approved for treating existing infections. Especially 12 drugs against chronic hepatitis B virus, 37 against chronic hepatitis C virus, 37 against human immunodeficiency virus, 14 anti-herpesvirus, 11 anti- influenza, and 18 others drugs currently on the market were considered for this study. Then these drugs were evaluated using virtual screening and molecular docking studies in the active site of the (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (6lu7). Once the efficacy of the drug is determined, it can be approved for of their in vitro and in vivo activity against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that could be interesting for rapid clinical treatment of patients. These drugs were ranked for potential effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and those with high molecular docking scores are proposed as novel candidates for repurposing. The N3 inhibitor co-crystallized with the protease (6lu7) and the anti-HIV protease inhibitor Lopinavir were used as standards for comparison. RESULTS: The results suggest the effectiveness of Beclabuvir, Nilotinib, Tirilazad, Trametinib and Glecaprevir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its main protease. CONCLUSION: These promising drugs could inhibit the replication of the virus; hence, we suggest the repurposing of these compounds for thetreatment of COVID-19. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA. However, the assessment of these potential inhibitors as clinical drugs involves further in vivo tests for these drugs.","Chtita, Samir; Belhassan, Assia; Aouidate, Adnane; Belaidi, Salah; Bouachrine, Mohammed; Lakhlifi, Tahar",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),341,1

However, this new work pattern could also affect the well-being of workers. Therefore, the aim of the study was to study the magnitude of occupational health problems and lifestyle changes among workers who have only recently started working from home. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using online self-administered questionnaires during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the Bangkok metropolitan area, Thailand. The participants were from any organization that allowed working from home. The demographic data including the analysis of the characteristics of working from home, the occurrence of occupational health problems, and the lifestyle changes caused by working from home were analyzed. Results: A total of 869 workers were included as study participants. The highest prevalence of physical health problems among all workers was identified to be weight gain at a rate of 40.97% (95% confidence interval = 37.69-44.24), and the highest prevalence of psychosocial problems was identified to be cabin fever at a rate of 31.28% (95% confidence interval = 26.66-35.90%) among full-time working-from-home workers. The health effects that were significantly related to the intensity of working from home (p for trends <0.05), either positively or negatively, included body weight changes, ergonomic problems, indoor environmental problems, and psychosocial problems.

The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on fitness indices in adolescents. We observed high school adolescents (33% girls;aged 15–17 years) divided into two cohorts. The first cohort (control;n = 48) included adolescents who were in school during the 2018/2019 year, while the second cohort (lockdown;n = 66) was observed during the school year 2019/2020 when COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed. Variables included body height, body mass, BMI, sit-ups, and the 600 m dash. Both cohorts were tested at the beginning and at the end of the observed school years. A factorial analysis of variance for repeated measurements evidenced an improvement in sit-ups and the 600 m dash in the control, and a decrease of the same capacities in the lockdown cohort. In the lockdown cohort, a decrease in muscular fitness was more evident in boys than in girls. No differential changes between cohorts were evidenced in anthropometrics. Results suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown negatively influenced muscular fitness status in adolescents, especially in boys.","Sunda, Mirela Gilic Barbara Peric Ivan Jurcev Savicevic Anamarija Sekulic Damir",Healthcare,341,12

Whereas it appears that social distancing is an effective strategy for mitigating spread, it may also result in a variety of unintended negative consequences to individuals' psychological well-being and mental health. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the present study examined associations among some demographic variables (gender, age, marital and working statuses, and having a family member or a friend infected with COVID-19), acceptance of social distancing, mood changes, and quality of life (QoL) in Qatar, a high-income Middle Eastern Arabic-speaking country. Older, married, and working participants were more accepting of social distancing than younger, unmarried, and non-working participants, respectively. Participants indicated that, during this time, they became more distressed, upset, scared, irritable, nervous, and afraid, and less inspired and determined. In a stark contrast, more individuals indicated that they became more interested, alert, and attentive, whereas higher percentages of participants reported feeling less guilty, hostile, and ashamed. Social distancing correlated positively with negative affect, whereas social avoidances correlated positively with positive affect and with physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL. Finally, positive affect correlated positively, and negative affect correlated negatively, with these four domains of QoL. These results highlight the need for public health and clinical providers to consider peoples' psychological well-being and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Megreya, Ahmed M; Latzman, Robert D; Al-Ahmadi, Aisha M; Al-Dosari, Nasser F",Int J Ment Health Addict,341,1

Subsequent inflammation can promote rapid virus clearance, but severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by an inefficient immune response that fails to clear the infection. Using primary epithelial organoids from human colon, we explored how the central antiviral mediator IFN-Î³, which is elevated in COVID-19, affects epithelial cell differentiation, ACE2 expression, and susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2. In mouse and human colon, ACE2 is mainly expressed by surface enterocytes. Inducing enterocyte differentiation in organoid culture resulted in increased ACE2 production. IFN-Î³ treatment promoted differentiation into mature KRT20+ enterocytes expressing high levels of ACE2, increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and resulted in enhanced virus production in infected cells. Similarly, infection-induced epithelial interferon signaling promoted enterocyte maturation and enhanced ACE2 expression. We here reveal a mechanism by which IFN-Î³-driven inflammatory responses induce a vulnerable epithelial state with robust replication of SARS-CoV-2, which may have an impact on disease outcome and virus transmission.","Heuberger, Julian; Trimpert, Jakob; Vladimirova, Daria; Goosmann, Christian; Lin, Manqiang; Schmuck, Rosa; Mollenkopf, Hans-Joachim; Brinkmann, Volker; Tacke, Frank; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Sigal, Michael",EMBO Mol Med,341,30

Sero-surveillance among HCWs using IgG antibodies can add further value to the scientific findings. Objectives: To estimate seropositivity among HCWs and to correlate it with various factors affecting seropositivity. Methods: Population based large scale sero-surveillance among HCWs was carried out during second half of August'20 in Ahmedabad using ""Covid-Kavach"" IgG Antibody Detection ELISA kits. Seropositivity among HCWs was estimated and compared with various demographic & other factors to understand their infection & immunity status. Proportions and Z-test were used as appropriate. Results: As on August'20, Seropositivity among HCWs from Ahmedabad is 23.65% (95% Confidence Interval 21.70-25.73%). Seropositivity of 25.98% (95%CI 23.47-28.66) among female HCWs is significantly higher than 19.48% (95%CI 16.53-22.80) among male HCWs. The zone wise positivity among HCWs closely correlate with cases reported from the respective zone. The sero-positivity among HCWs from the earliest and worst affected zones have lower level of seropositivity as compared to the zones affected recently. This might be pointing towards the fact that the IgG Antibodies may not be long lasting. Conclusion: As on August 2020, the seropositivity of 23.65% in HCWs indicate high level of disease transmission and higher risk of infection among HCWs in Ahmedabad. The seropositivity is significantly higher among female HCWs. Zone wise seropositivity, closely correlate with the reported cases from the respective zone. Their comparison also indicates the possibility of reducing IgG seropositivity, which necessitates further in-depth scientific research to generate greater scientific evidences.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay; Makwana, Govind; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal; Shukla, Aparajita; Pethani, Jayshri; Tiwari, Hemant",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,341,32

This work aims to survey commonly available mask materials to provide an overview of potential exposure. A total of 19 mask materials were analyzed using a nontargeted analysis two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC)-mass spectrometric (MS) workflow. Traditionally, there has been a lack of GCxGC-MS automated high-throughput screening methods, resulting in trade-offs with throughput and thoroughness. This work addresses the gap by introducing new machine learning software tools for high-throughput screening (Floodlight) and subsequent pattern analysis (Searchlight). A recursive workflow for chemical prioritization suitable for both manual curation and machine learning is introduced as a means of controlling the level of effort and equalizing sample loading while retaining key chemical signatures. Manual curation and machine learning were comparable with the mask materials clustering into three groups. The majority of the chemical signatures could be characterized by chemical class in seven categories: organophosphorus, long chain amides, polyethylene terephthalate oligomers, n-alkanes, olefins, branched alkanes and long-chain organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. The olefin, branched alkane, and organophosphorus components were primary contributors to clustering, with the other chemical classes having a significant degree of heterogeneity within the three clusters. Machine learning provided a means of rapidly extracting the key signatures of interest in agreement with the more traditional time-consuming and tedious manual curation process. Some identified signatures associated with plastics and flame retardants are potential toxins, warranting future study to understand the mask exposure route and potential health effects.","Favela, Kristin A; Hartnett, Michael J; Janssen, Jake A; Vickers, David W; Schaub, Andrew J; Spidle, Heath A; Pickens, Keith S",J.

However, the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma has been questioned by some people, because of one ancient proverb. To explore the rationality of the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, this study systematically examined the ancient and modern physicians' understanding of the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma, and collated the application and dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient prescriptions and modern clinics based on literature analysis. As a result, we found that ancient and modern physicians have different understanding on the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma and that the theory about the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma is flawed. We also found that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient and modern clinical applications was not constrained by ancient experience. Physicians usually increase the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in clinical therapy according to the actual conditions, and there were no adverse reactions. Additionally, according to laws and regulations concerning medical affairs, physician could increase or decrease the dosage of the drug under special circumstances. Based on the analysis of safety and effectiveness of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, we conclude that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction is safe, effective and reasonable.","Qin, Zi-Nan; Wang, Meng-Xin; Shi, Nan-Nan; Wang, Yan-Ping; Zhai, Hua-Qiang",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,341,1

This is particularly true for PEGylation of proteins, because characterization of PEGylation reactions and products can often be difficult because of the relatively small impact on protein structure, the lack of an accessible PEG chromophore, and the heterogeneous final product mixtures. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy is one potential solution because of its relatively high sensitivity to small changes in protein structure and its suitability for online or at-line measurements. Here we use PEGylation of lysosome as a model system to determine the efficacy of polarized Excitation Emission Matrix (pEEM) spectroscopy as a rapid tool for characterizing the structural variability of the lysozyme starting materials and PEGylated products with PEG to protein ratio (PPR). Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed that as PPR increased from 0 to 2.8, the hydrodynamic radius increased from ~2.2 to 4.8 nm. pEEM measurements provided several sources of information: Rayleigh scatter identified size changes and aggregate/particle formation, and fluorescence emission to assessed chemical and structural change. PEGylation induced sufficient physicochemical changes in lysozyme which produced changes in the pEEM spectra largely due to changes in hydrophobic environment for tryptophan residues close to a PEG attachment site. These significant spectral changes when modelled using conventional multivariate analysis methods were able to easily discriminate the raw product solutions according to degree of PEGylation and were also able to predict PPR with reasonable accuracy (RMSEC ~10%, REP<20%) considering the reference Size Exclusion Chromatography method error of ~7.2%. Variable selection of the pEEM data, suggest that equivalent predictions could be made with faster and simpler 2D spectra making the method a more viable online measurement method.

Despite its similarity to related coronaviruses, there are currently no specific treatments for COVID-19 infection, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop therapies for this and future coronavirus outbreaks. Formation of the cap at the 5' end of viral RNA has been shown to help coronaviruses evade host defenses. Nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is responsible for N7-methylation of the cap guanosine in coronaviruses. This enzyme is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is a bifunctional protein with both N7-methyltransferase and 3'-5' exonuclease activities that distinguish nsp14 from its human equivalent. Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV nsp14 highlighted its role in viral replication and translation efficiency of the viral genome. In this paper, we describe the characterization and development of a high-throughput assay for nsp14 utilizing RapidFire technology. The assay has been used to screen a library of 1771 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. From this, we have validated nitazoxanide as a selective inhibitor of the methyltransferase activity of nsp14. Although modestly active, this compound could serve as a starting point for further optimization.","Pearson, Lesley-Anne; Green, Charlotte J; Lin, De; Petit, Alain-Pierre; Gray, David W; Cowling, Victoria H; Fordyce, Euan A F",SLAS Discov,341,9

Particularly, coronaviruses are mentioned among the viruses implicated in autoimmunity. Today, the world's greatest threat derives from the pandemic of a new human coronavirus, called ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the responsible agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China in December 2019 and, to date, has spread to at least 187 countries. This review focuses on autoimmune manifestations described during COVID-19, including pro-thrombothic state associated to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), acute interstitial pneumonia, macrophage activation syndrome, lymphocytopenia, systemic vasculitis, and autoimmune skin lesions. This offers the opportunity to highlight the pathogenetic mechanisms common to COVID19 and several autoimmune diseases, in order to identify new therapeutic targets. In a supposed preliminary pathogenetic model, SARS-CoV-2 plays a direct role in triggering widespread microthrombosis and microvascular inflammation, because it is able to induce transient aPL, endothelial damage and complement activation at the same time. Hence, endothelium might represent the common pathway in which autoimmunity and infection converge. In addition, autoimmune phenomena in COVID-19 can be explained by regulatory T cells impairment and cytokines cascade.","Fatone, Maria Celeste",Current rheumatology reviews (Online),341,13

These connected-health technologies enable monitoring of patients and facilitate remote clinical trial research while reducing the potential for the spread of the novel coronavirus. There is a growing requirement for monitoring of the full 24 h spectrum of behaviours with a single research-grade sensor. This research describes a free-living and supervised protocol comparison study of the Verisense inertial measurement unit to assess physical activity and sleep parameters and compares it with the Actiwatch 2 actigraph. Fifteen adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 4 females, 29 ± 12.6 years) wore both monitors for 2 consecutive days and nights in the free-living study while twelve adults (11 males, 23.4 ± 3.4 years and 1 female, 22 ± 0 years) wore both monitors for the duration of a gym-based supervised protocol study. Agreement of physical activity epoch-by-epoch data with activity classification of sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous activity and sleep metrics were evaluated using Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. For all activity, Verisense showed high agreement for both free-living and supervised protocol of r = 0.85 and r = 0.78, respectively. For physical activity classification, Verisense showed high agreement of sedentary activity of r = 0.72 for free-living but low agreement of r = 0.36 for supervised protocol; low agreement of light activity of r = 0.42 for free-living and negligible agreement of r = -0.04 for supervised protocol; and moderate agreement of moderate-to-vigorous activity of r = 0.52 for free-living with low agreement of r = 0.49 for supervised protocol. For sleep metrics, Verisense showed moderate agreement for sleep time and total sleep time of r = 0.66 and 0.54, respectively, but demonstrated high agreement for determination of wake time of r = 0.83. Overall, our results showed moderate-high agreement of Verisense with Actiwatch 2 for assessing epoch-by-epoch physical activity and sleep, but a lack of agreement for activity classifications. Future validation work of Verisense for activity cut-point potentially holds promise for 24 h continuous remote patient monitoring.","McDevitt, Bríd; Moore, Lisa; Akhtar, Nishat; Connolly, James; Doherty, Rónán; Scott, William",Sensors (Basel),341,30

Comparing AIS data from February 2019 and from February 2020, it is found that the merchant ship count and utilization frequency are reduced during the epidemic period. The epidemic could result in longer ship turnaround times because of more operation time for berthing and anchoring activities. Ship emission comparison results reveal that the cargo ship emissions are significantly reduced while container ships and tankers produce a slightly decreased emissions resulting by strict COVID-19 quarantine measures. In addition, the unit ship emission intensity is greatly reduced for ships which are under the normal cruising status while berthing and anchoring operations are associated with increased ship emissions. This implies that it is urgent to promote the use of shore power equipment for merchant ships during the epidemic period.","Shi, Kun; Weng, Jinxian",Sci Total Environ,341,1

ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, together with implications for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.","Gheblawi, Mahmoud; Wang, Kaiming; Viveiros, Anissa; Nguyen, Quynh; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Turner, Anthony J; Raizada, Mohan K; Grant, Maria B; Oudit, Gavin Y",Circ Res,341,6

This qualitative study explored the perspectives and experiences of the family nurse practitioner faculty and the family nurse practitioner nursing students who participated in FL. The type and level of FL practices faculty can apply to support students coming to class prepared to engage in active learning activities was also investigated. The study used an insider action research design. There were two arms of the study, faculty and student. Ten faculty-led learning circles with four faculty and three family nurse practitioner student focus groups, each with six students, were held over the course of the study. Thematic findings were developed from both student and faculty data. The results revealed that family nurse practitioner students had a positive attitude toward FL. Many expressed FL provided perceptions of gained confidence, personalized learning, increased engagement, and preparedness for classroom instruction. Overall, faculty preferred FL over traditional teaching approaches. Several active learning activities were used by faculty with clinical case studies being the most preferred by student participants. This study confirms FL is a plausible and promising approach to traditional classroom instruction.

However, the imposed safety measures allowed to flatten the epidemic curve and hence to ease the restrictions and inaugurate, on the 4th of May 2020, the Italian phase (P) 2 of the pandemic. The present survey study, endorsed by CODRAL and AIRO-L, aimed to assess how radiotherapy (RT) departments in Lombardy have dealt with the recovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire dealing with the management of pandemic was developed online and sent to all CODRAL Directors on the 10th of June 2020. Answers were collected in full anonymity one week after. RESULTS: All the 33 contacted RT facilities (100%) responded to the survey. Despite the scale of the pandemic, during P1 14 (42.4%) centres managed to safely continue the activity (&#8804; 10% reduction). During P2, 10 (30.3%) centres fully recovered and 14 (42.4%) reported an increase. Nonetheless, 6 (18.2%) declared no changes and, interestingly, 3 (9.1%) reduced activities. Overall, 21 centres (63.6%) reported suspected or positive cases within healthcare workforce since the beginning of the pandemic. Staff units were quarantined in 19 (57.6%) and 6 (18.2%) centres throughout P1 and P2, respectively.

The aim of this research was to use a viral cell cycle model of SARS-CoV-2 to explore the potential impact drugs, or combinations of drugs, that act at different stages in the viral life cycle might have on various metrics of infection outcome relevant in the early stages of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Using a target-cell limited model structure that has been used to characterize viral load dynamics from COVID-19 patients, we performed simulations to inform on the combinations of therapeutics targeting specific rate constants. The endpoints and metrics included viral load area under the curve (AUC), duration of viral shedding and epithelial cells infected. Based on the known kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, we rank ordered potential targeted approaches involving repurposed, low-potency agents. RESULTS: Our simulations suggest that targeting multiple points central to viral replication within infected host cells or release from those cells is a viable strategy for reducing both viral load and host cell infection. In addition, we observed that the time-window opportunity for a therapeutic intervention to effect duration of viral shedding exceeds the effect on sparing epithelial cells from infection or impact on viral load AUC. Furthermore, the impact on reduction on duration of shedding may extend further in patients who exhibit a prolonged shedder phenotype.

In early 2021, a quarter of people in England who believed they could work entirely from home reported attending their workplace. To inform interventions to reduce this, this study examined associated factors. STUDY DESIGN: Data from the ongoing COVID-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses survey series of nationally representative samples of people in the UK aged 16+ years in January-February 2021 were used. METHODS: The study sample was 1422 respondents who reported that they could work completely from home. The outcome measure was self-reported workplace attendance at least once during the preceding week. Factors of interest were analysed in three blocks: 1) sociodemographic variables, 2) variables relating to respondents' circumstances and 3) psychological variables. RESULTS: 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 24.5%-29.1%) of respondents reported having attended their workplace at least once in the preceding week. Sociodemographic variables and living circumstances significantly independently predicted non-essential workplace attendance: male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.33-2.58); dependent children in the household (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.17-2.32); financial hardship (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08-1.21); lower socio-economic grade (C2DE; OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.19-2.53); working in sectors such as health or social care (OR = 4.18, 95% CI = 2.56-6.81), education and childcare (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.45-4.14) and key public service (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.83-7.81) and having been vaccinated (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.33-3.24).

We aimed to examine prefecture-level spatial heterogeneity and clustering of the associations of economic and health care factors with infant mortality rates (IMR) in China. IMR data in 348 prefectures were calculated and adjusted, and economic and health care data were collected in each prefecture in China, 2010. Stepwise regression was used to select important variables, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to examine the spatial variations of the relationships between economic and health care factors and IMR. The k-means clustering was developed to elucidate the spatial clustering patterns of the GWR coefficients. The results showed that three important variables were selected in the multivariable regression model, including per capita income of rural residents, Engel's coefficient of rural residents, and proportion of government health expenditure. The GWR with these three variables revealed spatial heterogeneity of the associations between IMR and economic and health care factors; western China generally had higher GWR R-squares and stronger associations between IMR and all the three variables than the middle-eastern part of China. Based on the GWR coefficients, three distinct spatial clusters were identified.

Studies show that profound cytokine release and excessive activation of blood coagulation appear to be key drivers of COVID-19 associated mortality. Since limited in vitro methods exist for assessing the effects of anticoagulants on hemostasis, the development of novel therapies to safely prevent thrombosis in COVID-19 patients relies on preclinical animal models and early phase human trials. Herein we present the design of a microfluidic ""bleeding chip"" to evaluate the effects of antithrombotic therapies on hemostatic plug formation in vitro. Methods: The design of the microfluidic device consists of two orthogonal channels: an inlet that serves as a model blood vessel, and a bleeding channel to model hemostatic plug formation at sites of compromised endothelial barrier function. This is achieved by placing a series of 3 pillars spaced 10 µm apart at the intersection of the two channels. The pillars and bleeding channel are coated with the extracellular matrix protein collagen. Results: Perfusion of human whole blood through the microfluidic bleeding chip led to initial platelet adhesion and aggregation at the pillars followed by hemostatic plug formation and occlusion of the bleeding channel. Conclusions: Safe and effective mitigating agents are needed for treatment and prevention of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients. This simple microfluidic device holds potential to be developed into a tool for assessing the effects of anticoagulant therapy on hemostasis.","Lakshmanan, Hari Hara Sudhan; Pore, Adity A; Kohs, Tia C L; Yazar, Feyza; Thompson, Rachel M; Jurney, Patrick L; Maddala, Jeevan; Olson, Sven R; Shatzel, Joseph J; Vanapalli, Siva A; McCarty, Owen J T",Cell Mol Bioeng,341,26

The aim is to analyse these concepts to provide a framework in which mutual influences are ontologically analysed; more specifically this article will explore whether health promotion should improve health literacy or health literacy is actually a pre-requisite for understanding (and put into practice) health promotion/public health messages. Public health must protect the public from misinformation and on this nurses and other health care providers play a crucial role in supporting individuals and communities in the comprehension of public health messages. The paradox under analysis is the link between health literacy and health promotion; what the role of health literacy is when, as in the case of the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Public Health must address tens of hundreds of health promotion messages to the whole population. During the outbreak, there was an underlying uncertainty, every day new data and information emerged and every day something more was understood (or misunderstood) about the virus. There was a massive presence of COVID-19 misinformation, particularly on social media in terms of, among others, treatments, the utility of wearing mask, COVID-19 cases by age group, conspiracy theories, all added more confusion and uncertainty to the public. Public health must protect the public from misinfromation.

Moreover, the importance of advanced imaging in these patients has not been comprehensively assessed. Purpose To estimate the frequency of radiographically occult hip fracture in elderly patients, to define the higher-risk subpopulation, and to determine the diagnostic performance of CT and bone scanning in the detection of occult fractures by using MRI as the reference standard. Materials and Methods A literature search was performed to identify English-language observational studies published from inception to September 27, 2018. Studies were included if patients were clinically suspected to have hip fracture but there was no radiographic evidence of surgical hip fracture (including absence of any definite fracture or only presence of isolated greater trochanter [GT] fracture). The rate of surgical hip fracture was reported in each study in which MRI was used as the reference standard. The pooled rate of occult fracture, diagnostic performance of CT and bone scanning, and strength of evidence (SOE) were assessed. Results Thirty-five studies were identified (2992 patients; mean age, 76.8 years ± 6.0 [standard deviation]; 66% female). The frequency of radiographically occult surgical hip fracture was 39% (1110 of 2835 patients; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 35%, 43%) in studies of patients with no definite radiographic fracture and 92% (134 of 157 patients; 95% CI: 83%, 98%) in studies of patients with radiographic evidence of isolated GT fracture (moderate SOE). The frequency of occult fracture was higher in patients aged at least 80 years (44%, 529 of 1184), those with an equivocal radiographic report (58%, 71 of 126), and those with a history of trauma (41%, 977 of 2370) (moderate SOE). CT and bone scanning yielded comparable diagnostic performance in the detection of radiographically occult hip fracture (P = .67), with a sensitivity of 79% and 87%, respectively (low SOE). Conclusion Elderly patients with acute hip pain and negative or equivocal findings at initial radiography have a high frequency of occult hip fractures. Therefore, the performance of advanced imaging (preferably MRI) may be clinically appropriate in all such patients. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Haj-Mirzaian, Arya; Eng, John; Khorasani, Ramin; Raja, Ali S; Levin, Adam S; Smith, Stacy E; Johnson, Pamela T; Demehri, Shadpour",Radiology,341,16

Anisodamine hydrobromide injection (AHI), the main ingredient of which is anisodamine, is a listed drug for improving microcirculation in China. Anisodamine can improve the condition of patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Protein-protein interactions obtained from the String databases were used to construct the protein interaction network (PIN) of AHI using Cytoscape. The crucial targets of AHI PIN were screened by calculating three topological parameters. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The intersection between the AHI component proteins and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) coexpression proteins was analyzed. We further investigated our predictions of crucial targets by performing molecular docking studies with anisodamine. Results: The PIN of AHI, including 172 nodes and 1454 interactions, was constructed. A total of 54 crucial targets were obtained based on topological feature calculations. The results of Gene Ontology showed that AHI could regulate cell death, cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, and immune system processes. KEGG disease pathways were mainly enriched in viral infections, cancer, and immune system diseases. Between AHI targets and ACE2 coexpression proteins, 26 common proteins were obtained. The results of molecular docking showed that anisodamine bound well to all the crucial targets. Conclusion: The network pharmacological strategy integrated molecular docking to explore the mechanism of action of AHI against COVID-19. It provides protein targets associated with COVID-19 that may be further tested as therapeutic targets of anisodamine.","Su, Jinsong; Liu, Zixuan; Liu, Chuan; Li, Xuanhao; Wang, Yi; Zhao, Jing; Wu, Qingjiang; Zheng, Shichao; Zhang, Yi",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,341,26

This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 on blood transfusion therapy (BTT) of thalassemia patients and suggest ways to ensure safe and reliable blood supplies amid such health crises. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2019 (before COVID-19) to July 2020 (during COVID-19) based on the data provided by a thalassemia center, named Help International Welfare Trust, Karachi, Pakistan. SPSS version 24.0 was used for the data analysis. Data were described in the form of means and percentages. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the consumption of PRBCs bags after the emergence of COVID-19 (P=0.002). Moreover, the number of thalassemia patients receiving BTT was dropped by 10.56% during the pandemic. There was a strong negative correlation observed between the rising cases of COVID-19 in Pakistan and the number of patients missing their therapy sessions (r=-0.914, P=0.030). A considerable decline in the reserves of all Rhesus-negative blood groups amid the COVID-19 outbreak was also observed. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the already suboptimal care catered to thalassemia patients in Karachi, Pakistan. The fear of the virus contraction coupled with the lockdown and restricted mobility has disrupted the entire transfusion chain from donor to the recipient. Collaborated efforts by the government and healthcare authorities are essential to ensure sufficient blood for thalassemia patients amid the pandemic.","Arshad Ali, S; Azim, D; Hassan, H M; Iqbal, A; Ahmed, N; Kumar, S; Nasim, S",Transfus. clin. biol,341,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigators designed a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of 883 subjects who presented for evaluation of oral and maxillofacial fractures (OMF) between March 1 and June 30 in the years 2018 through 2020. The primary predictor variable was the evaluation of OMF during a period with social distancing policies (2020 - experimental group) or without social distancing policies in place (2018 or 2019 - control group). The primary outcome variables were the facial fracture diagnosis, the abbreviated injury scale (AIS), injury severity score (ISS), and the mechanism of injury. Appropriate univariate and bivariate statistics were computed, and the level of significance was set at P < .05 for all tests. RESULTS: The number of subjects presenting with OMF was lower during the period of social distancing (n = 235 in 2020) than during the periods without (2018: n = 330; 2019: n = 318). During the period of social distancing, there were more individuals who presented secondary to assault, whereas fewer individuals presented secondary to falls (P = .05). On average, those who presented in 2020 had more severe oral and maxillofacial injuries (mean AIS = 3.2 ± 1.2 in 2020 vs 3.0 ± 1.1 in 2019 and 3.0 ± 1.1 in 2018.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the initial clinical characteristics of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients on admission in order to find out which kinds may be more likely to get positive nucleic acid testing results, and to explore the risk factors associated with all-cause death. METHODS: Medical records from 309 highly suspected cases with pneumonia were collected from February 13, 2020, to March 14, 2020, in a COVID-19-designated hospital of Wuhan. The majority of the clinical data were collected on the first day of hospital admission. RESULTS: Of 309 patients with median age 64 years (interquartile ranges [IQR], 53-72 years), 111 patients (35.9%) were confirmed by nucleic acid testing (median age 64 years, IQR: 56-71 years; 48 males). Of those 111 patients, 13 (11.7%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with positive testing included fatigue (odds ratios [OR] = 3.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.88-5.24, p < 0.001), cough (OR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32-0.95, p = 0.032), no less than 1 comorbidity (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.06-2.98, p = 0.030), and severe pneumonia (OR = 2.67; 95% CI: 1.20-5.97, p = 0.016).

Paralelo a esse fenômeno, transformações socioculturais têm impactado as modalidades de cuidado ofertadas à pessoa idosa, sendo crescente o número destas encaminhadas para Instituições de Longa Permanência para Idosos (ILPIs). Este cenário impõe o desafio de compreender as pessoas idosas institucionalizadas em suas dimensões existenciais e de subjetividade. Trata-se de um estudo fenomenológico pautado na fenomenologia de Martin Heidegger e que objetivou desvelar o sentido de ser-pessoa-idosa vivendo em Instituição de Longa-Permanência para Idosos. Para a produção das informações foram realizadas 12 entrevistas fenomenológicas com pessoas idosas que vivem em uma ILPI no interior da Bahia, Brasil, de ambos os sexos, que moram na instituição há, pelo menos, quatro meses e que demonstraram condição cognitiva preservada para participar do estudo. As entrevistas foram realizadas no período de março de 2017 a agosto de 2018. A apreensão dos aspectos ônticos ­ a partir da compreensão vaga e mediana das vivências compartilhadas - possibilitou a construção de seis unidades de significado. A pessoa idosa que reside em ILPI mostrou-se como pessoa que: I. Vivencia a perda progressiva de autonomia e independência; II. Percebe a ida para a ILPI como trajetória circunstancial inevitável; III. O ser-com torna-se ser-só/ser-solitário; IV. Ex-siste imersa numa rotina vazia; V. Apega-se à religiosidade/espiritualidade como estratégia de resiliência e conforto; VI. Experiencia a ressignificação de percepções diversas. Após as etapas de apreensão dos aspectos ônticos, procedeu-se com a compreensão hermenêutica e a construção da unidade de significação: o sentido de ser-pessoa-idosa vivendo em instituição de longa permanência. Foi possível compreender que parte da facticidade do ser-aí lançado no mundo vivida pelo ser-pessoa-idosa é resultado de processos instituídos pela ILPI. Passíveis, portanto, de ajustes e redefinições. Conclui-se que, atualmente, a assistência em saúde à pessoa idosa que vive em ILPI centra-se no atendimento das necessidades fisiológicas do ente idoso, restringindo-se à instância ôntica. As necessidades ontológicas, as quais atentam para as particularidades do ser-pessoa-idosa que vive em ILPI seguem esquecidas. Uma vez que somos ôntico e ontológico, o cuidado limitado à instância ôntica sinaliza deficiências do processo de institucionalização. Assim, urge a necessidade de melhorias no cuidado que considerem o ente e incluam a busca continuada pela compreensão do ser-pessoa-idosa que vive em ILPI em suas diferentes e peculiares facetas do existir. Esse exercício é fundamental para garantir às pessoas idosas institucionalizadas o direito de envelhecer com dignidade e qualidade de vida.(AU)","Reis, Camila Calhau Andrade",,341,24

For this group, both intervention #1 and intervention #2 showed significant reductions with large effect sizes (p &lt;.001, Hedges' g = 2.00) (p &lt;.001, Hedges' g = 1.18). Follow-up SUD scores were obtained from 58 participants, with the mean disturbance level showing a significant further decrease. These findings provide preliminary evidence that group FT appears to safely provide rapid relief from disturbing memories.

The amplification of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences followed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing gradient (DGGE) has been a powerful technique to genetically evaluate microbial ecosystems. Changes in rumen microbial populations were investigated in vitro using a basal diet with different lipid sources. PCRs were performed with two different sets of primers in order to amplify 16S rRNA sequences, and the amplified fragments were submitted to DGGE analysis. The findings presented in this study show that distinct microbial communities were present in each treatment. The presence of soybean oil seems to maximize growth of bacterial population, whereas fish oil appears to reduce growth. We demonstrated the successful application of molecular ecological techniques to analyze the structure and composition of bacterial communities in rumen ecosystems.","Cláudia Freitas, Kárita; Eyre Gabriel, Jane; Cunha Leite, Laudí; Dutra de Armas, Rafael; Pazzanese Duarte Lanna, Dante; Maciel França Madeira, Humberto",Acta Sci.

Methods and Results Patients undergoing coronary revascularization, aortic valve replacement, lower extremity peripheral vascular intervention, or carotid artery revascularization from up to 852 US hospitals in the Nationwide Readmissions Database were identified. Crude and risk-standardized red blood cell transfusion rates were determined for each procedure. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between respective procedural transfusion rates. Median odds ratios were estimated to reflect between-hospital variability in red blood cell transfusion rates following the same procedure for a given patient. There was wide variation in red blood cell transfusion rates across different procedures, from 2% following carotid endarterectomy to 29% following surgical aortic valve replacement. For surgical and endovascular modalities, transfusion rates at the same hospital were highly correlated for aortic valve replacement (r=0.67; P<0.001), moderately correlated for coronary revascularization (r=0.56; P<0.001) and peripheral vascular intervention (r=0.51; P<0.001), and weakly correlated for carotid artery revascularization (r=0.19, P<0.001). Median odds ratios were all >2, highest for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and surgical aortic valve replacement, indicating substantial site variation in transfusion rates. Conclusions After adjustment for patient-related factors, wide variation in red blood cell transfusion rates remained across surgical and endovascular procedures employed for the same cardiovascular condition. Transfusion rates following these procedures are highly correlated at individual hospitals and vary widely across hospitals. In aggregate, these findings suggest that local institutional culture significantly influences the decision to transfuse following invasive cardiovascular procedures and highlight the need for randomized data to inform such decisions.","Apostolidou, Eirini; Kolte, Dhaval; Kennedy, Kevin F; Beale, Charles E; Abbott, J Dawn; Ehsan, Afshin; Gurm, Hitinder S; Carson, Jeffrey L; Mamdani, Shafiq; Aronow, Herbert D",J Am Heart Assoc,341,26

However, there is a dearth of evidence regarding type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article explores the possibility of COVID 19 induced diabetes and highlights a potential bidirectional link between COVID 19 and T1DM. METHODS: A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Google Scholar electronic databases till October 2020, using relevant keywords (COVID-19 induced diabetes; COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes; COVID-19 induced DKA; new-onset diabetes after SARS-CoV-2 infection) to extract relevant studies describing relationship between COVID-19 and T1DM. RESULTS: Past lessons and new data teach us that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) can enter islet cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors and cause reversible ß-cell damage and transient hyperglycemia. There have been postulations regarding the potential new-onset T1DM triggered by COVID-19. This article reviews the available evidence regarding the impact and interlink between COVID-19 and &#932;1DM. We also explore the mechanisms behind the viral etiology of &#932;1DM. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can trigger severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation in individuals with new-onset diabetes. However, at present, there is no hard evidence that SARS-CoV-2 induces T1DM on it's own accord. Long term follow-up of children and adults presenting with new-onset diabetes during this pandemic is required to fully understand the type of diabetes induced by COVID-19.","Boddu, Sirisha Kusuma; Aurangabadkar, Geeta; Kuchay, Mohammad Shafi",Diabetes Metab Syndr,341,17

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of emergency imaging volumes from January 5 to May 30, 2020. Weekly volume data were collected for total imaging studies, abdominopelvic CT, and abdominopelvic CTs positive for common causes of acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. Two emergency radiology attendings scored all diverticulitis cases independently, and weekly volume data for uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis cases was also collected. Volume data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared, using 2019 volumes as a control. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overall emergency imaging volume decreased 30% compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). While the number of emergency abdominopelvic CTs positive for appendicitis and small bowel obstruction did not significantly change during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of diverticulitis decreased significantly compared to 2019 (p = 0.001). This reduction can be specifically attributed to decreased uncomplicated diverticulitis cases, as the number of uncomplicated diverticulitis cases dropped significantly (p = 0.002) while there was no significant difference in the number of complicated diverticulitis cases (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced emergency abdominopelvic CT volume during the COVID-19 pandemic can partially be explained by decreased imaging of lower acuity patients. This data may help formulate future strategies for imaging resource utilization with an improved understanding of the relationship between perceived imaging risk and symptom acuity.","Gibson, Averi L; Chen, Byron Y; Rosen, Max P; Paez, S Nicolas; Lo, Hao S",Emerg Radiol,341,16

National guidelines currently recommend 12-14 in-person prenatal visits, a schedule that has remained unchanged since 1930. When scrutinizing the standard prenatal visit schedule, it becomes clear that prenatal care is overdue for a redesign. We have strong evidence of the benefits of prenatal services, such as screening for gestational diabetes and maternal vaccination. However, how to deliver these services is not clear. Studies of prenatal services consistently demonstrate that such care can be delivered in fewer than 14 visits and that patients do not need to visit clinics in person to receive all maternity services. Telemedicine has emerged as a promising care delivery option for patients seeking greater flexibility, and early trials leveraging virtual care and remote monitoring have shown positive maternal and fetal outcomes with high patient satisfaction. Our institution has worked for the past year on a new prenatal care pathway. Our initial work assessed the literature, elicited patient perspectives, and captured the insights of experts in patient-centered care delivery. There are 2 key principles that guide prenatal care redesign: (1) design care delivery around essential services, using in-person care for services that cannot be delivered remotely and offering video visits for other essential services, and (2) creation of flexible services for anticipatory guidance and psychosocial support that allow patients to tailor support to meet their needs through opt-in programs. The rise of coronavirus disease 2019 prompted us to extend this early work and rapidly implement a redesigned prenatal care pathway. In this study, we outline our experience in transitioning to a new prenatal care model with 4 in-person visits, 1 ultrasound visit, and 4 virtual visits (the 4-1-4 prenatal plan). We then explore how insights from this implementation can inform patient-centered prenatal care redesign during and beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Peahl, Alex F; Smith, Roger D; Moniz, Michelle H",Am J Obstet Gynecol,341,16

Aims: We assess the challenges and strategies used in the management of osteoporosis and fragility fracture care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We have done a comprehensive review of the literature using suitable keywords on the search engines of PubMed, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Research Gate in the first week of May 2020 on developments and guidance during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures management has been hampered by lock down and infection transmission strategies used to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to diagnostic tests, treatment facilities with the need to use clinical and prediction tools to guide management Telemedicine has an evolving role. Conclusion: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures in elderly individuals pose a real challenge for an appropriate diagnosis and management, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A clinical decision along with use of clinical prediction tools for osteoporosis should be used to direct treatment. Obligatory fractures such as hip fractures require operative intervention. Non-obligatory fractures such as distal radius fractures can be managed conservatively with use of telemedicine applications in monitoring both types of patients.","Upadhyaya, Gaurav K.; Iyengar, Karthikeyan; Jain, Vijay K.; Vaishya, Raju",J.

We assessed the performance of primary angioplasty in a tertiary care hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia, by comparing the door-to-device (DTD) time and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow after angioplasty between two periods of admission: during the outbreak of COVID-19 (March 1 to May 31, 2020) and before the outbreak (March 1, to May 31, 2019). Overall, there was a relative reduction of 44% for STEMI admission during the outbreak (n = 116) compared with before the outbreak (N = 208). Compared with before the outbreak period (n = 141), STEMI patients who admitted during the outbreak and received primary angioplasty (n = 70) had similar median symptom onset-to-angioplasty center admission (360 minutes for each group), similar to radial access uptake (90 vs. 89.4%, p = 0.88) and left anterior descending infarct-related artery (54.3 vs. 58.9%, p = 0.52). The median DTD time and total ischemia time were longer (104 vs. 81 minutes, p &lt; 0.001, and 475.5 vs. 449 minutes, p = 0.43, respectively). However, the final achievement of TIMI 3 flow was similar (87.1 vs. 87.2%), and so was the in-hospital mortality (5.7 vs. 7.8%). During the COVID-19 outbreak, we found a longer DTD time for primary angioplasty, but the achievement of final TIMI 3 flow and in-hospital mortality were similar as compared with before the outbreak. Thus, primary angioplasty should remain the standard of care for STEMI during the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

We propose strategically reconstructing the public safety-net systems serving youth, including early education, maternal and child health, child welfare, corrections, and mental health. That plan called for a concentrated focus on coalition-building and contracting by state mental health systems to establish a foundation for an improved health system. This paper offers a complementary set of suggestions for the four non-mental health systems mentioned above by recommending actionable steps based on scientific evidence to support improved services for children at risk for MEB problems. For each system we describe examples of evidence-informed services, policies or programs that (1) prevent disabilities and promote health, (2) protect and preserve families and neighborhoods, and (3) provide quality care.

As diagnostic options, swabs from the anterior nose, from the nasopharynx, from the oropharynx or the extraction of throat rinse water or saliva are possible. The laboratory methods available are antigen tests that can be read in a few minutes or more lengthy RT-PCR methods in a lab. Swabs are carried out by physicians, medical staff, laypeople and in the self-test, in each case according to prior instructions. Many of these factors therefore have an influence on the informative value and the sensitivity of the entire diagnostic process. The PCR laboratory method is more sensitive than the antigen method; the swabs from the nasopharynx are considered the most valid smear site; correct execution of a test can be achieved even with non-professional individuals with good instructions. Complications with such swabs are reported very rarely, given the assumed number of procedures performed. Short-term nosebleeds after traumatic smears can be assumed without publications about it being found. Broken parts of swabs had to be removed by an ENT doctor. There are only very few reports on injuries to the skullbase with CSF-leaks, including 2 times with anomalies such as meningoceles. The choice of a suitable diagnostic medium depends on many parameters such as availability, the timing of the result, a smear test by knowledgeable staff or a self-test, and a number of other practical considerations.","Deitmer, Thomas; Dietz, A; Chaberny, I F; Pietsch, C",Laryngorhinootologie,341,16

Surgeons operating near the aerodigestive tract are at particularly high risk, given the respiratory spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study examines the practices and opinions of craniofacial surgeons as they adapt to a worldwide epidemic. Methods: An electronic survey study was conducted on practicing craniomaxillofacial surgeons regarding their preference of personal protective equipment use before, during, and after the pandemic in patients with or without COVID-19 infection, as well as demographic data. Statistical analysis was performed to compare changes in behaviors and preferences and differences across demographic groups. Results: Craniofacial surgeons changed their behaviors significantly during the pandemic, with 91.5% of respondents wearing N95 masks or powered air purifying respirators for operations involving exposure of the nasal or oral airways on untested patients, compared with 4.3% before the pandemic (P &lt; 0.001). For examinations in the clinic, 100% reported wearing a mask during the pandemic compared with 40.3% before the pandemic (P &lt; 0.001). After the pandemic is over, 31.9% of surgeons planned to continue using an N95 mask or powered air purifying respirator for craniomaxillofacial cases and 80.9% planned to continue using masks in clinic. Overall, 46.8% of respondents believed that N95 masks should be the standard for craniofacial surgery. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly shifted the practices and opinion of craniofacial surgeons toward more protective personal protective equipment. These results indicate that this is likely to persist after the pandemic is over, which may limit surgeon exposure to airborne disease and help the field withstand future epidemic outbreaks.","Lee, J.

In order to obey relevant regulations, railway stations, airports, shopping malls and other public places are equipped with staff to supervise citizens to wear masks. This method not only wastes human resources, but also has the disadvantage of significantly reducing the efficiency when the flow increases. In order to improve work efficiency, save human resources, and ensure the health and safety of staff, computer vision technology can be used to develop embedded device to deal with the task of automatic mask wearing detection. This paper proposes a mask wearing detection method based on the skin color and eyes detection. This method uses the ellipse skin model, the grayscale gradient features of eyes and the geometric relationship between eyes and other parts of face to locate the face region. And by calculating the coverage of skin color in nose and mouth area, this method gives a judgement of whether a man is wearing a mask properly. This method can basically deal with the task of mask wearing detection under the specific application scenario. It also has the advantages of small volume and strong interpretability.","He, Tengjiao",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,341,22

In this paper, we conduct the first, large-scale user study on 320 lay and 11 expert users to shed light on the effectiveness of state-of-the-art attribution methods in assisting humans in ImageNet classification, Stanford Dogs fine-grained classification, and these two tasks but when the input image contains adversarial perturbations. We found that, in overall, feature attribution is surprisingly not more effective than showing humans nearest training-set examples. On a hard task of fine-grained dog categorization, presenting attribution maps to humans does not help, but instead hurts the performance of human-AI teams compared to AI alone. Importantly, we found automatic attribution-map evaluation measures to correlate poorly with the actual human-AI team performance. Our findings encourage the community to rigorously test their methods on the downstream human-in-the-loop applications and to rethink the existing evaluation metrics.","Nguyen, Giang; Kim, Daeyoung; Nguyen, Anh",,341,1

The R package PoolTestR was developed to meet the needs of increasingly large and complex molecular xenomonitoring surveys but can be applied to analyse any data involving pooled testing. PoolTestR includes simple and flexible tools to estimate prevalence and fit fixed- and mixed-effect generalised linear models for pooled data in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Mixed-effect models allow users to account for the hierarchical sampling designs that are often employed in surveys, including MX. We demonstrate the utility of PoolTestR by applying it to a large synthetic dataset that emulates a MX survey with a hierarchical sampling design.","McLure, Angus; O'Neill, Ben; Mayfield, Helen; Lau, Colleen; McPherson, Brady",,341,20

Using data scraped from 'Healthy China', an official Sina Weibo account of the National Health Commission of China, we examine how citizen engagement relates to a series of theoretically relevant factors, including media richness, dialogic loop, content type and emotional valence. Results show that media richness negatively predicts citizen engagement through government social media, but dialogic loop facilitates engagement. Information relating to the latest news about the crisis and the government's handling of the event positively affects citizen engagement through government social media.

DESIGN/SETTING: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019-February 2020) versus after (April 2020) lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (&#8805; 16 years). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2 versus 4.0%, ORadj = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05-0.97) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9 versus 6.1%, ORadj = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.64-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Following the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, smokers and high-risk drinkers in England were more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce alcohol consumption and rates of smoking cessation and use of remote cessation support were higher. However, high-risk drinking prevalence increased post-lockdown and use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers decreased with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","Jackson, Sarah E; Garnett, Claire; Shahab, Lion; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,341,26

An immediate consequence was the weighing in by Indian politicians, entertainers, media and other influencers on the issue. In this paper, we use data from Twitter and an archive of debunked misinformation stories to understand some of the patterns around influencer engagement with a political issue. We found that more followed influencers were less likely to come out in support of the tweet. We also find that the later engagement of major influencers on the side of the government's position shows suggestion's of collusion. Irrespective of their position on the issue, influencers who engaged saw a significant rise in their following after their tweets. While a number of tweets thanked Rihanna for raising awareness on the issue, she was systematically trolled on the grounds of her gender, race, nationality and religion. Finally, we observed how misinformation existing prior to the tweet set up the grounds for alternative narratives that emerged.","Mishra, Dibyendu; Akbar, Syeda Zainab; Arya, Arshia; Dash, Saloni; Grover, Rynaa; Pal, Joyojeet",,341,0

Given the regional disparities in incidence and mortality in the general population, we aimed to describe local characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients in Montreal. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort of consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal with confirmed COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Between 20 March and 13 May 2020, 75 patients were admitted, with a median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of 62 [53-72] yr and high rates of obesity (47%), hypertension (67%), and diabetes (37%). Healthcare-related infections were responsible for 35% of cases. The median [IQR] day 1 sequential organ failure assessment score was 6 [3-7]. Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was used in 57% of patients for a median [IQR] of 11 [5-22] days. Patients receiving IMV were characterized by a moderately decreased median [IQR] partial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspired oxygen (day 1 PaO2:FiO2 = 177 [138-276]; day 10 = 173 [147-227]) and compliance (day 1 = 48 [38-58] mL/cmH2O; day 10 = 34 [28-42] mL/cmH2O) and very elevated estimated dead space fraction (day 1 = 0.60 [0.53-0.67]; day 10 = 0.72 [0.69-0.79]). Overall hospital mortality was 25%, and 21% in the IMV patients. Mortality was 82% in patients &#8805; 80 yr old. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Montreal were similar to those reported in the existing literature.

Furthermore, we investigate how organizational learning culture moderates the aforementioned mediated relationship. From an educational sector stakeholders' perspective, elaborations are made on how the constructs will aid in facilitating and nurturing the sustainable development of educational organizations.Design/methodology/approachThe respondents for this descriptive study were drawn from a student sample, who had taken up postgraduate courses in science and technology streams, in a prominent university in India. Self-reporting questionnaires were administered among the respondents, who were selected through random sampling. Measurement model analysis was done using IBM AMOS 21.0, and path analytic procedures using PROCESS 3.0 macro were used to test the proposed hypotheses.FindingsThe results revealed that digital learning orientation had a significant indirect effect on innovative work behavior, through readiness for change. Also, the conditional indirect effects of digital learning orientation on innovative work behavior, mediated through readiness for change, were influenced by organizational learning culture as the moderator, specifically when the levels of the moderator were low. At optimal levels of an organizational learning culture, digital learning orientation had a significant influence on innovative behavior, through higher readiness for change. However, beyond a certain threshold, organizational learning culture does not have a significant influence on predicting outcomes.Originality/valueThis study is pioneering in conceptualizing and testing a theoretical model linking digital learning orientation, organizational learning culture, readiness for change and innovative behavior. The study is relevant especially in the context of today's students being referred to as “digital natives,” and it, thus, becomes imperative to understand how the same can be translated into work outcomes. Educators are suggested to facilitate an organizational learning culture that is conducive to nurturing positive outcomes among digital native students. Efforts should be oriented toward undertaking teaching pedagogies that will include more of digital gadgets and technologies, enabling higher experiential learning.","Aboobaker, Nimitha Zakkariya K.

However, the frequent use of these preventive measures can lead to skin reactions. Our study aimed to determine the frequency of these reactions in Northern Morocco. In addition, we also looked at the risk factors and the consequences of these injuries on work efficiency and performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous online survey was used to collect data, which was sent to 500 health workers in the study region. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data on IBM SPSS software. RESULTS: In total, 273/500 responded to the questionnaire (55%). For the participants' profession, 41% were doctors, 32% were nursing staff, and 26% held other jobs. The general prevalence rate of adverse reactions for all health workers was (80%), including skin problems: after wearing goggles (58%), after wearing surgical masks and respirators (57%), after handwashing and wearing gloves (45%), after wearing a face shield (23%), and after wearing protective clothing (11%). Bleach immersion was highly significantly associated with hand reaction (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.77-4.90; P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a statistically significant association between hand cream use more than twice daily and fewer reactions (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.98-3.77; P = 0.038). The skin reactions related to goggles use were also significantly associated with use duration (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 0.988-3.12; P = 0.05). Similarly, wearing masks and N95 respirators and their related adverse reactions were significantly associated with use duration (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.20-0.7; P = 0.02). In addition, adverse reactions of regular use of protective clothing were related to the frequency of its use per shift (OR: 3.5, 95% CI: 1.47-8.54; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey-based study showed that the prevalence of these skin reactions in our context should not be neglected. The length of daily wearing time and the frequency of PPE uses were the most implicated factors. More attention must be paid to these reactions for better care of HCWs during these critical times.","Marraha, Farah; Al Faker, Ibtissam; Charif, Faiza; Chahoub, Hanane; Benyamna, Youness; Rahmani, Najlaa; Kabbou, Soukaina; Rkiek, Yasmine; Najdi, Adil; Gallouj, Salim",Ann.

A transcriptomic approach led to significant insights on gene regulation of the major metabolic pathways (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation) in batch cultures carried out on SSL and compared with glucose and xylose. Significantly overexpressed genes in SSL compared to glucose and xylose were fructose biphosphate aldolase (> 1.18-fold change) in the catabolism, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (> 1.59-fold change) and malate dehydrogenase (> 1.49-fold change) in the TCA cycle, citrate lyase (> 1.7-fold change), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (> 0.88-fold change), pyruvate dehydrogenase E2 (> 1.63-fold change) and pyruvate formate lyase (> 0.61-fold change), involved in acetyl-CoA pathways. Finally, C4 tricarboxylic transporters were overexpressed (DCU (> 1.61-fold change) and 0079 (> 4.19-fold change).

The time between capsule consumption and first count, however, is widely taken, without debate, to be 3 h. In the Covid-19 era, it is desirable to limit the time patients spend in the department. We, therefore, questioned the need for a 3 h interval between capsule administration and the initial count. METHODS: Using an uncollimated gamma camera, whole-body counting was performed at 5, 30 and 180 min after capsule ingestion in 24 patients with chronic diarrhoea. Geometric mean was taken of counts acquired from posterior and anterior projections. WBR was expressed as the ratio of 7 day-to-initial whole-body counts (%) to give WBR5, WBR30 and WBR180. A small meal was given at 60 min after capsule ingestion. RESULTS: There was a close correlation between WBR30 and WBR180 (y = 1.0x - 0.29%; r = 0.99). For WBR180 values of <15% (lower limit of normal), there was close agreement between WBR30 and WBR180 (bias 0.03%; precision 0.7%). WBR5 overestimated WBR180. However, cWBR5, obtained by multiplication of WBR5 by 0.75, also correlated closely with WBR180 (y = 1.2x - 4.5%; r = 0.97), and there was close agreement between cWBR5 and WBR180 for WBR180 values <15% (bias 0.08%, precision 1.3%). CONCLUSION: The first whole-body count in the 75SeHCAT test can be undertaken at 30 min postcapsule without loss of accuracy, or even 5 min if only subnormal values are considered relevant. No food is required after capsule consumption.","Soares, Sara; Heraghty, Neil; Gulliver, Nick; Peters, Adrien Michael",Nucl. med. commun,341,24

METHODS: A study period of twelve weeks following the introduction of the nationwide ""lockdown period"", March 23rd - June 14th, 2020 was identified and compared to the same time period in 2019 as a ""baseline period"". A retrospective analysis of all emergency orthopaedic referrals and surgical procedures performed during these time frames was undertaken. All data was collected and screened using the 'eTrauma' management platform (Open Medical, UK). The study included data from a five NHS Foundation Trusts within North West London. A total of 6695 referrals were included for analysis. RESULTS: The total number of referrals received during the lockdown period fell by 35.3% (n=2631) compared to the same period in 2019 (n=4064). Falls remained proportionally the most common mechanism of injury across all age groups in both time periods. The proportion sports related injuries compared to the overall number of injuries fell significantly during the lockdown period (p<0.001), however, the proportion of pushbike related accidents increased significantly (p<0.001). The total number of operations performed during the lockdown period fell by 38.8% (n=1046) during lockdown (n=1732). The proportion of patients undergoing operative intervention for Neck of Femur (NOF) and ankle fractures remained similar during both study periods. A more non-operative approach was seen in the management of wrist fractures, with 41.4% of injuries undergoing an operation during the lockdown period compared to 58.6% at baseline (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the nationwide lockdown has led to a decrease in emergency orthopaedic referrals and procedure numbers. There has been a change in mechanism of injuries, with fewer sporting injuries, conversely, there has been an increase in the number of pushbike or scooter related injuries during the lockdown period. NOF fractures remained at similar levels to the previous year. There was a change in strategy for managing distal radius fractures with more fractures being treated non-operatively.","Sephton, B M; Mahapatra, P; Shenouda, M; Ferran, N; Deierl, K; Sinnett, T; Somashekar, N; Sarraf, K M; Nathwani, D; Bhattacharya, R",Injury,341,1

Here we describe the discovery of myricetin, a flavonoid found in many food sources, as a non-peptidomimetic and covalent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Crystal structures of the protease bound with myricetin and its derivatives unexpectedly revealed that the pyrogallol group worked as an electrophile to covalently modify the catalytic cysteine. Kinetic and selectivity characterization together with theoretical calculations comprehensively illustrated the covalent binding mechanism of myricetin with the protease and demonstrated that the pyrogallol can serve as an electrophile warhead. Structure-based optimization of myricetin led to the discovery of derivatives with good antiviral activity and the potential of oral administration. These results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the covalent mode of action by pyrogallol-containing natural products and a template for design of non-peptidomimetic covalent inhibitors against 3CLpros, highlighting the potential of pyrogallol as an alternative warhead in design of targeted covalent ligands.","Su, Haixia; Yao, Sheng; Zhao, Wenfeng; Zhang, Yumin; Liu, Jia; Shao, Qiang; Wang, Qingxing; Li, Minjun; Xie, Hang; Shang, Weijuan; Ke, Changqiang; Feng, Lu; Jiang, Xiangrui; Shen, Jingshan; Xiao, Gengfu; Jiang, Hualiang; Zhang, Leike; Ye, Yang; Xu, Yechun",Nat Commun,341,20

Combining a phylogenetic approach with the study of contact zones can help to overcome such difficulties. The Podarcis hispanicus species complex has proven to be prosperous in independent evolutionary units, sometimes associated with cryptic diversity. Previous studies have revealed that one of the species of this complex, P. guadarramae, comprises two deeply divergent yet morphologically indistinguishable evolutionary units, currently regarded as subspecies (P. g. guadarramae and P. g. lusitanicus). In this study we used molecular data to address the systematics of the two lineages of Podarcis guadarramae and the closely related P. bocagei. Firstly, we reconstructed the species tree of these three and two additional taxa based on 30 nuclear loci using the multispecies coalescent with and without gene flow. Secondly, we used SNPs obtained from RADseq data to analyze the population structure across the distribution limits P. g. lusitanicus and P. g. guadarramae, and for comparison, a contact zone between P. bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus. Nuclear phylogenetic relationships between these three taxa are clearly difficult to determine due to the influence of gene flow, but our results give little support to the monophyly of P. guadarramae, potentially due to a nearly simultaneous divergence between them. Genetic structure and geographic cline analysis revealed that the two lineages of P. guadarramae replace each other abruptly across the sampled region and that gene flow is geographically restricted, implying the existence of strong reproductive isolation. Podarcis bocagei and P. g. lusitanicus show a similar degree of genetic differentiation and reproductive isolation, with very low levels of admixture in syntopy. These results support that all three forms are equally differentiated and reproductively isolated. In consequence, we conclude that the two former subspecies of Podarcis guadarramae constitute valid, yet cryptic species, that should be referred to as P. lusitanicus and P. guadarramae.","Caeiro-Dias, Guilherme; Rocha, Sara; Couto, Alvarina; Pereira, Carolina; Brelsford, Alan; Crochet, Pierre-André; Pinho, Catarina",Mol Phylogenet Evol,341,20

Based on this premise, the current research offers a novel and timely view by examining how communication messages in public service advertisements (PSAs) can alter the perception of threat under uncertain situations such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. This article investigates the role of additional relative statistical information on the perception of threat and stockpiling intention. First, we examine whether there is a reduction in the perceived threat of the coronavirus if information about the potential severity of an alternative threat (car accidents) is activated, when compared to offering only statistics on the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as COVID-19. Furthermore, we established the mediating role of a perceived threat in consumers’ decisions and behavior in times of severe crisis. This suggests that organizations and policymakers can influence individuals by increasing or decreasing their perceived level of threat depending on the desired outcomes (e.g., respecting authorities’ recommendations or avoiding stockpiling). This research offers a deeper understanding of how consumers can be “nudged” toward desired behavior in the context of public health and safety.","Kim, Jungkeun; Giroux, Marilyn; Gonzalez-Jimenez, Hector; Jang, Seongsoo; Kim, Seongseop; Park, Jooyoung; Kim, Jae-Eun; Lee, Jacob C.; Choi, Yung Kyun",J.

Many a systems thinker like the Limits to Growth's Club of Rome have suggested ways to avoid the negative consequences of the current economic system but these entail radical changes that cannot be afforded by deeply-entrenched practices of the worldwide economy. In this paper, another alternative is proposed, which may not only be desirable to an envisioned ecological society but also may also be logical to the unsustainable society of today. Looking at rural indigenous livelihoods may show us how an ecological society should be like. Exemplifying collectivism, indigenous peoples continue to cultivate empathy while at the same time inculcating sense of responsibility. Before “multi-hyphenated” became fashionable, indigenous peoples were already engaged in different occupations that, in turn, result to a diversified livelihood portfolio similar to what banks today advise clients on their investments. However, the difference lies in the indigenous tradition of only having enough for what is needed and rarely hoarding to the point of exhausting resources. This paper proposes that the diverse indigenous livelihood portfolio can be a valuable economic framework for an ecological society.

Such mobilities, however, cause disruptive social, spatial and economic transformations of urban and rural landscapes across the globe. Consequently, transnational gentrifications may be considered a crucial testimonial of economic shifts, during the 2008–2020 period of accumulation. In this article, we argue that the underlying conceptual assumptions of transnational gentrifications require crucial adjustments. We should especially consider the intellectual roots that simply celebrate leisure-oriented mobilities while setting aside the exclusionary social practices of the consumption of space, culture, heritage and place. We do this by interpreting the phenomenon by means of a political economy that understands (i) the lens of the multi-scalar organisation of state power as a centrepiece for orchestrating the conditions for transnational gentrifications; (ii) transnational middle-class leisure-oriented mobilities linked dichotomously with labour precariousness and flexibility; and (iii) the rent gap as an analytical tool to understand dispossession, and corresponding displacement of people, practices and discourses. This approach sheds light on the nuances of gentrification as an attribute of systemic violence exercised in financialised capitalism. It also supports us to sketch out a theoretically informed outlook for the ongoing reorientation of intertwined gentrifications by transnational capital investments with intermittent flows of people in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alexandri, Georgia; Janoschka, Michael",Urban Stud.,341,1

RESULTS: The literature reports that vitamin D has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. It reduces the expression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#945; and INF-Î³, regulates the activity of T helper lymphocytes, and other elements of the immune system at the molecular level. The deficiency of this vitamin promotes the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, contributing to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The severity of the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on comorbidities, the development and course of which may also be affected by vitamin D levels (coagulopathies, pulmonary, cardiological, metabolic diseases). Most of the analyzed research studies from different countries indicated a relationship between insufficient vitamin D levels and a more severe course of COVID-19 and an increase in mortality due to it, especially among the elderly. Researchers agree that further analyzes are necessary concerning both the influence of the vitamin D blood serum levels on the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the use of its supplementation in the struggle against SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are reports of possible beneficial interactions of vitamin D with other substances, such as quercetin, estradiol, some microelements, and other vitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an adequate level of vitamin D has a positive effect on the functioning of the immune system. At the moment, there is insufficient evidence to establish a clear relationship between vitamin D levels and the severity of COVID-19. It is necessary to conduct further research on a larger study group. The literature does not mention the use of vitamin D as a medication for COVID-19. People at risk of vitamin D deficiency should consider vitamin D supplementation at the current time of the pandemic.","Reka, Gabriela; Korzeniowska, Anna; Machowiec, Piotr; Maksymowicz, Marcela; Piecewicz-Szczesna, Halina",Przegl Epidemiol,341,24

In the situation of limited resources, how to take care of the physiological needs of the doctor without increasing the chance of contamination during replacement is a consideration. By reducing the chance of contamination during removal and storage, the previous designs were analyzed and improved. We proposed three improved designs to reduce the contact. Design-A features a mask with a water channel that allows the user to remain hydrated without removing the cover. Design-B has a folding pattern that hides the outer surface.

These EOs are present in many over- the- counter balms and oils. The effect of exposure to these EOs and occurrence of seizure is not systematically studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between essential oils and the first episode of seizure and breakthrough seizures in known epileptic patients. METHODS: This was a multi-center prospective study, conducted in four hospitals over four years. Every person presenting with the first episode of seizure or breakthrough seizure was asked about exposure to EOs, mode of exposure, time to onset of a seizure in relationship to exposure, duration of seizure, type of seizure, and antiepileptic drug therapy. RESULTS: During the four-year period there were 55 patients with essential oil-related seizure (EORS). 22(40 %) had essential oil-induced seizures (EOIS) and 33(60 %) had essential oil-provoked seizures (EOPS). The female: male ratio was 1:1.1, the age of the patients ranged from 8 months to 77 years. In the EOIS group, 95 % had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 5% had focal impaired awareness seizures. In the EOPS group, 42.4 % had focal impaired awareness seizures, 27.3 % generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 15 % focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, and 15 % focal aware motor seizures. EOs implicated were preparations containing eucalyptus and camphor. CONCLUSION: Exposure to essential oils of eucalyptus and camphor is an under-recognized cause of the first and breakthrough seizure. Identifying the true causative factor will prevent unnecessary antiepileptic drug therapy and future recurrence.","Mathew, Thomas; K John, Saji; Kamath, Vikram; Kumar R, Shiva; Jadav, Rakesh; Swamy, Sreekanta; Adoor, Gurucharan; Shaji, Asha; Nadig, Raghunandan; Badachi, Sagar; D Souza, Delon; Therambil, Manjusha; Sarma, G R K; J Parry, Gareth",Epilepsy Res,341,31

METHODS: Clinical data on 285 cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital's electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Additional 446 Influenza A outpatients' hematologic data were enrolled for comparison. RESULTS: NLR, SII, RLR, PLR, HsCRP, and IL-6 were significant higher and LMR was lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild COVID-19 patients (p < .001). PLR and LMR were lower in the individuals with influenza A than those with COVID-19 (p < .01). COVID-19 patients with higher levels of NLR, SII, RLR, PLR, HsCRP, and IL-6 and lower LMR were significantly associated with the severe type. AUC of NLR (0.76) was larger while the specificity of IL-6 (86%) and sensitivity of HsCRP (89%) were higher than other inflammatory markers in predicating the typing of COVID-19. PT had obvious correlation with all the inflammatory markers except RPR. NLR showed positive correlations with AST, TP, BUN, CREA, PT, and D-dimer. Patients with high IL-6 levels have a relatively worse prognosis (HR = 2.30). CONCLUSION: Peripheral blood inflammatory markers reflected the intensity of inflammation and associated with severity of COVID-19.NLR was more useful to predict severity as well as IL-6 to predict prognosis of COVID-19.

To date, there is a lack of findings on the role of rehabilitation in post-acute COVID-19 patients. AIM: Thus, we aimed at describing the role of a patient-tailored rehabilitation plan on functional outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Real-practice retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatients Rehabilitation Unit. POPULATION: Post-acute COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Medical records of patients referred to an Italian COVID-19 Rehabilitation Unit from March 10th, 2020 to April 30th, 2020 were collected. All patients underwent a rehabilitative (30 minutes/set, 2 times/day), aimed to improve gas exchanges, reducing dyspnoea, and improving muscle function. At the admission (T0) and at the discharge (T1), we evaluated as outcome measures: Barthel Index (BI), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale, 6-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT) and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. We also assessed: type of respiratory supports needed, pulmonary function, coagulation and inflammation markers and length of stay (LOS) in Rehabilitation Unit. RESULTS: We included 41 post-acute COVID-19 patients (25 male and 19 female), mean aged 72.15±11.07 years. Their mean LOS in the Rehabilitation Unit was 31.97±9.06 days, as 39 successfully completed the rehabilitation treatment and 2 deceased.

It is suggested that COVID-19 associated PE represents in situ immunothrombosis rather than venous thromboembolism, although the origin of thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) characteristics of PE in 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and compared these to those of 100 consecutive control patients diagnosed with acute PE before the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, RV/LV diameter ratio, pulmonary artery trunk diameter and total thrombus load (according to Qanadli score) were measured and compared. RESULTS: We observed that all thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients were found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19. Also, the thrombus load was lower in COVID-19 patients (Qanadli score -8%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] -16 to -0.36%) as was the prevalence of the most proximal PE in the main/lobar pulmonary artery (17% versus 47%; -30%, 95%CI -44% to -8.2). Moreover, the mean RV/LV ratio (mean difference -0.23, 95%CI -0.39 to -0.07) and the prevalence of RV/LV ratio >1.0 (prevalence difference -23%, 95%CI -41 to -0.86%) were lower in the COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings therefore suggest that the phenotype of COVID-19 associated PE indeed differs from PE in patients without COVID-19, fuelling the discussion on its pathophysiology.","van Dam, L F; Kroft, L J M; van der Wal, L I; Cannegieter, S C; Eikenboom, J; de Jonge, E; Huisman, M V; Klok, F A",Thromb Res,341,16

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the rectal tissue specimens obtained from surgical resection, succus entericus and intestinal mucosa of ileostomy, and rectal mucosa during follow-up after recovery. Ultrathin sections of surgical samples were observed for SARS-CoV-2 virions using electron microscopy. Histopathological examination was performed using hematoxylin-eosin stain. Immunohistochemical analysis and immunofluorescence were carried out on rectal tissues to evaluate the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, and immune cell infiltrations. RESULTS: The patient had fever and cough on day 3 postoperatively, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on day 7, and was discharged from the hospital on day 41. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in surgically resected rectal specimens, but not in samples collected on 37 day after discharge. Notably, coincidence with rectal tissues of surgical specimens tested nucleic acid positive for SARS-CoV-2, typical coronavirus virions in rectal tissue were observed under electron microscopy.

A 54-item, valid, and reliable questionnaire, including items on demographic characteristics and past medical history, stress levels, awareness about signs and symptoms of COVID-19, knowledge about at-risk groups and prevention methods, knowledge about transmission methods, trust in sources of information, and availability of facemasks and sanitizers, was deployed via social and mass media networks. A total of 3787 Iranians participated in the study where the majority of the participants were females (67.4%), employed (56.1%), from developed provinces (81.6%), without chronic diseases (66.6%), and with &#8805;13 years of formal education (87.9%). The mean age of study participants was 34.9 years (range = 12-73), and the average stress score was 3.33 (SD = ±1.02). Stress score was significantly higher for females, those who were 30-39 years old, housewives, those with chronic diseases, individuals who were aware that there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19, those who could not get facemasks or sanitizers, and individuals with higher knowledge about at-risk groups (p < 0.05).

It seems that patients with underlying disease(s), such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic lung diseases, had a higher probability to have positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection than those with no underlying disease(s).","Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Najafi, Farid; Riahi, Parisa; Moradinazar, Mehdi; Shakiba, Ebrahim; Mostafaei, Shayan",Am J Trop Med Hyg,341,24

METHODS: A Boolean search was made in PubMed database using the specific keywords related to our objectives up till May 14, 2020 and full text of article retrieved with the supplements published in English language. RESULTS: Two studies available so far have studied the outcomes of severity and mortality in patients with diabetes stratified on glycemic control. Both the studies have unequivocally found that patients with poorly-controlled hyperglycemia (blood glucose >180 mg/dl) have significantly higher level of poor prognostic markers biochemically, compared to the well-controlled arms (blood glucose <180 mg/dl). Moreover, significant increase in severity and mortality was observed in cohorts with poorly-controlled blood glucose due to any cause (diabetes or stress hyperglycemia), compared to the well-controlled cohorts with COVID-19, even after the adjustment of multiple confounders.

For two decades, the medical education establishment in the UK has been challenged to remedy these failings, but little has changed. Meanwhile, there has been an exponential increase in biomedical research and an international paradigm shift in the literature, which defines ME/CFS as a multisystem disease, replacing the psychogenic narrative. This study was designed to explore the current UK medical school education on ME/CFS and to identify challenges and opportunities relating to future ME/CFS medical education. Materials and methods: A questionnaire, developed under the guidance of the Medical Schools Council, was sent to all 34 UK medical schools to collect data for the academic year 2018-2019. Results: Responses were provided by 22 out of a total of 34 medical schools (65%); of these 13/22 (59%) taught ME/CFS, and teaching was led by lecturers from ten medical specialties. Teaching delivery was usually by lecture; discussion, case studies and e-learning were also used. Questions on ME/CFS were included by seven schools in their examinations and three schools reported likely clinical exposure to ME/CFS patients. Two-thirds of respondents were interested in receiving further teaching aids in ME/CFS. None of the schools shared details of their teaching syllabus, so it was not possible to ascertain what the students were being taught. Conclusions: This exploratory study reveals inadequacies in medical school teaching on ME/CFS. Many medical schools (64% of respondents) acknowledge the need to update ME/CFS education by expressing an appetite for further educational materials. The General Medical Council (GMC) and Medical Schools Council (MSC) are called upon to use their considerable influence to bring about the appropriate changes to medical school curricula so future doctors can recognise, diagnose and treat ME/CFS. The GMC is urged to consider creating a registered specialty encompassing ME/CFS, post-viral fatigue and long Covid.","Muirhead, Nina; Muirhead, John; Lavery, Grace; Marsh, Ben",Medicina (Kaunas),341,24

While most individuals remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms, approximately 5% develop severe forms of COVID-19 characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure (MOF) that usually require intensive-care support and often yield a poor prognosis. SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is far from being completely understood, and the lack of effective treatments leads to a sense of urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies based on pathophysiological assumptions. The exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection, a condition known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm, is emerging as the mechanism leading to ARDS and MOF in COVID-19, thus endorsing the hypothesis that properly timed anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies could improve patients' clinical outcomes and prognosis. Key Messages: The objective of this article is to explore and comment on the potential role of the promising immunomodulatory therapies using pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to overcome the dysregulated proinflammatory response in COVID-19.","Iannaccone, Giulia; Scacciavillani, Roberto; Del Buono, Marco Giuseppe; Camilli, Massimiliano; Ronco, Claudio; Lavie, Carl J; Abbate, Antonio; Crea, Filippo; Massetti, Massimo; Aspromonte, Nadia",Cardiorenal Med,341,16

Small-molecule ENPP1 inhibitors are much needed as tools to study the basic biology of extracellular cGAMP and as investigational cancer immunotherapy drugs. Here, we surveyed structure-activity relationships around a series of cell-impermeable and thus extracellular-targeting phosphonate inhibitors of ENPP1. In addition, we solved the crystal structure of an exemplary phosphonate inhibitor to elucidate the interactions that drive potency. This study yielded several best-in-class inhibitors with Ki < 2 nM and excellent physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate that an ENPP1 inhibitor delays tumor growth in a breast cancer mouse model.

In this paper, we provide a methodology of discovering potential drugs for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona-Virus 2 (commonly known as SARS-CoV-2). We proposed a new model called Genetic Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoder (GCGVAE) to solve this problem. We trained our model based on the data of various viruses' protein structure, including that of the SARS, HIV, Hep3, and MERS, and used it to generate possible drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Several optimization algorithms, including valency masking and genetic algorithm, are deployed to fine tune our model. According to the simulation, our generated molecules have great effectiveness in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. We quantitatively calculated the scores of our generated molecules and compared it with the scores of existing drugs, and the result shows our generated molecules scores much better than those existing drugs. Moreover, our model can be also applied to generate effective drugs for treating other viruses given their protein structure, which could be used to generate drugs for future viruses.","Cheng, Tianyue; Fan, Tianchi; Wang, Landi",,341,1

Methods: An electronic literature search using PubMed was conducted to identify relevant research studies published between December 2019 and August 2020. Twenty-five studies were selected out of 1,041 studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, which highlight patients' satisfaction and experience with the use of telemedicine during the pandemic. Results: The findings based upon 48,144 surveyed patients and 146 providers in 12 different countries revealed high satisfaction with virtual encounters across a spectrum of diseases. Telemedicine was found satisfactory on various outcome measures, such as addressing patients' concerns, communication with health care providers, usefulness, and reliability. Most common advantages were time saved due to lesser traveling and waiting time, better accessibility, convenience, and cost efficiency. Age and sex did not significantly impact the satisfaction levels. Physicians and patients both showed a strong preference for continued usage and agreed upon telemedicine's potential to complement the regular health care services even after the pandemic. Technical challenges (reported in 10 studies) and lack of physical examination (reported in 13 studies) were the main limitations encountered in virtual visits. Conclusion: Long-term sustainability of telemedicine for all socioeconomic classes requires closer scrutiny of issues such as technology, training, reimbursement, data privacy, legal guidelines, and framework. Telemedicine must be adopted as a proactive strategy and scaled-up even beyond emergency usage due to its immense potential in complementing conventional health care services, such as diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, surveillance, and infection control.","Nanda, Mehak; Sharma, Rajesh",Telemed. j. e. health,341,16

To continue transplantation while protecting immunocompromised patients and health care workers, significant restructuring of normal patient care practice habits is required. Methods: This is a nonrandomized, descriptive study of the abdominal transplant program at 1 academic center (University of California, San Francisco) and the programmatic changes undertaken to safely continue transplantations. Patient transfers, fellow use, and patient discharge education were identified as key areas requiring significant reorganization. Results: The University of California, San Francisco abdominal transplant program took an early and aggressive approach to restructuring inpatient workflows and health care worker staffing. The authors formalized a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transfer system to address patients in need of services at their institution while minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in their transplant ward and used technological approaches to provide virtual telehealth where possible. They also modified their transplant fellow staffing and responsibilities to develop an adequate backup system in case of potential exposures. Conclusion: Every transplant program is unique, and an individualized plan to adapt and modify standard clinical practices will be required to continue providing essential transplantation services.

METHODS: A total of 1297 patients, admitted between 18 March and 8 April 2020, were stratified according to their risk of developing COVID-19 using their responses to a questionnaire designed to evaluate symptoms and risk conditions. RESULTS: Anosmia/hyposmia (p<0.0001), fever (p<0.0001), body pain (p<0.0001) and chills (p=0.001) were all independent predictors for COVID-19, with a 72% estimated probability for detecting COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Leucopenia, relative monocytosis, decreased eosinophil values, C reactive protein (CRP) and platelets were also shown to be significant independent predictors for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The significant clinical features for COVID-19 were identified as anosmia, fever, chills and body pain. Elevated CRP, leucocytes under 5400×109/L and relative monocytosis (>9%) were common among patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. These variables may help, in the absence of reverse transcriptase PCR tests, to identify possible COVID-19 infections during pandemic outbreaks.

The Pub and the People is a classic text for its distinctly sociological approach, seeing patterns of drinking and socializing in context, rather than focusing primarily on pathological consequences. The main conclusions were that the pub is a living social organism and that the traditional approach of British sociology which, Mass Observation argued, focused on 'the drink problem' and the links between alcohol, crime and delinquency, failed to take account of the full social context. Mass Observation's focus on the pub as a place anticipates themes taken up in work on alcohol in cultural geography. Later alcohol researchers and epidemiologists have continued this orientation, recognizing the importance of physical and social environments in relation to alcohol consumption. Other studies have built on the MO initiative by looking at how drug and alcohol consumption links to identity, friendship and sociality or at the connections between intoxication and pleasure. The value of this classic text is that it reminds us that paying attention to the social context is not just a useful supplement, but absolutely central to understanding the use of alcohol or drugs.","MacGregor, Susanne",Addiction,341,30

The aim of the work was to identify the VOC SARS-CoV-2 genovariants in the territory of the Republics of Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Udmurtia, and Samara, Penza, Saratov, Ulyanovsk, and Orenburg Regions. Materials and methods. The identification of genovariants and the determination of the type of mutations was carried out by the Sanger fragment sequencing method. Results and discussion. The study examined 298 samples of clinical material obtained from the Centers for Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Republics of Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Udmurtia, Samara, Penza, Saratov, Ulyanovsk, and Orenburg Regions. In 17 % of cases, the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was observed for one or more markers: in three samples, a new coronavirus of the B. 1.1.7 line (“British”) was detected;in a number of cases, only one mutation was detected in the virus found in samples - deletion Y144 or substitution D138Y, E484K, N501Y, and very rarely two mutations - deletion Y144 and substitution E484K. The presence of the L141-G142-V143 deletion localized in the recurrent deletion region RDR2 of the S-gene was shown in 10 % of the cases. The data obtained indicate the heterogeneity in macroorganism of the population of the new coronavirus with the deletion L141-G142-V143, which leads to a change in the antigenic structure of the virus, which probably allows the virus to evade the immune response. © 2021 Russian Research Anti-Plague Institute.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care routine of a tertiary hospital, which is a regional reference in cardiology and oncology. METHODS: Cross-sectional cohort study. We conducted a survey of medical visits from March 23, 2020 (when local commerce was closed) to April 23, 2020 (P20), in comparison with the same period in 2019 (P19). RESULTS: We found decreases in the number of cardiology consultations, exercise tests, Holter, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram (90%, 84%, 94%, 92%, 94%, and 81%, respectively). In relation to cardiac surgery and cardiac catheterization, there were 48% and 60% decreases, respectively. There was an increase in the number of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (33%) and definitive pacemaker implantations (29%). There were 97 admissions to the ICU during P19, in contrast with 78 during P20, a 20% decrease. Visits to the cardiac emergency room (45%) and admissions to the cardiology ward (36%) also decreased. The decrease in oncology consultations was 30%. Chemotherapy sessions decreased from 1,944 to 1,066 (45%), and radiotherapy sessions decreased by 19%. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has led to a considerable decrease in the number of consultations in outpatient clinics for cardiology, oncology, and other specialties. There was a concerning decrease in the number of cardiac surgeries, chemotherapy sessions, and radiotherapy sessions during the initial weeks of the pandemic. The number of people seeking care in the cardiac emergency room and the number of admissions to the cardiology ward and ICU also decreased, generating concern regarding the evolution and prognosis of these patients with pathologies other than COVID-19 during this pandemic time.

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations: This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance: Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.","Zubair, Adeel S; McAlpine, Lindsay S; Gardin, Tova; Farhadian, Shelli; Kuruvilla, Deena E; Spudich, Serena",JAMA neurol.

Clear expectations, high sensitivity and specificity, and manufacturer disclosure will facilitate excellence of tests. OBJECTIVES: To derive mathematical equations for designing and interpreting COVID-19 tests, assess Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization and Health Canada minimum requirements, establish sensitivity and specificity tiers, and enhance clinical performance in low prevalence settings. DESIGN: PubMed and other sources generated articles on COVID-19 testing and prevalence. EndNote X9.1 consolidated references. Mathematica and open access software helped prove equations, perform recursive calculations, graph multivariate relationships, and visualize patterns, including a new relationship, predictive value geometric mean-squared. RESULTS: Derived equations were used to illustrate shortcomings of COVID-19 diagnostics in low prevalence. Visual logistics helped establish sensitivity/specificity tiers. FDA/Canada's 90% sensitivity, 95% specificity minimum requirements generate excessive false positives at low prevalence. False positives exceed true positives at <5.3% prevalence, or if sensitivity is improved to 100% and specificity to 98%, at <2% prevalence. Recursive testing improves predictive value. Three tiers emerged from these results. With 100% sensitivity, physicians can select desired predictive values, then input local prevalence, to determine suitable specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding low prevalence impact will help healthcare providers meet COVID-19 needs for effective testing. Laypersons should receive clinical performance disclosure when submitting specimens. Home testing needs to meet the same high standards as other tests. In the long run, it will be more cost-effective to improve COVID-19 POC tests rather than repeat testing multiple times.","Kost, Gerald J",Arch. pathol. lab. med. (1976),341,15

In the spring of 2003, an epidemic of coronavirus pneumonia spread from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and subsequently to the rest of the world. The WHO coined the acronym SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and subsequently the causative virus as SARS-CoV. In the summer of 2012, epidemic of pneumonia occurred again in Saudi Arabia which was subsequently found to be caused by another novel coronavirus. WHO coined the term MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) to denote the Middle East origin of the novel virus (MERS-CoV). In the winter of 2019, another outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China which rapidly spread globally. Yet another novel coronavirus was identified as the culprit and has been named SARS-CoV-2 due to its similarities with SARS-CoV, and the disease as coronavirus disease-2019. This overview aims to compare and contrast the similarities and differences of these three major episodes of coronavirus outbreak, and conclude that they are essentially the same viral respiratory syndromes caused by similar strains of coronavirus with different names. Coronaviruses have caused major epidemics and outbreaks worldwide in the last two decades. From an epidemiological perspective, they are remarkably similar in the mode of spread by droplets. Special focus is placed on the pediatric aspects, which carry less morbidity and mortality in all three entities.","Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Karen Ka Yan; Leung, Alexander K C; Sridhar, Siddharth; Qian, Suyun; Lee, So Lun; Colin, Andrew A",Pediatr Pulmonol,341,23

On the other hand, X-ray, a different type of imaging procedure, is inexpensive, often available at the bedside and more widely available, but offers a simpler, two dimensional image. We show that by relying on a model that learns to generate CT images from X-rays synthetically, we can improve the automatic disease classification accuracy and provide clinicians with a different look at the pulmonary disease process. Specifically, we investigate Tuberculosis (TB), a deadly bacterial infectious disease that predominantly affects the lungs, but also other organ systems. We show that relying on synthetically generated CT improves TB identification by 7.50% and distinguishes TB properties up to 12.16% better than the X-ray baseline.","Lewis, Ashia; Mahmoodi, Evanjelin; Zhou, Yuyue; Coffee, Megan; Sizikova, Elena",,341,16

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 134 residents aged &#8805;65 years with different frailty and disability profiles in five long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Albacete, Spain. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Residents were administered two vaccine doses as per the label, and antibody levels were determined 21.9 days (SD 9.3) after both the first and second dose. Functional variables were assessed using activities of daily living (Barthel Index), and frailty status was determined with the FRAIL instrument. Cognitive status and comorbidity were also evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age was 82.9 years (range 65-99), and 71.6% were female. The mean antibody titers in residents with and without previous COVID-19 infection were 49,878 AU/ml and 15,274 AU/ml, respectively (mean difference 34,604; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27,699-41,509).

We also investigate impacts of the opening of four new light rail stations in 2016 and of increased community-based policing starting in late 2018. Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes-larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property-and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: city-wide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new community-based policing measures. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions. While our research detects changes in reported crime, it does not provide causative explanations. Our work, along with other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, may be useful to law enforcement and policymakers to assess the overall effect of Proposition 47.","Crodelle, Jennifer; Vallejo, Celeste; Schmidtchen, Markus; Topaz, Chad M; D039,; Orsogna, Maria R",PLoS One,341,1

By analyzing large public NGS datasets, we map the landscape of non-canonical cysteines in human variable heavy-chain domains (VHs) at the repertoire level. We identify remarkable usage of non-canonical cysteines within the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR-H3) and other CDRs and framework regions. Furthermore, our study reveals the diversity and location of non-canonical cysteines and their associated motifs in human VHs, which are reminiscent of and more complex than those found in other non-human species such as chicken, camel, llama, shark, and cow. These results explain how non-canonical cysteines strategically occur in the human antibodyome to expand its paratope space.

Like other low- and middle-income countries, Bangladeshi schools lack facilities for girls to change and dispose of their menstrual absorbents. We explored existing systems for disposing of menstrual absorbent wastes in urban and rural schools of Bangladesh and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of alternative disposal options. METHODS: We explored how girls dispose of their menstrual products, identified girls' preferences and choices for a disposal system and piloted four disposal options in four different schools. We then implemented one preferred option in four additional schools. We explored girls', teachers', and janitors' perspectives and evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and potential for sustainability of the piloted disposal system. RESULTS: Barriers to optimal menstrual hygiene management included lack of functional toilets and private locations for changing menstrual products, and limited options for disposal. Girls, teachers, and janitors preferred and ranked the chute disposal system as their first choice, because it has large capacity (765 L), is relatively durable, requires less maintenance, and will take longer time to fill. During implementation of the chute disposal system in four schools, girls, teachers, and janitors reported positive changes in toilet cleanliness and menstrual products disposal resulting from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The chute disposal system for menstrual products is a durable option that does not require frequent emptying or regular maintenance, and is accepted by schoolgirls and janitors alike, and can improve conditions for menstrual hygiene management in schools. However, regular supervision, motivation of girls to correctly dispose of their products, and a long-term maintenance and management plan for the system are necessary.","Jahan, Farjana; Nuruzzaman, Md; Sultana, Farhana; Mahfuz, Mehjabin Tishan; Rahman, Mahbubur; Akhand, Farhana; Luby, Stephen P; Unicomb, Leanne; Winch, Peter J",BMC Public Health,341,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.","Rabin, Carolyn; Dutra, Sunny",Psychol Health Med,341,24

The relations remain constant after several robustness tests. These findings suggest that investors concern about the potential risk when firms are located in the provinces with higher threats to public health.

It was recently reported that the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role for capturing SARS-CoV-2 into the human target body, and binding studies were performed using biosensors techniques based on surface plasmon resonance and bio-layer interferometry. The published affinity constants for the interactions, derived using the traditional approach, described a single interaction between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We reanalyzed these data sets using our advanced four-step approach based on an adaptive interaction distribution algorithm (AIDA) that accounts for the great complexity of larger biomolecules and gives a two-dimensional distribution of association and dissociation rate constants. Our results showed that in both cases the standard assumption about a single interaction was erroneous, and in one of the cases, the value of the affinity constant KD differed more than 300% between the reported value and our calculation. This information can prove very useful in providing mechanistic information and insights about the mechanism of interactions between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD or similar systems.","Forssén, Patrik; Samuelsson, Jörgen; Lacki, Karol; Fornstedt, Torgny",Anal Chem,341,24

Positive patients had surgery deferred until a negative swab. At IEO, radical surgeries declined by 6% as compared to the same period in 2019 (n = 1477 vs. 1560, respectively). Readmissions were required for 3% (n = 41), and <1% (n = 9) developed COVID-19, of which only one had severe disease and died. At SELCA, radical surgeries declined by 34% (n = 1553 vs. 2336). Readmissions were required for 11% (n = 36), <1% (n = 7) developed COVID-19, and none died from it. Whilst a decline in number of surgeries was observed in both centres, the implemented COVID-19 minimal pathways have shown to be safe for cancer patients requiring radical treatment, with limited complications and almost no COVID-19 infections.","Monroy-Iglesias, Maria J; Tagliabue, Marta; Dickinson, Harvey; Roberts, Graham; De Berardinis, Rita; Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; Irwin, Sophie; Olsburgh, Jonathon; Cocco, Ivana Maria Francesca; Schizas, Alexis; McCrindle, Sarah; Nath, Rahul; Brunet, Aina; Simo, Ricard; Tornari, Chrysostomos; Srinivasan, Parthi; Prachalias, Andreas; Davies, Andrew; Geh, Jenny; Fraser, Stephanie; Routledge, Tom; Ma, RuJun; Doerge, Ella; Challacombe, Ben; Nair, Raj; Hadjipavlou, Marios; Scarpinata, Rosaria; Sorelli, Paolo; Dolly, Saoirse; Mistretta, Francesco Alessandro; Musi, Gennaro; Casiraghi, Monica; Aloisi, Alessia; Dell039,; Acqua, Andrea; Scaglione, Donatella; Zanoni, Stefania; Rampazio Da Silva, Daniele; Brambilla, Daniela; Bertolotti, Raffaella; Peruzzotti, Giulia; Maggioni, Angelo; de Cobelli, Ottavio; Spaggiari, Lorenzo; Ansarin, Mohssen; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Gandini, Sara; Jain, Urvashi; Hamed, Hisham; Haire, Kate",,341,20

For over three decades, since the term was used in public little has been done about it. Such important activities for the protection of our ecosystem have been mainly discussed at scientific conferences or in the comfort of academic lecture halls. Successive global crises, especially the ecological, economic, financial and now humanitarian one related to the COVID-19 pandemic have demolished global economies, sidelined the development of a sustainable economy and especially sustainable construction, treating it more as a whim of the rich than expedience. The construction sector accounts for up to 40 per cent of the global carbon dioxide emissions and generates more than 0.5 billion tonnes of waste every year. However, when it comes to improving macroeconomic indicators after another crisis, the easiest way to look for savings is to use the production of emerging markets, without considering their lower economic and environmental awareness. Each time, the lust for profit prevailed over environmental protection. Education, business, and institutional factors failed, as indicated in the conclusions.

However, the impact of COVID-19 on blood glucose has not been fully understood. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize available data on the association between glycemic parameters and severity of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched from December 1, 2019 to May 15, 2020. Observational studies investigating blood glucose or glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) according to the severity of COVID-19 were considered for inclusion. Two independent researchers extracted data from eligible studies using a standardized data extraction sheet and then proceeded to cross check the results. Data were pooled using a fixed- or random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Three studies reported blood glucose and HbA1c according to the severity of COVID-19 and were included in this meta-analysis. The combined results showed that severe COVID-19 was associated with higher blood glucose (WMD 2.21, 95% CI: 1.30-3.13, P < 0.001). In addition, HbA1c was slightly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19, yet this difference did not reach significance (WMD 0.29, 95% CI: -0.59 to 1.16, P = 0.52). Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that severe COVID-19 is associated with increased blood glucose. This highlights the need to effectively monitor blood glucose to improve prognosis in patients infected with COVID-19.","Chen, Juan; Wu, Chunhua; Wang, Xiaohang; Yu, Jiangyi; Sun, Zilin",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),341,16

In type 2 diabetes, there is a change in immune system cells, which shift from an anti-inflammatory to a predominantly pro-inflammatory pattern. This altered immune profile may induce important clinical consequences, including increased susceptibility to lung infections; and enhanced local inflammatory response. Furthermore, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzyme is highly expressed in the lung, and that it may have additional actions besides its effects on glucose metabolism, which might exert profound pro-inflammatory effects. We briefly review the impact on the inflammatory system of DPP4 for its possible detrimental effect on COVID-19 syndrome, and of DPP4 inhibitors (gliptins), currently used as glucose lowering agents, which may have the potential to exert positive pleiotropic effect on inflammatory diseases, in addition to their effects on glucose metabolism. Thanks to these ancillary effects, gliptins could potentially be ""repurposed"" as salutary drugs against COVID-19 syndrome, even in non-diabetic subjects. Clinical studies should be designed to investigate this possibility.","Pantanetti, Paola; Cangelosi, Giovanni; Ambrosio, Giuseppe",Intern Emerg Med,341,24

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to define the impact of COVID-19 in adults with CHD and to identify risk factors associated with adverse outcomes. METHODS: Adults (age 18 years or older) with CHD and with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 were included from CHD centers worldwide. Data collection included anatomic diagnosis and subsequent interventions, comorbidities, medications, echocardiographic findings, presenting symptoms, course of illness, and outcomes. Predictors of death or severe infection were determined. RESULTS: From 58 adult CHD centers, the study included 1,044 infected patients (age: 35.1 ± 13.0 years; range 18 to 86 years; 51% women), 87% of whom had laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. The cohort included 118 (11%) patients with single ventricle and/or Fontan physiology, 87 (8%) patients with cyanosis, and 73 (7%) patients with pulmonary hypertension. There were 24 COVID-related deaths (case/fatality: 2.3%; 95% confidence interval: 1.4% to 3.2%). Factors associated with death included male sex, diabetes, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency, and previous hospital admission for heart failure. Worse physiological stage was associated with mortality (p = 0.001), whereas anatomic complexity or defect group were not. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mortality in adults with CHD is commensurate with the general population. The most vulnerable patients are those with worse physiological stage, such as cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension, whereas anatomic complexity does not appear to predict infection severity.","Broberg, Craig S; Kovacs, Adrienne H; Sadeghi, Soraya; Rosenbaum, Marlon S; Lewis, Matthew J; Carazo, Matthew R; Rodriguez, Fred H; Halpern, Dan G; Feinberg, Jodi; Galilea, Francisca Arancibia; Baraona, Fernando; Cedars, Ari M; Ko, Jong M; Porayette, Prashob; Maldonado, Jennifer; Sarubbi, Berardo; Fusco, Flavia; Frogoudaki, Alexandra A; Nir, Amiram; Chaudhry, Anisa; John, Anitha S; Karbassi, Arsha; Hoskoppal, Arvind K; Frischhertz, Benjamin P; Hendrickson, Benjamin; Bouma, Berto J; Rodriguez-Monserrate, Carla P; Broda, Christopher R; Tobler, Daniel; Gregg, David; Martinez-Quintana, Efren; Yeung, Elizabeth; Krieger, Eric V; Ruperti-Repilado, Francisco J; Giannakoulas, George; Lui, George K; Ephrem, Georges; Singh, Harsimran S; Almeneisi, Hassan Mk; Bartlett, Heather L; Lindsay, Ian; Grewal, Jasmine; Nicolarsen, Jeremy; Araujo, John J; Cramer, Jonathan W; Bouchardy, Judith; Al Najashi, Khalid; Ryan, Kristi; Alshawabkeh, Laith; Andrade, Lauren",J Am Coll Cardiol,341,24

DATA SOURCES: Eligible studies published until May 28, 2020, were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, medRxiv, and bioRxiv collection databases. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: This systematic review included cohort studies, case series, and case reports of pregnant women who received a coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis using severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test and had reported data regarding the testing of neonates or fetuses for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immediately after birth and within 48 hours of birth. A total of 30 eligible case reports describing 43 tested neonates and 38 cohort or case series studies describing 936 tested neonates were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The methodological quality of all included studies was evaluated by a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Quantitative synthesis was performed on cohort or case series studies according to the neonatal biological specimen site to reach pooled proportions of vertical transmission. RESULTS: Our quantitative synthesis revealed that of 936 neonates from mothers with coronavirus disease 2019, 27 neonates had a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test using nasopharyngeal swab, indicating a pooled proportion of 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.3) for vertical transmission. Of note, the pooled proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity in neonates by nasopharyngeal swab in studies from China was 2.0% (8/397), which was similar to the pooled proportion of 2.7% (14/517) in studies from outside of China. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA testing in neonatal cord blood was positive in 2.9% of samples (1/34), 7.7% of placenta samples (2/26), 0% of amniotic fluid (0/51), 0% of urine samples (0/17), and 9.7% of fecal or rectal swabs (3/31). Neonatal serology was positive in 3 of 82 samples (3.7%) (based on the presence of immunoglobulin M). CONCLUSION: Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is possible and seems to occur in a minority of cases of maternal coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the third trimester. The rates of infection are similar to those of other pathogens that cause congenital infections. However, given the paucity of early trimester data, no assessment can yet be made regarding the rates of vertical transmission in early pregnancy and potential risk for consequent fetal morbidity and mortality.","Kotlyar, Alexander M; Grechukhina, Olga; Chen, Alice; Popkhadze, Shota; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Tal, Oded; Taylor, Hugh S; Tal, Reshef",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,341,21

We reported previously that VCAM-1 mediates monocyte adhesion to LSECs. However, the pathogenic role of VCAM-1 in NASH is unclear. Herein, we report that VCAM-1 was a top upregulated adhesion molecule in the NASH mouse liver transcriptome. Open chromatin landscape profiling combined with genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed robust transcriptional upregulation of LSEC VCAM-1 in murine NASH. Moreover, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was significantly increased in human NASH. LSEC VCAM-1 expression was upregulated by palmitate treatment in vitro and reduced with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase (MAP3K) mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3). Likewise, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was reduced in the Mlk3-/- mice with diet-induced NASH. Furthermore, VCAM-1 neutralizing Ab or pharmacological inhibition attenuated diet-induced NASH in mice, mainly via reducing the proinflammatory monocyte hepatic population as examined by mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF). Moreover, endothelium-specific Vcam1 knockout mice were also protected against NASH. In summary, lipotoxic stress enhances the expression of LSEC VCAM-1, in part, through MLK3 signaling. Inhibition of VCAM-1 was salutary in murine NASH and might serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for human NASH.","Furuta, Kunimaro; Guo, Qianqian; Pavelko, Kevin D; Lee, Jeong-Heon; Robertson, Keith D; Nakao, Yasuhiko; Melek, Jan; Shah, Vijay H; Hirsova, Petra; Ibrahim, Samar H",J. clin. invest,341,1

Being a new disease there is lack of information about pathogenesis and proliferation pathways of this new coronavirus. Currently there is no effective treatment for coronavirus infection; major effort is to develop vaccine against the virus and development of therapeutic drugs for the disease. The development of genome-based vaccine and therapeutic antibodies require thorough testing for safety and will be available after some time. In the meanwhile, the available practical approach is to repurpose existing therapeutic agents, with proven safety record as a rapid response measure for the current pandemic.

As a high infectious pathogen, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in public space is very important for its transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals are the main places to deal with the diseases. In this work, we evaluated the exposure risk of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment in order to protect healthcare workers (HCWs). Briefly, air and surface samples from 6 different sites of 3 hospitals with different protection levels were collected and tested for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by reverse transcription real-time fluorescence PCR method during the COVID-19 epidemic. We found that the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was 7.7 % in a COVID-19 respiratory investigation wards and 82.6 % in a ICUs with confirmed COVID-19 patients. These results indicated that in some wards of the hospital, such as ICUs occupied by COVID-19 patients, the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 existed in the air and surface, which indicates the potential occupational exposure risk of HCWs. This study has clarified retention of SARS-CoV-2 in different sites of hospital, suggesting that it is necessary to monitor and disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in hospital environment during COVID-19 pandemic, and will help to prevent the iatrogenic infection and nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and to better protect the HCWs.","Ge, Xing-Yi; Pu, Ying; Liao, Ce-Heng; Huang, Wen-Fen; Zeng, Qi; Zhou, Hui; Yi, Bin; Wang, Ai-Min; Dou, Qing-Ya; Zhou, Peng-Cheng; Chen, Hui-Ling; Liu, Hui-Xia; Xu, Dao-Miao; Chen, Xiang; Huang, Xun",Sustainable Cities Soc.,341,1

The policy responses of governments to the pandemic should be integrated with public behavioral changes. This study examines public attitudes, practices and perceived quarantine competency in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive design using an online survey was employed. Convenience and snowball sampling were adopted, and 1022 valid responses were received. FINDINGS: Most respondents demonstrated satisfactory practices, including wearing face masks (76.5%), keeping a safe distance (97.8%) and appropriate hand hygiene (99.2%). Fear of stigma (8.9%) and of financial consequences (0%) were minimal drivers of underreporting of symptoms among the respondents, whereas uncertainty of the relevance of symptoms (30.3%) was a main cause of not reporting to health authorities. Most participants (73.4%) abided by government instructions due to fear of infection rather than of legal penalties. Participants, especially females and Saudi citizens, reported a high level of perceived quarantine competence (12.9 ± 2.59). Spearman's rho correlation showed a significant positive association between wearing face masks and other precautionary practices, including keeping a safe distance (0.25, P < .01) and frequent handwashing (0.224, P < .01), which rules out the concern that wearing face masks would result in less adherence of the participants to other protective measures. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 awareness programs should focus more on males and non-Saudi populations. We also recommend the development of screening protocols and education programs for asthmatic patients in Saudi Arabia to avoid the consequences of confusing COVID-19 symptoms with those of asthma.","Almarwani, Abdulaziz Mofdy; Aljohani, Mohammed Saeed; Eweda, Ghada",Int J Clin Pract,341,24

The Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing ""red zones"" need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS: In all Italian provinces a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 km and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities. Such an approach can be useful to identify the red zones in future epidemics due to highly infective pathogens similar to SARS-CoV-2.","Tripepi, Giovanni; Plebani, Mario; Iervasi, Giorgio; Gori, Mercedes; Leonardis, Daniela; D039,; Arrigo, Graziella; Fusaro, Maria",Eur. j. public health,341,1

Through an online survey, we demonstrated variable adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PPE guidelines among health care personnel (HCP). METHODS: CDC guidelines for optimal and acceptable PPE usage in common situations faced by frontline health care workers were referenced to create a short online survey. The survey was distributed to national, statewide, and local professional organizations across the United States and to HCP, using a snowball sampling technique. Responses were collected between June 15 and July 17, 2020. RESULTS: Responses totaling 2245 were received from doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, and medical technicians in 44 states. Eight states with n > 20 (Arizona, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington) and a total of 436 responses are included in the quantitative analysis. Adherence to CDC guidelines was observed to be highest in the scenario of patient contact when COVID-19 was not suspected (86.47%) and lowest when carrying out aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) (42.47%).

To date, studies on COVID-19 have consistently shown that pediatric patients generally have relatively milder cytokine release syndrome and lower mortality rates than adults. Interestingly, similar phenomena of relatively mild symptoms in children have been observed in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In fact, in the early stage of life, there are many mechanisms that spontaneously regulate excessive inflammatory responses. Milk, as the main food of infants, not only provides necessary energy and nutrients but also plays an important role in regulating homeostasis related to the immune system, gut microecology and nutrition balance.

The rapid growth of IoT technology has revolutionized human life by inaugurating the concept of smart devices, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart city, smart grid, among others. IoT devices' security has become a serious concern nowadays, especially for the healthcare domain, where recent attacks exposed damaging IoT security vulnerabilities. Traditional network security solutions are well established. However, due to the resource constraint property of IoT devices and the distinct behavior of IoT protocols, the existing security mechanisms cannot be deployed directly for securing the IoT devices and network from the cyber-attacks. To enhance the level of security for IoT, researchers need IoT-specific tools, methods, and datasets. To address the mentioned problem, we provide a framework for developing IoT context-aware security solutions to detect malicious traffic in IoT use cases. The proposed framework consists of a newly created, open-source IoT data generator tool named IoT-Flock. The IoT-Flock tool allows researchers to develop an IoT use-case comprised of both normal and malicious IoT devices and generate traffic. Additionally, the proposed framework provides an open-source utility for converting the captured traffic generated by IoT-Flock into an IoT dataset. Using the proposed framework in this research, we first generated an IoT healthcare dataset which comprises both normal and IoT attack traffic. Afterwards, we applied different machine learning techniques to the generated dataset to detect the cyber-attacks and protect the healthcare system from cyber-attacks. The proposed framework will help in developing the context-aware IoT security solutions, especially for a sensitive use case like IoT healthcare environment.","Hussain, Faisal; Abbas, Syed Ghazanfar; Shah, Ghalib A; Pires, Ivan Miguel; Fayyaz, Ubaid U; Shahzad, Farrukh; Garcia, Nuno M; Zdravevski, Eftim",Sensors (Basel),341,12

Two MPC strategies are designed: a) a centralized MPC, which coordinates a single control policy for both states; and b) a decentralized strategy, for which one optimization is solved for each state. Simulation results are shown to illustrate and compare both control strategies. The framework serves as guidelines to deals with such pandemic phenomena.","Morato, Marcelo M.; Pataro, Igor M.

Methods: Using an individual-based model, we simulated the spread of COVID-19 in Daegu. An individual can be infected through close contact with infected people in a household, at work/school, and at religious and social gatherings. We created a synthetic population from census sample data. Then, 9,000 people were randomly selected from the entire population of Daegu and set as members of the hotspot of the Shincheonji church. We did not take into account population movements to and from other regions in South Korea. Results: Using the individual-based model, the cumulative confirmed cases in Daegu through March 26, 2020, were reproduced, and it was confirmed that the hotspot had a different probability of infection than non-hotspot areas. For 3 scenarios (I: school closing, II: school opening after April 6, III: school opening after April 6 and the mean period from symptom onset to hospitalization increasing to 4.3 days), we predicted future changes in the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Daegu. Conclusion: Compared to scenario I, it was found that in scenario III, the cumulative number of patients would increase by 107 and the date of occurrence of the last patient would be delayed by 92 days.","Son, Woo-Sik; Team, RISEWIDs",Epidemiol Health,341,16

Anesthesiologists are vulnerable to acquiring the disease during aerosol-generating procedures in operating theater and intensive care units. High index of suspicion, detailed history including travel history, strict hand hygiene, use of face masks, and appropriate personal protective equipment are some ways to minimize the risk of exposure to disease. Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, modification of anesthesia regimen based on the procedure performed, and HCP safety are some implications relevant to a neuroanesthesiologist. National and international guidelines, recommendations, and position statements help in risk stratification, prioritization, and scheduling of neurosurgery and neurointervention procedures. Institutional protocols can be formulated based on the guidelines wherein each HCP has a definite role in this ever-changing scenario.

Extension has not only been an audience for Agricultural Safety and Health Center work, but also an essential partner in promoting evidence-based farm health and safety in communities. This commentary stems from a collaborative effort among Center leaders across the nation who developed a set of surveys to explore the ways COVID-19 has affected Extension professionals. Preliminary data gathered from across the nation suggest that while many Extension professionals feel prepared to address challenges from the pandemic and are well supported by their State and Center's resources, over half also reported moderate to great difficulty in balancing personal and professional needs and, to a lesser extent, balancing remote work and family needs. Because Extension professionals act as connectors between Agricultural Safety and Health Centers and farmers and their families, they serve in a role similar to first-responders. COVID-19 has exacerbated the potential for anxiety, stress, and other mental health concerns among this group. With COVID-19 numbers rising at an especially fast rate among agricultural workers, it is important to attend to the wellbeing of the professionals who work with them.","Sampson, Shannon; Mazur, Joan; Israel, Glenn; Galindo, Sebastian; Ward, Cassandra",J Agromedicine,341,11

Within the United States, some of the most affected regions have been New York, and Northern New Jersey. Our objective is to describe the impact of COVID-19 in a large delivery service in Northern New Jersey, including its effects on labor and delivery (L&D), the newborn nursery, and the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 21, 2020 and May 5, 2020, a total of 78 mothers (3.6% of deliveries) were identified by screening history or examination to either be COVID-19 positive or possible positives (persons under investigation). Of the mothers who were tested after admission to L&D, 28% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION: Isolation between mother and infant was recommended in 62 cases, either because the mother was positive for SARS-CoV-2 or because the test was still pending. Fifty-four families (87%) agreed to isolation and separation. The majority of infants, 51 (94%), were initially isolated on the newborn nursery. Six needed NICU admission. No infants had clinical evidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Fourteen infants whose mothers were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and who had been separated from the mother at birth were tested for SARS-CoV-2 postnatally. All were negative. RESULTS: COVID-19 posed a significant burden to mothers, infants, and staff over the 5-week study period. The yield from screening mothers for COVID-19 on L&D was high. Most families accepted the need for postnatal isolation and separation of mother and newborn. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to her fetus/newborn seems to be uncommon if appropriate separation measures are performed at birth. KEY POINTS: · The yield of targeted testing for SARS-CoV-2, on mothers on Labor and Delivery is high.. · Agreement to separation of mothers and infants to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was high.. · The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in newborns is low, if appropriate separation occurs at birth..","Griffin, Ian; Benarba, Farah; Peters, Caryn; Oyelese, Yinka; Murphy, Tom; Contreras, Diana; Gagliardo, Christina; Nwaobasi-Iwuh, Eberechi; DiPentima, M Cecilia; Schenkman, Andrew",Am J Perinatol,341,6

We additionally considered how participants 'shielding' due to underlying health complications, or living alone, performed. We predicted that performance would be poorest under strictest, most-isolating conditions. At five timepoints over 13 weeks, participants (N = 342; aged 18-72 years) completed online tasks measuring attention, memory, decision-making, time-estimation, and learning. Participants indicated their mood as 'lockdown' was eased. Performance typically improved as opportunities for social contact increased. Interactions between participant sub-groups and timepoint demonstrated that performance was shaped by individuals' social isolation levels. Social isolation is linked to cognitive decline in the absence of ageing covariates. The impact of social isolation on cognitive function should be considered when implementing prolonged pandemic-related restrictive conditions.","Ingram, Joanne; Hand, Christopher J; Maciejewski, Greg",Appl. cogn. psychol,341,16

For hospices with terminally ill patients, the trade-off between compassion and infection control becomes a difficult decision. This study aimed to survey the changes in visiting policy for all 76 hospice wards in Taiwan during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The altered visiting policies were assessed by the number of visitors per patient allowed at one time, the daily number of visiting slots, the number of hours open daily, and requisites for hospice ward entry. The differences in visiting policies between hospice wards and ordinary wards were also investigated. Data were collected by reviewing the official website of each hospital and were supplemented by phone calls in cases where no information was posted on the website. One quarter (n = 20) of hospice wards had different visiting policies to those of ordinary wards in the same hospital. Only one hospice ward operated an open policy, and in contrast, nine (11.8%) stopped visits entirely. Among the 67 hospice wards that allowed visiting, at most, two visitors at one time per patient were allowed in 46 (68.6%), one visiting time daily was allowed in 32 (47.8%), one hour of visiting per day was allowed in 29 (43.3%), and checking of identity and travel history was carried out in 12 wards (17.9%). During the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all hospice wards in Taiwan changed their visiting policies, but the degree of restriction varied. Further studies could measure the impacts of visiting policy changes on patients and healthcare professionals.","Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Liu, Ya-An; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Lee, Hsiao-Wen; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),341,15

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q heterogeneity test and I². This meta-analysis included 634,338 COVID-19 patients from 16 studies. Our findings revealed that pre-diagnosis with mental disorders increased the risk of COVID-19 mortality and severity. This increase in the risk of COVID-19 mortality and severity remained significant in the model that only included the studies that adjusted for confounding variables. Furthermore, higher mortality was noticed in the included studies among schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders patients compared to mood disorders patients. In this meta-analysis we provided two models which both reported a significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality among patients with mental disorders, and with the upcoming COVID-19 vaccines, we recommend to give this category the priority in the vaccination campaigns along with medical health providers and elderly.","Toubasi, Ahmad A; AbuAnzeh, Rand B; Tawileh, Hind B Abu; Aldebei, Renad H; Alryalat, Saif Aldeen S",Psychiatry Res,341,11

Despite the COVID-19 influence, the tourism sector remains one of drivers for the global and nation economies because it plays the generating and integrating role within the context of ensuring the positive dynamics of quantitative and qualitative parameters describing the development of economic systems. Furthermore, the tourism sector is an effective multiplier with regard to enhancing the main macroeconomic indicators. A brand is a powerful means for promoting tourism in the internal and global tourism markets. Forming and supporting a nation tourism brand constitute an important goal for effective development of the tourism sector, as well as a precondition for capturing its opportunities and strategic prospects. The article's purpose is to substantiate conceptual basics and methodical frameworks regarding the formation and development of the nation tourism brand of Ukraine. Having generalized scientific and analytical researches, we have revealed that Ukraine ranks low on the level of tourism attractiveness and value of its nation tourism brand. In addition, we have observed the low level of competitiveness of its tourism sector in the global market. Therefore, there is a need to draw up a branding conception grounded in the holistic approach and implementation of its provisions into the tourism sector through a leverage portfolio, instruments of mechanisms, and recommendations concerning improvement of processes of formation, development, monitoring, and supporting the nation brand of Ukraine. The nation tourism brand of Ukraine is considered as the integral unique tourism image and a behaviour model for Ukraine as a country supplying a tourism product. A tourism product integrates outcomes of more than 50 industries of the economy and contains immanent attributes and determinants, which embody its identity and determine valuefor consumers alongside advantages for stakeholders. The formation of the nation tourism brand contemplates the structural and logical consequence of processes, which comprises six stages: brand-context, brand-monitoring, brand-start, brand-support, brand-effect, and brand-foresight. A semantic model for creating and supporting the nation tourism brand of Ukraine reflects the main groups of descriptors: stakeholders, principles, factors, functions, processes, results, and aims. The identification of these descriptors enables to indicate the content, intrinsic features, functions, and processes of the tourism branding of Ukraine. We have suggested a three-level model of the nation tourism brand's advantages for stakeholders, which describes expenses and benefits for indicated groups of stakeholders within the context of the functioning of the formed tourism brand of the country. Forming the nation tourism brand will foster ensuring the competitiveness, image, leadership positions, business perfection, customer loyalty, positive perception of tourism products by stakeholders, tourism sector, and nation tourism system of Ukraine.","Melnychenko, S.; Bosovska, M.; Okhrimenko, A.",Baltic Journal of Economic Studies,341,16

Emerging evidence demonstrates that older individuals and people with underlying metabolic conditions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The ACE-2 receptor is a part of the dual system renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) consisting of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis with a downregulation of ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. The activated ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, the ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. In effect, the balance between these two axes may determine the prognosis. The already strained ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the ACE-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise. Further evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system would be advantageous due to upregulation of Mas activation or harmful due to the concomitant ACE-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of COVID-19.","Dalan, Rinkoo; Bornstein, Stefan R; El-Armouche, Ali; Rodionov, Roman N; Markov, Alexander; Wielockx, Ben; Beuschlein, Felix; Boehm, Bernhard O",Horm Metab Res,341,15

Gordon et al. previously conducted a review of medical education developments in response to COVID-19; however, the field has rapidly evolved in the ensuing months. This scoping review aims to map the extent, range and nature of subsequent developments, summarizing the expanding evidence base and identifying areas for future research. METHODS: The authors followed the five stages of a scoping review outlined by Arskey and O'Malley. Four online databases and MedEdPublish were searched. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Included articles described developments in medical education deployed in response to COVID-19 and reported outcomes. Data extraction was completed by two authors and synthesized into a variety of maps and charts. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven articles were included: 104 were from North America, Asia and Europe; 51 were undergraduate, 41 graduate, 22 continuing medical education, and 13 mixed; 35 were implemented by universities, 75 by academic hospitals, and 17 by organizations or collaborations. The focus of developments included pivoting to online learning (n = 58), simulation (n = 24), assessment (n = 11), well-being (n = 8), telehealth (n = 5), clinical service reconfigurations (n = 4), interviews (n = 4), service provision (n = 2), faculty development (n = 2) and other (n = 9). The most common Kirkpatrick outcome reported was Level 1, however, a number of studies reported 2a or 2b. A few described Levels 3, 4a, 4b or other outcomes (e.g. quality improvement). CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review mapped the available literature on developments in medical education in response to COVID-19, summarizing developments and outcomes to serve as a guide for future work. The review highlighted areas of relative strength, as well as several gaps. Numerous articles have been written about remote learning and simulation and these areas are ripe for full systematic reviews.

A novel flow cytometry-based system to objectively quantify phenotypic effects of HIV using a SCID mouse HAND model was developed which demonstrated that the HIV-infected mice had significant increases in astrogliosis, loss of neuronal dendritic marker, activation of murine microglia, and human macrophage explants compared to uninfected control mice. HIV p24 could also be quantified in the brains of the infected mice. Correlation of these impairments with HIV-induced brain inflammation and previous behavioral abnormalities studies in mice suggests that this model can be used as a fast and relevant throughput methodology to quantify preclinical testing of novel treatments for HAND.","Gavegnano, Christina; Haile, Woldeab; Koneru, Raj; Hurwitz, Selwyn J; Kohler, James J; Tyor, William R; Schinazi, Raymond F",J. neurovirology,341,16

DESIGN: Survey of cases. PARTICIPANTS: The study included Québec HCWs from private and public institutions with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed between March 1 and June 14, 2020. HCWs aged &#8805;18 years who worked during the exposure period and survived their illness were eligible for the survey. METHODS: After obtaining consent, 4,542 HCWs completed a standardized questionnaire. COVID-19 rates and proportions of exposures and practices were estimated and compared between ACHs and LTCFs. RESULTS: HCWs represented 13,726 (25%) of 54,005 reported COVID-19 cases in Québec and had an 11-times greater rate of COVID-19 than non-HCWs. Their secondary household attack rate was 30%. Most affected occupations were healthcare support workers, nurses and nurse assistants working in LTCFs (45%) and ACHs (30%). Compared to ACHs, HCWs in LTCFs had less training, higher staff mobility between working sites, similar PPE use, and better self-reported compliance with at-work physical distancing. Suboptimal IPC practices declined over time but were still present at the end of the first wave. CONCLUSION: Québec HCWs and their families were severely affected during the first wave of COVID-19.

While numerous seroprevalence reports have been published by blood operators during the COVID-19 pandemic, details on the assay used has not been well documented. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity of assays being used by blood operators and assess how this may affect seroprevalence estimates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed 49 blood component providers from 39 countries. Questionnaire included information on the number and identity of assays used, the detected immunoglobulin(s) and target antigen, and performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: Thirty-eight of the 49 contacted blood suppliers provided at least partial responses. The results indicate that 19 commercial and five in-house serology assays have been used by surveyed blood operators. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was the most commonly used kit and utilized by 15 blood suppliers. Two assays did not detect IgG, but detected either IgM/IgA or IgM. 68.2% of assays targeted the spike protein and 50% the nucleocapsid protein, while 18.2% targeted both viral proteins. The sensitivity and specificity of IgG-specific assays ranged from 71.9% to 100% and from 96.2% to 100%, respectively. As of 18 October 2020, the seroprevalence was below 5% in 10 of 14 countries reporting. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the diversity of assays being used. Analyses comparing blood donor seroprevalence across countries should consider assay characteristics with optimization of signal/cut-off ratios and consistent methodology to adjust for waning antibody.","Lewin, A.; Drews, S.

CENP-A defines the loci by serving as an epigenetic marker that recruits other centromere components for a functional structure. However, the mechanism that controls CENP-A regulation of centromeric chromatin integrity remains to be explored. Separate studies have shown that loss of CENP-A or the Cdk5 regulatory subunit associated protein 2 (Cdk5rap2), a key player in mitotic progression, triggers the occurrence of lagging chromosomes. This prompted us to investigate a potential link between CENP-A and Cdk5rap2 in the maintenance of centromeric chromatin integrity. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Cdk5rap2 causes reduced CENP-A expression while exogenous Cdk5rap2 expression in cells depleted of endogenous Cdk5rap2 restores CENP-A expression. Indeed, we show that Cdk5rap2 is a nuclear protein that acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of CENP-A. Cdk5rap2 interacts with the CENP-A promoter and upregulates CENP-A transcription. Accordingly, loss of Cdk5rap2 causes reduced level of centromeric CENP-A. Exogenous CENP-A expression partially inhibits the occurrence of lagging chromosomes in Cdk5rap2 knockdown cells, indicating that lagging chromosomes induced by loss of Cdk5rap2 is due, in part, to loss of CENP-A. Aside from manifesting lagging chromosomes, cells depleted of Cdk5rap2, and thus CENP-A, show increased micronuclei and chromatin bridge formation. Altogether, our findings indicate that Cdk5rap2 serves to maintain centromeric chromatin integrity partly through CENP-A.","Wang, Xidi; Rosales, Jesusa L; Gao, Xu; Lee, Ki-Young",Biomed Pharmacother,341,20

This study assessed the effect of a nationwide lockdown in France on admissions for acute surgical conditions and the subsequent impact on postoperative mortality. METHODS: This was an observational analytical study, evaluating data from a national discharge database that collected all discharge reports from any hospital in France. All adult patients admitted through the emergency department and requiring a surgical treatment between 17 March and 11 May 2020, and the equivalent period in 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the change in number of hospital admissions for acute surgical conditions. Mortality was assessed in the matched population, and stratified by region. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, 57 589 consecutive patients were admitted for acute surgical conditions, representing a decrease of 20.9 per cent compared with the 2019 cohort. Significant differences between regions were observed: the decrease was 15.6, 17.2, and 26.8 per cent for low-, intermediate- and high-prevalence regions respectively. The mortality rate was 1.92 per cent during the lockdown period and 1.81 per cent in 2019. In high-prevalence zones, mortality was significantly increased (odds ratio 1.22, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 1.40). CONCLUSION: A marked decrease in hospital admissions for surgical emergencies was observed during the lockdown period, with increased mortality in regions with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

We conducted a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire for the general public (recruited via social media) and healthcare workers (recruited via email) from the State of Qatar, and the Middle East and North Africa region to understand the knowledge of and anxiety levels around COVID-19 (April-June 2020) during the early stage of the pandemic. The final dataset used for the analysis comprised of 1658 questionnaires (53.0% of 3129 received questionnaires; 1337 [80.6%] from the general public survey and 321 [19.4%] from the healthcare survey). Knowledge about COVID-19 was significantly different across the two survey populations, with a much higher proportion of healthcare workers possessing better COVID-19 knowledge than the general public (62.9% vs. 30.0%, p < 0.0001). A reverse effect was observed for anxiety, with a higher proportion of very anxious (or really frightened) respondents among the general public compared to healthcare workers (27.5% vs. 11.5%, p < 0.0001). A higher proportion of the general public tended to overestimate their chance of dying if they become ill with COVID-19, with 251 (18.7%) reporting the chance of dying (once COVID-19 positive) to be &#8805;25% versus 19 (5.9%) of healthcare workers (p < 0.0001). Good knowledge about COVID-19 was associated with low levels of anxiety. Panic and unfounded anxiety, as well as casual and carefree attitudes, can propel risk taking and mistake-making, thereby increasing vulnerability.

I considered the number of US physician deaths in comparison to the expected COVID death rate in the general population. AIMS: To estimate the whether US physicians are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 due to occupational exposures. METHODS: COVID-related physician deaths were identified through searches using Medscape In Memoriam, and multiple internet searches using Google and Facebook. An obituary or death notice was obtained in all but one case. Death rates among physicians were compared to the expected rate based on COVID deaths in the US population. RESULTS: Up to 7 October 2020, there were 108 deaths among US physicians. Physicians make up about 0.33% of the US population. By 1 October 2020, there were 210 000 COVID deaths in the US population with 693 expected physician deaths. Observed deaths were 16% of expected. Seventy-five per cent of the deaths occurred among physicians older than age 60 and about half appeared to be among those retired from clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Observed physician deaths were significantly below expected based on deaths the general population.

As we begin to emerge from the crisis, we will need to manage the backlog of nonemergency neurosurgical patients whose treatment has been delayed and remain responsive to further possible surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to identify the core themes and challenges that will limit resumption of a normal neurosurgical service after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to provide pragmatic advice and solutions that could be of utility to clinicians seeking to resume nonemergency neurosurgical care. We reviewed the relevant international policies, a wide range of journalistic and media sources, and expert opinion documents to address the stated aims. RESULTS: We have presented and discussed a range of factors that could become potential barriers to resuming full elective neurosurgical provision and important steps that must be completed to achieve pre-SARS-CoV-2 surgical capacity. We also explored how these challenges can be overcome and outlined the key requirements for a successful neurosurgical exit strategy from the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The performance of nonemergency neurosurgery can start once minimum criteria have been fulfilled: 1) a structured prioritization of surgical cases; 2) virus infection incidence decreased sufficiently to release previously diverted healthcare resources; 3) adequate safety criteria met for patients and staff, including sufficient personal protective equipment and robust testing availability; and 4) maintenance of systems for rapid communication at organizational and individual levels.","Hill, Ciaran S; Muirhead, William R; Vakharia, Vejay N; Marcus, Hani J; Choi, David",World Neurosurg,341,16

I first trace the development of the emotion recognition industry, before examining attempts by vibraimage's developers and affiliates scientifically to legitimate the technology, concluding that the disciplining power and corporate value of vibraimage is generated through its very opacity, in contrast to increasing demands across the social sciences for transparency. I propose the term 'suspect AI' to describe the growing number of systems like vibraimage that algorithmically classify suspects / non-suspects, yet are themselves deeply suspect.

METHODS: A retrospective study including COVID-19 patients admitted to an Italian hospital between March 1 and July 1, 2020. Predictors of viral clearance (VC) and prolonged VS from the upper respiratory tract were assessed by Poisson regression and logistic regression analyses. The causal relation between VS and clinical outcomes was evaluated through an inverse probability weighted Cox model. RESULTS: The study included 536 subjects. The median duration of VS from symptoms onset was 18 days. The estimated 30-day probability of VC was 70.2%. Patients with comorbidities, lymphopenia at hospital admission, or moderate/severe respiratory disease had a lower chance of VC. The development of moderate/severe respiratory failure, delayed hospital admission after symptoms onset, baseline comorbidities, or D-dimer >1000ng/mL at admission independently predicted prolonged VS. The achievement of VC doubled the chance of clinical recovery and reduced the probability of death/mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory disease severity, comorbidities, delayed hospital admission and inflammatory markers negatively predicted VC, which resulted to be associated with better clinical outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of prompt hospitalization of symptomatic patients, especially where signs of severity or comorbidities are present.","Mondi, Annalisa; Lorenzini, Patrizia; Castilletti, Concetta; Gagliardini, Roberta; Lalle, Eleonora; Corpolongo, Angela; Valli, Maria Beatrice; Taglietti, Fabrizio; Cicalini, Stefania; Loiacono, Laura; Di Gennaro, Francesco; D039,; Offizi, Gianpiero; Palmieri, Fabrizio; Nicastri, Emanuele; Agrati, Chiara; Petrosillo, Nicola; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Vaia, Francesco; Girardi, Enrico; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Antinori, Andrea; Zito, Sara; Abbonizio, Maria Alessandra; Abdeddaim, Amina; Agostini, Elisabetta; Albarello, Fabrizio; Amadei, Gioia; Amendola, Alessandra; Antonica, Maria Assunta; Antonini, Mario; Bartoli, Tommaso Ascoli; Baldini, Francesco; Barbaro, Raffaella; Bartolini, Barbara; Bellagamba, Rita; Benigni, Martina; Bevilacqua, Nazario; Biava, Gianluigi; Bibas, Michele; Bordi, Licia; Bordoni, Veronica; Boumis, Evangelo; Branca, Marta; Buonomo, Rosanna; Busso, Donatella; Camici, Marta; Campioni, Paolo; Canichella, Flaminia",Int J Infect Dis,341,6

When zoonotic viruses jump to a new host, they undergo both mutational and natural selective pressures that result in non-synonymous and synonymous adaptive changes, necessary for efficient replication and rapid spread of diseases in new host species. The nucleotide composition and codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 indicate the presence of a highly conserved, gene-specific codon usage bias. The codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is mostly antagonistic to human and bat codon usage. SARS-CoV-2 codon usage bias is mainly shaped by the natural selection, while mutational pressure plays a minor role. The time-series analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome indicates that the virus is slowly evolving. Virus isolates from later stages of the outbreak have more biased codon usage and nucleotide composition than virus isolates from early stages of the outbreak.","Hussain, Snawar; Rasool, Sahibzada Tasleem; Pottathil, Shinu",J. mol. evol,341,24

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities. SUMMARY: In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards. Ultimately, the expected rebound in STI/HIV incidence will require an appropriate and timely public health response.

In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? METHOD: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation RESULTS: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and ""extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs"", all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are ""incredibly vulnerable to this virus"". CONCLUSIONS: Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.","Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Quezado, Rosa Magda Martins; Mendonça, Elayne Cristina Santos; de Araújo, Tallys Iury; Luz, Dayse Christina Rodrigues Pereira; de Santana, Willma José; Sampaio, Juliana Ribeiro Francelino; Carvalho, Poliana Moreira de Medeiros; Arrais, Tereza Maria Siqueira Nascimento; Landim, José Marcondes Macedo; da Silva, Claúdio Gleideston Lima",Psychiatry Res,341,16

The SARS-CoV-2 is the third most pathogenic human CoV after SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which is classified within the genus Betacoronavirus. Though the actual source of its origin and transmission is still unclear, genetic analysis has shown its very close similarity (~96%) with bat SARS-like CoV. SARS-CoV-2 is a spherically-icosahedral virus with a plus-sense single-strand RNA (~30 kb) genome defined into thirteen open reading frames, which encode 2 non-structural polyproteins, 4 structural proteins and 6 accessory proteins. Of its structural proteins the 'S1' subunit of spike (S) contains the cellular ACE-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) whereas the 'S2' subunit is required for cell membrane fusion. The membrane (M) protein participates in cell-fusion whereas envelope (E) is necessary for virion assembly and morphogenesis. The non-structural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) undergo proteolytic processing to produce a total of 16 small proteins, which are involved in mRNA synthesis and replication. Of the accessory proteins (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9b), few are known to modulate host-innate immunity. Interestingly, '3b' is absent in SARS-CoV-2 that significantly differentiates it from other human CoV. Detection of several novel mutations in '3a', '3b' and 'ORF8' proteins, notably in the 'S' RBD strongly suggest SARS-CoV-2 enhanced cell attachment and facilitated entry, its high infectivity and disease severity in humans. The recent emergence of highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7 strain), South Africa (B.1.351 strain) and Brazil (P.1 strain), and their subsequent spread to other counties have raised serious concerns.","Parvez, M.

In occupational environments, especially industries, due to air pollution with dust, gases and vapors and allergens and irritants, workers are susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Respiratory exposure of workers to these contaminants can adversely affect the function of their respiratory system and predispose them to respiratory diseases. In some industrial environments, due to the nature of work, workers are forced to work close to each other or use common tools and devices, thereby increasing the risk of the coronavirus outbreaks. Due to the high population density in factories and companies, it is necessary to study the prevention of the coronavirus and application of control measures. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the prevention of coronavirus in industry. Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that was performed after the pandemic of Covid-19 in April 2020. Three hundred and fifty Iranian industries were investigated in this study. In order to assess the status of Covid-19 prevention in industrial environments, a researcher-made questionnaire was used to perform the study. This study was conducted in three phases including checklist design, checklist validation and industry evaluation. The checklist questions were designed based on the latest recommendations offered by reputable international organizations. The initial questionnaire had 40 questions. To determine the validity, the questionnaire was checked carefully by a panel of experts, including 15 professors and experts in safety and emergency management. Content validity index (CVI) and content validity ratio (CVR) were also used to assess validity. Moreover, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. After designing and validating the checklist, in order to maintain ethical issues and prevent theCovid-19 outbreak the completion of the checklists' items, the checklists were prepared electronically and distributed in more than 50 social networks of occupational health professionals and HSE. The purpose of the study and how to answer the questions were fully explained to the occupational health and HSE officials. Next, the information was extracted and analyzed by SPSS software version 23. Results: After checking the validity of the designed checklist, 13 questions were removed and 27 questions remained in total. The results of face validity showed that the transparency, appropriateness and overall simplicity of the questionnaire were equal to 0.90, 0.93 and 0.91, respectively. The lowest and highest values of validity index were 0.79 and 1, respectively. Also, the minimum and maximum content validity ratios were, respectively, equal to 0.65 and 1. Total CVI and CVR values of the questionnaire were determined to be 0.87 and 0.92. Furthermore, based on the results of completed questionnaires by the industries, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the questionnaire was calculated to be 0.92. The findings of the evaluation showed that the commitment of management to the implementation of prevention programs in the industries is in good condition and most of the surveyed industries have a developed program to prevent of Covid-19. However, some areas such as telecommuting, distancing, and procuring some essential items were in poor condition. It was found that only 36.4% of the industries have taken action to strengthen local and general ventilation systems and more than 90% of them have held training programs for prevention. The most and the least supplied items were related to detergents (95.1%) and respirators (37.8%). Moreover, few industries have used the teleworking protocol (48.1%) and created an isolated room (26.1%) to isolate suspicious cases in emergencies. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the designed checklist has a high reliability and can help the management of the rganization in assessing the current situation to manage the prevention of Covid-19. The results of the evaluation illustrated that the commitment of management to implement prevention programs in industries is in good condition and most of the industries surveyed have a developed program to combat Covid-19. However, some areas, such as teleworking, spacing, and the provision of some essential items, were in an unfavorable position, requiring the strengthening of discovered weaknesses. © 2020 Iran University of Medical Sciences.

METHODS: We enrolled adult male patients who were hospitalized with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection in the study. In addition to routine laboratory and radiological tests, semen sample was obtained from volunteers and transferred to the Turkish Public Health Institution, National Virology Laboratory. The samples were processed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on the day of collection. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included in the study. The median age was 33.5 years (18-54). All but one had respiratory symptoms. None of the patients had a history or symptoms of urogenital disease. All semen samples were obtained during hospitalization and in the acute stage of the infection. The median time to obtain a semen sample after positive nasopharyngeal test was 1 day (0-7). All semen samples were detected as negative for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Although all semen samples were obtained in acute stage of the infection when the nasopharyngeal swab test was positive, we did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The results of our study support the thought that sexual transmission via semen does not have an important role in the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We think that our study will provide new information to fill the gap in the literature.","Kayaaslan, Bircan; Korukluoglu, Gulay; Hasanoglu, Imran; Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Eser, Fatma; Akinci, Esragul; Guner, Rahmet",Urol Int,341,16

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. RESULTS: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18), and for twice-weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19-compatible illness (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-exposure prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine once or twice weekly did not significantly reduce laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 or Covid-19-compatible illness among healthcare workers.","Rajasingham, Radha; Bangdiwala, Ananta S; Nicol, Melanie R; Skipper, Caleb P; Pastick, Katelyn A; Axelrod, Margaret L; Pullen, Matthew F; Nascene, Alanna A; Williams, Darlisha A; Engen, Nicole W; Okafor, Elizabeth C; Rini, Brian I; Mayer, Ingrid A; McDonald, Emily G; Lee, Todd C; Li, Peter; MacKenzie, Lauren J; Balko, Justin M; Dunlop, Stephen J; Hullsiek, Katherine H; Boulware, David R; Lofgren, Sarah M",Clin Infect Dis,341,21

AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of LOTUS China (the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China), which was a randomized trial in hospitalized subjects with COVID-9 in a respiratory sample and pneumonia. As, in severe COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no beneficial effects but increased gastrointestinal adverse effects, this combination should not be used at this stage of COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: In my opinion, the rationale for undertaking a trial of lopinavir/ritonavir in COVID-19 was poor. The analysis of a modified intention to treat group analysis in LOTUS China may have introduced bias. After LOTUS China, there is probably no future for lopinavir in the treatment of severe COVID-19, but some clinical trials for prevention or in various stages of COVID-19 have recently started or are ongoing. The major limitation of these trials is that as lopinavir does not inhibit COVID-19, it is unlikely to prevent infection, reduce viral load, or reduce the severity. However, these trials may be worthwhile in finally determining whether lopinavir has any role in preventing or treating COVID-19.","Doggrell, Sheila A",Expert Opin Investig Drugs,341,26

Therefore, here, we evaluated whether the stoppage due to the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) lockdown influenced physical performance compared to the start of LaLiga&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; in terms of high-intensity efforts. Using a semi-automatic, multiple-camera system, running activities during 22 matches were analyzed. We compared the first 11 matches of the season (pre-lockdown) with the 11 matches just after the restart of LaLiga TM (post-lockdown). The results showed higher (p &lt; 0.05) performance in the pre-lockdown period compared with the post-lockdown period, including in medium-speed running (14.1-21 km/h), high-speed running (21.1-24 km/h), and sprinting speed running distances (&gt;24 km/h). However, the number of accelerations/min and decelerations/min were significantly higher during the post-lockdown period. Therefore, we conclude that the stoppage due to the COVID-19 lockdown generated lower physical performance in the post-lockdown period compared with the pre-lockdown period, most likely due to the accumulation of matches (congested schedules).","Garcia-Aliaga, A.; Marquina, M.; Cordon-Carmona, A.; Sillero-Quintana, M.; de la Rubia, A.; Refoyo Roman, I.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],341,12

These phytochemicals may act as lead molecules for the development of safe and effective immunomodulators as potential remedies for the prevention and cure of viral diseases. Natural products are known to primarily modulate the immune system in nonspecific ways. A number of plant-based principles have been identified and isolated with potential immunomodulation activity which justify their use in traditional folklore medicine and can form the basis of further specified research. The aim of the current review is to describe and highlight the immunomodulation potential of certain plants along with their bioactive chemical constituents. Relevant literatures of recent years were searched from commonly employed scientific databases on the basis of their ethnopharmacological use. Most of the plants displaying considerable immunomodulation activity are summarized along with their possible mechanisms.

METHODS: Serial thin-section CT scans of 17 discharged patients with COVID-19 were obtained during recovery. Longitudinal changes of clinical parameters and a CT pattern were documented in all patients during the 4 weeks after admission. A CT score was used to evaluate the extent of the disease. RESULTS: There were marked improvements of fever, lymphocyte counts, C-reactive proteins, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates within the first 2 weeks after admission. However, the mean CT score rapidly increased from the first to the third week, with a top score of 8.2 obtained in the second week. During the first week, the main CT pattern was ground-glass opacities (GGO; 76.5%). The frequency of GGO (52.9%) decreased in the second week. Consolidation and mixed patterns (47.0%) were noted in the second week. Thereafter, consolidations generally dissipated into GGO, and the frequency of GGO increased in the third week (76.5%) and fourth week (71.4%). Opacities were mainly located in the peripheral (76.5%) and subpleural (47.1%) zones of the lungs; they presented as focal (35.3%) or multifocal (29.4%) in the first week and became more diffuse in the second (47.1%) and third weeks (58.8%), then showed a reduced extent in fourth week (50%). CONCLUSIONS: The progression course of the CT pattern was later than the progression of the clinical parameters within the first 2 weeks after admission; however, there were synchronized improvements in both the clinical and radiologic features in the fourth week.","Han, Xiaoyu; Cao, Yukun; Jiang, Nanchuan; Chen, Yan; Alwalid, Osamah; Zhang, Xin; Gu, Jin; Dai, Meng; Liu, Jie; Zhu, Wanyue; Zheng, Chuansheng; Shi, Heshui",Clin Infect Dis,341,24

Recent clinical data indicate higher complication rates with HCQ/AZM combination treatment in comparison to monotherapy. Here, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to systematically investigate the effects of HCQ and AZM individually and in combination. The clinically observed QT prolongation caused by treatment with HCQ could be recapitulated in iPSC-CMs based on prolonged field potential duration (FPDc). Interestingly, HCQ-induced FPDc prolongation was strongly enhanced by combined treatment with AZM, although AZM alone slightly shortened FPDc in iPSC-CMs. Furthermore, combined treatment with AZM and HCQ leads to higher cardiotoxicity, more severe structural disarrangement, and more pronounced contractile and electrophysiological dysfunctions, compared to respective mono-treatments. First mechanistic insights underlying the synergistic effects of AZM and HCQ on iPSC-CM functionality are provided based on increased Cx43- and Nav1.5-protein levels.

METHODS: We collected detailed information on transmission events and symptom status based on laboratory-confirmed patient data and contact tracing data from four provinces and one municipality in China. We estimated the variation in risk of transmission over time, and the severity of secondary infections, by symptomatic status of the infector. RESULTS: There were 393 symptomatic index cases with 3136 close contacts and 185 asymptomatic index cases with 1078 close contacts included into the study. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases were 4.1% (128/3136) and 1.1% (12/1078), respectively, corresponding to a higher transmission risk from symptomatic cases than from asymptomatic cases (OR: 3.79, 95% CI: 2.06, 6.95). Approximately 25% (32/128) and 50% (6/12) of the infected close contacts were asymptomatic from symptomatic and asymptomatic index cases, respectively, while more than one third (38%) of the infections in the close contacts of symptomatic cases were attributable to exposure to the index cases before symptom onset. Infected contacts of asymptomatic index cases were more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to be severe.

It has been found that the amount of abdominal fat may predict grade C postoperative pancreatic fistula. In this study, we analysed the value of retrorenal fat thickness in the prediction of grade C pancreatic fistula. METHODS: A total of 140 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy were retrospectively analysed. Retrorenal fat thickness and intra-abdominal fat, expressed as total fat area, visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area, were determined from computed tomography slices using the known range of attenuation values (-190 to -30). Blood loss, operating time, pancreatic texture and main pancreatic duct diameter as well as body mass index were also analysed. RESULTS: Retrorenal fat thickness (P = 0.0004), duct diameter (P = 0.0008), subcutaneous fat area (P = 0.023) and total fat area (P = 0.014) were found to be significant predictors of grade C pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSION: Although retrorenal fat tissue thickness may seem robust, it is a simple measure that can be used to predict the most severe grade of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy.","Kopljar, Mario; Coklo, Miran; Krstacic, Antonija; Krstacic, Goran; Jelec, Vjekoslav; Zovak, Mario; Pavic, Roman; Kondza, Goran",ANZ j.

Such models are usually defined as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into compartments based on qualitative characteristics, with different assumptions about the nature and rate of transfer across compartments. Though most commonly formulated as ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, in which the compartments depend only on time, recent works have also focused on partial differential equation (PDE) models, incorporating the variation of an epidemic in space. Such research on PDE models within a Susceptible, Infected, Exposed, Recovered, and Deceased (SEIRD) framework has led to promising results in reproducing COVID-19 contagion dynamics.

The repurposing of existing drugs in the market represents an effective and economical strategy commonly utilized in such investigations. In this study, we used a multiple-sequence alignment approach for preliminary screening of commercially-available drugs on SARS-CoV sequences from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) isolates. The viral genomic sequences from KSA isolates were obtained from GISAID, an open access repository housing a wide variety of epidemic and pandemic virus data. A phylogenetic analysis of the present 164 sequences from the KSA provinces was carried out using the MEGA X software, which displayed high similarity (around 98%). The sequence was then analyzed using the VIGOR4 genome annotator to construct its genomic structure. Screening of existing drugs was carried out by mining data based on viral gene expressions from the ZINC database. A total of 73 hits were generated. The viral target orthologs were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 KSA isolate sequence by multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL OMEGA, and a list of 29 orthologs with purchasable drug information was generated. The results showed that the SARS CoV replicase polyprotein 1a had the highest sequence similarity at 79.91%. Through ZINC data mining, tanshinones were found to have high binding affinities to this target. These compounds could be ideal candidates for SARS-CoV-2. Other matches ranged between 27 and 52%.

Subsequently, on March 12, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,614 deaths were reported. Coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus, from the genus Betacoronavirus, that is distributed in birds, humans, and other mammals. WHO has named the novel coronavirus disease as COVID-19. More than 80 clinical trials have been launched to test coronavirus treatment, including some drug repurposing or repositioning for COVID-19. Hence, we performed a search in March 2020 of the clinicaltrials.gov database. The eligibility criteria for the retrieved studies were: contain a clinicaltrials.gov base identifier number; describe the number of participants and the period for the study; describe the participants' clinical conditions; and utilize interventions with medicines already studied or approved for any other disease in patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV). It is essential to emphasize that this article only captured trials listed in the clinicaltrials.gov database. We identified 24 clinical trials, involving more than 20 medicines, such as human immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, bevacizumab, and traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Although drug repurposing has some limitations, repositioning clinical trials may represent an attractive strategy because they facilitate the discovery of new classes of medicines; they have lower costs and take less time to reach the market; and there are existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution.","Rosa, Sandro G.

We estimated the prevalence of loneliness and identified key sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related risk factors for loneliness among adults aged &#8805;55 during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, when much of the country was under shelter-in-place orders. METHODS: We collected data from online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national study of 6938 US adults aged &#8805;55 from April 2 through May 31, 2020. We estimated the population-weighted prevalence of loneliness (scores &#8805;6 of 9 on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale), overall and by sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related factors. We used population-weighted modified Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs for the associations between these factors and loneliness, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education level. RESULTS: Overall, we estimated that 29.5% (95% CI, 27.9%31.3%) of US adults aged &#8805;55 were considered high in loneliness in April and May 2020. In population-weighted adjusted models, loneliness was the most prevalent among those who reported depression, who were not married or in a relationship, who lived alone, and who were unemployed at the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We identified subpopulations of middle-aged and older adults who were vulnerable to loneliness during a period when COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders were in place across most of the country. These insights may inform the allocation of resources to mitigate an unintended health consequence during times of restricted activity.","O039,; Shea, Brendan Q; Finlay, Jessica M; Kler, Jasdeep; Joseph, Carly A; Kobayashi, Lindsay C",Public Health Rep,341,24

In particular, an FL central server manages the local updates of multiple collaborators (city DT), provides a global model which is trained in multiple iterations at different city DT systems, until the model gains the correlations between various response plan and infection trend. That means, a collaborative city DT paradigm based on FL techniques can obtain knowledge and patterns from multiple DTs, and eventually establish a `global view' for city crisis management. Meanwhile, it also helps to improve each city digital twin selves by consolidating other DT's respective data without violating privacy rules. To validate the proposed solution, we take COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. The experimental results on the real dataset with various response plan validate our proposed solution and demonstrate the superior performance.","Pang, Junjie; Li, Jianbo; Xie, Zhenzhen; Huang, Yan; Cai, Zhipeng",,341,6

We tailor Leavitt's model to the B2B sales context and recognize the potential for exogenous shocks such as COVID-19 to impact each variable. In doing so, we conduct a review of practitioner-oriented articles, interviews with key informants working for B2B organizations, and a webinar with sales professionals.

However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24/50 (57.1%) patients were males. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. At Cox regression analysis, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count < 1000 cells/µL (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

In particular, physical distancing and restriction of movement have had important consequences on human behaviour and potentially also on illicit drug use and supply. These changes can be associated with additional risks for users, in particular due to reduced access to prevention and harm reduction activities. Furthermore, there have been limitations in the amount of data about drug use which can be collected due to restrictions. To goal of this study was to obtain information about potential changes in illicit drug use impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Wastewater samples were collected in seven cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy at the beginning of lockdowns (March-May 2020). Using previously established and validated methods, levels of amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), MDMA, benzoylecgonine (BE, the main metabolite of cocaine) and 11-nor-9-carboxy-&#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH, main metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) were measured and compared with findings from previous years. Important differences in levels of consumed drugs were observed across the considered countries. Whilst for some substances and locations, marked decreases in consumption could be observed (e.g., 50% decrease in MDMA levels compared to previous years). In some cases, similar or even higher levels compared to previous years could be found. Changes in weekly patterns were also observed, however these were not clearly defined for all locations and/or substances. Findings confirm that the current situation is highly heterogeneous and that it remains very difficult to explain and/or predict the effect that the present pandemic has on illicit drug use and availability. However, given the current difficulty in obtaining data due to restrictions, wastewater analysis can provide relevant information about the situation at the local level, which would be hard to obtain otherwise.","Been, Frederic; Emke, Erik; Matias, João; Baz-Lomba, Jose Antonio; Boogaerts, Tim; Castiglioni, Sara; Campos-Mañas, Marina; Celma, Alberto; Covaci, Adrian; de Voogt, Pim; Hernández, Félix; Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara; Laak, Thomas Ter; Reid, Malcolm; Salgueiro-González, Noelia; Steenbeek, Ruud; van Nuijs, Alexander L N; Zuccato, Ettore; Bijlsma, Lubertus",Environ Int,341,21

Our objective was to model the cost-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT in six African countries guided by an HIV prevention cascade framework. The HIV prevention cascade as yet to be applied to evaluating CVCT effectiveness or cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We defined a priority population for CVCT in Africa as heterosexual adults in stable couples. Based on our previous experience nationalizing CVCT in Rwanda and scaling-up CVCT in 73 clinics in Zambia, we estimated HIV prevention cascade domains of motivation for use, access and effectiveness of CVCT as model parameters. Costs-per-couple tested were also estimated based on our previous studies. We used these parameters as well as country-specific inputs to model the impact of CVCT over a five-year time horizon in a previously developed and tested deterministic compartmental model. We consider six countries across Africa with varied HIV epidemics (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone). Outcomes of interest were the proportion of HIV infections averted by CVCT, nationwide CVCT implementation costs and costs-per-HIV infection averted by CVCT. We applied 3%/year discounting to costs and outcomes. Univariate and Monte Carlo multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: We estimated that CVCT could avert between 54% (Sierra Leone) and 62% (South Africa) of adult HIV infections. Average costs-per-HIV infection averted were lowest in Zimbabwe ($550) and highest in South Africa ($1272). Nationwide implementations would cost between 7% (Kenya) and 21% (Ivory Coast) of a country's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) budget over five years. In sensitivity analyses, model outputs were most sensitive to estimates of cost-per-couple tested; the proportion of adults in heterosexual couples and HIV prevention cascade domains of CVCT motivation and access. CONCLUSIONS: Our model indicates that nationalized CVCT could prevent over half of adult HIV infections for 7% to 21% of the modelled countries' five-year PEPFAR budgets.

Although, the recent announcement of vaccine breakthrough for COVID-19 renews the hope, however, there remains a major challenge of accessibility to urgently match the rapid global therapeutic demand for curtailing the pandemic, thereby creating an impetus for further search. The reassessment of results from a stream of experiments is of enormous importance in identifying bona fide lead-like candidates to fulfil this quest. This review comprehensively highlights the common pathomechanisms and pharmacological targets of HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and potent therapeutic potentials from basic and clinical experimental investigations. The implicated targets for the prevention and treatment include the viral proteases (Mpro, PLpro, 3CLpro), viral structural proteins (S- and N-proteins), non-structural proteins (nsp 3, 8, 10, 14, 16), accessory protein (ns12.9), viroporins (3a, E, 8a), enzymes (RdRp, TMPRSS2, ADP-ribosyltransferase, MTase, 2'-O-MTase, TATase, furin, cathepsin, deamidated human triosephosphate isomerase), kinases (MAPK, ERK, PI3K, mTOR, AKT, Abl2), interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and the human host receptor, ACE2. Notably among the 109 overviewed inhibitors include quercetin, eriodictyol, baicalin, luteolin, melatonin, resveratrol and berberine from natural products, GC373, NP164 and HR2P-M2 from peptides, 5F9, m336 and MERS-GD27 from specific human antibodies, imatinib, remdesivir, ivermectin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nafamostat, interferon-ß and HCQ from repurposing libraries, some iron chelators and traditional medicines.

This study aimed to investigate what technology O&M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&M technologies and build capacity in the international O&M profession. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A technology survey was completed by professionals (n = 36) attending O&M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&M specialists (n = 31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. RESULTS: Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&M tele-practice. O&M technology could support comprehensive O&M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&M clients with complex needs. Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&M professionals upgrading technology in Australia. Comprehensive training for O&M specialists is needed in Malaysia to meet the travel needs of clients with low vision or blindness who also have physical, cognitive, sensory or mental health complications.","Deverell, Lil; Bhowmik, Jahar; Lau, Bee Theng; Al Mahmud, Abdullah; Sukunesan, Suku; Islam, Fakir M Amirul; McCarthy, Chris; Meyer, Denny",Disabil Rehabil Assist Technol,341,24

The complementary use of once-weekly HD expedites to achieve adequate dialysis and enables to prolong PD duration. Although PD+HD has been widely employed among Japanese PD patients, it is much less common outside Japan. Clinical evidences are still not enough, especially in long-term prognosis and appropriate treatment duration, suitable patients, and generalizability. A retrospective cohort study by Chung et al. (BMC Nephrol 21:348, 2020) compared the risk of mortality and hospitalization between PD patients who were transferred to PD+HD and those who were transferred to HD in Taiwan. Because the mortality and hospitalization rates did not differ between the groups, the authors concluded that, PD+HD may be a rational and cost-effective treatment option. It should be noted that the effects of PD+HD on long-term prognosis are still unknown due to too-short PD+HD duration. However, the study identified the high-risk patient population and showed the generalizability of PD+HD. PD+HD is a treatment of choice in patients with ESKD who prefer PD lifestyles even after decline in residual kidney function.","Tanaka, Mototsugu; Mise, Naobumi",BMC Nephrol,341,33

METHODS: This was a prospective descriptive study comprising 147 consecutive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive patients who underwent CT chest. Prevalence, distribution, extent and type of abnormal lung findings were recorded. RESULTS: Among the total study cohort of 147 patients, 104 (70.7 %) were males and 43 (29.3 %) were females with mean age of 40.9â¯±â¯17.2 years (range 24-71 years). We observed lung parenchymal abnormalities in 51 (34.7 %) cases whereas 96 (65.3 %) RT-PCR positive cases had a normal chest CT. Only 12.2 % of the patients were dyspneic, 6.1 % had desaturation, 7.4 % had increased respiratory rate and 10.9 % had comorbidities. Among the patients with abnormal CT findings bilateral 39/51 (76.5 %), multilobar (88.2 %) lung involvement with a predominant peripheral and posterior distribution was commonly observed. With regards to the type of opacity, ground glass opacity (GGO) was the dominant abnormality found in all 51 (100 %) cases.

The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of facial PIs. The secondary outcomes of interest were facial pain while wearing PPE and ease of use of the care bundle. METHODS: This study used a voluntary survey by questionnaire, supplemented by a qualitative analysis of interviews from a small purposive sample that took place in one large Irish hospital over a two-month period in 2020. The hospital was a city-based public university teaching hospital with 800 inpatient beds. The intervention was a care bundle consisting of skin protection, face mask selection, material use, skin inspection, cleansing and hydration developed in line with international best practice guidelines. All staff working in COVID-19 wards, intensive care units and the emergency department in the hospital were given a kitbag containing the elements of the care bundle plus an information pamphlet. Data were collected via a survey and interviews. RESULTS: A total of 114 staff provided feedback on the use of the care bundle. Before using the care bundle 29% (n=33) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI, whereas after using the care bundle only 8% (n=9) of the respondents reported developing a facial PI. The odds ratio (OR) of skin injury development was 4.75 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.15-10.49; p=0.0001), suggesting that after the care bundle was issued, those who responded to the survey were almost five times less likely to develop a skin injury. Interviews with 14 staff determined that the bundle was easy to use and safe. CONCLUSION: Among those who responded to the survey, the use of the bundle was associated with a reduction in the incidence of skin injury from 29% to 8%, and respondents found the bundle easy to use, safe and effective. As with evidence from the international literature, this study has identified that when skincare is prioritised, and a systematic preventative care bundle approach is adopted, there are clear benefits for the individuals involved.","Moore, Zena; McEvoy, Natalie L; Avsar, Pinar; McEvoy, Linda; Curley, Gerard; O039,; Connor, Tom; Budri, Aglecia; Nugent, Linda; Walsh, Simone; Bourke, Frank; Patton, Declan",J Wound Care,341,20

This mode of medication is often done with the help of African traditional medicines. Because of the misconception that African traditional medicines can cure/prevent all diseases, some Africans may opt for COVID-19 prevention and management by self-medicating. Thus to efficiently predict the dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, the role of the self-medicated population needs to be taken into account. In this paper, we formulate and analyse a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 in Cameroon. The model is represented by a system of compartmental age-structured ODEs that takes into account the self-medicated population and subdivides the human population into two age classes relative to their current immune system strength. We use our model to propose policy measures that could be implemented in the course of an epidemic in order to better handle cases of self-medication.","Kong, Jude D; Tchuendom, Rinel F; Adeleye, Samuel A; David, Jummy F; Admasu, Fikreab Solomon; Bakare, Emmanuel A; Siewe, Nourridine",J Biol Dyn,341,16

In contrast to a model-based approach for estimating population immunity, or simplistic summing of natural- and vaccine-induced immunity, the current study presents a data-driven statistical procedure for estimating the total immunity rate in a region using prospectively collected serological data along with state-level vaccination data. We present a detailed procedure so that efforts can be replicated regionally to inform policy-making decisions relevant to SARS-CoV-2.

To address the current gap in knowledge about post-acute needs of those infected by COVID-19, we examined discharge function data to better prepare patients, providers, and health systems to return patients to optimal levels of functioning. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the prevalence of functional decline and related rehabilitation needs at hospital discharge. DESIGN: Prospective chart review. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized adults with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, with admission dates between March 4, 2020 and May 1, 2020 INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discharge location;need for outpatient physical, occupational, or speech therapy;need for durable medical equipment at discharge;presence of dysphagia at discharge;functional decline. RESULTS: Three hundred eleven potential cases were reviewed. The final number of cases included in analysis was N=288, ranging in age from 20-95 years old (mean 66.80+/-15.31 years). Nearly twenty percent of COVID-19 survivors discharged to a location other than their home. Forty-five percent of survivors experienced functional decline impacting their discharge. Eighty-seven (80.6%) of survivors who showed functional change during hospitalization were referred for additional therapy at discharge. At least 73 (67.6%) of these patients required DME at discharge (in 12 cases this was not clearly documented). Twenty-nine (26.7%) of the survivors who showed functional changes had ongoing dysphagia at the time of hospital discharge. Ninety-seven of the survivors (40.6%) were never assessed by a PM&R physician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech language pathologist during their hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mortality rates are frequently reported in the media, while the effects on function are not as well described.

Physical exercise has an important role in the preservation of the immune system, which is vital to prevent infections. To promote physical exercise and maintain a healthy status, recent studies have suggested general exercise routines to be implemented during the quarantine period. However, to improve the health-related physical fitness components, any specific prescription should include intensity, volume, duration, and mode. Controversy persists about which is the best intensity of physical activity, while performing exercise at a moderate intensity could bring important benefits to asymptomatic people. High intensity or unaccustomed exercise should be restricted for older people, and for people of all ages with chronic diseases or compromised immune system, obesity, or upper respiratory tract infection with limited symptoms. Besides, physical activity guidelines should be particular to each population group, giving special consideration to those vulnerable to COVID-19 who are much more likely to suffer more self-isolation. Therefore, the present study is to provide specific physical activity recommendations for different populations during this pandemic.","Baena Morales, Salvador; Tauler Riera, Pedro; Aguiló Pons, Antonio; García Taibo, Olalla",Nutr Hosp,341,24

These variants have in common a higher transmissibility, becoming dominant within populations in a short time, and an accumulation of a high number of mutations in the spike (S) protein, especially within the amino terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations have direct implications on virus infection rates through higher affinity of S RBD for the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. There are also signs of enhanced virulence, re-infection frequency, and increased resistance to the action of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from convalescence sera and in vaccinated individuals in regions where the variants spread dominantly.

METHODS: Cohort study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized from March to September 2020 at 25 hospitals. Study data were collected from medical records using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools. Multivariate Poisson regression model was used to assess risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 2054 patients (52.6% male, median age 58 years old), in-hospital mortality was 22.0%, and 47.6% among those treated in the ICU. Hypertension (52.9%), diabetes (29.2%) and obesity (17.2%) were the most prevalent comorbidities. Overall, 32.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation and 12.1% kidney replacement therapy. Septic shock was observed in 15.0%, nosocomial infection in 13.1%, thromboembolism in 4.1% and acute heart failure in 3.6%. Age &#8805;65 years-old, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, C-reactive protein &#8805;100 mg/dL, platelet count <100 × 109/L, oxygen saturation <90%, supplementary oxygen requirement and invasive mechanical ventilation at admission were independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The overall use of antimicrobials was 87.9%. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Brazil. Easily assessed parameters at hospital admission were independently associated with a higher risk of death.

However, current US immigration laws-and their enforcement-not only fail to fulfill migrants' health rights but actively undermine their realization and worsen the pandemic's spread.Specifically, the US immigration system's reliance on detention, which precludes effective social distancing, increases risks of exposure and infection for detainees, staff, and their broader communities. International agreements clearly state that the prolonged, mandatory, or automatic detention of people solely because of their migration status is a human rights violation on its own. But in the context of COVID-19, the consequences for migrants' right to health are particularly acute.Effective alternatives exist: other countries demonstrate the feasibility of adopting and implementing immigration laws that establish far less restrictive, social services-based approaches to enforcement that respect human rights. To protect public health and realize its global commitments, the United States must shift away from detaining migrants as standard practice and adopt effective, humane alternatives-both amid COVID-19 and permanently.

This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic. METHODS: The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability. RESULTS: Twenty-eight survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues.","Rehani, Bhavya; Rodriguez, Jose A; Nguyen, Jeffers K; Patel, Mauli M; Ammanuel, Simon G; Winford, Elliott; Dillon, William P",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,341,16

Also efficacy and safety of antiviral regimens were not compared according severity of the disease. In this study the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine plus atazanavir/ritonavir was compared in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the clinical outcomes of 213 patients with COVID-19 during the hospitalization course and up to 56 days after the hospital discharge. The disease was categorized to moderate and severe based on the severity of pneumonia and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2). The patients received the national treatment protocol containing hydroxychloroquine (400 mg BD in first day and then 200 mg BD) plus atazanavir/ritonavir (300/100 mg daily) for 7 days. Main outcomes included discharge rates at day 7, 14 and 28, 28-day mortality, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and intubation, length of hospital and ICU stay and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of patients was 60(14) years and 53% were male. According to WHO definition, 51.64% and 48.36% of the patients had moderate (SpO2 &#8805; 90%) and severe disease (SpO2 < 90%) at baseline, respectively. The discharge rate of the moderate group was significantly higher than the severe group at day 7, 14 and 28 (HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35-0.69, p = < 0.001 at day 7, HR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.35-0.66, p = < 0.001 at day 14 and HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.36-0.67, p = < 0.001at day 28). The 28-day mortality of the severe group was six times higher than the moderate group (HR = 6.00; 95% CI: 2.50-14.44), p = < 0.001). The need of admission in ICU for the severe group and the moderate group was 37.86% and 18.18% of the patients. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the moderate group in comparison with the severe group (5 ± 4 vs. 8 ± 6 days, p < 0.001). Patients in the moderate group experienced the serious adverse events and complications less than the severe group. The discharged patients were followed up to 56 days after discharge. Some of the patients complained of symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, weakness and new-onset hair loss. CONCLUSION: Our study did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine plus atazanavir/ritonavir in patients who had SpO2 < 90% at the time of hospital admission. SpO2 was the only predictor of clinical outcomes (duration of hospital stay, discharge from the hospital and mortality) in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine plus atazanavir/ritonavir.","Rahmani, Hamid; Davoudi-Monfared, Effat; Nourian, Anahid; Nabiee, Morteza; Sadeghi, Setayesh; Khalili, Hossein; Abbasian, Ladan; Ghiasvand, Fereshteh; Seifi, Arash; Hasannezhad, Malihe; Ghaderkhani, Sara; Mohammadi, Mostafa; Yekaninejad, Mir Saeed",,341,16

Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus elevates heart rate (HR) prior to symptom onset, whether this virus evokes other presymptomatic alterations is unknown. This Case Study details the presymptomatic impact of COVID-19 on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young woman (24yrs, 173.5cm, 89kg, BMI: 29.6kg·m-2). Vascular and skeletal muscle function were assessed as part of a separate study with the first and second visits separated by 2 weeks. On the evening following the second visit, the participant developed a fever and a rapid antigen test confirmed a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Compared to the first visit, the participant presented with a markedly elevated HR (~ 30 bpm) and lower mean blood pressure (~8 mmHg) at the second visit. Vascular function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, reactive hyperemia, and passive leg movement were all noticeably attenuated (25-65%) as was leg blood flow during knee extension exercise. Muscle strength was diminished as was ADP stimulated respiration (30%), assessed in vitro, while there was a 25% increase in the apparent Km. Lastly, an elevation in IL-10 was observed prior to symptom onset. Notably, 2.5 months after diagnosis symptoms of fatigue and cough were still present. Together, these findings provide unique insight into the physiological responses immediately prior to COVID-19 symptom onset; they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 negatively impacts vascular and skeletal muscle function prior to the onset of common symptoms and may set the stage for the widespread sequelae observed following COVID-19 diagnosis.","Trinity, Joel D; Craig, Jesse C; Fermoyle, Caitlin C; McKenzie, Alec I; Lewis, Matthew T; Park, Soung Hun; Rondina, Matthew T; Richardson, Russell S",,341,16

There is increasing evidence that non-O blood groups have both higher susceptibility and higher severity of COVID-19 infections. The reason behind such relationship seems elusive. Regarding susceptibility, Non-O individuals have Anti-A antibodies which can prevent viral entry across ACE-2 receptors, moreover, Non-O individuals are at higher risk of autoimmunity, hypercoagulable state, and dysbiosis resulting in an augmented tendency for vascular inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19. We can conclude, on the diagnostic level, that ABO blood groups can be potentially used for risk stratification of affected COVID-19 patients, to anticipate the deterioration of patients at higher risk for complications.

The aim of this study was to detect the contamination of hands, objects, and surfaces in isolation rooms and also in outpatients' clinics in hospitals and polyclinics. Environmental contamination of public high-touch surfaces in public facilities was also investigated during an active COVID-19 pandemic. Random swabs were also taken from public shops, pharmacies, bakeries, groceries, banknotes, and automated teller machines (ATMs). Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 positivity using real-time polymerase chain reaction. In the COVID-19 regional reference hospital, only 3 out of 20 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Hand swabs from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in isolation rooms were occasionally positive for viral RNA. In outpatients' clinics, door handles were the most contaminated surfaces. Dental chairs, sinks, keyboards, ophthalmoscopes, and laboratory equipment were also contaminated. Although no positive swabs were found in shops and public facilities, random ATM swabs returned a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Although there is no longer a focus on COVID-19 wards and isolation hospitals, more attention is required to decontaminate frequently touched surfaces in health-care facilities used by patients not diagnosed with COVID-19.

Evidence from the Corporate Bond Market,15.835114,2.170222,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVD-19 global pandemic has placed a large demand on personal protective equipment for healthcare workers. N-95 respirators, required to perform aerosolizing procedures, are in short supply and have increased significantly in cost. The lack of a clear end to the pandemic requires hospitals to create a long-term, cost effective solution to the N95 shortage. We initially used previously described methods to reuse and resterilize N95 masks; however, we found they did not solve the issues related to just-in-time fit-testing and cost. STUDY DESIGN: We initiated a program with the aim to reduce our dependence on N95 masks by initiating a phased program to acquire industrial style elastomeric P100 masks as a substitute for reuse and resterilization of disposable N95s. We created an allocation strategy based on availability of the masks, as well as an operational plan to fit test, educate, and disinfect the masks. RESULTS: Within 1 month, we were able to reduce the number of N95s needed by our network by 95%. We also found that the cost was, conservatively, 10 times less per month than purchasing disposable N95s, and the cost benefit increases the longer they are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of an elastomeric mask program is feasible and less expensive than programs focused on reusing and disinfecting disposable N95 masks. A well thought out elastomeric distribution and disinfection program does not pose greater operational challenges than an N95 reuse and resterilization program. In addition, elastomeric masks can be stored for future surges and should be considered an essential part of all healthcare facilities' supply of personal protective equipment. Implementation of the program has eliminated our dependence on disposable N95s to maintain normal operations during the global pandemic.","Chalikonda, Sricharan; Waltenbaugh, Hope; Angelilli, Sara; Dumont, Tiffany; Kvasager, Curt; Sauber, Timothy; Servello, Nino; Singh, Anil; Diaz-Garcia, Rafael",J Am Coll Surg,341,1

This review provides an update on significant issues relevant to the inpatient management of T1D. Topics include trends in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hypoglycemia, and adapting ambulatory technologies for inpatient use. RECENT FINDINGS: Rates of DKA in the United States are rising. Although socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and hemoglobin A1c are persistently associated with DKA in individuals with T1D, newer risk factors have also emerged. These include the off-label use of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitor medications, immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes, and infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Hypoglycemia is common among hospitalized patients with T1D. Use of validated hypoglycemia risk prediction models and multidisciplinary care initiatives can reduce the risk of inpatient hypoglycemia. Finally, continuous glucose monitoring is being adapted for use in the hospital setting and has shown promise during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Spain, France and all other countries followed. From the first week of March, restrictive measures began in Greece and then confinement in order to limit the spread of the pandemic and not drown the National Health System by serious cases. The policy of restrictive measures to stop the pandemic was the internationally accepted response1 and the generalized adherence proved effective, despite the shock and the various reactions from the unprecedented, generalized state of restriction, different scale from epidemics of other times.2-4 In other countries, the loose restrictive measures have cost thousands of deaths. The general restrictive measures, however, have serious consequences for people's mental equilibrium, economy and employment, and for this reason they can only be of limited duration.5 The gradual return to normal life rhythms began gradually from May. But the test of the holiday time and the gradual opening of the tourist season, that is, the open communication of moving populations with limited, random checks for the virus and only local restrictions of the gathering of citizens. We are experiencing now the gradual and severe increase in cases, with an uncertain spreading, with asymptomatic and younger in age likely playing a central role in the spread of the virus, while the fear of a potential large increase in serious cases remains. At the time of this writing, the only means of coping is to maintain and locally strengthen the protective measures, while we gradually realize that these measures came to stay for many more months.6,7 A major problem is that the initial small number of cases favored the underestimation of risk by part of the population, and the serious consequences on people's jobs and lives, along with the deregulation of employment and social security relations legislated in recent months, have provided substantial material to conspiracy theories. We carefully monitor the research on the epidemiological behavior of covid-19 and the clinical data, the discussion on the drugs that make the symptoms milder, the effect of the virus on the CNS and the expected vaccine or vaccines. Our role from the beginning concerned the enormous psychological burden of a global health crisis, with serious consequences on people's working and social lives and equally avoiding the deregulation of the management of our patients and of the units that provide it. At the time of confinement, the telephone contact, familiar to all generations, offered valuable information and support, the lines 10306 and 1110, as well as many local or voluntary help-lines. Telepsychiatry was used more widely - being also an initiative of the Hellenic Psychiatric Association - and seems to have entered impetuously in our work, as well as in education. Its central or complementary role and its safe use are issues that are widely discussed at the moment.8 Protection measures against the virus seriously affect the normal functioning of health and mental health services. The solution should be sought in the urgent operational upgrade, the very necessary reinforcement of the staff and its effective protection from the virus and stress from exposure to danger, which has emerged as important factors for the normal operation of the mental health units.9 The use of telepsychiatry has solved a number of operational problems, but in many cases, it remains complementary, as it cannot replace physical presence in more specific care operations. The need not only to normalize, but to improve the follow up of our patients, the need to strengthen the units that provide basic, community mental health services, is shown by the increase in cases of involuntary hospitalization in the psychiatric hospitals of Athens and Thessaloniki during the last two months. A health crisis that affects almost the entire planet and the working and social life of most is a major social and political problem that concerns all of us,10 while mental health professionals are called to offer their scientific tools for people to face a multifaceted threat and in particular to claim and ensure the continuation of the treatment of our patients and the normal operation of our units.","Ploumpidis, D",Psychiatriki,341,16

Poor sepsis prognosis is also associated with low zinc levels and the release of High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) from activated and/or necrotic cells. HMGB1 added to whole blood at physiological pH did not bind leukocyte receptors, but lowering pH with lactic acid to mimic sepsis conditions allowed binding, implying the presence of natural inhibitor(s) preventing binding at normal pH. Testing micromolar concentrations of divalent cations showed that zinc supported the robust binding of sialylated glycoproteins with HMGB1. Further characterizing HMGB1 as a sialic acid-binding lectin, we found that optimal binding takes place at normal blood pH and is markedly reduced when pH is adjusted with lactic acid to levels found in sepsis. Glycan array studies confirmed the binding of HMGB1 to sialylated glycan sequences typically found on plasma glycoproteins, with binding again being dependent on zinc and normal blood pH. Thus, HMGB1-mediated hyperactivation of innate immunity in sepsis requires acidosis, and micromolar zinc concentrations are protective. We suggest that the potent inflammatory effects of HMGB1 are kept in check via sequestration by plasma sialoglycoproteins at physiological pH and triggered when pH and zinc levels fall in late stages of sepsis. Current clinical trials independently studying zinc supplementation, HMGB1 inhibition, or pH normalization may be more successful if these approaches are combined and perhaps supplemented by infusions of heavily sialylated molecules.","Siddiqui, Shoib S; Dhar, Chirag; Sundaramurthy, Venkatasubramaniam; Sasmal, Aniruddha; Yu, Hai; Bandala-Sanchez, Esther; Li, Miaomiao; Zhang, Xiaoxiao; Chen, Xi; Harrison, Leonard C; Xu, Ding; Varki, Ajit",Proc.

While healthcare workers (HCWs) have been at the frontlines for the pandemic response, vaccine acceptance amongst them needs further study. MethodsA web-based survey to assess vaccine acceptance and preparedness in India was disseminated to HCWs working in various settings between January and February 2021, shortly after the launch of Indias vaccination campaign. Descriptive statistics were used to examine respondent demographics and Likert scale responses. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance. ResultsThe survey yielded 624 respondents from 25 states and five union territories in India; 53.5% were male, and median age was 37 years (IQR 32-46). Amongst all respondents, 84.1% (525/624) supported COVID-19 vaccines, and 63.2% (141/223) of those unvaccinated at the time of survey administration were willing to accept a vaccine. Reliability on government sources, healthcare providers or scientific journal articles for COVID-19 related information was reported by 66.8%, while confidence in social media for this information was reported by only 4.5%. Factors independently associated with vaccine acceptance included advancing age (aOR 3.50 [95% CI, 1.04-11.76] for those above 45 years), evidence of vaccine effectiveness and safety (aOR 3.78 [95% CI 1.15-12.38]), and provision of free/no-cost vaccine (aOR 2.63 [95% CI, 1.06-6.50]). Most respondents (80%) were confident about their hospital being equipped to efficiently rollout COVID-19 vaccines to the general population. ConclusionsOverall attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and preparedness were positive among HCWs in India, although acceptance was lower among healthier and younger HCWs. Data availability on vaccine safety and effectiveness, and cost considerations were important for acceptance. Targeted interventions are needed to improve vaccine acceptance amongst HCWs, since they are critical in promoting vaccine acceptance amongst the general population.","Mehta, Kayur; Dhaliwal, Baldeep; Zodpey, Sanjay; Loisate, Stacie; Banerjee, Preetika; GUPTA, MADHU; Shet, Anita",,341,23

Collected data included general information (patient age, weight, clinical indication), CT equipment (CT make and model, year of installation, number of detector rows), scan protocols (body region, scan phases, tube current and potential), and radiation dose descriptors (CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP)). Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations were performed. Results Data from 782 patients (median age (interquartile range) of 59(15) years) from 54 healthcare sites in 28 countries were evaluated. Less than one-half of the healthcare sites used CT for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and three-fourth used CT for assessing disease severity. CTDIvol varied based on CT vendors (7-11mGy, p<0.001), number of detector-rows (8-9mGy, p<0.001), year of CT installation (7-10mGy, p=0.006), and reconstruction techniques (7-10mGy, p=0.03). Multiphase chest CT exams performed in 20% of sites (11 of 54) were associated with higher DLP compared with single-phase chest CT exams performed in 80% (43 of 54 sites) (p=0.008). Conclusion CT use, scan protocols, and radiation doses in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed wide variation across healthcare sites within the same and different countries. Many patients were scanned multiple times and/or with multiphase CT scan protocols.

Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, witnessed a huge surge in COVID-19 cases, resulting in the establishment of isolation facilities named COVID Care Center (CCC). In our study, we describe the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics; clinical progression; and outcome of 1,263 asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients isolated in one such CCC between May 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020. Around 10.5% of the patients progressed to moderate/severe illness, requiring referral for tertiary care, and three died. Nearly half (49.5%) of the patients were symptomatic at the time of admission, 2.2% of the patients developed symptoms post-testing, and 48.5% patients remained asymptomatic during the entire course of illness. Most common presenting symptoms were fever (69.9%) and cough (29.6%), followed by generalized body pain, breathlessness, and loss of smell and taste. On multivariate analysis, we identified that symptomatic patients with comorbidities and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were more likely to progress to severe illness warranting referral for tertiary care. COVID Care Center ensured case isolation and monitoring of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients, thereby providing hospital beds for sick patients. COVID Care Center isolation facilities are safe alternatives for medical institutions to isolate and monitor COVID-19 patients. Older symptomatic patients with comorbidities and a high NLR admitted in an isolation facility must be frequently monitored for prompt identification of clinical progression and referral to higher center for advanced medical care.","Krishnasamy, Narayanasamy; Natarajan, Murugan; Ramachandran, Arunkumar; Vivian Thangaraj, Jeromie Wesley; Etherajan, Theranirajan; Rengarajan, Jayanthi; Shanmugasundaram, Meenakshi; Kandasamy, Anuradha; Ramamoorthy, Ramesh; Velusamy, Arul; Obla Lakshmanamoorthy, Naganath Babu; Kanagaraman, Prabhuraman; Rahamathula, Mohammed Iliyas; Devadas, Geetha; Sathyanathan, Babu Peter; Rajaji, Poonguzhali; Rajendran, Karthick; Panneerselvam, Priyadarshini; Rajaram, Muthukumaran; Panjacharam, Mohan",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,341,26

Methods: A total of 37 overseas young and middle-aged people, who tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive upon their return to Shanghai, were enrolled for an analysis of their clinical symptoms, blood routine indexes, and lung CT images. Results: The clinical symptoms were characterized by fever (51.4%), dry cough (13.5%), expectoration (27.0%), hypodynamia (21.6%), pharyngalia (10.8%), pharynoxerosis (8.1%), rhinobyon (13.5%), rhinorrhea (8.1%), muscular soreness (16.2%), and diarrhea (2.7%). In 16.2% of cases, no symptoms were reported. Fever was the most common symptom (51.40%). The pneumonic changes referred to the latticed ground glass imaging and similar white lung imaging accompanied by consolidated shadows. The rate of pneumonia was high (81.10%). We found that the exclusive percent of eosinophils was abnormally low. By analyzing the correlation of eosinophils, fever, and pneumonia, we found that the percentage of eosinophils was low in the COVID-19 patients afflicted with fever or pneumonia (P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, pneumonia and fever were negatively correlated with the percentage of eosinophils and eosinophils/neutrophils ratio (P &lt; 0.01, respectively), but not associated with pneumonia severity (P &gt; 0.05). Fever was not correlated with pneumonia (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: A low percentage of eosinophils may be considered as a biomarker of pneumonia of COVID-19, but not as a biomarker of pneumonia severity.","Yang, Juan; Zhao, Xiaohui; Liu, Xueyuan; Sun, Wanju; Zhou, Longzhu; Wang, Yongbing; Sui, Haijing",Front.

Since the health system reform and health policy environment differ from each country, it is necessary to analyze the motivations of THE in a specific country. METHODS: The objective of this study was to analyze the influential factors of Provincial THE (PTHE) per capita in China by using spatiotemporal panel data across 31 provinces (including provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, all called provinces in here) from 2009 to 2016 at the provincial and annual level. Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) was used to identify the influential factors of PTHE per capita. RESULTS: The number of beds per 10,000 population explained most of the variation of PTHE per capita. The results also showed that health expenditure in China reacts more to mortality compared with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. But mortality and Out-Of-Pocket Payments (OOP) as a percentage of THE were associated with PTHE per capita negatively. The rate of infectious diseases and THE as a percentage of GDP had no statistical significance. And the Proportion of the Population Aged 65 and Over (POP65) impact PTHE per capita positively. But the coefficient was small. CONCLUSIONS: In response to these findings, we conclude that the impact of the increasing percentage of OOP in THE diminishes the PTHE. Furthermore, we find that both the ""baseline"" health level and health provision are positively correlated with PTHE, which outweighs the effect of GDP.","Hou, Jifei; Tian, Liqi; Zhang, Yun; Liu, Yanzheng; Li, Jing; Wang, Yue",BMC Health Serv Res,341,11

METHODS: Retrospective data on PED visits at British Columbia Children's Hospital were collected between December 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020, and for 2 previous years. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed to estimate the difference in daily visits after stay-at-home orders on March 17, 2020, as well as before and after. Further analysis was performed to estimate the drop and recovery of admission and visits by age and acuity. RESULTS: After adjustment for year and seasonality, we documented a drop in the expected number of daily visits of 83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-89) after stay-at-home orders. Thereafter, daily visits increased by 12.9 (95% CI, 11.3-14.4) every month. Probability of admission adjusted for seasonality and acuity increased 6.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-9.0%) after stay-at-home orders and decreased in the odds of -0.7% (95% CI, -1% to -0.4%) monthly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had a dramatic and lasting impact on the number of PED visits, with contracted rates 6 months into the pandemic. Further increase in acuity-adjusted rate of admissions after stay at home orders suggests that individuals may be delaying arrival to the emergency department. Further assessment is needed to determine if patients are seeking care through other venues or not seeking care altogether.","Irvine, Michael A; Portales-Casamar, Elodie; Goldman, Ran D",Pediatr Emerg Care,341,4

The aim of our prospective single-centre clinical study was to assess the proportion of readable results and errors compared with routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the clinical consequences drawn by infectious disease (ID) physicians from RAST results during same-day bedside consultation. METHODS: All positive blood cultures suitable for RAST from January to December 2019 were included and RAST results at 4 and 6 h compared with standard disc diffusion. The real-life impact of RAST on clinical decisions was assessed during same-day ID bedside consultation. RESULTS: The proportion of readable RAST results was significantly higher after 6 h of incubation compared with after 4 h (881/930 versus 642/847; P < 0.0001). Major and very major errors were rare (17/642 after 4 h and 12/881 after 6 h; P = 0.087). ID consultation was performed in 134 patients after the RAST result. Antimicrobial treatment was changed in 73 patients and 84 additional measures (i.e. imaging studies, surgery, additional resistance testing) were ordered in 62 patients. CONCLUSIONS: RAST according to EUCAST methods was easy to implement with a low number of major and very major errors after 6 h of incubation. ID physicians performing bedside consultations frequently used this information to change antimicrobial treatment and recommended additional measures.","Valentin, Thomas; Koenig, Elisabeth; Prattes, Juergen; Wunsch, Stefanie; Loizenbaur, Tobias; Krause, Robert; Zollner-Schwetz, Ines",J Antimicrob Chemother,341,16

METHODS: This quantitative study used primary data from the survey of 1249 college students at one of the universities in Georgia during April and May 2020. We performed multinomial logistic regression, computing 2 models for the 2 ordinal dependent variables concerning students' experience of race-related bias and hatred-(a) during their lifetime and (b) since the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020-both measured as ""never,"" ""rarely,"" ""sometimes,"" and ""fairly often or very often."" RESULTS: During their lifetime, 47.5% of students had experienced some level of bias or hatred, ranging from ""rarely"" to ""very often."" Since the onset of COVID-19 on March 2 in Georgia, in a short period of 1 to 2 months, 17.6% of students reported experiencing race-related bias or hatred. Univariate statistics revealed substantial differences in race-related bias and hatred by race, experienced during students' lifetime as well as since the onset of COVID-19. Results of multinomial logistic regression showed that the odds of having experienced bias or hatred during their lifetime were significantly higher (P < .05) for the Black students than for White students (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 75.8, for very often or often vs never; AOR = 42 for sometimes vs never). Compared with White students, the odds of hatred and bias were also significantly higher for students who were Asian, multiple races, or another non-White race. The odds of having experienced race-related bias and hatred since the onset of COVID-19 were also higher for Black Asian, multiple races, and other non-White students. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds critical scientific evidence about variation in the perception of bias and hatred that should draw policy attention to race-related issues experienced by college students in the United States.","Shah, Gulzar H; Rochani, Haresh D; Telfair, Joseph; Ayangunna, Elizabeth; Skuraton, Gemma",J Public Health Manag Pract,341,21

To improve detection of gene-by-environment (G × E) interplay, we interacted layoffs from business closures-a plausibly exogenous environmental exposure-with whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) that capture genetic contributions to both the population mean (mPGS) and variance (vPGS) of BMI. Results show evidence of genetic moderation using a vPGS (as opposed to an mPGS) and indicate genome-wide summary measures of phenotypic plasticity may further our understanding of how environmental stimuli modify the distribution of complex traits in a population.","Schmitz, Lauren L; Goodwin, Julia; Miao, Jiacheng; Lu, Qiongshi; Conley, Dalton",Sci Rep,341,33

This paper describes the UBC Pharmacists Clinic's technical systems and lessons learned using enabling technology and the provision of virtual patient care by pharmacists. Of 2036 scheduled appointments at the clinic in 2019, only 1.5% of initial appointments were conducted virtually which increased to 64% for follow-up appointments. Survey respondents (n = 18) indicated an overall high satisfaction with the format, quality of care delivery, ease of use and benefits to their overall health. Other reports indicate that the majority of patients would like the option to book appointments electronically, email their healthcare provider, and have telehealth visits, although a small minority (8%) have access to virtual modes of care. The Clinic team is bridging the technology gap to better align virtual service provision with patient preferences. Practical advice and information gained through experience are shared here. As the general population and health care providers become increasingly comfortable with video conferencing as a result of COVID-19, it is anticipated that requests for video appointments will increase, technological barriers will decrease and conditions will enable providers to increase their virtual care capabilities. Lessons learned at the Clinic have application to pharmacists in both out-patient and in-patient care settings.","Reardon, J.; Yuen, J.; Lim, T.; Ng, R.; Gobis, B.",Innovations in Pharmacy,341,24

Likewise, elements that contribute to building strong brands during a context that has changed consumption priorities are required. For this reason, this paper aims at adapting the dimension of socially responsible brand personality (SRBP), proposed by Mayorga (2017), taking the situation experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a new context. The objective of this research is to contribute to the management of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by providing, from a communicative perspective, a tool that optimizes the creation of a socially responsible image by the different stakeholders. The results allow us to conclude that there is a structural modification of the brand personality proposed by Mayorga, which can be presumed to be generated by the current environment, and which, therefore, can be established as a pillar of CSR management in the new normal, from a relational point of view. The findings clearly identify the virtue of integrity in brand personality, which is made up of two attributes, which, in turn, are made up of 17 traits that can identify a socially responsible brand. © 2021 by the authors.

Rapid first-line testing protocols are needed for outbreak control and surveillance. METHODS: We used computational and manual designs to generate a suitable set of reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) primer and exonuclease probe, internally quenched (exo-IQ), sequences targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. RT-RPA sensitivity was determined by amplification of in vitro transcribed RNA standards. Assay selectivity was demonstrated with a selectivity panel of 32 nucleic acid samples derived from common respiratory viruses. To validate the assay against full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, total viral RNA derived from cell culture supernatant and 19 nasopharyngeal swab samples (8 positive and 11 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were screened. All results were compared to established RT-qPCR assays. RESULTS: The 95% detection probability of the RT-RPA assay was determined to be 7.74 (95% CI: 2.87-27.39) RNA copies per reaction. The assay showed no cross-reactivity to any other screened coronaviruses or respiratory viruses of clinical significance. The developed RT-RPA assay produced 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to RT-qPCR (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: With a run time of 15 to 20 minutes and first results being available in under 7 minutes for high RNA concentrations, the reported assay constitutes one of the fastest nucleic acid based detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 to date and may provide a simple-to-use alternative to RT-qPCR for first-line screening at the point of need.","Behrmann, Ole; Bachmann, Iris; Spiegel, Martin; Schramm, Marina; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Dobler, Gerhard; Dame, Gregory; Hufert, Frank T",Clin Chem,341,23

The traditional Chinese medicine prescription Dayuanyin (DYY), a classic prescription for the treatment of plague, has shown significant effects in the treatment of COVID-19. However, its specific mechanism of action has not yet been clarified. This study aims to explore the mechanism of action of DYY in the treatment of COVID-19 with the hope of providing a theoretical basis for its clinical application. Methods: First, the TCMSP database was searched to screen the active ingredients and corresponding target genes of the DYY prescription and to further identify the core compounds in the active ingredient. Simultaneously, the Genecards database was searched to identify targets related to COVID-19. Then, the STRING database was applied to analyse protein-protein interaction, and Cytoscape software was used to draw a network diagram. The R language and DAVID database were used to analyse GO biological processes and KEGG pathway enrichment. Second, AutoDock Vina and other software were used for molecular docking of core targets and core compounds. Finally, before and after application of DYY, the core target gene IL6 of COVID-19 patients was detected by ELISA to validate the clinical effects. Results: First, 174 compounds, 7053 target genes of DYY and 251 genes related to COVID-19 were selected, among which there were 45 target genes of DYY associated with treatment of COVID-19. This study demonstrated that the use of DYY in the treatment of COVID-19 involved a variety of biological processes, and DYY acted on key targets such as IL6, ILIB, and CCL2 through signaling pathways such as the IL-17 signaling pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. DYY might play a vital role in treating COVID-19 by suppressing the inflammatory storm and regulating immune function. Second, the molecular docking results showed that there was a certain affinity between the core compounds (kaempferol, quercetin, 7-Methoxy-2-methyl isoflavone, naringenin, formononetin) and core target genes (IL6, IL1B, CCL2). Finally, clinical studies showed that the level of IL6 was elevated in COVID-19 patients, and DYY can reduce its levels. Conclusions: DYY may treat COVID-19 through multiple targets, multiple channels, and multiple pathways and is worthy of clinical application and promotion.","Ruan, Xiaofeng; Du, Peng; Zhao, Kang; Huang, Jucun; Xia, Hongmei; Dai, Dan; Huang, Shu; Cui, Xiang; Liu, Liming; Zhang, Jianjun",Chin.

Methods The clinical characteristics of patients with SARS infection were searched using PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang Data and VIP databases. Descriptive analysis was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics of the patients, clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis. Results A total of 13 studies including 19 pregnant females, 14 newborns, and 81 children and adolescents were identified. The ratio of male to female was 1 to 1.2 in children and adolescents patients aged 56 days to 17.5 years. Children under 12 years old accounted for 58.3% (28/48). Of the child patients, 34.0% (16/47) had close contact with patients with SARS. Fever (93.8%, 76/81) and cough (49.4%, 40/81) were the most common symptoms in children and adolescents with SARS infection, and 17.5% (11/63) occurred with shortness of breath or dyspnea. The positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV was 9.2% (14/48), and the positive ratio of serum antibody was 92.9% (13/14). Peripheral blood lymphocyte reduction was approximately 65.7% (44/67). Approximately 70.8% (51/72) unilateral and 29.2% (21/72) bilateral lesions were found by thoracic X-ray or CT scan. No child fatalities were reported. As of maternal patients, aged 23 to 44 years, 10 cases (52.6%) were infected during early and middle pregnancy, and 9 cases (47.4%) during late pregnancy. Fever (100.0%, 19/19) and cough (78.9%, 15/19) were the main clinical symptoms, and shortness of breath/dyspnea occurred in 36.8% (7/19) of infected pregnant females. The positive ratio of nucleic acid detection for SARS-CoV was 50.0% (8/16), whereas the positive ratio of serum antibody was 93.3% (14/15). The ratios of thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and liver enzymes abnormalities were 38.9% (7/18), 61.1% (11/18) and 50.0% (3/6). All patients were identified for lesions by thoracic X-ray or CT scan examination. Seven cases were severe (36.8%). Five patients were treated with mechanical ventilation (26.3%). Three patients died (15.8%). Four patients were spontaneous abortion (40.0%, 4/10). Nine patients were cesarean sectioned (75.0%, 9/12). Six fetuses (46.2%, 6/13) with fetal distress, 7 cases (53.8%, 7/13) with premature delivery were identified. Three fetuses (23.1%) had intrauterine growth retardation. None of the fourteen newborns was diagnosed as SARS infection. Conclusions The clinical symptoms such as fever and cough in children and adolescents with SARS infection are similar to that of adult patients. However, children and adolescents are usually manifested as mild infection without reported death. There is no evidence to support that SARS-CoV could transmit vertically from infected mother to their fetuses.","Li, Wenxing; Tang, Jun; Zeng, Yan; Yue, Yan; He, Yang; Zhang, Meng; Hu, Peng; Xiong, Tao; Mu, Dezhi; Li, Youping",Chin.

Because the NPI was developed using data obtained from conscious patients with pain, we evaluated the performance of NPI in comparison with the SPI and the analgesia nociception index (ANI) in patients under general anaesthesia with target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil. The time of nociception occurrence was defined as when the signs of inadequate anaesthesia occurred. The median values of NPI, SPI, and ANI for 1 minute from the time of the sign of inadequate anaesthesia were determined as the value of each analgesic index that represents inadequate anaesthesia. The time of no nociception was determined as 2 minutes before the onset of skin incision, and the median value for 1 minute from that time was defined as the baseline value. In total, 81 patients were included in the analysis. NPI showed good performance in distinguishing inadequate anaesthesia during propofol-remifentanil based general anaesthesia. NPI had the highest value in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, albeit without statistical significance (NPI: 0.733, SPI: 0.722, ANI: 0.668).

SARS-CoV-2 encodes a small hydrophobic envelope (E) protein that mediates envelope formation, budding, replication, and release of progeny viruses from the host. Through this study, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein is studied for its open and closed state and focused in identifying antiviral herbs used in traditional medicine practices for COVID-19 infections. In this study using computational tools, we docked the shortlisted phytochemicals with the envelope protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the results hint that these compounds interact with the pore-lining residues. The molecular level understanding of the open state is considered and the active inhibitors from the phytochemicals of Ayurvedic medicinal plants from Withania somnifera. We have thus identified a potential phytochemical compound that directly binds with the pore region of the E protein and thereby blocks its channel activity. Blocking the ion channel activity of E protein is directly related to the inhibition of virus replication. The study shows encouraging results on the usage of these phytochemicals in the treatment/management of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Abdullah Alharbi, Raed",,341,16

Considering the protective effect of NEP against pulmonary inflammatory reactions and fibrosis, it is suggested to direct the future efforts towards its potential role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Thus, the review aimed to shed light on the potential beneficial effects of NEP pathways as a novel target for COVID-19 therapy by summarizing its possible molecular mechanisms.

While teleneurology is regularly used in acute stroke care, its application in other branches of neurology was limited. Here we review how the recent pandemic has created a paradigm shift in caring for patients with chronic neurological disorders and how academic institutions have responded to the present need. METHOD: Literature review was performed to examine the recent changes in health policies. Number of outpatient visits and televisits in the Department of Neurology was reviewed from Yale University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to examine the road to transition to televisit. RESULTS: The federal government and the insurance providers extended their supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several rules and regulations regarding teleneurology were revised and relaxed to address the current need. New technologies for video conferencing were incorporated. The transition to televisits went smoothly in both the institutions and number of face-to-face encounters decreased dramatically along with a rapid rise in televisits within 2 weeks of the declaration of national emergency. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The need for ""social distancing"" during the COVID-19 pandemic has created a major surge in the number of teleneurology visits, which will probably continue for the next few months. It may have initiated a more permanent transition to virtual technology incorporated medical care.","Roy, Bhaskar; Nowak, Richard J; Roda, Ricardo; Khokhar, Babar; Patwa, Huned S; Lloyd, Thomas; Rutkove, Seward B",J Neurol Sci,341,1

However, due to slow take-up of LMS many schools in developing countries, especially Africa were completely shut down due to COVID-19 pandemic. To fill this gap, 4 AI-based models;Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) were developed for prediction of LMS determinants. Nonlinear sensitivity analysis was employed to select the key parameters of the LMS determinants data obtained from 1244 schools’ students. Five statistical indices were used to validate the models. The performance results of the four developed AI models discovered facilitating conditions, attitude towards LMS, perceived enjoyment, users’ satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and ease of use to be the most significant factors that affect educational sustainability in Nigeria during COVID-19. Further, single model’s performance results comparison proved that SVM has the highest prediction ability compared to GPR, ANN, and BRT due to its robustness in handling data uncertainties. The study results identified the factors responsible for total schools’ closure during COVID-19. Future studies should examine the application of other linear and other nonlinear AI techniques.","Cavus, Nadire Mohammed Yakubu Bala Yakubu Mohammed Nasiru",Sustainability,341,24

A 43-year-old man presented to our hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with favipiravir and ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for the first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was stable, and he became asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9. Although the PCR tests remained positive, he met the updated discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day 12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on day 16. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that favipiravir and ciclesonide treatment probably did not completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and therefore the infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after two consecutive PCR test results were negative. PCR tests are not mandatory for the updated WHO discharge criteria. However, even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with hematologic malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired viral excretion. Depending on the background disease and comorbidities, there may be some patient populations for whom it is not appropriate to simply comply with the current discharge criteria. Therefore, more emphasis may be needed on PCR examinations.","Fujii, Hiroyuki; Tsuji, Taisuke; Sugitani, Mio; Matsumoto, Yosuke; Yuba, Tatsuya; Tanaka, Shunya; Suga, Yoshifumi; Matsuyama, Aosa; Goda, Shiho; Omura, Ayaka; Shiotsu, Shinsuke; Takumi, Chieko; Ono, Seiko; Hiraoka, Noriya",Curr Probl Cancer,341,0

Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability.

Traditional pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), including exercise training, psychosocial counselling and education, has been employed to improve pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COVID-19. However, the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in PR programmes remain unclear. This study aimed to determine whether the addition of a supervised IMT in a PR is more effective than PR itself in improving dyspnoea, health-related quality of life and exercise capacity in symptomatic patients with post-COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial, powered for superiority, aimed to assess exercise capacity as the primary outcome. A total of 138 are being recruited at two PR centres in Brazil. Following baseline testing, participants will be randomised using concealed allocation, to receive either (1) standard PR with sham IMT or (2) standard PR added to IMT. Treatment effects or differences between the outcomes (at baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks, and after 6 months) of the study groups will be analysed using an ordinary two-way analysis of variance.

Methods Case-study methodology was used to examine and contextualise the analysis of the Republic of Kiribati's adoption of the IPCP from 2003 to 2010. Data were collected from multiple sources including semi-structured interviews, IPCP documentation, program evaluation and a healthcare worker survey. Data were subjected to thematic analysis and descriptive statistics where relevant to the study design. Results It was found that the self-initiated progression of activities and stimuli has resulted in the successful adoption of a comprehensive IPCP. The process followed the staged model of the classic Diffusion of Innovations process in organisations described by Everett Rogers. Conclusion This case study provides an illustration of how a comprehensive IPCP can be adopted in a LMI country setting with little involvement from external agencies. It identifies key stimuli, opportunities and activities which could be similarly adopted and implemented by other LMI countries.","Zimmerman, Peta-Anne; Yeatman, Heather; Jones, Michael; Murdoch, Helen",Healthcare infection,341,11

We investigated the association between COVID-19 and stroke. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving patients discharged from a healthcare system in New York State, from January to April 2020. A mixed-effects logistic regression analysis and a propensity score–weighted analysis were used to control for confounders and investigate the association of COVID-19 with ischemic stroke. Similar techniques were used to detect the impact of concurrent COVID-19 infection on unfavorable outcomes for patients with stroke. RESULTS: Among 24 808 discharges, 2513 (10.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 566 (0.2%) presented with acute ischemic stroke. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were at one-quarter the odds of stroke compared with other patients (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.16–0.40]). This association was consistent in all age groups.

In patients presenting with stroke, concurrent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was associated with higher case-fatality (odds ratio, 10.50 [95% CI, 3.54–31.18]) and a trend towards increased occurrence of discharge to rehabilitation (odds ratio, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.81–1.25]). CONCLUSIONS: Using a comprehensive cross-section of patients from a large NY-based healthcare system, we did not identify a positive association between ischemic stroke and COVID-19. However, patients with stroke with COVID-19 had worse outcomes compared with those without, with over a 9-fold increase in mortality. Although no definitive conclusions can be reached from our observational study, our data do not support the concerns for an epidemic of stroke in young adults with COVID-19.","Bekelis, Kimon; Missios, Symeon; Ahmad, Javaad; Labropoulos, Nicos; Schirmer, Clemens M.; Calnan, Daniel R.; Skinner, Jonathan; MacKenzie, Todd A.",Stroke,341,32

Although it is essential for public health efforts to comprehensively identify which interventions have the largest impact on preventing new cases, most of the modeling studies that support such decision-making efforts have only considered a very small set of interventions. In addition, previous studies predominantly considered interventions as independent or examined a single scenario in which every possible intervention was applied. Reality has been more nuanced, as a subset of all possible interventions may be in effect for a given time period, in a given place. In this paper, we use cloud-based simulations and a previously published Agent-Based Model of COVID-19 (Covasim) to measure the individual and interacting contribution of interventions on reducing new infections in the US over 6 months. Simulated interventions include face masks, working remotely, stay-at-home orders, testing, contact tracing, and quarantining. Through a factorial design of experiments, we find that mask wearing together with transitioning to remote work/schooling has the largest impact. Having sufficient capacity to immediately and effectively perform contact tracing has a smaller contribution, primarily via interacting effects.","Giabbanelli, P. J.; Li, J.",,341,23

A reliable serological assay for evaluating the PEDV-specific humoral and mucosal immune response is important for disease survey, monitoring the efficacy of immunization, and designing strategies for the prevention and control of PED. Two PEDV spike (S) glycoprotein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were developed using G2b PEDV-Pintung 52 (PEDV-PT) trimeric full-length S and truncated S(1–501) proteins derived from the human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell expression system. The truncated S(1–501) protein was selected from a superior expressed stable cell line. The sensitivity and specificity of these two ELISAs were compared to immunostaining of G2b PEDV-PT infected cells and to a commercial nucleocapsid (N)-based indirect ELISA kit using a panel of PEDV negative and hyperimmune sera. RESULTS: The commercial N-based ELISA exhibited a sensitivity of 37%, a specificity of 100%, and a fair agreement (kappa = 0.37) with the immunostaining result. In comparison, the full-length S-based ELISA showed a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 94%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.90) with the immunostaining result. Interestingly, the S(1–501)-based ELISA had even higher sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 99.1%, and an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.97) with the immunostaining result. A fair agreement (kappa< 0.4) was seen between the commercial N-based ELISA and either of our S-based ELISAs. However, the results of the full-length S-based ELISA shared an almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.92) with that of S(1–501)-based ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Both full-length S-based and S(1–501)-based ELISAs exhibit high sensitivity and high specificity for detecting antibodies against PEDVs. Considering the high protein yield and cost-effectiveness, the S(1–501)-based ELISA could be used as a reliable, sensitive, specific, and economic serological test for PEDV.","Chang, Chia-Yu; Peng, Ju-Yi; Cheng, Yun-Han; Chang, Yen-Chen; Wu, Yen-Tse; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Chiou, Hue-Ying; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Chang, Hui-Wen",BMC Vet Res,341,2

However, its effect on quality of life (QoL) in skin cancer patients has not been systematically evaluated to date. Given that QoL impairments may be associated with increased psychological morbidity, and may interfere with engagement with cancer therapy and follow-up, we prospectively evaluated quality of life in skin cancer patients using the Covid-19 Emotional Impact Survey (C-19EIS) and the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires. 101 patients (48 females and 53 males) completed both questionnaires. The mean C-19EIS score was 3.8 on a scale from 0 (no impact) to 12 (severe impact). Patients undergoing systemic therapy showed significantly impaired physical (p = 0.006) and social functioning (p = 0.003). However, when compared to the published normative EORTC QLQ-C30 data, there was no evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic had significantly impacted upon overall quality of life. Subscales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were significantly inversely correlated with the C-19EIS, validating its use in skin cancer patients. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, skin cancer patients in our tertiary referral center were surprisingly resilient. However, given the geographical variations in the rates of Sars-CoV-2 infection it is possible that the low incidence in Northern Germany may have resulted in a lack of general QoL impairments. Multi-center studies are required to further determine the impact of Covid-19 on psychological wellbeing in skin cancer patients in order to develop supportive interventions and to ensure that engagement with cancer care services is maintained in order to enable early detection of cancer progression and/or recurrence.","Kurzhals, Jonas K.; Klee, Gina; Busch, Hauke; Hagelstein, Victoria; Zillikens, Detlef; Terheyden, Patrick; Langan, Ewan A.",PLoS One,341,14

There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that, before the pandemic hit, 43 million workers worked in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Many of these workers lost their jobs since. Consistently with our model, employment losses have been largest in sectors that rely heavily on customer contact and where these contacts dropped the most: retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools.

It has been reported also in patients with COVID-19, Hodgkin disease and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We analyzed the clinical relevance of Low T3 syndrome in COVID-19 patients and, in particular, in those with associated hematological malignancies. METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients, hospitalized during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Sant’Andrea University Hospital in Rome, were subdivided in 38 patients (Group A), showing low levels of FT3, and in 24 patients (Group B), with normal FT3 serum values. During the acute phase of the disease, we measured serum, radiologic and clinical disease severity markers and scores, in search of possible correlations with FT3 serum values. In addition, in 6 COVID-19 patients, 4 with Low T3 syndrome, including 2 with a hematological malignancy, and 2 with normal FT3 values, we performed, high-dimensional single-cell analysis by mass cytometry, multiplex cytokine assay and gene expression profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RESULTS: Low FT3 serum values were correlated with increased Absolute Neutrophil Count, NLR and dNLR ratios and with reduced total count of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Low FT3 values correlated also with increased levels of inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation serum markers as well as with SOFA, LIPI and TSS scores. The CyTOF analysis demonstrated reduction of the effector memory and terminal effector subtypes of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Multiplex cytokine assay indicates that mainly IL-6, IP-10 and MCAF changes are associated with FT3 serum levels, particularly in patients with coexistent hematological malignancies. Gene expression analysis using Nanostring identified four genes differently expressed involved in host immune response, namely CD38, CD79B, IFIT3 and NLRP3. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that low FT3 serum levels are associated with severe COVID-19. Our multi-omics approach suggests that T3 is involved in the immune response in COVID-19 and coexistent hematological malignancy and new possible T3 target genes in these patients have been identified.

Currently, however, evidence that supports reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been reported. METHODS: We conducted whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA from clinical specimens at the initial infection and at the positive retest from 6 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and retested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via rRT-PCR after recovery. A total of 13 viral RNAs from the patients’ respiratory specimens were consecutively obtained, which enabled us to characterize the difference in viral genomes between initial infection and positive retest. RESULTS: At the time of the positive retest, we were able to acquire a complete genome sequence from patient 1, a 21-year-old previously healthy woman. In this patient, through the phylogenetic analysis, we confirmed that the viral RNA of positive retest was clustered into a subgroup distinct from that of the initial infection, suggesting that there was a reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with a subtype that was different from that of the primary strain. The spike protein D614G substitution that defines the clade “G” emerged in reinfection, while mutations that characterize the clade “V” (ie, nsp6 L37F and ORF3a G251V) were present at initial infection.

DESIGN: Retrospective; observational study. SETTING: Istanbul Faculty of Medicine hospital, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: 362 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from March 11 to May 11, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: The demographic information; associated comorbidities; presenting clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics on admission and outcomes from the electronic medical records were analyzed comparatively between the younger (<65 years) and older (≥65 years) adults. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality of the older adults were analyzed by multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46–67), and 224 (61.9%) were male. There were 104 (28.7%) patients ≥65 years of age. More than half of the patients (58%) had one or more chronic comorbidity. The three most common presenting symptoms in the older patients were fatigue/myalgia (89.4%), dry cough (72.1%), and fever (63.5%). Cough and fever were significantly less prevalent in older adults compared to younger patients (p=0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Clinically severe pneumonia was present in 31.5% of the study population being more common in older adults (49% vs. 24.4%) (p<0.001). The laboratory parameters that were significantly different between the older and younger adults were as follows: the older patients had significantly higher CRP, D-dimer, TnT, pro-BNP, procalcitonin levels, higher prevalence of lymphopenia, neutrophilia, increased creatinine, and lower hemoglobin, ALT, albumin level (p<0.05). In the radiological evaluation, more than half of the patients (54.6%) had moderate-severe pneumonia, which was more prevalent in older patients (66% vs. 50%) (p=0.006). The adverse outcomes were significantly more prevalent in older adults compared to the younger patients (ICU admission, 28.8% vs. 8.9%; mortality, 23.1% vs. 4.3%, p<0.001). Among the triage evaluation parameters, the only factor associated with higher mortality was the presence of clinically severe pneumonia on admission (Odds Ratio=12.3, 95% confidence interval=2.7–55.5, p=0.001).

Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (α-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10−4 M to one of 10−9 M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of VSV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors.","Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Simpson, Robert W.",Virology,341,17

Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility. Graphical Abstract.

Here we develop an individual-based model for epidemic spreading on networks in which viruses are explicitly represented by finite chains of nucleotides that can mutate inside the host. Under the hypothesis of neutral evolution we compute analytically the average pairwise genetic distance between all infecting viruses over time. We also derive a mean-field version of this equation that can be added directly to compartmental models such as SIR or SEIR to estimate the genetic evolution. We compare our results with the inferred genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the epidemic in China and found good agreement with the analytical solution of our model. Finally, using genetic distance as a proxy for different strains, we use numerical simulations to show that the lower the connectivity between communities, e.g., cities, the higher the probability of reinfection.","Marquioni, Vitor M.; de Aguiar, Marcus A.

Visiting restrictions introduced since the start of the pandemic in residential care facilities (RCFs) may impact negatively on visitors including close family, friends, and guardians. We examined the effects of COVID-19 visiting restrictions on measures of perceived loneliness, well-being, and carer quality of life (QoL) amongst visitors of residents with and without cognitive impairment (CI) in Irish RCFs. Methods: We created a cross-sectional online survey. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA brief loneliness scale, psychological well-being with the WHO-5 Well-being Index and carer QoL with the Adult Carer QoL Questionnaire (support for caring subscale). Satisfaction with care (“increased/same” and “decreased”) was measured. A history of CI was reported by respondents. Sampling was by convenience with the link circulated through university mail lists and targeted social media accounts for 2 weeks in June 2020. Results: In all, 225 responses were included of which 202 noted whether residents had reported CI. Most of the 202 identified themselves as immediate family (91%) and as female (82%). The majority (67%) were aged between 45 and 64 years. Most (80%) reported that their resident had CI. Approximately one-third indicated reduced satisfaction (27%) or that restrictions had impaired communication with nursing home staff (38%). Median loneliness scores were 4/9, well-being scores 60/100 and carer QoL scores 10/15. Visitors of those with CI reported significantly lower well-being (p = 0.006) but no difference in loneliness (p = 0.114) or QoL (p = 0.305). Reported CI (p = 0.04) remained an independent predictors of lower WHO-5 scores, after adjusting for age, sex, RCF location, and dementia stage (advanced), satisfaction with care (reduced), and perception of staff support measured on the Adult Carer QoL Questionnaire. Conclusion: This survey suggests that many RCF visitors experienced low psychosocial and emotional well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown. Visitors of residents with CI report significantly poorer well-being as measured by the WHO-5 than those without. Additional research is required to understand the importance of disrupted caregiving roles resulting from visiting restrictions on well-being, particularly on visitors of residents with CI and how RCFs and their staff can support visitors to mitigate these.","O'Caoimh, Rónán; O'Donovan, Mark R.; Monahan, Margaret P.; Dalton O'Connor, Caroline; Buckley, Catherine; Kilty, Caroline; Fitzgerald, Serena; Hartigan, Irene; Cornally, Nicola",Front Psychiatry,341,26

A molecular framework of how the virus manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection remains unclear. Here, we focus on SARS-CoV-2 NSP1, which is proposed to be a virulence factor that inhibits protein synthesis by directly binding the human ribosome. Using extract-based and reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that NSP1 inhibits translation initiation on model human and SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs. NSP1 also specifically binds to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, which is required for translation inhibition. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays to monitor NSP1–40S subunit binding in real time, we demonstrate that eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) modulate the interaction: NSP1 rapidly and stably associates with most ribosomal pre-initiation complexes in the absence of mRNA, with particular enhancement and inhibition by eIF1 and eIF3j, respectively. Using model mRNAs and an inter-ribosomal-subunit FRET signal, we elucidate that NSP1 competes with RNA segments downstream of the start codon to bind the 40S subunit and that the protein is unable to associate rapidly with 80S ribosomes assembled on an mRNA. Collectively, our findings support a model where NSP1 associates with the open head conformation of the 40S subunit to inhibit an early step of translation, by preventing accommodation of mRNA within the entry channel. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. A molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates host cellular machinery to facilitate infection is needed. Here, we integrate biochemical and single-molecule strategies to reveal molecular insight into how NSP1 from SARS-CoV-2 inhibits translation initiation. NSP1 directly binds to the small (40S) subunit of the human ribosome, which is modulated by human initiation factors. Further, NSP1 and mRNA compete with each other to bind the ribosome. Our findings suggest that the presence of NSP1 on the small ribosomal subunit prevents proper accommodation of the mRNA. How this competition disrupts the many steps of translation initiation is an important target for future studies.","Lapointe, Christopher P.; Grosely, Rosslyn; Johnson, Alex G.; Wang, Jinfan; Fernández, Israel S.; Puglisi, Joseph D.",bioRxiv,341,18

However, the population of patients with COVID who are admitted with false negative testing is unstudied. OBJECTIVE: To characterize and develop a model to predict true SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients who initially test negative for COVID by PCR. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between 3/10/2020 and 9/1/2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who received diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. EXPOSURE: We developed a logistic regression model from readily available electronic health record data to predict SARS-CoV-2 positivity in patients who were positive for COVID and those who were negative and never retested. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: This model was applied to patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 who were retested within the first 96 hours of hospitalization. We evaluated the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who would subsequently retest negative and those who would subsequently retest positive. RESULTS: We included 31,459 hospitalized adult patients; 2,666 of these patients tested positive for COVID and 3,511 initially tested negative for COVID and were retested. Of the patients who were retested, 61 (1.7%) had a subsequent positive COVID test. The model showed that higher age, vital sign abnormalities, and lower white blood cell count served as strong predictors for COVID positivity in these patients. The model had moderate performance to predict which patients would retest positive with a test set area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.70 – 0.83). Using a cutpoint for our risk prediction model at the 90(th) percentile for probability, we were able to capture 35/61 (57%) of the patients who would retest positive. This cutpoint amounts to a number-needed-to-retest range between 15 and 77 patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: We show that a pragmatic model can predict which patients should be retested for COVID. Further research is required to determine if this risk model can be applied prospectively in hospitalized patients to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Ghazi, Lama; Simonov, Michael; Mansour, Sherry; Moledina, Dennis; Greenberg, Jason; Yamamoto, Yu; Biswas, Aditya; Wilson, F.

The clinical course, outcomes, and significance of immunosuppression regimen in heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We included the first 99 heart transplant recipients at participating centers with COVID-19 and followed patients until resolution. We collected baseline information, symptoms, laboratory studies, vital signs, and outcomes for included patients. The association of immunosuppression regimens at baseline with severe disease were compared using logistic regression, adjusting for age and time since transplant. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years, 25% were female, and 44% were white. The median time post-transplant to infection was 5.6 years. Overall, 15% died, 64% required hospital admission, and 7% remained asymptomatic. During the course of illness, only 57% of patients had a fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms were common. Tachypnea, oxygen requirement, elevated creatinine and inflammatory markers were predictive of severe course. Age ≥60 was associated with higher risk of death and the use of the combination of calcineurin inhibitor, antimetabolite, and prednisone was associated with more severe disease compared to the combination of calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite alone (adjusted OR=7.3, 95% CI 1.8-36.2). Among hospitalized patients, 30% were treated for secondary infection, acute kidney injury was common and 17% required new renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We present the largest study to date of heart transplant patients with COVID-19 showing common atypical presentations and a high case fatality rate of 24% among hospitalized patients and 16% among symptomatic patients.","MD, Michael V.

Furthermore, the VRD sensitivity for different Ct-value groups (Ct <20; Ct 20-25, Ct 25-30 and Ct > 30) and different intervals since symptom onset (< 7 days; > 7 days) were examined. Design: Prospective performance evaluation study. Setting: Municipal Health Service (GGD) COVID-19 test centres in West-Brabant, the Netherlands Participants: In order to evaluate clinical specificity, 352 symptomatic adults (> 18 years) who presented at a participating GGD test centre for a COVID- 19 test between September 28 and October 7 2020 were included. In order to evaluate clinical sensitivity, 123 symptomatic adults (> 18 years) who were tested positive with qRT-PCR in a participating GGD test centre between September 26 and October 6 were included. Results: An overall clinical specificity of 100% (95%CI : 98.9%-100%) and sensitivity of 80.7% (95% CI: 73,2%-86,9%) was found for the VRD compared to qRT-PCR. Sensitivity was the highest for low Ct-value categories and for specimen obtained within the first days after disease onset. For specimen obtained within 7 days after onset of symptoms, the overall sensitivity was 91.0% (95%: CI 82,4%-96,3%) and 98,6% (95%: CI 92,3%-100%) for samples with qRT-PCR Ct-value beneath 30. Conclusion: The VRD is a promising diagnostic test for COVID-19 community screening for symptomatic individuals within 7 days after symptom onset in function of disease control. The clinical sensitivity was highest when viral load was high, which correlated with the duration of symptoms.

However, the highly virulent pathogens are equipped with diverse molecular mechanisms that can subvert the host countermeasures and/or exaggerate the host cell responses to toxic levels leading to severe illnesses. In his review, we discuss the immune-mediated pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease induced by the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus. SARS-Cov-2 primarily infects type II alveolar epithelial cells. These cells are highly abundant with the ACE2 receptor protein, which occurs to be counterpart of the viral Spike protein and thus facilitates internalization of the virus. Following infection onset, the rapid clinical deterioration occurs about in a week suggesting that the respiratory failure in COVID-19 could result from a unique pattern of immune impairment characterized by severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (known as cytokine storm) leading to macrophage activation syndrome. In addition, the SARS-Cov-2 infection can induce a profound depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, CD19 lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, i.e., all major guardians cell components of the host immune barrier. However, while the numbers of that cells decline in the sequelae of the disease, the presence of persistent hyper-inflammation driving progressive tissue injury, suggests that the deteriorating impact of the systemic reactive responses can be more significant than the virus-induced cytopathic effects on the immunocompetent cells. In this respect, the authors discuss the emerging evidence of beneficial effects of administration of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells—another sentinel-type cells—in management of the hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, they also discuss the exosomes-originated mechanisms, which sustain regeneration of the damaged pulmonary lining cells and the vascular endothelial cells in various organs, including the brain.","Sanders, Jason; Schneider, E.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of a Swedish PFAC operating at the managerial level at one of Sweden’s six regional cancer centres. METHODS: This was a qualitative, single-case study based on interviews with PFAC participants and meeting minutes from PFAC meetings. These were analysed using a modified version of a framework developed by Abelson et al. to design and evaluate collective involvement processes in the healthcare sector: (i) representation; (ii) information; (iii) process or procedures and (iv) outcomes and decisions. RESULTS: The descriptive representation was good regarding geographical location and cancer diagnosis. Information from the regional cancer centre was an important part of the meeting agenda. The procedures encouraged everyone to speak up, and the participants saw the representatives from the regional cancer centre as allies against the hospitals and regions, raising some questions about the PFAC's independence. Regarding outcomes, most participants did not know to what extent their work had led to any improvements in cancer care. However, they still regarded the council as effective, as issues the participants raised were listened to by the representatives from the regional cancer centre and ‘taken further’ in the healthcare organization. CONCLUSIONS: The participants were satisfied with being listened to, but they found it difficult to know whether their work had led to improvements, in part because they did not know enough about how the healthcare organization worked above the care-provision level. This was a hurdle to achieving change. The study suggests it is more difficult for patients and next of kin to participate at the managerial level, compared to the care-provision level in healthcare systems, where they could potentially influence important aspects of cancer care and policy, since it is at these levels strategic decisions about priorities in cancer care and service configurations are made. This indicates that there is a particular need for guidance and support for patient and public involvement to work successfully at this level, which may include relevant education and training in system knowledge.","Fredriksson, Mio; Modigh, Anton",BMC Health Serv Res,341,16

However, definitive research studies take time while real-world experience accumulates. Adoption of new practices before adequate comparison to current treatments threaten successful study conduct and may expose patients to what is ultimately learned to be inferior treatment. We conducted a survey to understand the Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) community's predictions about (a) future practice trends in the HCT field and (b) results of ongoing Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) trials to gauge how the HCT community views the treatments being studied. METHOD: The survey was distributed between February and March 2019 to an electronic mailing list maintained by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) of HCT clinicians practicing in the United States. RESULTS: Of 986 clinicians surveyed, 315 responded (32%). They predicted an increase in the number of HCTs performed for malignant hematologic diseases and benign diseases such as sickle cell, autoimmune and genetic disorders. The majority (63%) predicted that matched related donors (MRD) will remain the preferred donor source for adult HCT recipients in 2023 but 21% predicted haploidentical (Haplo) and 17% predicted matched unrelated donors (MUD) would be the preferred donors. Most respondents (65%) predicted a decrease in the use of umbilical cord blood (UCB) as a graft source for HCT. Most respondents also predicted that calcineurin-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis would be replaced by post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) (55%), biomarker use would become standard practice to guide GVHD therapy (73%), and steroids would be combined with other agents for first line therapy for newly diagnosed acute and (53%) chronic GVHD (54%). In ongoing BMT CTN trials where outcomes are not yet known, 60% to 92% of respondents had an opinion about which arm they thought would be superior. However, not all respondents predicted the same outcome with a range of 44% to 88% choosing the same arm. There was not a clear relationship between the proportion predicting the same arm would win and accrual to the trial. CONCLUSION: Survey respondents are optimistic about growth in the volume of transplant procedures, and they also expect significant changes in the practice of HCT over the next few years including wider adoption of PTCy GVHD prophylaxis, increased use of biomarkers to guide GVHD therapy, and decreased use of UCB HCT. The degree of equipoise in the community about the relative efficacy of therapies being studied did not seem to affect accrual to current BMT CTN trials but this is an area that needs further investigation.","Farhadfar, Nosha; Burns, Linda J.; Mupfudze, Tatenda; Shaw, Bronwen E.; Bollard, Catherine M.; Devine, Steven M.; Horowitz, Mary M.; Jones, Richard J.; Murthy, Hemant S.; Wingard, John R.; Lee, Stephanie J.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,341,1

Individuals living with SCD are at high risk of developing serious infections which can further trigger disease related complications and attribute additional morbidity and mortality. In light of the evolving pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease, and the potential for future infectious disease epidemics, it is important to understand the impact that COVID-19 has on hospitalization rates and mortality in this medically vulnerable population. The objective of this study was to describe hospitalization and case fatality rates secondary to COVID-19 among individuals living with SCD in different age groups and compare these to the general population. The Medical College of Wisconsin established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect data on pediatric and adult COVID-19 infections in individuals living with SCD. Providers are instructed to report confirmed COVID-19 cases to the registry after sufficient time has passed to observe the disease course through resolution of acute illness and/or death. For each case, providers complete a short form that includes the following data: patient demographics, COVID-19 related hospitalization, COVID-19 severity/management strategies, if the patient died due to COVID, and other information about SCD complications. Data are de-identified and without protected health information to facilitate rapid and increased reporting. We calculated the hospitalization rate and case fatality rate for individuals with SCD by specific age group and contrasted it with the rates publicly available for the general Black population. We utilized data from California Department of Public Health for case fatality rate comparison in Blacks and data from COVID-NET for hospitalization rate comparison. We used indirect age adjustment to calculate standardized mortality ratios using COVID-19 data from California state as the reference population. As of July 17th 2020, 218 cases of COVID-19 in Blacks with SCD in the US were reported to the registry. There was a slight predominance of females (52.8%) and 32.1% of reported cases were patients 18 years and under. There were 15 deaths reported with overall mortality rate of 6.9%. Figure 1 shows the distribution of cases and deaths by age group and gender. Mortality rate in SCD patients was highest in the 50-64 years age group (23.1%) in contrast to mortality rate peaks seen in the general population in patients older than 80 years (Table 1). Young adult SCD patients aged 18-34 years had a case fatality rate of 3.3% and those aged 34-50 years had a rate of 14.9%. California Department of Public Health report case fatality rates for Blacks are less than 1% in both of these comparative age groups. Age-standardized mortality ratio shows that individuals with SCD are 7.7 times more likely to die due to COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. The overall hospitalization rate in individuals with SCD was 72.5% and 18.8% of reported hospitalized cases were children. Among hospitalized adults with SCD, stratification by age showed that 85% were aged 18-49, whereas only 25.7% of people 18-49 years in the general Black population were hospitalized (Table 2). Our findings show that individuals with SCD who have COVID-19 infection have higher rates of death due to COVID-19 than the general Black population. Also, a large proportion of COVID hospitalization for the SCD population occurs among the younger age group. Further analysis is planned to examine effects of underlying comorbidities and prior SCD-associated complications on the severity of COVID-19 in individuals with SCD.

This technique makes it possible to measure the colloid concentration field during the drying of the drop at a high accuracy (about 0.5%) and with a high temporal and spatial resolution (about 1 frame/s and 5 $\mu$m/pixel). These features allow us to probe mass transport of the charged dispersion in this out-of-equilibrium situation. In particular, our experiments provide the evidence that mass transport within the drop can be described by a purely diffusive process for some range of parameters for which the buoyancy-driven convection is negligible. We are then able to extract from these experiments the collective diffusion coefficient of the dispersion $D(\varphi)$ over a wide concentration range $\varphi=0.24$-$0.5$, i.e. from the liquid dispersed state to the solid glass regime, with a high accuracy. The measured values of $D(\varphi)\simeq 5$-$12 D_0$ are significantly larger than the simple estimate $D_0$ given by the Stokes-Einstein relation, thus highlighting the important role played by the colloidal interactions in such dispersions.","Sobac, Benjamin; Dehaeck, Sam; Bouchaudy, Anne; Salmon, Jean-Baptiste",Soft matter,341,16

These sex differences are consistent with broader findings in psychology, reflecting women’s stronger empathy, higher pathogen disgust, health concern, care-taking orientation, and dislike for the suffering of other people—as well as men’s higher risk-taking, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and focus on financial indicators of success and status. This review article contextualizes sex differences in pandemic leadership in an evolutionary framework. Evolution by natural selection is the only known process in nature that organizes organisms into higher degrees of functional order, or counteracts the unavoidable disorder that would otherwise ensue, and is therefore essential for explaining the origins of human sex differences. Differential sexual selection and parental investment between males and females, together with the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, drive sex differences in cognition and behavioral dispositions, underlying men’s and women’s leadership styles and decision-making during a global pandemic. According to the sexually dimorphic leadership specialization hypothesis, general psychobehavioral sex differences have been exapted during human evolution to create sexually dimorphic leadership styles. They may be facultatively co-opted by societies and/or followers when facing different kinds of ecological and/or sociopolitical threats, such as disease outbreaks or intergroup aggression. Early evidence indicates that against the invisible viral foe that can bring nations to their knees, the strategic circumspection of empathic feminine health “worriers” may bring more effective and humanitarian outcomes than the devil-may-care incaution of masculine risk-taking “warriors”.","Luoto, Severi; Varella, Marco Antonio Correa",Front Psychol,341,20

When the clinical environment resumed student placement, the potential health risks had caused additional anxiety to the students and clinical faculty. This paper aims to examine the measures implemented to support the radiation therapy students during their first clinical placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: : The 2nd year radiation therapy students’ first clinical placement was organized around the pandemic restrictions requiring new activities to support student safety and wellness. The clinical faculty team redesigned the clinical course to integrate enhanced communication, additional safety measures and mental wellness sessions, COVID-19 related resources during the week-long orientation and throughout the semester. METHODS: : Registered students were asked to participate in a 9-item survey questionnaire to gather their perspective on the effectiveness of the orientation and clinical activities during the pandemic. The responses were tabulated and independently analyzed by the 2 clinical faculty for emergent themes. DISCUSSION: : The students reported that the combination of activities, workshops, exposure to the treatment unit and feedback from both clinical faculty and learning mentors provided the support needed for physical safety and wellness in the clinic. Identified challenges included communication with continuous masking, the timeliness of communicating evolving clinical safety protocols and the need for enhanced coordination of interprofessional education. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges and opportunities for students and clinical faculty at the University of Alberta's Radiation Therapy department. The results of the quality improvement survey highlighted the importance and effectiveness of the redesigned clinical course which integrated COVID-19 related activities, enhanced communication strategies, safety, wellness resources and check-ins throughout the course duration.","Palmaria, Cynthia; Osmar, Kari",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,341,1

We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients presenting with initial gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: We evaluated all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 10 and February 29, 2020. We divided these patients into two groups: patients with initial gastrointestinal symptoms (group A, n = 183) and patients with respiratory syndrome and/or fever (group B, n = 1228). The clinical characteristics, radiological features, and laboratory data were assessed. RESULTS: The clinical procedures of both groups underwent 1-2 weeks rising period and were downward trend at 3 weeks; less than 5% of patients progressed to critical illness. In both groups, mean leukocyte count (P = 0.354) and lymphocyte count (P = 0.386) were below normal, and C-reactive protein level was elevated (P = 0.412).

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","Chakraborty, Sandipan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,341,32

Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented. METHODS: To estimate the comparative efficacy of individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit a model to the incubation period distribution (mean 5·2 days) and to two estimates of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4·8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7·5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we considered two feasibility settings: a high-feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and a low-feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a 2-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. FINDINGS: Model fitting by sequential Monte Carlo resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset before symptom onset of 0·77 days (95% CI −1·98 to 0·29) for the shorter serial interval, and for the longer serial interval it resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset after symptom onset of 0·51 days (95% CI −0·77 to 1·50). Individual quarantine in high-feasibility settings, where at least 75% of infected contacts are individually quarantined, contains an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with a short serial interval (4·8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where the outbreak continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms). When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1·25, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number <1). INTERPRETATION: Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost–benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts. To the extent that these interventions can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

As vaccines are given to millions of healthy people, including children, to prevent life-threatening diseases, vaccines must meet high safety standards. Vaccine safety monitoring is of paramount importance to maintain trust in vaccination programs globally. Once a vaccine is licensed and recommended for use, its safety and effectiveness must be monitored during its whole lifecycle, as the safety profile and protective effectiveness may change over time. A well-established safety governance model across the organization with underlying processes for data collection, signal and risk management and communication is essential. A “fit for purpose” pharmacovigilance system may vary as it depends on several factors. However, all vaccine manufacturers strive to achieve a pharmacovigilance system satisfying Good Pharmacovigilance Practices, in compliance with national, international and supranational requirements, as applicable. A landscape analysis, using a questionnaire covering nine pharmacovigilance key areas related to an effective system, was conducted to understand the existing pharmacovigilance structures, practices and expertise of vaccine manufacturers from emerging countries, on an institutional level. 34 of the 43 contacted manufacturers participated voluntarily. The survey results show that all respondents have established vaccine safety capacity, mainly in collecting and handling adverse events following immunization and implementing standardized processes; the survey also shows differences in the maturity of the manufacturers’ pharmacovigilance system, Quality Management System, signal and risk management, and safety governance. The analysis provides a tool for manufacturers to gain a “bird's-eye” view of the structure of pharmacovigilance key areas and the operational dimensions covered by each area, to benchmarking against international expectations, serving as a basis to further strengthen pharmacovigilance systems, to support accelerated global vaccine supply.","Hartmann, Katharina; Pagliusi, Sonia; Precioso, Alexander",Vaccine,341,33

METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study was conducted in the Pediatric Emergency and Intensive Care Units and COVID-19 hospital of a tertiary care teaching and referral hospital in North India over a period of 5 months (September 2020-January 2021). Clinical details, laboratory investigations, intensive care needs, treatment, and short-term outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Forty children with median (IQR) age of 7 (5-10) years were enrolled. The common clinical features were fever (97.5%), mucocutaneous involvement (80%), abdominal (72.5%) and respiratory (50%) symptoms. Shock was noted in 80% children. Most cases (85%) required PICU admission where they received nasal prong oxygen (40%), non-invasive (22.5%) and invasive (22.5%) ventilation, and vasoactive drug support (72.5%). The confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 exposure was noted in the form of positive serology (66.7%), RT PCR (10%), and contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive case (12.5%). The common echocardiographic findings included myocardial dysfunction (ejection fraction <55%) (72.5%), and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (22.5%). The immunomodulatory treatment included IVIG (2 gm/kg) (100%) and steroids (methylprednisolone 10-30 mg/kg/day for 3-5 days) (85%). Aspirin was used in 80% and heparin (low molecular weight) in 7.5% cases. Two children died (5%) and median duration of PICU and hospital stay in survivors were 5 (2-8) and 7 (4-9) days, respectively. Children with shock showed higher total leucocyte count and higher rates of myocardial dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular involvement and shock are predominant features in severe disease. Early diagnosis may be challenging given the overlapping features with other diagnoses. A high index of suspicion is warranted in children with constellation of fever, mucocutaneous, GI and cardiovascular involvement alongwith evidence of systemic inflammation and recent or concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The short-term outcome is good with appropriate organ support therapies and immunomodulation.","Angurana, Suresh Kumar; Awasthi, Puspraj; Thakur, Ajay; Randhawa, Manjinder Singh; Nallasamy, Karthi; Kumar, Manoj Rohit; Naganur, Sanjeev; Kumar, Mahendra; Goyal, Kapil; Ghosh, Arnab; Bansal, Arun; Jayashree, Muralidharan",J Trop Pediatr,341,19

However, when measuring three-dimensional flows with two-dimensional (2D) PIV, there are some uncertainties in the measured velocity field due to out-of-plane motion, which might alter turbulence statistics and distort the overall flow characteristics. In the present study, three different turbulence models are employed and compared. Mean and fluctuating fields obtained by three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modeling are compared to experimental data. Turbulence statistics such as integral length scale, Taylor microscale, Kolmogorov scale, turbulence kinetic energy, dissipation rate, and velocity correlations are calculated at different experimental conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature, fan speed, etc.). A reasonably isotropic and homogeneous turbulence with large turbulence intensities is achieved in the central region extending to almost 45 mm radius. This radius decreases with increasing the initial pressure. The influence of the third dimension velocity component on the measured characteristics is negligible. This is a result of the axisymmetric features of the flow pattern in the current vessel. The results prove that the present vessel can be conveniently adopted for several turbulent combustion studies including mainly the determination of turbulent burning velocity for gaseous premixed flames in nearly homogeneous isotropic turbulence.

Patients with COVID-19 were also identified in Chongqing. This study aimed to investigate the clinical and demographic characteristics of cluster cases and sporadic cases of COVID-19 in 141 patients in the main district of Chongqing during one month, between January and February 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective study included 141 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The diagnosis was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The patients were divided into cluster cases (n=90) and sporadic cases (n=51). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two study groups and included the presence of comorbidities, the presenting symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging findings, and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The mean age of the 141 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was 47.3 years, and the most common presenting symptom was a persistent cough (48.9%). The 90 cluster cases (63.8%) were older than the sporadic cases, and cross-infection from family gathering occurred in 82.2%, and cough was more common than fever, and there was an increased prevalence of asymptomatic, mild, and moderate cases. Cluster cases showed fewer typical manifestations of COVID-19 on chest CT. However, the laboratory findings between the cluster and sporadic cases showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: There were demographic and clinical differences between cluster cases and sporadic cases of COVID-19 in the main district of Chongqing during the month between January to February 2020.","Chen, Peng; Zhang, Ying; Wen, Yongsheng; Guo, Jinjun; Bai, Weizhi; Jia, Jinwei; Ma, Yu; Xu, Yi",Med Sci Monit,341,1

METHODS: : The overall frame was Complex Interventions, and the study was conducted within the phenomenological-hermeneutic tradition. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with eight nurse communication guides. Data were analysed using a Ricoeur-inspired interpretation method. RESULTS: : Two main themes emerged: 1) “The communication intervention components provided overview, a conceptual framework, awareness and room for reflection” and 2) “Being a communication guide illuminated the barriers and challenges of implementation”. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding was established that illuminated experiences throughout the analysis: “An ICU communication intervention has to be adaptable to the specific situation and the double need for individualization but also provide overall guidance”. CONCLUSION: : Findings showed that as communication is inherent to all human beings, it can be difficult to change the communication behaviour of nurses. Therefore, a communication intervention in the intensive care unit must be sensitive to the nurse communication guides’ individual communication style. Furthermore, a communication intervention should provide nurse communication guides with overall guidance while at the same time remaining adaptable to the needs of each specific situation.","Holm, Anna; Karlsson, Veronika; Dreyer, Pia",International journal of qualitative studies on health and well-being,341,1

The immune system is regulated both locally and systemically by the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the adrenal gland and local sympathetic neurons. Immune cells respond by activation of adrenergic receptors, primarily the β2-adrenergic receptor, which signal through heterotrimeric G-proteins. Depending upon the cell type, adrenergic signaling regulates a variety of functions in immune cells ranging from cellular migration to cytokine secretion. Furthermore, due to the diurnal oscillation of systemic norepinephrine levels, various immune functions follow a circadian rhythmic pattern. This review will highlight recent advances in our understanding of how the sympathetic nervous system regulates both innate and adaptive immune functions and how this regulation is linked to circadian rhythms.","Sharma, Drashya; Farrar, J.

Large psychological shifts were found reflecting three distinct phases. When COVID-19 warnings first emerged (“warning phase”), people’s attentional focus switched to the impending threat. Anxiety levels surged, and positive emotion and anger dropped. In parallel, people’s thinking became more intuitive rather than analytic. When lockdowns began (“isolation phase”), analytic thinking dropped further. People became sadder, and their thinking reflected attempts to process the uncertainty. Familial ties strengthened, but ties to broader social groups weakened. Six weeks after COVID-19’s onset (“normalization phase”), people’s psychological states stabilized but remained elevated. Most psychological shifts were stronger when the threat of COVID-19 was greater.

In addition, tracheal compression by thyroid nodules can aggravate hypoxia in critically ill patients. No studies have investigated the effect of thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID‐19. In this study, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormonal disorders and thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID‐19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Şırnak State Hospital (Pandemic hospital in Turkey) between 15 March and 15 August 2020. We evaluated thyroid hormonal disorder and thyroid nodules in 125 patients who were admitted to the non‐intensive care unit (non‐ICU) due to mild COVID‐19 pneumonia (group 1) and 125 critically ill patients who were admitted to the ICU (group 2). RESULTS: Thyroid‐stimulating hormone levels (TSH) were not significantly different between groups 1 and 2; however, group 2 patients had significantly lower levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) as compared to group 1 (P = .005, P < .0001, respectively). FT3 level showed a negative correlation with length of hospital stay and C‐reactive protein level (rho: −0.216, p: 0.001; rho: −0.383, P < .0001). Overt thyroid disorder was observed in 13 patients [2 patients in group 1 (both with overt thyrotoxicosis) and 11 patients in group 2 (3 overt hypothyroidism, 8 overt thyrotoxicosis) (P = .01)]. Thyroid nodules sized ≥1 cm were found in 9 patients (7%) in group 1 and 32 patients (26%) in group 2 (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Overt thyroid hormonal disorders were more common in critically ill COVID‐19 patients. FT3 level at hospital admission is a potential prognostic marker of COVID‐19 patients. Thyroid nodules may be associated with severe COVID‐19 disease.","Güven, Mehmet; Gültekin, Hamza",Int J Clin Pract,341,1

DESIGN: A cross-sectional online survey. SETTING: The study surveyed 31 provinces in China. PARTICIPANTS: This study surveyed 5039 respondents in China. OUTCOME MEASURES: Public stigma towards both patients with COVID-19 and Wuhan residents was measured. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with public COVID-19-related stigma. RESULTS: Among the participants, 122 (2.4%) reported themselves and 254 (5.0%) reported the communities they lived in as holding a stigmatising attitude towards patients with COVID-19, respectively. Additionally, 114 (2.5%) and 475 (10.3%) reported that themselves and the communities they lived in, respectively, held a stigma against people from Wuhan, which was the most severely affected area in China. People aged over 40, lived in areas with severe epidemics (adjusted OR (aOR)=2.03, 95% CI (1.05 to 3.92)) and who felt it difficult to find and understand information about COVID-19 (aOR=1.91, 95% CI (1.08 to 3.37); aOR=1.88, 95% CI (1.08 to 3.29)) were more likely to stigmatise patients with COVID-19. People who were male, aged 41–50 and had difficulty understanding information (aOR=2.08, 95% CI (1.17 to 3.69)) were more likely to stigmatise people from Wuhan. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and Wuhan residents suffered stigma at both the individual and the community levels. Those who had low health literacy, who lived in areas with a large number of COVID-19 cases and who were of ethnic minorities were more likely to stigmatise others. Tailored interventions are encouraged to improve health literacy and consequently to reduce public COVID-19-related stigma.","Jiang, Tianyu; Zhou, Xudong; Lin, Leesa; Pan, Yanzheng; Zhong, Yuyuan; Wang, Xiaomin; Zhu, Hui",BMJ Open,341,1

Response to the Covid-19 pandemic have created a long list of new stressors for teachers to deal with, including problems caused by the emergency conversion to online language teaching. This article examines the stress and coping responses of an international sample of over 600 language teachers who responded to an online survey in April, 2020. The survey measured stressors and 14 coping strategies grouped into two types, approach and avoidant. Substantial levels of stress were reported by teachers. Correlations show that positive psychological outcomes (wellbeing, health, happiness, resilience, and growth during trauma) correlated positively with approach coping and negatively with avoidant coping. Avoidant coping, however, consistently correlated (rs between .42 and .54) only with the negative outcomes (stress, anxiety, anger, sadness, and loneliness). In addition, ANOVA showed that although approach coping was consistently used across stress groups, avoidant coping increased as stress increased suggesting that there may be a cost to using avoidant coping strategies. Stepwise regression analyses using the 14 specific coping strategies showed a complex pattern of coping. Suggestions for avoiding avoidance coping strategies are offered.","MacIntyre, Peter D.; Gregersen, Tammy; Mercer, Sarah",,341,5

They specifically bind carbohydrate moieties on cell membranes and trigger cell internalization. Fungal lectin MpL (Macrolepiota procera lectin) does not provoke cancer cell cytotoxicity but is able to bind aminopeptidase N (CD13) and integrin α3β1, two glycoproteins that are overexpressed on the membrane of tumor cells. Upon binding, MpL is endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner and accumulates initially in the Golgi apparatus and, finally, in the lysosomes. For effective binding and internalization a functional binding site on the α-repeat is needed. To test the potential of MpL as a carrier for delivering protein drugs to cancer cells we constructed fusion proteins consisting of MpL and the cysteine peptidase inhibitors cystatin C and clitocypin. The fused proteins followed the same endocytic route as the unlinked MpL. Peptidase inhibitor-MpL fusions impaired both the intracellular degradation of extracellular matrix and the invasiveness of cancer cells. MpL is thus shown in vitro to be a lectin that can enable protein drugs to enter cancer cells, enhance their internalization and sort them to lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus.","Žurga, Simon; Nanut, Milica Perišić; Kos, Janko; Sabotič, Jerica",Oncotarget,341,31

In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed. This viewpoint suggests different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations’ contribution.

It was shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Pregnant and breastfeeding people were largely excluded from clinical trials and hence, the extent to which results can be applied to these populations is not clear. OBJECTIVES: To synthesize published data on tocilizumab in pregnancy and lactation, highlight important knowledge gaps, and help inform clinical decision-making about tocilizumab’s use in these populations with COVID-19. SOURCES: PubMed was searched for studies evaluating tocilizumab in pregnancy and lactation for COVID-19 and other indications. Literature on pharmacokinetics and reproductive/fetal safety of monoclonal antibodies in general was also sought. US FDA and EMA guidance for the industry and regulatory approval documents were reviewed. CONTENT: Published data on tocilizumab in pregnancy includes 610 cases (n=20 with COVID-19) together with 7 mother-infant breastfeeding pairs. Higher rates of spontaneous abortion and premature birth have been reported compared to the general population, but multiple confounding variables limit interpretation. There is little data on tocilizumab exposure in the second and third trimesters when transplacental transport is highest. The effects of tocilizumab on the developing immune system are unclear. Pregnant patients with COVID-19 who received tocilizumab were often critically ill and corticosteroid use was uncommon. Neonatal follow-up was limited. Tocilizumab appears to be compatible with breastfeeding. IMPLICATIONS: Although the available data do not raise serious safety signals, they have significant limitations and are not sufficient to delineate the complete spectrum of potential adverse outcomes that may be associated with tocilizumab exposure during pregnancy and lactation. Diligent follow-up and documentation of pregnancy outcomes will be important moving forward.

Governments worldwide have legislated non-essential service shutdowns and adapted essential service provision in order to minimise face-to-face contact. We anticipate major consequences resulting from such policies, with marginalised populations expected to bear the greatest burden of such measures, especially those with substance use disorders (SUDs). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We aim to conduct (1) a scoping review to summarise the available evidence evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with SUDs, and (2) an evidence map to visually plot and categorise the current available evidence evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with SUDs to identify gaps in addressing high-risk populations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for this scoping review as we plan to review publicly available data. This is part of a multistep project, whereby we intend to use the findings generated from this review in combination with data from an ongoing prospective cohort study our team is leading, encompassing over 2000 patients with SUDs receiving medication-assisted therapy in Ontario prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Naji, Leen; Dennis, Brittany; Morgan, Rebecca L; Sanger, Nitika; Worster, Andrew; Paul, James; Thabane, Lehana; Samaan, Zainab",BMJ Open,341,16

No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data. The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. We identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-nCoV spike protein that potentially triggers both T-cell and B-cell responses. Analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion. Our computational pipeline is validated with experimental data from SARS-CoV.","Fast, Ethan; Altman, Russ B.; Chen, Binbin",bioRxiv,341,20

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinoviruses are the commonest pathogens associated with these illnesses. Why some infants are severely affected, requiring admission to hospital, whilst others experience a simple cold is not fully understood: research has suggested that the innate immune response to these viruses is important. The innate immune system has many components and activation or deficiency in one or many areas may explain the different clinical presentations and disease severities that can occur in these infants. This review will summarize the recent evidence highlighting how RSV and rhinoviruses may modulate the innate immune response in both bronchiolitis and PSRW, and discuss how these illnesses affect the long-term development of the infant lung and the possible susceptibility to persistent airway disease.","Halfhide, Clare; Smyth, Rosalind L.",Paediatr Respir Rev,341,24

The COVID-19 pandemic has further magnified this problem by the possibility of viral transmission via fomites. To protect themselves, staff and providers were donning personal protective equipment to review paper records, which was time-consuming and wasteful. We describe an innovative process developed by a team of hospital leadership, members of a local collaborative of skilled nursing facilities, and leadership of this collaborative group, to address this problem. Many possible solutions were suggested and reviewed. We describe the reasons for selecting our final document transfer process and how it was implemented. The critical success factors are also delineated.

Beside their well-known role in wound healing and hemostasis, they are emerging mediators of the immune response and implicated in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including cancer. Despite their anucleate nature, they harbor a diverse set of RNAs, which are subject to an active sorting mechanism from megakaryocytes into proplatelets and affect platelet biogenesis and function. However, sorting mechanisms are poorly understood, but RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been suggested to play a crucial role. Moreover, RBPs may regulate RNA translation and decay following platelet activation. In concert with other regulators, including microRNAs, long non-coding and circular RNAs, RBPs control multiple steps of the platelet life cycle. In this review, we will highlight the different RNA species within platelets and their impact on megakaryopoiesis, platelet biogenesis and platelet function. Additionally, we will focus on the currently known concepts of post-transcriptional control mechanisms important for RNA fate within platelets with a special emphasis on RBPs.","Neu, Carolin T.; Gutschner, Tony; Haemmerle, Monika",Int J Mol Sci,341,20

We examined the incidence of MI during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, which has remained an open society with a different public health approach fighting COVID-19. METHODS: We assessed the incidence rate (IR) as well as the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of all MI referred for coronary angiography in Sweden using the nationwide Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR), during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden (1 March 2020–7 May 2020) in relation to the same days 2015–2019. RESULTS: A total of 2443 MIs were referred for coronary angiography during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in an IR 36 MIs/day (204 MIs/100 000 per year) compared with 15 213 MIs during the reference period with an IR of 45 MIs/day (254 MIs/100 000 per year) resulting in IRR of 0.80, 95% CI (0.74 to 0.86), p<0.001. Results were consistent in all investigated patient subgroups, indicating no change in patient category seeking cardiac care. Kaplan-Meier event rates for 7-day case fatality were 439 (2.3%) compared with 37 (2.9%) (HR: 0.81, 95% CI (0.58 to 1.13), p=0.21). Time to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was shorter during the pandemic and PCI was equally performed, indicating no change in quality of care during the pandemic.

The ubiquitous nature of Norovirus necessitates simple and rapid detection methods with high accuracy and sensitivity. To this end, several investigators have evaluated the usefulness of commercial reverse‐transcription loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (RT‐LAMP) kits for detecting Norovirus genogroups I (GI) and II (GII). In previous studies, the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII showed a relatively high detection rate, while that for Norovirus GI showed a relatively low detection rate. In the present study, clinical Norovirus specimens were used to compare the detection rate of a modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI with the rates of the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI and an “in‐house” RT‐LAMP GI primer set, methods which had a high detection rate. Results from the present study showed that the modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI had a higher detection rate for two viral genotypes (GI.3, GI.11). On comparison with an “in‐house” GII primer set using genotype GII.4 viruses circulating recently, the detection rate by the Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII was found to be higher, with a 98% detection rate. These results indicate the applicability of the modified LAMP kit for GI and the conventional LAMP kit for GII for detection of Noroviruses in clinical samples. J. Med.

As of January 2021, 100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 along with more than 2 million deaths were reported worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines thereby leading to the development of “Cytokine Storm Syndrome.” This condition results in uncontrollable inflammation that further imposes multiple-organ-failure eventually leading to death. SARS-CoV-2 induces unrestrained innate immune response and impairs adaptive immune responses thereby causing tissue damage. Thus, understanding the foremost features and evolution of innate and adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in anticipating COVID-19 outcomes and in developing effective strategies to control the viral spread. In the present review, we exhaustively discuss the sequential key immunological events that occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection and are involved in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to this, we also highlight various therapeutic options already in use such as immunosuppressive drugs, plasma therapy and intravenous immunoglobulins along with various novel potent therapeutic options that should be considered in managing COVID-19 infection such as traditional medicines and probiotics.","Bhardwaj, Asha; Sapra, Leena; Saini, Chaman; Azam, Zaffar; Mishra, Pradyumna K.; Verma, Bhupendra; Mishra, Gyan C.; Srivastava, Rupesh K.",International reviews of immunology,341,26

Fast diagnosis of COVID-19, and finding high-risk patients with worse prognosis for early prevention and medical resources optimization is important. Here, we proposed a fully automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 diagnostic and prognostic analysis by routinely used computed tomography. We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5+ days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimization and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.

METHODS: This descriptive, survey-based cross-sectional study was performed on 533 OR nurses in all the referring hospitals of COVID-19 infection. The required information were collected using a questionnaire regarding the knowledge on the side effects of electrosurgery smoke. The obtained data were then analyzed using t-test and ANOVA by SPSS software. RESULTS: Most of the included participants (93.6%) had a low level of awareness and only a small number of them (0.4%) had a good level of knowledge on the effects of electrosurgery smoke.

Study eligibility criteria: Studies which investigated urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 in infected patients included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two reviewers selected relative studies and performed quality assessment of individual studies. Meta-analysis was performed the pooled case reports and case series. Fixed-effects model was used for analysis as no significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. Results: Thirty three studies were finally included in the systematic review including 19 case reports, 13 case series, and one cohort. Urinary samples from 430 patients were investigated. Ten studies reported the presence of COVID-19 in urinary samples from 16 patients. The rate of COVID-19 presence in urinary samples was 3.7%. Urinary viral load was low in most reports. The presence of virus in urine was not related to the disease course of the illness. Urinary COVID-19 was mostly detected from patients with moderate to severe disease (13 pts) but was also isolated from two children (one neonate and one 7 year-old girl) with mild disease. The pathogenicity of virus isolated from urine has been demonstrated in cell culture media in one study. Conclusions: This review highlights the low frequency of COVID-19 presence in urine of infected individuals and the potential of isolated virus for cytopathic effects. Therefore the probability of infection transmission through urine can be suggested. Caution must be exerted when dealing with urine of patients infected with COVID-19 including medical interventions like endoscopy and urethral catheterization.","Kashi, A.

The frequency of published news is an indicator of the various levels of a problem. The more attention paid by a newspaper to the community, the more valuable it is in reporting problems. Currently, news related to the COVID-19 outbreak is most popular. The media has been reporting not only on health but also on social and economic issues during the pandemic. The questions of this research are (1) what social issues were reported in the online news media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) what economic issues were reported in the online news media during the same period. This study aims to identify the content of news when conveying COVID-19 pandemic information based on the frequency of appearance and news content based on social and economic issues in online news. This is a descriptive quantitative study using a content analysis approach to obtain primary data from 6,376 online news articles published by Antara News from 28 February to 8 April 2020. The NVivo 12 tool was used to analyse the data by dividing the types of COVID-19 issues related to social and economic issues in the news (in the form of text, images, videos and graphics) as an analysis unit. The results showed that Antara News used text, photos, videos and graphics 1,847 times for social issues and 2,701 times for economic issues related to COVID-19. The social issues involved 20 themes. Some of the important ones included regulations, social funds and charities, the humanities, the availability of infrastructure facilities, education, instruction and appeal, and culture and religion. Meanwhile, the economic issues involved 52 themes. Some of the important ones included exchange rates; transportation; the oil, natural gas and electricity industries; social funds and charities; regulation and policy; agriculture; and the tourism industry. The topics are related to social distancing, social restrictions, social actions, culture, other problems associated with the social sector (a decline in community purchasing power, consumption and dismissal) and the real and massive impact on economic growth. COVID-19 is not only a global health crisis but also a major labour market and economic crisis that has had a significant impact on society.

This work aimed to assess the temporal–geospatial associations between PIDRs and COVID-19 infection at the county level in South Carolina. We used the spatial error model (SEM), spatial lag model (SLM), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR) as global models and the geographically weighted regression model (GWR) as a local model. The data were retrieved from multiple sources including USAFacts, U.S. Census Bureau, and the Population Estimates Program. The percentage of males and the unemployed population were positively associated with geodistributions of COVID-19 infection (p values < 0.05) in global models throughout the time. The percentage of the white population and the obesity rate showed divergent spatial correlations at different times of the pandemic. GWR models fit better than global models, suggesting nonstationary correlations between a region and its neighbors. Characterized by temporal–geospatial patterns, disparities in COVID-19 infection rate and their PIDRs are different from the mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 patients. Our findings suggest the importance of prioritizing different populations and developing tailored interventions at different times of the pandemic.","Lyu, Tianchu; Hair, Nicole; Yell, Nicholas; Li, Zhenlong; Qiao, Shan; Liang, Chen; Li, Xiaoming",Int J Environ Res Public Health,341,22

After infection in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is found in the nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions. The virus has also been detected in the blood plasma of infected patients. The viral spread occurs through droplets exhaled from the nose and mouth of the infected people when they breath or talk, or through droplets propelled as a dense cloud by chough or sneeze. The virus can also be delivered as an aerosol from blood plasma, through surgical procedures. Following these ways, the virus can disperse in the air, then reaching and settling on the exposed surfaces. How long the virus will survive on a surface depends on the material the surface is made from. Infection via high-touch surfaces should be prevented.

Researchers throughout the globe are still struggling to understand this strain's aggressiveness in search of putative therapies for its control. Crosstalk between oxidative stress and systemic inflammation seems to support the progression of the infection. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Gsk-3) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase that mainly participates in cell proliferation, development, stress, and inflammation in humans. Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is an important structural protein responsible for viral replication and interferes with the host defence mechanism by the help of Gsk-3 protein. The virally infected cells show activated Gsk-3 protein that degrades the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) protein, resulting in excessive oxidative stress. Activated Gsk-3 also modulates CREB-DNA activity, phosphorylates NF-​κB, and degrades β-catenin, thus provokes systemic inflammation. Interaction between these two pathophysiological events, oxidative stress, and inflammation enhance mucous secretion, coagulation cascade, and hypoxia, which ultimately leads to multiple organs failure, resulting in the death of the infected patient. The present review aims to highlight the pathogenic role of Gsk-3 in viral replication, initiation of oxidative stress, and inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review also summarizes the potential Gsk-3 pathway modulators as putative therapeutic interventions in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rana, Anil Kumar; Rahmatkar, Shubham Nilkanth; Kumar, Amit; Singh, Damanpreet",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,341,1

Over 40 are now undergoing clinical evaluation, ten of these are in Phase III clinical trials, three of them have ended Phase III with positive results. A few of these new vaccines are being approved for emergency use. Existing data suggest that new vaccine candidates may be instrumental in protecting individuals and reducing the spread of pandemic. The conceptual and technological platforms exploited are diverse, and it is likely that different vaccines will show to be better suited to distinct groups of the human population. Moreover, it remains to be elucidated whether and to what extent the capacity of vaccines under evaluation and of unrelated vaccines such as BCG can increase immunological fitness by training innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and pathogen-agnostic protection. Due to the short development time and the novelty of the technologies adopted, these vaccines will be deployed with several unresolved issues that only the passage of time will permit to clarify. Technical problems connected with the production of billions of doses and ethical ones connected with the availably of these vaccines also in the poorest countries, are imminent challenges facing us. It is our tenet that in the long run more than one vaccine will be needed to ensure equitable global access, protection of diverse subjects and immunity against viral variants.","Forni, Guido; Mantovani, Alberto",Cell Death Differ,341,21

METHODS: We used national population-based datasets of 44,624 households in Vietnam from 2000 to 2014. We applied Bayesian regression models to estimate the trends in and projections of RMNCH indicators and the probabilities of achieving the 2030 targets. Using the relative index, slope index, and concentration index of inequality, we examined the patterns and trends in RMNCH coverage inequality. FINDINGS: We projected that 9 out of 17 health service indicators (53%) would likely achieve the 2030 targets at the national level, including at least one and four ANC visits, BCG immunization, access to improved water and adequate sanitation, institutional delivery, skilled birth attendance, care-seeking for pneumonia, and ARI treatment. We observed very low coverages and zero chance of achieving the 2030 targets at national and sub-national levels in early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, family planning needs satisfied, and oral rehydration therapy. The most deprived households living in rural areas and the Northwest, Northeast, North Central, Central Highlands, and Mekong River Delta regions would not reach the 80% immunization coverage of DPT3, Polio3, Measles and full immunization. We found socioeconomic, regional, and urban-rural inequalities in all RMNCH indicators in 2014 and no change in inequalities over 15 years in the lowest-coverage indicators. INTERPRETATION: Vietnam has made substantial progress toward UHC. By improving the government's health system reform efforts, re-allocating resources focusing on people in the most impoverished rural regions, and restructuring and enhancing current health programs, Vietnam can achieve the UHC targets and other health-related SDGs.

Immune protection will most likely be mediated by antibodies that bind to the viral entry protein, Spike (S). Here we used Phage-DMS, an approach that comprehensively interrogates the effect of all possible mutations on binding to a protein of interest, to define the profile of antibody escape to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein using COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Antibody binding was common in two regions: the fusion peptide and linker region upstream of the heptad repeat region 2. However, escape mutations were variable within these immunodominant regions. There was also individual variation in less commonly targeted epitopes. This study provides a granular view of potential antibody escape pathways and suggests there will be individual variation in antibody-mediated virus evolution.","Garrett, Meghan E.; Galloway, Jared; Chu, Helen Y.; Itell, Hannah L.; Stoddard, Caitlin I.; Wolf, Caitlin R.; Logue, Jennifer K.; McDonald, Dylan; Matsen, Frederick A.; Overbaugh, Julie",bioRxiv,341,16

This begs the question, “What is elective in structural heart disease intervention?” The recently proposed Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions/American College of Cardiology consensus statement is, unfortunately, non-specific and insufficient in its scope and scale of response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose guidelines that are practical, multidisciplinary, implementable, and urgent. We believe that this will provide a helpful framework for our colleagues to manage their practice during the surge and peak phases of the pandemic. General principles that apply across structural heart disease interventions include tracking and reporting cardiovascular outcomes, “healthcare distancing,” preserving vital resources and personnel, shared decision-making between the heart team and hospital administration on resource-intensive cases, and considering delaying research cases. Specific guidance for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and MitraClip procedures varies according to pandemic phase. During the surge phase, treatment should broadly be limited to those at increased risk of complications in the near term. During the peak phase, treatment should be limited to inpatients for whom it may facilitate discharge.

To improve recruitment and retention of this population in studies spanning from the prenatal period to middle childhood, it is imperative to determine ways to improve key research engagement factors. The current manuscript uses a qualitative approach to determine important factors related to recruiting, enrolling, and retaining high-risk pregnant and postpartum women. The current sample included 41 high-risk women who participated in focus groups or individual interviews. All interviews were analyzed to identify broad themes related to engaging high-risk pregnant and parenting women in a 10-year longitudinal research project. Themes were organized into key engagement factors related to the following: (1) recruitment strategies, (2) enrollment, and (3) retention of high-risk pregnant and parenting women in longitudinal research studies. Results indicated recruitment strategies related to ideal recruitment locations, material, and who should share research study information with high-risk participants. Related to enrollment, key areas disclosed focused on enrollment decision-making, factors that create interest in joining a research project, and barriers to joining a longitudinal research study. With regard to retention, themes focused on supports needed to stay in research, barriers to staying in research, and best ways to stay in contact with high-risk participants. Overall, the current qualitative data provide preliminary data that enhance the understanding of a continuum of factors that impact engagement of high-risk pregnant and postpartum women in longitudinal research with current results indicating the need to prioritize recruitment, enrollment, and retention strategies in order to effectively engage vulnerable populations in research.","Beasley, Lana O.; Ciciolla, Lucia; Jespersen, Jens E.; Chiaf, Ashleigh L.; Schmidt, Mallory; Shreffler, Karina M.; Breslin, Florence J.; Bakhireva, Ludmila N.; Sanjuan, Pilar M.; Stephen, Julia M.; Coles, Claire D.; Chambers, Christina D.; Kable, Julie A.; Leeman, Lawrence; Singer, Lynn T.; Zellner, Jennifer; Morris, Amanda S.; Croff, Julie M.",Advers Resil Sci,341,20

This daily “presence” is exhausting humanity in ways akin to times of war or extreme financial strife, and its long-term impact on human mental health is referred to in this paper as CORONEX, or exhaustion caused by the coronavirus, in this case COVID-19. This term is based on broad observations, but not on clinical data. Prolonged fear, insecurities, and radical changes to lifestyles can erode psychological defenses while fortifying mental frailties. Particularly vulnerable to both health and mental health impacts of COVID-19 are older individuals, those with pre-existing conditions, minorities, and healthcare workers. Even with vaccines, COVID-19-induced fatigue (CORONEX) will likely continue in the foreseeable future as humanity learns to coexist with this pandemic.

METHODS: We reviewed relevant literature to identify experts to interview. We carried out a thematic analysis of the literature and interview transcripts. We iteratively developed data coding on the many characteristics of violence against children, on the framing of the issue by proponents, and on the problem of governance – that is, how proponents organize themselves for collective action. FINDINGS: The analysis of our data sources reveals many obstacles for global prioritization of addressing violence against children, including the forms of violence considered, inadequate data to describe prevalence and a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of proposed solutions. There exists fundamental disagreement among proponents on the recently introduced frame of violence against children, including differences in the types of violence that should be prioritized and in the proposed solutions (e.g. prevention or remediation). On governance, competition between networks focused on specific forms of violence is hampering efforts to create strong governing institutions. CONCLUSION: Despite the complex challenges identified, proponents have made some progress in global prioritization of addressing violence against children. To improve this prioritization further, proponents must resolve framing tensions and strengthen governance mechanisms to promote shared goals, while ensuring that networks focused on particular forms of violence are able to maintain their distinct identities.","Shawar, Yusra Ribhi; Shiffman, Jeremy",Bull World Health Organ,341,24

A conserved linear B-cell epitope peptide, YTSNETTDVTS(175–185), was identified in M41 IBV strains while three such epitopes types namely, VSNASPNSGGVD(279–290), HPKCNFRPENI(328–338), and NETNNAGSVSDCTAGT(54–69), were predicted in CR88 IBV strains. Analysis of MHCI binding peptides in M41 IBV strains revealed the presence of 15 antigenic peptides out of which 12 were highly conserved in 96–100% of the total M41 strains analysed. Interestingly three of these peptides, GGPITYKVM(208), WFNSLSVSI(356), and YLADAGLAI(472), relatively had high antigenicity index (>1.0). On the other hand, 11 MHCI binding epitope peptides were identified in CR88 IBV strains. Of these, five peptides were found to be highly conserved with a range between 90% and 97%. However, WFNSLSVSL(358), SYNISAASV(88), and YNISAASVA(89) peptides comparably showed high antigenicity scores (>1.0).

Various antiviral drugs have recently been tested. Type I interferon (IFN) is a regulatory protein involved in the innate immune response, with broad‐spectrum antiviral activities and the ability to directly block viral replication and support the immune response to eliminate virus infection. Insufficient virus‐induced type I IFN production is characteristic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, because SARS‐CoV‐2 suppresses the IFN response by interacting with essential IFN signaling pathways. Exogenous type I IFN is recommended for treating COVID‐19. Unexpectedly however, angiotensin converting enzyme‐2 (ACE2) receptor, which acts as a SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor, was shown to be stimulated by IFN, raising doubts about the suitability of IFN use. However, further studies have excluded concerns regarding IFN administration. Type I IFNs, including IFN‐α1b, have been used clinically as antiviral drugs for many years and have shown strong antiviral activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro. Preliminary clinical studies of type I IFNs, especially when delivered via aerosol inhalation, have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment and prevention of COVID‐19.
