That's one of the findings of State of Student Success and Trends in Higher Education: 2020 Global Research Study and Trends, a report by Canvas that reveals results of a survey of students. The findings also show major disparities in reported engagement among students of different economic classes, with 2.5 times more students from upper economic classes reporting feeling extremely engaged in the classes and coursework than their lower‐income peers, and with four times more students from lower‐economic‐class households saying it was difficult to stay very engaged with remote or online learning.","Hope, Joan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753641/,782
46178,van de verenigingen,2021-03-05,"In this paper, we aim to investigate how researchers in Japan and Sweden perceive and approach the term “sharing economy” in research publications. Systematic literature reviews were used to explore academic discussions in both countries. The main finding of this research is that although researchers in both contexts use similar definitions and concepts, the meanings and connotations of the sharing economy differ among the two contexts. In summary, Japanese researchers tend to focus first and foremost on the economic effects of the sharing economy, as it serves the purpose of economic revitalisation. In contrast, Swedish researchers focus on its environmental effects. The differences reflect country-specific socio-cultural, technological, and economic contexts. Finally, we suggest future directions for research and policy development.","Majima, Takashi; Fors, Per; Inutsuka, Yu; Orito, Yohko",Rev Socionetwork Strat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897734/,782

Since 2008, when the second Berlin patient was cured from HIV after undergoing transplantation from a donor with delta-32 mutation, scientists are aiming for a long-term cure for the wider population. In 2019, a London patient became the second person to be free of HIV and came off the antiretroviral drugs completely. CCR5 gene is now being treated as a viable target for HIV treatment. It can be used in the treatment of HIV either through administration of drugs that bind to CCR5 and stop the receptor from working or through gene therapy to alter the CCR5 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 and prevent protein production. This review article aims to identify the obstacles and the need to overcome them in order to bridge the gap between current research and future potential cures for HIV.","Gupta, Praveen Kumar; Saxena, Apoorva",Proc Natl Acad Sci India Sect B Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8063169/,782

To investigate which nutrients are commonly consumed, an anonymous survey was given to 120 individuals and their responses were collected. The respondents answered questions relating to their health status, and their consumption of nutrients and supplements that produce immunomodulating effects. The participants were also asked about any prior viral, bacterial or fungal infections experienced, and in particular, infection frequency, course, and duration. The data collected were subjected to a statistical analyses to assess the relationship between the reported frequency of infections and nutrients consumed including vitamins D3, A, C, E, selenium, zinc, iron, β-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids as well as live active probiotic bacteria. The findings show that vitamin and mineral supplementation did not positively affect the duration, frequency, or course of infections in the surveyed sample. An exception was vitamin D3 supplementation that was correlated to sporadic incidence of viral infections. Conversely, immunity was positively affected by consumption of natural nutrients contained in whole food (vitamin C, iron, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids), evidenced by lower incidences and milder courses of infection.","Polak, Ewelina; Stępień, Agnieszka Ewa; Gol, Olga; Tabarkiewicz, Jacek",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065427/,782
52012,van de verenigingen,2021-05-07,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and shockwave (SW) therapy have been shown to exert a chondroprotective effect for osteoarthritis (OA). The results of this study demonstrated that autologous ADSCs had dose-dependent and synergistic effects with SW therapy (0.25 mJ/mm(2) with 800 impulses) in OA rat knee joint. Autologous, high-dose 2 × 10(6) ADSCs (ADSC2 group) combined with SW therapy significantly increased the bone volume, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number among in the treatment groups. ADSC2 combined with SW therapy significantly reduced the synovitis score and OARSI score in comparison with other treatments. In the analysis of inflammation-induced extracellular matrix factors of the articular cartilage in OA, the results displayed that ADSC2 combined with SW therapy had a greater than other treatments in terms of reducing tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene (TSG)-6 and proteoglycan (PRG)-4, in addition to increasing tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and type II collagen. Furthermore, ADSC2 combined with SW therapy significantly reduced the expression of inflammation-induced bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and BMP-6. Therefore, the results demonstrated that ADSC2 combined with SW therapy had a synergistic effect to ameliorate osteoarthritic pathological factors in OA joints.","Cheng, Jai-Hong; Yen, Ke-Tien; Chou, Wen-Yi; Jhan, Shun-Wun; Hsu, Shan-Ling; Ko, Jih-Yang; Wang, Ching-Jen; Kuo, Chun-En Aurea; Wu, Szu-Ying; Hsu, Tsai-Chin; Hsu, Chieh-Cheng",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065528/,782

64058,COVID-19 with silent hypoxemia.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Colorectal cancer (CRC), which is related with insulin resistance, is a one of the most common cancers. Triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) was made for a marker of insulin resistance. We conducted the investigation of association between TyG index and incident CRC. METHODS We examined the affect of TyG index on incident CRC in this historical cohort study of 27,944 (16,454 men and 11,490 women) participants. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting plasma glucose (mg/dL)/2]. The impact of TyG index on incident CRC was investigated using Cox proportional hazard models, adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, exercise, systolic blood pressure and creatinine. The covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve calculated the area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off value of TyG index for the incidence of CRC. RESULTS During the median 4.4-year follow-up, 116 participants were diagnosed as CRC. The cumulative incidence rate of CRC were 0.4%. In Cox proportional hazard model, the HRs of TyG index were 1.38 (95% Confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.91, p = 0.049) after adjusting for covariates. In the covariate-adjusted ROC curve analysis, the cut-off value of TyG index for incident CRC was 8.272 (AUC 0.687 (95%CI, 0.637-737, sensitivity = 0.620, specificity = 0.668, p < 0.001)). CONCLUSIONS TyG index can predict the onset of CRC. For early detection of CRC, we should encourage people with high TyG index to undergo screening for CRC.","Okamura, Takuro; Hashimoto, Yoshitaka; Hamaguchi, Masahide; Obora, Akihiro; Kojima, Takao; Fukui, Michiaki",BMC endocrine disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12902-020-00581-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709256/,782
66007,Compliance with infection control rules among adolescents in Oslo during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-06-30,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Fractures of the proximal humerus (PHF) and distal radius (DRF) are among the most common upper extremity fractures in the elderly. Recent randomized controlled trials support non-surgical treatment. Evidence behind the best non-surgical treatment strategy has been sparse and raises questions as to when and how to initiate exercises. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the benefits and harms of early mobilization versus late mobilization and supervised versus non-supervised exercises therapy after PHF and DRF. RECENT FINDINGS 15 published and 5 unpublished trials were included. Early mobilization after PHF resulted in better function with a mean difference (MD) of 4.55 (95% CI 0.00-9.10) on the Constant Shoulder Score. However, the MD was not found to be clinically relevant. No clear evidence showed that early mobilization after PHF had a positive effect on range of motion or pain. Neither did it lead to more complications. Furthermore, no eligible evidence was found supporting early mobilization to be superior to late mobilization after DRF, or that supervised exercise therapy was superior to non-supervised exercise therapy after PHF and DRF. The quality of evidence on all outcomes was found to be low or very low. Early mobilization after PHF may have a beneficial effect on function. Due to the lack of clear evidence, there is an urgent need for future studies to determine the effect of early mobilization and supervised exercise therapy after PHF and DRF.

68699,Pulmonary embolism in cases of COVID-19.,2020-05-26,"INTRODUCTION We systematically collated and reviewed reported adverse events (AEs) for ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis (MS). Areas covered: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Toxicology Data Network-TOXLINE from inception to 08-July-2020, and clinical trial registries, and product monographs for any clinical trials, observational studies or case reports examining AEs to ocrelizumab in person(s) with MS. Studies with/without a comparator drug or placebo were eligible. Expert opinion: Overall, 78 records were included (4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 open-label trials, 29 observational studies and 27 case reports). AEs affected 2756/4498 (61.3%) of ocrelizumab-exposed patients. The most common AEs were infections (n=1342, 39.2% of ocrelizumab-exposed patients) and infusion-related reactions (n=1391, 26.2%). Compared to beta-interferon, ocrelizumab-exposed patients were more likely to experience an infection (Risk Ratio (RR)=1.10; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.01-1.19), including: herpes virus-related (RR=1.75;95%CI:1.11-2.76), upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RR=1.42;95%CI:1.10-1.84 and RR=1.61;95%CI:1.10-2.35), nasopharyngitis (RR=1.47;95%CI:1.13-1.90) and rhinitis (RR=4.00;95%CI:1.13-14.14). Infusion-related reactions (RR range: 1.57 to 4.42) were also more common for ocrelizumab versus either placebo or beta-interferon. From pooled analyses of 3 RCTs, the risk of 'any' serious AE did not differ significantly between the ocrelizumab and comparator groups. However, insufficient data were available to assess longer-term AEs, such as malignancy.","Ng, Huah Shin; Rosenbult, Constanza Luzon; Tremlett, Helen",Expert opinion on drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2020.1807002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799563/,782
69930,Distance and proximity in clinical work.,2021-05-25,"BACKGROUND Life expectancy for persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who receive recommended treatment can approach that of the general population, yet HIV remains among the 10 leading causes of death among certain populations. Using surveillance data, CDC assessed progress toward reducing deaths among persons with diagnosed HIV (PWDH). METHODS CDC analyzed National HIV Surveillance System data for persons aged ≥13 years to determine age-adjusted death rates per 1,000 PWDH during 2010-2018. Using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, deaths with a nonmissing underlying cause were classified as HIV-related or non-HIV-related. Temporal changes in total deaths during 2010-2018 and deaths by cause during 2010-2017 (2018 excluded because of delays in reporting), by demographic characteristics, transmission category, and U.S. Census region of residence at time of death were calculated. RESULTS During 2010-2018, rates of death decreased by 36.6% overall (from 19.4 to 12.3 per 1,000 PWDH). During 2010-2017, HIV-related death rates decreased 48.4% (from 9.1 to 4.7), whereas non-HIV-related death rates decreased 8.6% (from 9.3 to 8.5). Rates of HIV-related deaths during 2017 were highest by race/ethnicity among persons of multiple races (7.0) and Black/African American persons (5.6), followed by White persons (3.9) and Hispanic/Latino persons (3.9). The HIV-related death rate was highest in the South (6.0) and lowest in the Northeast (3.2). CONCLUSION Early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and maintaining access to high-quality care and treatment have been successful in reducing HIV-related deaths and remain necessary for continuing reductions in HIV-related deaths.","Bosh, Karin A; Johnson, Anna Satcher; Hernandez, Angela L; Prejean, Joseph; Taylor, Jocelyn; Wingard, Rachel; Valleroy, Linda A; Hall, H Irene",MMWR.

METHODS Using the PRISMA guidelines, five electronic databases were searched using key terms and subject headings, as well as reference lists of relevant papers. The search was limited to literature published in English. Eligible studies examined the prevalence of anxiety disorders or symptoms in aged care residents aged 50+ years. RESULTS A total of 2249 articles were identified, of which 18 studies (with a total of 5927 participants) were included in this review. The rate of overall anxiety disorders ranged from 3.2% to 20%, with the highest quality studies estimating a prevalence rate of 5% to 5.7%. Generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobias were found to be the most common anxiety disorders among aged care residents, while clinically significant anxiety symptoms were found to be more frequent (6.5% to 58.4%) than threshold disorders. CONCLUSIONS Anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms are common in older aged care residents. Given the paucity and overall quality of research examining anxiety within this population and the heterogeneity found in studies, further research is needed to help clarify this issue.","Creighton, Alexandra S; Davison, Tanya E; Kissane, David W",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.4378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552603/,782
72405,Covid-19: Simulation models for epidemics.,2020-04-21,"OBJECTIVES To determine the procedural safety, safety, and efficacy of left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion in octogenarians. BACKGROUND Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) often do not receive appropriate anticoagulation. LAA occlusion is an option for patients with AF and contraindications to anticoagulation. Not much is known about the procedural safety and clinical efficacy of LAA occlusion in the very elderly. METHODS A retrospective review of LAA cases at our institution between 2002 and 2013 in patients 80 years of age or older was performed. Demographic, echocardiographic, procedural, and clinical follow-up data were collected. RESULTS Seventy-five cases were attempted in patients 80 years of age or older (average age 83.4 ± 2.8 years, 53.3% males). Hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure were present in 96, 41.3, and 36%, respectively. Mean CHADS2 and CHA2DS-VASc scores were 3.3 and 5.2. Devices used included the WATCHMAN, ACP, PLAATO, Lariat, and Coherex devices, which were attempted in 34.7, 36, 17.3, 5.3, and 5.3%, respectively. Overall procedural success, safety endpoint, and 1-year device efficacy was 90.1, 3.9, and 97.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION LAA closure is a safe and efficacious method of stroke prevention in the very elderly with AF.","Gafoor, Sameer; Franke, Jennifer; Bertog, Stefan; Boehm, Patrick; Heuer, Luisa; Gonzaga, Maik; Bauer, Janine; Braut, Annkathrin; Lam, Simon; Vaskelyte, Laura; Hofmann, Ilona; Sievert, Horst",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.25297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24259397/,782
73233,Systematic assessment of frailty.,2021-03-09,"PURPOSE To determine the occurrence of physiological significant coronary artery disease (CAD) by coronary CT angiography (CTA) derived fractional flow reserve (FFRCT) in asymptomatic patients with a new diagnosis (<1 year) of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS FFRCT-analysis was performed from standard acquired coronary CTA data sets. The per-patient minimum distal FFRCT-value (d-FFRCT) in coronary vessels (diameter ⩾1.8 mm) was registered. The threshold for categorizing FFRCT-analysis as abnormal was a d-FFRCT ⩽0.75. Total plaque volume and volumes of calcified plaque, non-calcified plaque, and low-density non-calcified plaque (LD-NCP) were assessed by quantitative plaque analysis. RESULTS Overall, 76 patients; age, mean (SD): 56 (11) years; males, n (%): 49(65), were studied. A total of 57% of patients had plaques. The d-FFRCT was ⩽0.75 in 12 (16%) patients. The d-FFRCT, median (IQR), was 0.84 (0.79-0.87). Median (range) d-FFRCT in patients with d-FFRCT ⩽0.75 was 0.70 (0.6-0.74). Patients with d-FFRCT⩽0.75 versus d-FFRCT >0.75 had numerically higher plaque volumes for all plaques components, although only significant for the LD-NCP component. CONCLUSION Every sixth asymptomatic patient with a new diagnosis of T2DM has hemodynamic significant CAD as evaluated by FFRCT. Flow impairment by FFRCT was associated with coronary plaque characteristics.","Mrgan, Monija; Nørgaard, Bjarne Linde; Dey, Damini; Gram, Jørgen; Olsen, Michael Hecht; Gram, Jeppe; Sand, Niels Peter Rønnow",Diabetes & vascular disease research,https://doi.org/10.1177/1479164120958422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985257/,782

This review provides a comprehensive overview of ocular parameters in humans and selected animals, with a focus on the ocular surface, detailing species differences in ocular surface anatomy, physiology, tear film dynamics and tear film composition. We describe major pitfalls that tremendously limit the translational potential of traditional laboratory animals (i.e., rabbits, mice, and rats) in ophthalmic research, and highlight the benefits of integrating companion dogs with clinical analogues to human diseases into preclinical pharmacology studies. This One Health approach can help accelerate and improve the framework in which ophthalmic research is translated to the human clinic. Studies can be conducted in canine subjects with naturally occurring or noninvasively induced ocular surface disorders (e.g., dry eye disease, conjunctivitis), reviewed herein, and tear fluid can be easily retrieved from canine eyes for various bioanalytical purposes.

METHODS AND MATERIALS In vitro studies included in this study were identified from PubMed/MEDLINE, Lilacs, and Scopus databases up until March 2019, without limits on publication year or language. Two reviewers independently selected the studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias of all studies. A random effects model was used for pairwise meta-analyses (control vs. post-space preparation groups) at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS Of the 2,832 potentially eligible studies, 453 studies were selected for full-text analysis, and 75 were included in this systematic review. Only one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, post-space treatment significantly improves the bond strength to root canal dentin (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION Post-space treatment has a positive influence on the bond strength of the post to root canal dentin. In this review, the post-space treatments that improve the adhesive resistance of the post were ethanol, sodium hypochlorite, and ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (NaOCl + EDTA), NaOCl + EDTA + ultrasound, erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser (Er:YAG laser), neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser (Nd:YAG laser), and diode laser.","Bohrer, T C; Fontana, P E; Rocha, R O; Kaizer, O B",Operative dentistry,https://doi.org/10.2341/19-277-lit; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370019/,782
80357,Acute respiratory distress syndrome in a patient with COVID-19 and negative nasopharyngeal swabs.,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality of esophageal cancer surgery. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a high incidence of earlier lymphatic spread and is usually located more proximal to the incisor than esophageal adenocarcinoma; consequently, the anastomosis should be made more proximal in the thorax or in the neck. We adopted the proximal intrathoracic anastomotic technique using thoracoscopy for mid-to-lower ESCC. METHODS From October 2010 to August 2014, fifty-eight consecutive patients underwent MIE for ESCC. After laparoscopic gastric tubing, thoracoscopic esophageal resection and reconstruction were performed using a 28-mm circular stapler following radical mediastinal lymph node dissection. We tried to make an anastomosis at the apex of the chest. Postoperative outcomes, including overall survival and recurrence, were assessed. RESULTS The mean patient age was 64.3±9 years. The mean operative time was 371.8±51.6 minutes, and the duration of the thorax procedure was 254.8±38.3 minutes. The mean number of lymph nodes dissected was 31±11.7. The mean intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospital stay were 3.5±8.2 hours and 13.6±7.4 days, respectively. The level of anastomosis was 22.3±1.8cm from the incisor. One patient died of uncontrolled sepsis due to necrosis of the gastric graft. Two patients developed small contained leakage. Nine patients exhibited distant metastasis during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic intrathoracic anastomosis at the proximal esophagus is feasible and safe.","Jeon, Hyun Woo; Park, Jae Kil; Song, Kyo Young; Sung, Sook Whan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27011160/,782
81559,India's pandemics.,2021-05-25,"A three-year-old ferret presented with a three-month history of rapid clinical deterioration necessitating euthanasia shortly after initial veterinary assessment. Postmortem PCR testing confirmed Mycobacterium xenopi which is most commonly identified in amphibians, reptiles and aquatic life. Infection of a captive-bred domestic ferret is highly unusual. A collaborative effort involving medical doctors, clinical veterinarians and veterinary pathologists investigated the potential sources of human-animal, animal-animal and environmental-animal M xenopi transmission. No human-animal or animal-animal risks were identified. As the affected ferret was the only ferret to have regular exposure to the owner's aquarium, a postmortem study of a dead guppy and aquarium water analysis were performed which confirmed mycobacteriosis. Although M xenopi was not specifically cultured, as a slow-growing organism, M xenopi may have been outgrown by more rapidly growing mycobacteria or Gram-positive bacilli present in the water. Thus, transmission of M xenopi via aquarium exposure was certainly plausible. This is the second documented case of M xenopi in a ferret and the first to determine a source of infection. This report highlights the previously recognised risk of mycobacterial exposure from aquaria and that caution is required before allowing domestic ferrets to have contact with potentially infected water reservoirs due to its fatal nature in this vulnerable species.","Davendralingam, Natasha; Davagnanam, Indran; Stidworthy, Mark Frederick; Baldrey, Vicki; Peters, Laureen Michele; Stapleton, Nadene",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.104250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28774941/,782

91154,Prolonged illness after COVID-19.,2020-10-13,"Importance Three-dimensionally printed nasopharyngeal swabs (3DP swabs) have been used to mitigate swab shortages during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinical validation for diagnostic accuracy and consistency, as well as patient acceptability, is crucial to evaluate the swab's performance. Objective To determine the accuracy and acceptability of the 3DP swab for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Design, Setting, and Participants A diagnostic study was conducted from May to July 2020 at 2 tertiary care centers in Singapore with different reference swabs (FLOQSwab [COPAN Diagnostics] or Dacron swab [Deltalab]) and swab processing techniques (wet or dry) to evaluate the performance of the 3DP swab compared with traditional, standard-of-care nasopharyngeal swabs used in health care institutions. The participants were patients with COVID-19 in the first 2 weeks of illness and controls with acute respiratory illness with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the same nostril and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of swabs was randomized based on odd and even participant numbers. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome measures were overall agreement (OA), positive percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement of the 3DP swab compared with reference swabs. Secondary outcome measures were the correlation of cycle threshold (Ct) values of both swabs. Results The mean (SD) age of participants was 45.4 (13.1) years, and most participants were men (87 of 89 [97.8%]), in keeping with the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. A total of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls were recruited. Among the patients with COVID-19, the overall agreement and PPA of the 3DP swab was 91.1% and 93.5%, respectively, compared with reference swabs. The PPA was 100% for patients with COVID-19 who were tested within the first week of illness. All controls tested negative. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction Ct values for the ORF1ab and E-gene targets showed a strong correlation (intraclass correlations coefficient, 0.869-0.920) between the 3DP and reference swab on independent testing at each institution despite differences in sample processing. Discordant results for both gene targets were observed only at high Ct values. Conclusions and Relevance In this diagnostic study of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls, the 3DP swab performed accurately and consistently across health care institutions and could help mitigate strained resources in the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.","Tay, Joshua K; Cross, Gail B; Toh, Song Tar; Lee, Chun Kiat; Loh, Jerold; Lim, Zhen Yu; Ngiam, Nicholas; Chee, Jeremy; Gan, Soo Wah; Saraf, Anmol; Chow, Wai Tung Eason; Goh, Han Lee; Siow, Chor Hiang; Lian, Derrick W Q; Loh, Woei Shyang; Loh, Kwok Seng; Lim, Chwee Ming; Chua, Ying Ying; Tan, Thuan Tong; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Yan, Benedict; Ko, Karrie; Chan, Kian Sing; Oon, Lynette; Chow, Vincent T K; Wang, De Yun; Fuh, Jerry Y H; Yen, Ching-Chiuan; Wong, John E L; Allen, David M",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.5680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33599684/,782

96127,COVID-19 in an elderly woman with acute functional decline.,2020-05-05,"Background Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a promising therapy for many neurologic and psychiatric conditions. However, determining stimulus parameters for individual patients is a major challenge. The traditional method of titrating stimulus intensity based on patient perception produces highly variable responses. This study explores using the vagal response to measure stimulation dose and predict physiological effect. Clinicians are investigating the use of VNS for heart failure management, and this work aims to correlate cardiac measures with vagal fiber activity. Results By recording vagal activity during VNS in rats and using regression analysis, we found that cardiac activity across all animals was best correlated to the activation of a specific vagal fiber group. With conduction velocities ranging from 5 to 10 m/s, these fibers are classified as B fibers (using the Erlanger-Gasser system) and correspond to vagal parasympathetic efferents. Conclusions B fiber activation can serve as a standardized, objective measure of stimulus dose across all subjects. Tracking fiber activation provides a more systematic way to study the effects of VNS and in the future, may lead to a more consistent method of therapy delivery.","Qing, Kurt Y; Wasilczuk, Kelsey M; Ward, Matthew P; Phillips, Evan H; Vlachos, Pavlos P; Goergen, Craig J; Irazoqui, Pedro P",Bioelectronic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42234-018-0005-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232081/,782
98998,Nursing home deaths after COVID-19 vaccination.,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND Aging is a natural life process and with an aging population, age-related diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), atherosclerosis-based cardiovascular diseases) are the primary mortality cause in older adults. Telomerase is often used as an aging biomarker. Detection and characterization of novel biomarkers can help in a more specific and sensitive identification of a person's aging status. Also, this could help in age-related diseases early prevent, ultimately prolonging the population's life span. Sirtuin 6 (Sirt6) - a member of the Sirtuins NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases family - is mainly intracellularly expressed, and is reported to be involved in the regulation of aging and aging-related diseases. Whether serum Sirt6 is correlated with aging and could be used as an aging biomarker is unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the age-related Sirt6 changes in the serum of human adults. METHODS Participants were divided into three groups according to age: 20-30 years (Young); 45-55 years (Middle-aged); and ≥ 70 years (Old). The Sirt6 and telomerase serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The Sirt6 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression in vessels from amputated human lower limbs were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining. The relationships between variables were evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS The Sirt6 and telomerase serum levels reduced with an increase in age. A similar tendency was observed for Sirt6 and hTERT in the vessel. Serum levels of Sirt6 were higher in females compared with males. Pearson's regression analysis revealed that the Sirt6 serum level positively correlated with telomerase (r = 0.5743) and both were significantly negatively correlated with age (r = - 0.5830 and r = - 0.5993, respectively). CONCLUSIONS We reported a negative correlation between serum Sirt6 concentration and aging in human beings. Therefore, the Sirt6 serum level is a potential sex-specific aging marker.","Zhao, Ying; Bai, Xiangli; Jia, Xiong; Lu, Yajing; Cheng, Wenzhuo; Shu, Meng; Zhu, Yan; Zhu, Lin; Wang, Li; Shu, Yan; Song, Yi; Jin, Si",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02399-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348649/,782
99539,Patient visits to a psychiatric casualty clinic during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-08-18,"INTRODUCTION Communicating bronchopulmonary foregut malformation (CBPFM) is a rare congenital anomaly comprising a spectrum of airway anomalies connected to the oesophagus or stomach. Our management of a case of CBPFM is presented to improve knowledge of its treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 17-month-old Japanese girl presented with fever (39.1 °C) and persistent cough. She was noted to be poorly developed (7.5 kg: -2SD). Chest X-ray radiography was suggestive of pneumonia involving the left lung; WBC was 41600/μL and CRP was 12.9 mg/dL. Computed tomography, upper gastrointestinal series, and bronchoscopy identified a fistula between the oesophagus and the left lung and severe left pulmonary artery hypoplasia, typical of type II CBPFM. Her left thoracic cavity was small with sclerotic lung tissue. We customised management by commencing a trial of intensive duodenal tube feeding without oral ingestion. She gained weight and her pneumonia improved enough to enable thoracoscopic left pneumonectomy through an unconventional dorsal approach, necessary because of the location of her CBPFM. Surgery was successful and tolerated well with unremarkable postoperative recovery. Currently she is asymptomatic and growing well. DISCUSSION We used minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to resect an anomalous bronchus and perform a left pneumonectomy after two weeks of intensive conservative management, including nil-by-mouth to optimise her condition for surgery. CONCLUSION Our case provides further evidence that CBPFM can be treated successfully by MIS (interval thoracoscopic pneumonectomy), especially after a period of intensive conservative management. Interval surgery should be considered actively prior to major surgery in smaller children if indicated.","Miyano, Go; Watanabe, Yukio; Hayashi, Takuo; Lane, Geoffrey J; Suzuki, Kenji; Yamataka, Atsuyuki",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.10.132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189002/,782

In this study, we provide a cross-sectional analysis of the dynamics of B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We observe changes in B cell subsets consistent with a robust humoral immune response, including significant expansion of plasmablasts and activated receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cell populations. We observe elevated titers of Abs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, full-length Spike, and nucleoprotein over the course of infection, with higher levels of RBD-specific IgG correlating with increased serum neutralization. Depletion of RBD-specific Abs from serum removed a major portion of neutralizing activity in most individuals.

METHODS Left lung allotransplantation was performed from a male Brown Norway donor to a male Fisher F344 recipient in the case of an acute rejection model (the animals were sacrificed 5 days after transplantation) as well as a male Brown Norway donor to a male Wistar recipient in the case of hyperacute rejection (the animals were sacrificed 2 days after transplantation). Control rats were sham-operated and sacrificed on day 2 or 5, respectively, of the experimental model. Rejection was confirmed by blood gas assessment and lung histological examination. A single intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin 30 mg kg(-1) body weight was administered on the day of autopsy (day 2 or 5 from transplantation, respectively, of the experimental model), and then the blood and lung specimens were sampled at 0, 5, 1, 2, 4 and 6h from the time of drug injection. RESULTS Arterial blood gas assessment (Wistar rats - pO(2): 44.33 ± 21.73 mmHg (mean ± standard deviation (SD)); Fisher rats - pO(2:) 50.67 ± 14.30 mmHg (mean ± SD)) as well as histopathologic examinations of lung grafts confirmed rejection. Vancomycin lung/plasma concentration ratio was significantly higher in transplanted rats than in sham-operated animals. CONCLUSIONS Both acute and hyperacute lung rejection affect the lung/serum of vancomycin in the transplanted lung resulting in higher drug accumulation, especially in late post-dosage time.","Pieróg, Jarosław; Kubisa, Bartosz; Droździk, Marek; Wójcik, Janusz; Bielewicz, Michał; Pankowski, Juliusz; Safranow, Krzysztof; Grodzki, Tomasz",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcts.2010.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226683/,782
108391,Can a COVID-19-related curfew be justified on medical grounds?,2021-03-23,"BACKGROUND The Canadian government legalized non-medical cannabis use by adults in October 2018 to minimize associated harms and redirect profits from criminals. In October 2019, a wider array of products, including edibles, was legalized, with entry into the legal market beginning in December. DATA AND METHODS Three quarters (the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2020) of the National Cannabis Survey were used to examine changes in cannabis use (overall use and daily or almost daily (DAD) use), consumption methods, products and sources. RESULTS Cannabis use in the past three months was higher in late 2020 (20.0%) than in 2019 (17.5%) and 2018 (14.0%), and this was particularly the case among: females (for whom rates rose to equal male rates for the first time), adults aged 25 and older, and some provinces. Similarly, DAD use, at 7.9% also increased. Higher percentages of Canadians reported getting at least some of their cannabis from legal sources or growing it, and fewer were relying on friends and family or illegal sources in 2020. DISCUSSION This study spans three years-from before legalization to about two years after. It provides a more complete picture of the law's impact on cannabis use and related behaviours, given the more established legal cannabis industry better equipped to compete with the black market on price, convenience and selection. Findings demonstrate that change is continuing, and, as before, some cautions and assurances remain. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cannabis use continues to be difficult to measure. Monitoring remains important, given the ever-changing provincial retail landscapes; the introduction of new products; and the pressure by the industry to remove or adjust potency limits, and allow widespread delivery, farm-gate sales and cannabis lounges.","Rotermann, Michelle",Health reports,https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202100400001-eng; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33881274/,782
108623,Diagnostic imaging of COVID-19 patients.,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND Interventions that enable people to remain in their own home as they age are of interest to stakeholders, yet detailed information on effective interventions is scarce. Our objective was to systematically search and synthesise evidence for the effectiveness of community-based, aged care interventions in delaying or avoiding admission to residential aged care. METHOD Nine databases were searched from January 2000 to February 2018 for English publications. Reference lists of relevant publications were searched. The databases yielded 55,221 citations and 50 citations were gleaned from other sources. Where there was sufficient homogeneity of study design, population, intervention and measures, meta-analyses were performed. Studies were grouped by the type of intervention: complex multifactorial interventions, minimal/single focus interventions, restorative programs, or by the target population (e.g. participants with dementia). RESULTS Data from 31 randomised controlled trials (32 articles) that met our inclusion criteria were extracted and analysed. Compared to controls, complex multifactorial interventions in community aged care significantly improved older adults' ability to remain living at home (risk difference - 0.02; 95% CI -0.03, - 0.00; p = 0.04). Commonalities in the 13 studies with complex interventions were the use of comprehensive assessment, regular reviews, case management, care planning, referrals to additional services, individualised interventions, frequent client contact if required, and liaison with General Practitioners. Complex interventions did not have a significantly different effect on mortality. Single focus interventions did not show a significant effect in reducing residential aged care admissions (risk difference 0, 95% CI -0.01, 0.01; p = 0.71), nor for mortality or quality of life. Subgroup analysis of complex interventions for people with dementia showed significant risk reduction for residential aged care admissions (RD -0.05; 95% CI -0.09, -0.01; p = 0.02). Compared to controls, only interventions targeting participants with dementia had a significant effect on improving quality of life (SMD 3.38, 95% CI 3.02, 3.74; p < 0.000001). CONCLUSIONS Where the goal is to avoid residential aged care admission for people with or without dementia, there is evidence for multifactorial, individualised community programs. The evidence suggests these interventions do not result in greater mortality and hence are safe. Minimal, single focus interventions will not achieve the targeted outcomes.

109837,Deep vein thrombosis more than two weeks after vaccination against COVID-19.,2021-04-29,"The functions of the alphavirus-encoded nonstructural protein nsP3 during infection are poorly understood. In contrast, nsP1, nsP2, and nsP4 have known enzymatic activities and functions. A functional analysis of the C-terminal region of nsP3 of Semliki Forest virus revealed the presence of a degradation signal that overlaps with a sequence element located between nsP3 and nsP4 that is required for proteolytic processing. This element was responsible for the short half-life (1 h) of individually expressed nsP3, and it also was functionally transferable to other proteins. Inducible cell lines were used to express native nsP3 or truncated mutants. The removal of 10 C-terminal amino acid (aa) residues from nsP3 increased the half-life of the protein approximately 8-fold. While the deletion of 30 C-terminal aa residues resulted in a similar stabilization, this deletion also changed the cellular localization of nsP3. This truncated mutant no longer exhibited a punctate localization in the cytoplasm, but instead filamentous stretches could be formed around the nuclei of induced cells, suggesting the existence of an additional functional element upstream of the degradation signal. C-terminally truncated uncleavable polyprotein P12(CA)3del30 was localized diffusely, which is in contrast to P12(CA)3, which is known to be associated with vesicle membranes. The induction of nsP3 or its truncated forms reduced the efficiency of virus multiplication in corresponding cells by affecting different steps of the infection cycle. The expression of nsP3 or a mutant lacking the 10 C-terminal aa residues repressed the establishment of infection, while the expression of nsP3 lacking 30 C-terminal aa residues led to the reduced synthesis of subgenomic RNA.","Varjak, Margus; Zusinaite, Eva; Merits, Andres",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01540-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015978/,782

114484,Hand sanitiser is flammable.,2021-06-08,"Anaphylaxis is a severe multisystem reaction that occurs rapidly after the introduction of an antigen that would otherwise be a harmless substance. It is characterized by airway and respiratory problems, cardiovascular collapse, mucosal inflammation, and other complications, all severe symptoms that can cause death. IgE-dependent anaphylaxis involves mast cells (MCs) which are the main sources of biologically active mediators that contribute to the pathological and lethal phenomena that can occur in anaphylaxis. Antibody-mediated anaphylaxis can follow multiple pathways such as that mediated by MCs carrying the FcεRI receptor, which can be activated by very small amounts of antigen including a vaccine antigen and trigger an anaphylactic reaction. In addition, anaphylaxis can also be provoked by high concentrations of IgG antibodies that bind to the FcγR receptor present on basophils, neutrophils, macrophages and MCs. For this reason, the IgG concentration should be kept under control in vaccinations. Activation of MCs is a major cause of anaphylaxis, which requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. MCs are activated through the antigen binding and cross-linking of IgE with release of mediators such as histamine, proteases, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and inflammatory cytokines. The release of these compounds causes nausea, vomiting, hives, wheezing, flushing, tachycardia, hypotension, laryngeal edema, and cardiovascular collapse. mRNA and viral vector vaccines have been cleared by the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generating hope of prevention and cure for COVID-19 around the world. Scientists advise against giving the vaccine to individuals who have had a previous history of anaphylaxis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people with a previous history of any immediate allergic reaction to remain under observation for approximately 30 minutes after COVID-19 vaccination. To date, vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection have not raised major concerns of severe allergic reactions, although, in some cases, pain and redness at the injection site and fever have occurred after administration of the vaccine. These reactions occur in the first 24-48 hours after vaccination. It has been reported that probable forms of anaphylaxis could also occur, especially in women approximately 40 years of age. But after tens of millions of vaccinations, only a few patients had this severe reaction with a low incidence. Anaphylactic and severe allergic reactions can also occur to any component of the vaccine including polysorbates and polyethylene glycol. To date, there is no precise information on allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Individuals with MCs and complement with higher activation than others may be at greater allergic risk. Moreover, the reactions called anaphylactoids, are those not mediated by IgE because they do not involve this antibody and can also occur in COVID-19 vaccination. These not-IgE-mediated reactions occur through direct activation of MCs and complement with tryptase production, but to a lesser extent than IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. However, at the moment it is not known exactly which component of the vaccine causes the allergic reaction and which vaccine causes the most side effects, including anaphylaxis. Thus, individuals who have a known allergy to any component of the vaccine should not be vaccinated. However, should an anaphylactic reaction occur, this requires immediate treatment with epinephrine to arrest severe lethal symptoms. In conclusion, the purpose of this editorial is to encourage the population to be vaccinated in order to extinguish this global pandemic that is afflicting the world population, and to reassure individuals that anaphylactic reactions do not occur with a higher incidence than other vaccinations.","Bellomo, R G; Gallenga, C E; Caraffa, Al; Tetè, G; Ronconi, G; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/bellomo_edit_3_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105336/,782

It has many symptoms, such as: fever, sore throat, headache, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. Arbidol was used in the treatment of COVID19, which was the most critical health problem in the world. However, the desired recovery was not achieved with Arbidol. Many countries still use this drug in the treatment of COVID19. AIM We aimed to determine whether Arbidol, the hemagglutinin esterase inhibitor used in the treatment of COVID-19, was effective against SARS Cov-2 in silico. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The similarity between hemagglutinin and spike proteins were reported due to the fact that inhibition properties of Arbidol and its 39 analogues were examined in detail against hemagglutinin esterase and spike glycoproteins. CID 1070884 and CID 1207786 were found to be more active against hemagglutinin esterase than in Arbidol, while these compounds were inactive against spike glycoproteins. The interaction mechanism was clarified between arbidol and spike proteins. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine, lysine, and aspartic acid were found to be the headliner amino acids in the interactions between Arbidol and binding domains of spike glycoproteins in the SARS-CoV2 (Tab. 3, Fig. 8, Ref. 28).","Aktas, A; Tuzun, B; Taskin, A H; Sayin, K; Ataseven, H",Bratislavske lekarske listy,https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2020_115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32955901/,782

We argue that, in addition to the presence of an RNA exonuclease (ExoN), two markers for the large size of viral RNA genomes are (i) the presence of one or more RNA methyltransferases (MTases) and (ii) a specific architecture of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase active site. We propose that RNA genome expansion and maintenance are driven by an evolutionary ménage-à-trois made of fast and processive RNA polymerases, RNA repair ExoNs, and RNA MTases that relates to the transition between RNA- to DNA-based life.","Ferron, François; Sama, Bhawna; Decroly, Etienne; Canard, Bruno",Trends in biochemical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tibs.2021.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172362/,782

With limited existing research, the aim of this study was to explore the psychological effects of COVID-19 public health measures on older adults in Uganda and their coping mechanisms.Methods: Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with older Ugandans (aged 60+) in June 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of public health measures, and their effects on the lives of older adults compared to pre-pandemic.Results: Three themes were identified: Impact on emotional well-being; Implications on physical well-being; and Coping mechanisms. Older adults experienced both psychological and physical effects, including upset, fear, and frustration about restrictions and the virus, as well as early signs of increased frailty, thus causing concerns for the long-term emotional and physical health of older Ugandans.Conclusions: Public health measures need to be considerate of the potential long-term implications on the well-being of older adults in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, and ensure the possibility for continued physical exercise and social connection. This can be particularly challenging for people from more disadvantaged backgrounds who may not be able to afford a smartphone or laptop, with older adults further requiring support in using digital technologies.Clinical Implications: Older adults need to receive adequate psychological support to cope with the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Giebel, Clarissa; Ivan, Bwire; Ddumba, Isaac",Clinical gerontologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1910394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843497/,782

RESULTS We report 3,122 disclosures by 480 individuals. ""Colorectal surgeon"" was the most common profession among disclosers. The most common type of disclosure was ""consulting."" The company with the highest number of disclosures was Covidien. Disclosers used 195 different terms to describe their relationships.

133712,Publishing during a pandemic.,2020-03-31,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES With the emergence of COVID-19, telemedicine use has increased dramatically as clinicians and patients have looked for alternatives to face-to-face care. Prior research has shown high levels of patient satisfaction and comparable quality of care. Video visits have been hypothesized to be one way to reduce burnout among clinicians, but there has been minimal research on physician views of virtual care. We sought to measure family physician experience with video visits at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We identified all faculty and resident physicians at a large academic department of family medicine who had conducted a video visit in the prior month and conducted an anonymous online 12-question survey about their experiences, satisfaction, and barriers with care. RESULTS Most eligible physicians responded (102/109, 94%), of whom half (52%) reported this was their first month trying a video visit. There was very high satisfaction (91% very or somewhat satisfied). The majority of respondents felt that video visits were shorter (54%) or took the same amount of time (38%) as in-person visits. There was concern that many physicians had experienced a visit in which they felt video was not the appropriate platform given patient concerns. CONCLUSIONS This study is among the first to assess physician experience with video visits. As the visits are perceived as shorter, they may offer a unique opportunity to address clinician burnout. There was a high level of satisfaction at our institution despite multiple technical challenges.","Gold, Katherine J; Laurie, Anna R; Kinney, Devon R; Harmes, Kathryn M; Serlin, David C",Family medicine,https://doi.org/10.22454/fammed.2021.613099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723819/,782

135529,Underlying conditions in adults with COVID-19.,2020-09-29,"BACKGROUND Recurrence after ventral hernia repair (VHR) remains a multifactorial problem still plaguing surgeons today. Some of the many contributing factors include mechanical strain, poor tissue-mesh integration, and degradation of matrices. The high recurrence rate witnessed with the use of acellular dermal matrices (ADM) for definitive hernia repair has reduced their use largely to bridging repair and breast reconstruction. Modalities that improve classic cellular metrics of successful VHR could theoretically result in improved rates of hernia recurrence; autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may represent one such tool, but has been underinvestigated for this purpose. METHODS Lewis rats (32) had chronic ventral hernias created surgically and then repaired with Strattice™ mesh alone (control) or mesh + autologous PRP. Samples were harvested at 3 and 6 months postoperatively and compared for gross, histologic, and molecular outcomes of: neovascularization, tissue incorporation, peritoneal adhesions, hernia recurrence, and residual mesh thickness. RESULTS Compared to control at 3 months postoperatively, PRP-treated rats displayed significantly more neovascularization of implanted mesh and considerable upregulation of both angiogenic genes (vEGF 2.73-fold, vWF 2.21-fold) and myofibroblastic genes (αSMA 9.68-fold, FSP-1 3.61-fold, Col1a1 3.32-fold, Col31a1 3.29-fold). Histologically, they also showed enhanced tissue deposition/ingrowth and diminished chronic immune cell infiltration. Peritoneal adhesions were less severe at both 3 (1.88 vs. 2.94) and 6 months (1.63 vs. 2.75) by Modified Hopkins Adhesion Scoring. PRP-treated rats experienced decreased hernia recurrence at 6 months (0/10 vs. 7/10) and had significantly improved ADM preservation as evidenced by quantification of residual mesh thickness. CONCLUSIONS PRP is an autologous source of pro-regenerative growth factors and chemokines uniquely suited to soft tissue wound healing. When applied to a model of chronic VHR, it incites enhanced angiogenesis, myofibroblast recruitment and tissue ingrowth, ADM preservation, less severe peritoneal adhesions, and diminished hernia recurrence. We advocate further investigation regarding PRP augmentation of human VHR.","Van Eps, Jeffrey; Fernandez-Moure, Joseph; Cabrera, Fernando; Wang, Xin; Karim, Azim; Corradetti, Bruna; Chan, Paige; Dunkin, Brian; Tasciotti, Ennio; Weiner, Bradley; Ellsworth, Warren",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4645-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578432/,782

138544,"Systematic review and meta-analysis on prevalence of metabolic syndrome in psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.",2021-06-02,"Biodiversity in the seas is only partly explored, although marine organisms are excellent sources for many industrial products. Through close co-operation between industrial and academic partners, it is possible to successfully collect, isolate and classify marine organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, micro- and macroalgae, cyanobacteria, and marine invertebrates from the oceans and seas globally. Extracts and purified compounds of these organisms can be studied for several therapeutically and industrially significant biological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and anticoagulant activities by applying a wide variety of screening tools, as well as for ion channel/receptor modulation and plant growth regulation. Chromatographic isolation of bioactive compounds will be followed by structural determination. Sustainable cultivation methods for promising organisms and biotechnological processes for selected compounds can be developed, as well as biosensors for monitoring the target compounds. The (semi)synthetic modification of marine-based bioactive compounds produces their new derivatives, structural analogs and mimetics that could serve as hit or lead compounds and be used to expand compound libraries based on marine natural products. The research innovations can be targeted for industrial product development in order to improve the growth and productivity of marine biotechnology. Marine research aims at a better understanding of environmentally conscious sourcing of marine biotechnology products and increased public awareness of marine biodiversity. Marine research is expected to offer novel marine-based lead compounds for industries and strengthen their product portfolios related to pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, agrochemical, food processing, material and biosensor applications.","Kiuru, Paula; DʼAuria, M Valeria; Muller, Christian D; Tammela, Päivi; Vuorela, Heikki; Yli-Kauhaluoma, Jari",Planta medica,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1383001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25203732/,782

METHODS A research team and an international consensus working group, including service users, clinicians, and researchers, worked together in an iterative process by using a modified Delphi consensus technique that included videoconferencing calls, online surveys, and focus groups. The research team conducted systematic literature searches to identify outcomes, outcome measures, and risk adjustment factors. After identifying outcomes important to service users, the consensus working group selected outcome measures, risk adjustment factors, and the final set of outcome measures. International stakeholder groups consisting of >100 professionals and service users reviewed and commented on the final set. RESULTS The consensus working group identified four outcome domains: symptoms, recovery, functioning, and treatment. The domains encompassed 14 outcomes of importance to service users. The research team identified 131 measures from the literature. The consensus working group selected nine measures in an outcome set that takes approximately 35 minutes to complete. CONCLUSIONS A set of patient-reported outcome measures for use in routine clinical practice was identified. The set is free to service users, is available in at least two languages, and reflects outcomes important to users. Clinicians can use the set to improve clinical decision making, and administrators and researchers can use it to learn from comparing program outcomes.","McKenzie, Emily; Matkin, Lucy; Sousa Fialho, Luz; Emelurumonye, Ifeoma Nneka; Gintner, Timea; Ilesanmi, Christiana; Jagger, Beth; Quinney, Shannon; Anderson, Elizabeth; Baandrup, Lone; Bakhshy, Amrit Kumar; Brabban, Alison; Coombs, Tim; Correll, Christoph U; Cupitt, Caroline; Keetharuth, Anju Devianee; Lima, Dania Nimbe; McCrone, Paul; Moller, Mary; Mulder, Cornelis L; Roe, David; Sara, Grant; Shokraneh, Farhad; Sin, Jacqueline; Woodberry, Kristen A; Addington, Donald",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369809/,782

This review encompasses the spectrum from advanced diagnostic imaging and technical therapeutic approaches for infrapopliteal occlusions, to a discussion of current standards and future directions. RECENT FINDINGS Contemporary studies of infrapopliteal angioplasty show suboptimal short-term and 1-year clinical outcomes. Comparative data is needed to shift the focus from PTA to disruptive treatment modalities that can further improve outcomes. Retrograde pedal access has emerged as an important tool to facilitate successfully percutaneous revascularization and limb salvage in patients with CLI. To efficiently approach the complexity of CLI, new thought processes are needed to change the reigning paradigms. Retrograde tibial-pedal access has shown improvement in the rate of successful revascularizations and is an important tool in the amputation-prevention armamentarium. Additional technologies may further improve success rates. Drug-eluting stents have shown better outcomes than PTA in patients with focal infrapopliteal lesions. Registry data have demonstrated the advantage of several atherectomy devices in the tibial arteries. More recently, bioresorbable vascular scaffolds have been used successfully, and further studies with drug-coated balloons are underway. Interventional operators are now even working in the inframalleolar space to reconstitute the plantar arch. Well-conducted studies are needed to generate high-quality evidence in the field of critical limb ischemia management.","Mustapha, Jihad A; Diaz-Sandoval, Larry J; Saab, Fadi",Current cardiology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-017-0879-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646446/,782

The increasing availability of large biobanks linked to electronic healthcare records enables the potential to identify novel drug-gene interactions in large populations of patients. In this study we used 3 Scottish cohorts and UK Biobank to identify drug-gene interactions for the 50 most commonly used drugs and 162 variants in genes involved in drug pharmacokinetics. We defined two phenotypes based upon prescribing behaviour - drug-stop or dose-decrease. Using this approach, we replicate 11 known drug-gene interactions including, for example, CYP2C9/CYP2C8 variants and sulphonylurea/thiazolidinedione prescribing and ABCB1/ABCG2 variants and statin prescribing. We identify 8 novel associations after bonferroni correction, 3 of which are replicated or validated in the UK biobank or have other supporting results: The C-allele at rs4918758 in CYP2C9 was associated with a 25% (15-44%) lower odds of dose reduction of quinine, p=1.6×10-5 ; the A-allele at rs9895420 in ABCC3 was associated with a 46% (24-62%) reduction in odds of dose reduction with doxazosin, p=1.2×10-4 , and altered blood pressure response in the UK Biobank; the CYP2D6*2 variant was associated with a 30% (18 %- 40%) reduction in odds of stopping ramipril treatment, p=1.01×10-5 , with similar results seen for enalapril and lisinopril and with other CYP2D6 variants.

154415,What can registry data teach us about the pandemic?,2020-09-29,"OBJECTIVES We systematically reviewed the literature to address the question of which of the three hemodynamic factors predicts prognosis best in heart failure patients when directly compared to each other: cardiac output, preload or afterload. METHODS Prognostic studies in heart failure (HF) were searched that included at least two of the three hemodynamic variables: (1) cardiac output or cardiac index (CI), (2) preload represented by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and (3) afterload simplified to systolic blood pressure (SBP). Critical appraisal was done according to the QUIPS format for prognostic studies. The main endpoint was all-cause mortality, which could be combined with other endpoints. We report the number of studies in which CI, PCWP and SBP remained significant prognostic predictors in multivariate analysis. We also assessed whether hemodynamic predictors of prognosis varied in four different HF-populations. RESULTS Included were 18 studies containing a multivariate analysis. PCWP was an independent predictor of prognosis in 10 of 18 studies, SBP in 3 of 14 studies and CI in none of 18 studies. Results were not specific for any of the HF-populations. CONCLUSIONS A higher PCWP and lower SBP are independent predictors of poor prognosis in HF. In spite of the frequently used concept behind HF, this review demonstrates that CI is not an independent predictor of prognosis in HF.","Aalders, Margot; Kok, Wouter",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm8101757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652650/,782

To test whether this fusion ORF is important for DI virus replication, we constructed derivatives of the DI-a genome in which the reading frame was truncated by a nonsense codon or a frameshift mutation. In vitro-transcribed DI RNAs were transfected into mouse hepatitis virus-infected cells followed by undiluted passage of the resulting virus-DI virus stocks. The following observations were made. (i) Truncation of the fusion ORF was not lethal but led to reduced accumulation of DI RNA. (ii) When pairs of nearly identical in-frame and out-of-frame DI RNAs were directly compared by cotransfection, DI viruses containing in-frame genomic RNAs prevailed within three successive passage even when the out-of-frame RNAs were transfected in 10-fold molar excess. (iii) When DI viruses containing out-of-frame genomic RNAs were passaged, mutants emerged and were selected for that had restored the reading frame. We conclude that translation of the fusion ORF is indeed required for efficient propagation of DI-a and its derivatives.","de Groot, R J; van der Most, R G; Spaan, W J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1326650/,782

201246,"Covid-19: Evidens-, eminens-, eller erfaringsbasert behandling?",2020,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a common vasculitic disorder usually seen in children below 5 years of age. The disease can present with protean clinical manifestations which include high grade fever (for at least 5 days), rash, redness of the lips and a typical strawberry tongue, cervical lymph node enlargement (often unilateral), swelling over the hands/feet and, later a characteristic peripheral desquamation over the fingers and toes. These clinical features appear sequentially and the findings may change from day-to-day. Thus, all these features may not be seen together at any one point of time. The diagnosis rests on the recognition of this characteristic temporal sequence of clinical events, none of which are, by themselves, pathognomonic. Establishing a diagnosis of KD may be further complicated by the occurrence of several other, seemingly unrelated, clinical features. These include irritability, neck stiffness, sterile pyuria, pneumonitis, hydrops of the gallbladder and hepatitis among many others. There is no laboratory test that can help in confirming a diagnosis of KD. Left untreated, up to 20% of children with KD can develop coronary aneurysms with catastrophic long term sequelae. It is important to diagnose KD in the first 10 days of the illness so that appropriate therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin can be Initiated.

306166,Prolonged illness after covid-19,2020,"Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the ACE2 cell receptor is very crucial for virus attachment to human cells. Selected mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S-protein are reported to strengthen its binding affinity to mammalian ACE2. The N501T mutation in SARS-CoV-2-CTD furnishes better support to hotspot 353 in comparison with SARS-CoV and shows higher affinity for receptor binding. Recombination analysis exhibited higher recombination events in SARS-CoV-2 strains, irrespective of their geographical origin or hosts. Investigation further supports a common origin among SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors, SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-like-CoV. The recombination events suggest a constant exchange of genetic material among the co-infecting viruses in possible reservoirs and human hosts before SARS-CoV-2 emerged. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias (CUB) in SARS-CoV-2 revealed significant CUB among the S-genes of different beta-coronaviruses governed majorly by natural selection and mutation pressure. Various indices of codon usage of S-genes helped in quantifying its adaptability in other animal hosts. These findings might help in identifying potential experimental animal models for investigating pathogenicity for drugs and vaccine development experiments.","Malik, Yashpal Singh; Ansari, Mohd Ikram; Kattoor, Jobin Jose; Kaushik, Rahul; Sircar, Shubhankar; Subbaiyan, Anbazhagan; Tiwari, Ruchi; Dhama, Kuldeep; Ghosh, Souvik; Tomar, Shailly; Zhang, Kam Y J",Brief. bioinform,,782

A national point-prevalence testing program of all NH residents and staff took place (18/04/2020-05/05/2020). AIMS: To examine characteristics of NHs across three Irish Community Health Organisations (CHOs), proportions with COVID-19 outbreaks, staff and resident infection rates symptom-profile, and resident case-fatality. METHODS: Forty-five NHs surveyed requesting details on occupancy, size, COVID-19 outbreak, outbreak timing, total symptomatic/asymptomatic cases, and outcomes for residents from 29/02/2020-22/05/2020. RESULTS: Surveys were returned from 62.2% (28/45) of NHs (2043 residents, 2,303 beds). Three-quarters (21/28) had COVID-19 outbreaks (1741 residents, 1972 beds). Median time from first COVID-19 case in Ireland to first case in these NHs was 27.0 days. Resident incidence was 43.9% (764/1741): 40.8% (710/1741) laboratory-confirmed, with 27.2% (193/710) asymptomatic, and 3.1% (54/1741) clinically-suspected. Resident case-fatality was 27.6% (211/764) for combined laboratory-confirmed/clinically-suspected COVID-19. Similar proportions of residents in NHs with ""early-stage"" (<28 days) versus ""later-stage"" outbreaks developed COVID-19. Lower proportions of residents in ""early"" outbreak NHs had recovered compared to those with ""late"" outbreaks (37.4% vs 61.7%; &#967;2 = 56.9, P < 0.001). Of 395 NH staff across twelve sites with confirmed COVID-19, 24.7% (99/398) were asymptomatic. There was a significant correlation between the proportion of staff with symptomatic COVID-19 and resident numbers with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 (Spearman's rho = 0.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19 on the NH sector. Systematic point-prevalence testing is necessary to reduce risk of transmission from asymptomatic carriers and manage outbreaks in this setting.","Kennelly, Sean P; Dyer, Adam H; Noonan, Claire; Martin, Ruth; Kennelly, Siobhan M; Martin, Alan; O039,; Neill, Desmond; Fallon, Aoife",Age ageing,,782

BACKGROUND: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, no studies have documented the experience of nurses urgently reallocated to a newly created unit. METHOD: A qualitative descriptive study. Twenty-four nurses working in a sub-intensive care unit created for COVID-19 patients participated in four focus groups. Audio-recorded interviews were verbatim-transcribed; then, a thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The experience of nurses was summarized along three lines: (a) 'becoming a frontline nurse', (b) 'living a double-faced professional experience' and (c) 'advancing in nursing practice'. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses who experienced being mandatorily recruited and urgently reallocated to a COVID-19 unit lived through a mix of negative feelings in the early stages, a double-faced situation during the episode and, at the end, the perception of global growth as a person, as a team and as a professional. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers could play a key role in identifying and preparing nurses in advance to mitigate their concerns and their sense of unpreparedness.

As a result, a sharp increase in prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia against different groups of people was observed in different geographical locations. This chapter presents the psychological and social sources of stereotypes and prejudices that take forms in the COVID-19 pandemic. These sources can be located in psychosocial processes, such as (i) socially generated and reinforced fears; (ii) human responses to stress induced by certain types of stimuli; (iii) sense of helplessness based on the lack of control over reality; (iv) psychological responses reinforced by conformism (crowd psychology); and (v) the stigmatization process. The chapter also presents the main groups of increased risk of experiencing prejudice and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic (Asians, health-care workers, COVID-19 patients, and their relatives). Moreover, it provides a documented example of such behaviors. The groups at higher risk of more adverse effects of COVID-19 due to pre-pandemic discrimination are also discussed. Finally, initiatives taken to mitigate the discrimination associated with COVID-19 are presented, as well as the recommendations and good practices for preventing these behaviors during future outbreaks and for limiting discrimination against COVID-19 until the disease can be contained.","Rzymski, Piotr; Mamzer, Hanna; Nowicki, Michal",Adv Exp Med Biol,,782

Here, we highlight the link between OAS and the germinal center reaction (GCR), a process unique to activated B cells undergoing somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination. It is the powerful response of activated memory B cells and the accompanying GCR that establish the foundations of OAS. We apply these concepts to the current COVID-19 pandemic and put forth several possible scenarios whereby OAS may result in either beneficial or harmful outcomes depending, hypothetically, on prior exposure to antigens shared between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal human coronaviruses (hCoVs) that include betacoronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) and alphacoronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) (E.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A review of the latest literature till 9 May 2020 has been made. PubMed and ResearchGate databases and WHO reports were used. RESULTS: Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS: At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.","Reka, Gabriela; Korzeniowska, Anna; Piecewicz-Szczesna, Halina",Przegl Epidemiol,,782

465485,Covid-19 Medical Advisory Group,2020,"Since the implementation of the Antimicrobial Therapy Optimization Programme, hospital pharmacy specialists have collaborated with infectious disease specialists on a regular basis in most hospitals in Spain. Cooperation between these professionals ensures the integrated management of patients with infectious diseases and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in hospitals. The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospital pharmacists to abruptly suspend all their structured activities and concentrate on the health crisis. Realtime information sharing between different medicine specialties is an effective strategy to generate and maintain treatment protocols adapted to each center, with continuous evidence-based modifications as new publications appear. Hospital pharmacies had to reorganize their activities to respond to the pandemic. On the one side were patients with COVID-19, and on the other were routine hospital pharmacy tasks, with the added difficulty of adapting to individual protection measures. New communication and collaboration strategies were adopted. Protocols were established for the management of COVID-19 patients, with continuous changes; special medications had to be prepared and distributed; circuits were designed for the home- or institution-based care of patients; internal circuits were created to minimize the movements of hospital staff and professionals caring for COVID-19 patients. The most effective antiviral drug and anti inflammatory therapy remains elusive. In this scenario, hospital pharmacists emerge as a key player, as they have a deep understanding of the mechanisms of action of drugs and potential interactions. In a setting where experimental drugs preferably tested in clinical trials are being used, the role of hospital pharmacists in interdisciplinary teams has become essential for the optimization of clinical outcomes.","Gil-Navarro, María Victoria; Luque-Márquez, Rafael",Farm Hosp,,782

Besides others this includes human and structural resources. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study evaluated the occurrence of infections, psychosocial stress and the different strategies to handle the COVID-19 pandemic in care facilities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data collection took place in 7 care facilities in Baden-Württemberg, Germany between 17 July and 25 August 2020. This included a SARS-CoV‑2 PCR and antibody testing and a questionnaire for residents and staff. Care facilities were questioned on interventions and preventive measures taken. RESULTS: Out of 829 SARS-CoV‑2 PCR tests all remained negative. Only 2 asymptomatic subjects had detectable SARS-CoV‑2 antibodies. All subjects (n = 6) with a history of positive PCR had no detectable antibodies. Healthcare workers were mainly worried about infecting family, friends and especially residents (54.4%) with less fear to infect themselves (27.2%). Individual stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: 17.1% exhaustion, 16% financial burden and 13.1% sleeping disorders. Coping strategies included a moderate increase of harmful behavior (+3.3% alcohol, +4.3% nicotine). This was relevantly more important in staff aged under 35 years (+13% alcohol, +12.7% nicotine). Women reported a 2.4% increased use of medication, 49.8% of respondents reduced their social contacts, 76.8% changed their individual hygiene behavior. Care facilities felt prepared to a limited extent for the challenges faced by the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Even with a low prevalence of infections at the time of the survey the COVID-19 pandemic challenged care facilities at multiple levels.

Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4%, P<0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.","Israel, A.; Feldhamer, I.; Lahad, A.; Levin-Zamir, D.; Lavie, G.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.20118877; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.01.20118877v1?rss=1,782
