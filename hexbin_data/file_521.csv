6969,Clinical spectrum of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),2016-04-29,"BACKGROUND: Hypoxia affects myocardial oxygen supply resulting in subclinical cardiac dysfunction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, with cardiovascular complications being associated with increased oxidative burst (OB). The aims of our study were to assess left ventricular (LV) dynamic myocardial deformation and diastolic reserve at rest and upon exercise, along with OB determination in this patients subset. METHODS: Conventional echocardiography, Doppler myocardial imaging and LV 2D speckle tracking echocardiography were performed in 55 OSA patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (EF) and 35 age and sex-comparable healthy controls. Peripheral OB levels were evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Despite comparable LVEF, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly reduced in OSA at rest (− 13.4 ± 3.8 vs − 18.4 ± 3.3 in controls, P < 0.001) and at peak exercise (− 15.8 ± 2.6 vs − 23.4 ± 4.3, P < 0.001). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and E/E′ ratios increase during effort were higher in OSA than in controls (ΔsPAP 44.3% ± 6.4 vs 32.3% ± 5.5, P < 0.0001, and ΔE/E’ 87.5% ± 3.5 vs 25.4% ± 3.3, P < 0.0001, respectively). The best correlate of E/E′ at peak stress was peak exertion capacity (r = − 0.50, P < 0.001). OB was also increased in OSA patients (P = 0.001) but, unlike OSA severity, was not associated with LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of diastolic function and myocardial deformation during exercise is feasible through stress echocardiography. OSA patients with preserved LVEF show subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, impaired LV systolic and diastolic reserve, reduced exercise tolerance, and increased peripheral levels of OB. Therapy aimed at increasing LV diastolic function reserve might improve the quality of life and exercise tolerability in OSA patients.","D’Andrea, Antonello; Canora, Angelo; Sperlongano, Simona; Galati, Domenico; Zanotta, Serena; Polistina, Giorgio Emanuele; Nicoletta, Carmine; Ghinassi, Giacomo; Galderisi, Maurizio; Zamparelli, Alessandro Sanduzzi; Lancellotti, Patrizio; Bocchino, Marialuisa",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103071/,521
22272,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection in Dromedary Camels in Saudi Arabia,2014-03-25,"This report explores the available curative molecules directed against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Limited efficiency as well as other drawbacks of existing molecules led to the search for promising potential alternatives. Understanding of the cell signaling mechanisms propelling carcinogenesis and driven by cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis can offer valuable information for the investigation of efficient treatment strategies. The complexity of the mechanisms behind carcinogenesis inspires researchers to explore the ability of various biomolecules to target specific pathways. Natural components occurring mainly in food and medicinal plants, are considered an essential resource for discovering new and promising therapeutic molecules. Novel biomolecules normally have an advantage in terms of biosafety. They are also widely diverse and often possess potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. Based on quantitative structure–activity relationship studies, biomolecules can be used as templates for chemical modifications that improve efficiency, safety, and bioavailability. In this review, we focus on anti-HCC biomolecules that have their molecular targets partially or completely characterized as well as having anti-cancer molecular mechanisms that are fairly described.","Juaid, Nouf; Amin, Amr; Abdalla, Ali; Reese, Kevin; Alamri, Zaenah; Moulay, Mohamed; Abdu, Suzan; Miled, Nabil",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509806/,521
27026,Pediatric Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection – UAE,2020-02-05,"Numerous viruses are able to cause respiratory tract infections. With the availability of new molecular techniques, the number of pathogens detected in specimens from the human respiratory tract has increased. Some of these viral infections have the potential to lead to severe systemic disease. Other viruses are limited to playing a role in the pathogenesis of the common cold syndrome. This chapter focuses on the viral pathogens that are linked to common cold. It is not the intention to comprehensively review all the viruses that are able to cause respiratory tract infections—this would go beyond the scope of this book. The list of viruses that are briefly reviewed here includes rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and coronavirus. Bocavirus is discussed as one example of a newly identified pathogen with a less established role in the etiology and pathogenesis of common cold. Influenza virus does not cause what is defined as common cold. However, influenza viruses are associated with respiratory disease and the clinical picture of mild influenza and common cold frequently overlaps. Therefore, influenza virus has been included in this chapter. It is important to note that a number of viruses are frequently co-detected with other viruses in humans with respiratory diseases. Therefore, the viral etiology and the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of common cold is complex, and numberous questions remain to be answered.","Weber, Olaf",Common Cold,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124101/,521

28932,Crystal structures of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein,2013,"In this present investigation, 2-imino-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)ethane sulphonic acid was anchored on a silver nanoparticle mediated by sugarcane sap. The Schiff base was synthesized from 2-aminoethanesulphonic acid and 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde under lemon juice catalyzed conditions while the nanoparticles were obtained by careful stirring of sugarcane sap and 1 mM AgNO(3) in the ratio of 1:10 respectively at room temperature. The resulting nanocomplex was formed by gentle heating and stirring of the silver nanoparticles solution and the ligand at a temperature of about 80 °C for 3 h. The ligand, nanoparticles and nanocomplex were characterized using UV–vis spectrophotometer, scanning electron microscope, FT-IR and XRD machines. From the UV–vis results, surface plasmon bands (SPBs) were observed at 475 nm for the nanoparticle within 1 h of the reaction and 450 nm for the nanocomplex. The ligand exhibited absorption bands at 310 nm, 280 nm and 230 nm which are due to π-electron transitions within the chromophores. The strikingly broad nature of the SPBs especially in the nanoparticles revealed that the particles are kinetically favored, nucleate easily and are polydispersed and the blue shift observed in the nanocomplex suggested further reduction in the particle size therefore giving us a clue on how to tailor the products by tuning the raw materials. From the scanning electron micrographs, the morphologies and growth mechanisms revealed oriented attachment for the nanoparticles onwards digestive ripening for the nanocomplex. All the synthesized materials proved to be potential antibacterial agents as they showed great inhibition to the growth of some bacterial strains with the activity enhanced in the nanocomplex.","Elemike, Elias Emeka; Dare, Enock Olugbenga; Samuel, Inyang David; Onwuka, Jude Chinedu",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148695/,521

29450,Zoonoses,2014-10-31,"This chapter reviews the basic principles of medical management of rat colonies and diagnostic approaches to detect infectious diseases of rats. Due to the fact that a comprehensive colony health monitoring program is so vital in protecting the validity and reproducibility of experimental research data, it must be devoted an appropriate priority in terms of budget, personnel, and other resources. The policies and practices should be defined in written plans, and agreement with the principles set forth should be secured by the scientific and administrative leadership of the institution, as well as by the veterinary and animal care group. Programs should be designed to monitor individual animal health through the use of direct methods such as close observation and physical examination. A program created to monitor the overall health status of a colony population often utilizes more indirect methods. Routine testing of selected representative animals (even in the absence of any signs of illness or disease) can provide valuable information regarding the viral, parasitic, and bacterial agents that such animals are either currently harboring or have been exposed to in the past. Risk analysis should be done by any institution planning on holding rodents, a process that should involve a discussion of the relative costs and benefits of the various options available for routine health monitoring as well as quarantine isolation and testing.","Otto, Glen; Franklin, Craig L.",The Laboratory Rat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150000/,521

Methods Retrospective study of 487 children presenting with fever and/or acute respiratory symptoms in the Paediatric Emergency Department. Analyses included viral presence/absence (both HAdV and other respiratory viruses) in respiratory exudates, CRP and PCT alterations in plasma, and haematological markers in whole blood. Results Viral load was >500 copies/103 cells of HAdV in 127 cases (26.1%), of which 66 (52%, P<0.0001) had alterations in PCT, and 112 (88.1%, P<0.0001) in CRP. Haematological markers were similar either HAdV was present or not, although many HAdV positive patients demonstrated leukocytosis (66%). Bacterial cultures from 141 samples showed altered PCT in 27 (60%) with HAdV infection, in 3 (18.7%) with bacterial infection, and 13 (26.5%) without either viral or bacterial infection (P<0.05). CRP was altered in 88.9% of HAdV infected children and in 87% infected with bacteria, although the percentage was greater than in cases where other respiratory viruses were present (61.3% P<0.05). Conclusions Results demonstrate a clear relationship between HAdV infection and alterations in PCT and CRP which should be taken into account in paediatric patient management.","Gómez de Oña, Constanza; Alvarez-Argüelles, Marta E; Rojo-Alba, Susana; Casares, Helena; Arroyo, Mireia; Rodríguez, Julián; de Oña, María; Melón, Santiago",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189083/,521

70015,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): announcement of the Coronavirus Study Group.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Thrombus composition has been postulated to affect the success of endovascular therapy. Calcified clots are composed of large amounts of calcium phosphate which influences their mechanical properties and may serve as a model for testing this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recanalization and complication rates of calcified thromboemboli in patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent thrombectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of all calcified intracranial thromboemboli in patients suffering an acute ischemic stroke, referred for endovascular therapy at two centers between January 2013 and July 2016. RESULTS Eight patients with a calcified intracranial clot underwent stent retriever thrombectomy (five women; mean age 80 years). Mean clot attenuation was 305 HU (range 150-640 HU). Successful reperfusion defined, as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2b-3 was achieved in only one patient (12.5%). Two periprocedural adverse events occurred: one peripheral vessel perforation which was coiled and one inadvertent stent retriever detachment due to fracture of the stent retriever wire. CONCLUSION Stent retriever thrombectomy of calcified thromboemboli seems less effective than with other types of clots. Different mechanical properties of calcified clots may render them stiffer and less accessible for stent retrievers. When faced with a calcified intracranial thromboembolus in clinical practice, a more contained approach may be warranted in view of low recanalization rates, and the potential for periprocedural adverse events.","Dobrocky, Tomas; Piechowiak, Eike; Cianfoni, Alessandro; Zibold, Felix; Roccatagliata, Luca; Mosimann, Pascal; Jung, Simon; Fischer, Urs; Mordasini, Pasquale; Gralla, Jan",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28798266/,521

Decades of research demonstrate that uninsured people and people with copays and deductibles use less care than people with first-dollar coverage. Hence, most economic analyses of Medicare for All proposals and other coverage expansions project increased utilization and associated costs. We review the utilization surges that such analyses have predicted and contrast them with the more modest utilization increments observed after past coverage expansions in the US and other affluent nations. The discrepancy between predicted and observed utilization changes suggests that analysts underestimate the role of supply-side constraints-for example, the finite number of physicians and hospital beds. Our review of the utilization effects of past coverage expansions suggests that a first-dollar universal coverage expansion would increase ambulatory visits by 7-10 percent and hospital use by 0-3 percent. Modest administrative savings could offset the costs of such increases.","Gaffney, Adam; Himmelstein, David U; Woolhandler, Steffie; Kahn, James G",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400569/,521
73250,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection: epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical characteristics.",2018,"Blood flow through intrapulmonary arteriovenous anastomoses (IPAVAs) has been demonstrated to increase in healthy humans during a variety of conditions; however, whether or not this blood flow represents a source of venous admixture (Q̇ VA /Q̇T) that impairs pulmonary gas exchange efficiency (i.e. increases the alveolar-to-arterial PO2 difference (A-aDO2)) remains controversial and unknown. We hypothesized that blood flow through IPAVAs does provide a source of Q̇ VA /Q̇T. To test this, blood flow through IPAVAs was increased in healthy humans at rest breathing room air and 40% O2: (1) during intravenous adrenaline (epinephrine) infusion at 320 ng kg(-1) min(-1) (320 ADR), and (2) with vagal blockade (2 mg atropine), before and during intravenous adrenaline infusion at 80 ng kg(-1) min(-1) (ATR + 80 ADR). When breathing room air the A-aDO2 increased by 6 ± 2 mmHg during 320 ADR and by 5 ± 2 mmHg during ATR + 80 ADR, and the change in calculated Q̇ VA /Q̇T was +2% in both conditions. When breathing 40% O2, which minimizes contributions from diffusion limitation and alveolar ventilation-to-perfusion inequality, the A-aDO2 increased by 12 ± 7 mmHg during 320 ADR, and by 9 ± 6 mmHg during ATR + 80 ADR, and the change in calculated Q̇ VA /Q̇T was +2% in both conditions. During 320 ADR cardiac output (Q̇T) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) were significantly increased; however, during ATR + 80 ADR only Q̇T was significantly increased, yet blood flow through IPAVAs as detected with saline contrast echocardiography was not different between conditions. Accordingly, we suggest that blood flow through IPAVAs provides a source of intrapulmonary shunt, and is mediated primarily by increases in Q̇T rather than PASP.","Elliott, Jonathan E; Duke, Joseph W; Hawn, Jerold A; Halliwill, John R; Lovering, Andrew T",The Journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2014.274829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25085889/,521
77846,Generation of Full-length Infectious cDNA Clones of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,2019,"BACKGROUND Clinical indications for medicinal cannabis include chronic conditions; thus users (MCUs) are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). The study aimed to provide data on cannabis use and self-reported behavioral changes among MCUs with preexisting chronic conditions in response to the pandemic. METHODS An internet-based questionnaire was administered to adults ≥18 who self-reported medicinal cannabis use within the past year. Data are from respondents between March 21 and April 23, 2020; response rate was 83.3%. Health conditions and cannabis frequency, route, and patterns of use were assessed via the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Questionnaire (Vidot et al. 2020). RESULTS Participants (N = 1202) were predominantly non-Hispanic white (82.5%) and 52.0% male (mean age 47.2 years). Mental health (76.7%), pain (43.7%), cardiometabolic (32.9%), respiratory (16.8%), and autoimmune (12.2%) conditions were most reported. Those with mental health conditions reported increased medicinal cannabis use by 91% since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic compared to those with no mental health conditions (adjusted odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.38-2.65). 6.8% reported suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Two percent (2.1%) have been tested for COVID-19 with only 1 positive test result. Some MCUs (16%) changed their route of cannabis administration, switching to nonsmoking forms. CONCLUSIONS The majority of MCUs reported at least one preexisting chronic health condition. Over half report fear of COVID-19 diagnosis and giving the virus to someone else; yet only some switched from smoking to nonsmoking forms of cannabis. Clinicians may consider asking about cannabis use among their patients, particularly those with chronic health conditions.","Vidot, Denise C; Islam, Jessica Y; Marlene Camacho-Rivera,; Harrell, Melissa B; Rao, Devika R; Chavez, Jennifer V; Lucas G Ochoa,; Hlaing, WayWay M; Weiner, Michelle; Messiah, Sarah E",Journal of addictive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1811455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933383/,521
80749,Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus: a new challenge for veterinarians?,2013,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the incidence of cervical stenosis and related emotional and sexual adjustment concerns in women treated with radical trachelectomy. METHODS Prospective data of 30 stage I cervical cancer patients enrolled in an ongoing study were evaluated in combination with a medical chart review. RESULTS Eight patients (27%) did not have any stenosis of the neo-cervix postoperatively; 10 (33%) had clinically notable stenosis not requiring neo-cervical dilation to allow adequate sampling; moreover, 12 (40%) had sufficient stenosis requiring a neo-cervical dilation procedure, which proved to be safe and useful. The majority of the dilation procedures (n=8) were conducted under local anesthesia in the office. At preoperative baseline survey, women reported a high rate of sexual inactivity. Fear of intercourse and dyspareunia were reported prior to surgery; however, trends of adjustment and improvement were noted over time postoperatively. Overall, fear of sexual activity tended to lessen if the degree of dyspareunia decreased over time. Postoperative dyspareunia decreased over time, which could have been associated with the mechanical stretching due to vaginal dilator use or dilating benefit of intercourse. CONCLUSION Postoperative concerns associated with radical trachelectomy may be greater than what has been reported in the literature; however, several adjustment trends were noted with intermediate/long-term follow-up. Office cervical dilation is a simple procedure, which is helpful in the management of neo-cervical stenosis. We are currently investigating the value of a physician checklist as a clinical care model to remind medical professionals to monitor and address important survivorship issues.","Carter, Jeanne; Sonoda, Yukio; Chi, Dennis S; Raviv, Leigh; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2008.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18662827/,521
81354,Importance of Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Multiple Antigenic Sites on the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Glycoprotein To Avoid Neutralization Escape.,2018,"INTRODUCTION early-stage follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by good prognosis and can be cured with involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT) in most cases. PET scan is a milestone of diagnostic work-up, with the aim of identifying a truly-localized disease; however, staging in most of the studies was without PET. AREAS COVERED we have searched in MEDLINE (inclusive dates 1994-2020) data about localized FL management. While high-quality evidence is lacking, current guidelines recommend IFRT or involved-site RT as first-line treatment in limited stages FL. Since a significant proportion of disease relapse occurred in non-irradiated areas, it has been hypothesized that occult disease could be present at diagnosis and could persist after RT, contributing to relapse. Available treatment options include watch-and-wait, chemotherapy, RT plus chemo- or chemo-immunotherapy and RT combined with rituximab (R). EXPERT OPINION RT combined with chemotherapy could increase PFS, but a clear OS benefit is lacking and toxic effects could be unacceptable.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study is a large case series, and data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Central Hospital of Wuhan between 2 January and 15 February 2020. All patients with definite outcomes (death or discharge) were included. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory information were extracted from electronic medical records. We collected daily fasting glucose data from standard morning fasting blood biochemistry to determine glycemic status and fluctuation (calculated as the square root of the variance of daily fasting glucose levels) during the 1st week of hospitalization. RESULTS A total of 548 patients were included in the study (median age 57 years; 298 [54%] were women, and n = 99 had diabetes [18%]), 215 suffered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 489 survived, and 59 died. Patients who had higher mean levels of glucose during their 1st week of hospitalization were older and more likely to have a comorbidity and abnormal laboratory markers, prolonged hospital stays, increased expenses, and greater risks of severe pneumonia, ARDS, and death. Compared with patients with the lowest quartile of glycemic fluctuation, those who had the highest quartile of fluctuation magnitude had an increased risk of ARDS (risk ratio 1.97 [95% CI 1.01, 4.04]) and mortality (hazard ratio 2.73 [95% CI 1.06, 7.73]). CONCLUSIONS These results may have implications for optimizing glycemic control strategies in COVID-19 patients during the early phase of hospitalization.","Chen, Liangkai; Sun, Wenwu; Liu, Yanli; Zhang, Lijuan; Lv, Yanling; Wang, Qiang; Long, Ding; Wang, Yujun; Zhao, Su; Rong, Shuang; Yu, Li; Liu, Liegang",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-0780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479161/,521
91668,Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus nsp1 Inhibits Host Gene Expression by Selectively Targeting mRNAs Transcribed in the Nucleus while Sparing mRNAs of Cytoplasmic Origin.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Torch-light Eye Screening Test (TEST) is a simple eye screening technique designed for use by opticians to look for common anterior segment eye conditions. The TEACHES-Learning Electronic Module (TEACHES-LEM) is an e-learning platform that was developed to teach opticians to perform TEST. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of TEACHES-LEM with face-to-face training (F2FT) in the training and assessment of knowledge among opticians. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned in this experimental study to receive either the intervention group ((TEACHES-LEM, n = 60) or the control group (F2FT, n = 57). The conceptual knowledge of TEST was assessed with a 20-item clinical scenario-based multiple choice question (MCQ) test before and after teaching (immediately post-teaching and 1-month post-teaching). The MCQ test was developed by three ophthalmologists to give face validity. RESULTS The pre-teaching test scores (TS), indicating prior knowledge, were comparable in both groups (10.02 ± 2.79 versus 10.40 ± 4.17, p = 0.563, independent t test). The mean immediate post teaching score for TEACHES-LEM was 13.3 ± 4.01 versus 12.3 ± 3.29 in the F2FT group (p = 0.170, independent t test). The mean post 1-month teaching score for TEACHES-LEM and F2FT groups were also comparable, 14.5 ± 4.19 versus 13.4 ± 3.90 respectively (p = 0.295, independent t test), indicating non-inferiority of TEACHES to F2FT. CONCLUSION The TEACHES-LEM e-learning tool is as effective as F2FT in teaching opticians to perform TEST. It is an alternative to face-to-face teaching in delivering knowledge and assessment. The obviation for physical contact will make it a useful teaching tool during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Chee, W K; Yip, C C; Yang, L; Soo, Y K; Wang, J; Chang, Bcm",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33319490/,521

100739,Effect of Fc Fusion on Folding and Immunogenicity of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike Protein.,2019,"Differential renal expression of a homolog of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), that is, ACE2, has been implicated as a genetic basis of polygenetic hypertension in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat model. However, data on the role of ACE2 in hypertension are still inconclusive. Therefore, we analyzed kidney ACE2 mRNA, ACE2 protein and ACE2 enzyme activities in the adult polygenetic stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) and the monogenetic TGR(mREN2)27 rat models, in comparison with their normotensive reference strains, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Spraque-Dawley (SD) rats, respectively. Kidney ACE2 mRNA was studied using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in cortex and medulla, whereas protein expression was scored semiquantitatively in detail in different renal structures using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, total renal tissue ACE2 activity was measured using a fluorimetric assay that was specified by the ACE2 inhibitor DX600. In SHRSP and homozygous TGR(mREN2)27 rats with established hypertension, kidney ACE2 mRNA, protein and tissue ACE2 activities were not different from their respective WKY and SD reference strain, respectively. In addition, when we looked at renal localization, we found ACE2 protein to be predominantly present in glomeruli and endothelium with weak staining in distal and negative staining in proximal tubuli. Thus, our data challenge previous work that implicates ACE2 as a candidate gene for hypertension in SHRSP by reporting a significant reduction of ACE2 in the kidneys of SHRSP. Taken together, renal ACE2 is not altered in the SHRSP and TGR(mREN2)27 genetic rat models with established hypertension.","Kamilic, Jelena; Hamming, Inge; Kreutz, Reinhold; Bolbrinker, Juliane; Siems, Wolf-Eberhard; Nassar, Ibrahim; Sluimer, Judith C; Walther, Thomas; Navis, Gerjan J; van Goor, Harry",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1038/hr.2009.191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19927150/,521

101283,Assessing the Detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus IgG in Suspected and Proven Cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection.,2017,"INTRODUCTION A major site of secondhand smoke exposure for children and adults is the home. Few studies have evaluated the impact of e-cigarette or hookah use on home air quality, despite evidence finding toxic chemicals in secondhand e-cigarette aerosols and hookah smoke. We assessed the effect of e-cigarette and hookah use on home air quality and compared it with air quality in homes where cigarettes were smoked and where no smoking or e-cigarette use occurred. METHODS Non-smoking homes and homes where e-cigarettes, hookah or cigarettes were used were recruited in the New York City area (n=57) from 2015 to 2019. Particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), black carbon and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured during a smoking or vaping session, both in a 'primary' smoking room and in an adjacent 'secondary' room where no smoking or vaping occurred. Log transformed data were compared with postanalysis of variance Tukey simultaneous tests. RESULTS Use of hookah significantly increased PM2.5 levels compared with non-smoking homes, in both the primary and secondary rooms, while use of e-cigarettes increased PM2.5 levels only in primary rooms. Additionally, in-home use of hookah resulted in greater CO concentrations than the use of cigarettes in primary rooms. CONCLUSIONS Use of e-cigarettes or hookah increases air pollution in homes. For hookah, increases in PM2.5 penetrated even into rooms adjacent to where smoking occurs. Extending smoke-free rules inside homes to include e-cigarette and hookah products is needed to protect household members and visitors from passive exposure to harmful aerosols and gases.","Shearston, Jenni A; Eazor, James; Lee, Lily; Vilcassim, M J Ruzmyn; Reed, Taylor A; Ort, Deborah; Weitzman, Michael; Gordon, Terry",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34021062/,521
101774,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in pilgrims returning from the Hajj.,2015,"In this study, a dual-targeting drug delivery system based on bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (BSA-NPs) modified with both lactoferrin (Lf) and mPEG2000 loading doxorubicin (DOX) was designed, and its blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and brain glioma cells targeting properties were explored. BSA-NPs were prepared by a desolvation technique, and mPEG2000 was incorporated onto the surface of BSA-NPs by reacting with the free amino-group of BSA to form mPEG2000-modified BSA-NPs (P2000-NPs). Finally, Lf-modified P2000-NPs (Lf-NPs) was obtained by absorbing Lf onto the surface of P2000-NPs via the positive and negative charges interaction at physiological pH. Three levels of mPEG2000 and Lf-modified NPs were prepared and characterized, respectively. The uptake and potential cytotoxicity of different DOX preparations in vitro by the primary brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and glioma cells (C6) were investigated. The dual-targeting effects were studied on the BBB model in vitro, BCECs/C6 glioma coculture model in vitro, and C6 glioma-bearing rats in vivo, respectively. The results exhibited that, with the increase of the amount of both mPEG2000 and Lf, the particle size of NPs increased and its zeta potential decreased. The in vivo pharmacokinetics study in healthy rats exhibited that P2000-NPs with a high level of mPEG2000 (P2000H-NPs) had longer circulation time in vivo. Compared to other NPs, Lf-NPs with high level of both Lf and mPEG2000 (LfH-NPs) showed the strongest cytotoxicity and the highest effectiveness in the uptake both in BCECs and C6 as well as improved the dual-targeting effects. Body distribution of DOX in different formulations revealed that LfH-NPs could significantly increase the accumulation of DOX in the brain, especially at 2 h postinjection (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Lf-NPs were a prospective dual-targeting drug delivery system for effective targeting therapy of brain gliomas.","Su, Zhigui; Xing, Lei; Chen, Yinan; Xu, Yurui; Yang, Feifei; Zhang, Can; Ping, Qineng; Xiao, Yanyu",Molecular pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1021/mp500238m; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24779677/,521

In the 2016 urban fire in Japan (Itoigawa-City Fire), at least 10 structures were ignited by firebrand showers and three of these structures were ignited by firebrand penetration under tile roof assemblies. In this study, the vulnerabilities of Japanese-style roof tile assemblies to firebrand exposures were investigated by using a continuous-feed firebrand generator with applied nominal wind speeds of 6 m/s and 9 m/s. It was observed that Japanese-style roof tile assemblies were more vulnerable than concrete flat, concrete profile, and terracotta flat roof tiles for applied wind speeds of 6 m/s. When the experiments were performed with debris placed underneath the roof tiles, penetrated firebrands ignited debris. Flaming ignition was observed under 9 m/s where flame was observed to protrude from the tiles in an effort to reach necessary oxygen for combustion.","Suzuki, Sayaka; Manzello, Samuel L",Fire technology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10694-020-00982-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831362/,521

DNA vaccines consist of a DNA plasmid containing a transgene that encodes the sequence of a target protein from a pathogen under the control of a eukaryotic promoter. This revolutionary technology has proven to be effective in animal models and four DNA vaccine products have recently been approved for veterinary use. Although few DNA vaccines against bacterial infections have been tested, the results are encouraging. Because of their versatility, safety and simplicity a wider range of organisms can be targeted by these vaccines, which shows their potential advantages to public health. This article describes the mechanism of action of DNA vaccines and their potential use for targeting bacterial infections.

115713,Passive immunotherapy with dromedary immune serum in an experimental animal model for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.,2015,"BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is underutilized in many parts of the world despite pro-PD health policies. The physical and cognitive demands of PD means that over half of eligible patients require some form of assistance. As such, many countries now offer assisted PD (aPD) programs to help patients start or stay on PD as opposed to in-center hemodialysis (HD). In order to evaluate the potential scope of aPD, it is important to review the outcomes and cost considerations of aPD. SUMMARY We reviewed available data from different countries and regions for health outcomes between aPD and in-center HD, with a focus on quality of life (QoL), mortality, hospitalization, and technique survival. We also evaluated studies discussing the overall costs of delivering aPD, including training, operating costs, and indirect costs and compared these to in-center HD costs for the same regions. Key Messages: aPD patients are older and more frail than either self-care PD patients and many in-center HD patients. We found no evidence for any difference in QoL, mortality, or hospitalization between aPD and in-center HD after adjustment for these differences. There is some evidence for an association between nurse assistance and improved technique survival as compared to family assistance or self-care PD. Despite increased cost of providing assistance in PD, it is still significantly less expensive than in-center HD in Western Europe and Canada.","Maierean, Serban M; Oliver, Matthew J",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000512839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33626546/,521

124311,Two Mutations Were Critical for Bat-to-Human Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES One year since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we aimed to summarize the frequency of neurological manifestations reported in COVID-19 patients and investigate the association of these manifestations with disease severity and mortality. METHODS We searched PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library, clinicaltrials.gov and EMBASE from 31st December 2019 to 15th December 2020 for studies enrolling consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting with neurological manifestations. Risk of bias was examined using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and pooled prevalence and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated for neurological manifestations. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were calculated to determine the association of neurological manifestations with disease severity and mortality. Presence of heterogeneity was assessed using I-square, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2. RESULTS Of 2,455 citations, 350 studies were included in this review, providing data on 145,721 COVID-19 patients, 89% of whom were hospitalized. Forty-one neurological manifestations (24 symptoms and 17 diagnoses) were identified. Pooled prevalence of the most common neurological symptoms included: fatigue (32%), myalgia (20%), taste impairment (21%), smell impairment (19%) and headache (13%). A low risk of bias was observed in 85% of studies; studies with higher risk of bias yielded higher prevalence estimates. Stroke was the most common neurological diagnosis (pooled prevalence- 2%). In COVID-19 patients aged ≥60, the pooled prevalence of acute confusion/delirium was 34% and the presence of any neurological manifestations in this age group was associated with mortality (OR 1.80; 95%CI 1.11 to 2.91). DISCUSSION Up to one-third of COVID-19 patients analysed in this review experienced at least one neurological manifestation. One in 50 patients experienced stroke. In those over 60, more than one-third had acute confusion/delirium; the presence of neurological manifestations in this group was associated with near doubling of mortality.

Seventeen adults completed three conditions: i) low threat, where participants performed a heel raise in response to a ""go"" tone, ii) high threat, where participants either heard the same ""go"" tone, for which they performed a heel raise, or experienced a support surface translation in the medio-lateral direction that disturbed their balance, and iii) choice reaction time task, where participants either completed a heel raise in response to the same ""go"" tone or a toe raise in response to a lower pitched tone. For all heel raise trials, anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) were quantified from center of pressure (COP) recordings and electromyographic (EMG) activity from the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL). Results indicated that participants exhibited larger APAs, as reflected by the greater backward COP displacement (p=0.038) and velocity (p=0.022) as well as a larger TA EMG amplitude (p=0.045), during the high threat condition. During the execution phase of the heel raise, an earlier (p=0.014) and larger (p=0.041) SOL EMG activation were observed during the high threat condition. These results contrast with previous findings of reduced APAs when the postural threat was evoked through changes in surface height. Therefore, the characteristics of the postural threat must be considered to isolate the effects of threat on anticipatory movement control.","Phanthanourak, Angel L; Cleworth, Taylor W; Adkin, Allan L; Carpenter, Mark G; Tokuno, Craig D",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2016.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27611062/,521

The responsiveness/validity of the RHI and multiple histological, endoscopic and clinical outcome measures were evaluated by analyses of change scores, standardised effect size (SES) and Guyatt's responsiveness statistic (GRS) using data from a clinical trial of an effective therapy. RESULTS Inter-rater ICCs (95% CIs) for the total GS and MRS scores were 0.79 (0.63 to 0.87) and 0.80 (0.69 to 0.87). The correlation estimates between change scores in RHI and change score in GS and MRS were 0.75 (0.67 to 0.82) and 0.84 (0.79 to 0.88), respectively. The SES and GRS estimates for GS, MRS and RHI were: 1.87 (1.54 to 2.20) and 1.23 (0.97 to 1.50), 1.29 (1.02 to 1.56) and 0.88 (0.65 to 1.12), and 1.05 (0.79 to 1.30) and 0.88 (0.64 to 1.12), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The RHI is a new histopathological index with favourable operating properties.","Mosli, Mahmoud H; Feagan, Brian G; Zou, Guangyong; Sandborn, William J; D'Haens, Geert; Khanna, Reena; Shackelton, Lisa M; Walker, Christopher W; Nelson, Sigrid; Vandervoort, Margaret K; Frisbie, Valerie; Samaan, Mark A; Jairath, Vipul; Driman, David K; Geboes, Karel; Valasek, Mark A; Pai, Rish K; Lauwers, Gregory Y; Riddell, Robert; Stitt, Larry W; Levesque, Barrett G",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2015-310393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475633/,521

136191,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV): A review.,2019,"OBJECTIVE Social lockdowns associated with COVID-19 have led individuals to increasingly rely on video conferencing and other technology-based interactions to fulfil social needs. The extent to which these interactions, as well as traditional face-to-face interactions, satisfied psychological needs and supported wellbeing during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be elucidated. In this study, university students' social interactions (both technology-based and face-to-face), psychological needs, and wellbeing were assessed at six time points across four months of government-enforced restrictions in Australia. DESIGN Repeated survey assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Basic psychological need satisfaction; general wellbeing. RESULTS Results demonstrated that, at the within-subjects level, relatedness satisfaction (feeling understood by, cared for, and connected to others) significantly mediated the relationship between technology-based interaction and wellbeing. Autonomy satisfaction (self-initiation and feeling ownership over decisions and behaviours) mediated the relationship between face-to-face interactions and wellbeing at the within-person level. CONCLUSION Discussion is centred on the importance of technology-based interactions for needs satisfaction and wellbeing during periods of social isolation.","Dimmock, James; Krause, Amanda E; Rebar, Amanda; Jackson, Ben",Psychology & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.1921178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33998909/,521

The novel member of Coronaviridae causing COVID-19 disease is named as SARS-Cov-2. Its first case was reported in China by the end of 2019, but its exponential spread has wrapped entire globe, suspended and is penalizing mankind. A retrospective meta-analysis study showed that outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-Cov-1 (Coronaviridae), influenza infection H1N1 and West-African Ebola caused lower mortality than this new pandemic COVID-19. Virus has appeared as a new human pathogen so to counter COVID-19 no specific vaccine, monoclonal antibodies have been manufactured till day. The outbreak of novel Coronavirus is treated with antimicrobial drugs but they have their own mild side effects. But the drastic spread of COVID-19 compels us also to use other ways to counter pandemic. Thus, passive immunization can be opted to hold back this mysterious virus. Passive immunization has been in use since early 20th century and showed its effectiveness against all previous infectious outbreaks including MERS and SARS-Cov-1 members of Coronaviridae. The review argues that convalescent plasma is an explicit option for containment of COVID-19 disease.","Iftikhar, Amina; Jabeen, Faiza; Manzoor, Maleeha; Younis, Tahira; Shaheen, Mussarat",Acta microbiologica et immunologica Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/030.2020.01199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32619190/,521

146853,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.,2017,"UNLABELLED Targeting cancer cells with vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is hampered by unwanted physiologic tissue uptake mediated by transcobalamin. Adhering to good manufacturing practice, we have developed a new (99m)Tc-cobalamin derivative ((99m)Tc(CO)3-[(4-amido-butyl)-pyridin-2-yl-methyl-amino-acetato] cobalamin, (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin). The derivative shows no binding to transcobalamin but is recognized by haptocorrin, a protein present in the circulation and notably expressed in many tumor cells. In this prospective study, we investigated cancer-specific uptake of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin in 10 patients with various metastatic tumors. METHODS Ten patients with biopsy-proven metastatic cancer were included. Dynamic imaging was started immediately after injection of 300-500 MBq of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin, and whole-body scintigrams were obtained at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and after 24 h. The relative tumor activity using SPECT/CT over the tumor region after 4 h was measured in comparison to disease-free lung parenchyma. Patients 3-10 received between 20 and 1,000 μg of cobalamin intravenously before injection of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin. The study population comprised 4 patients with adenocarcinomas of the lung, 3 with squamous cell carcinomas of the hypopharyngeal region, 1 with prostate adenocarcinoma, 1 with breast, and 1 with colon adenocarcinoma. RESULTS The median age of the study group was 61 ± 11 y. Six of 10 patients showed positive tumor uptake on (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin whole-body scintigraphy. The scan was positive in 1 patient with colon adenocarcinoma, in 3 of 4 lung adenocarcinomas, in 1 of 3 hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and in 1 breast adenocarcinoma. Renal uptake was between 1% and 3% for the left kidney. Predosing with cobalamin increased the tumor uptake and improved blood-pool clearance. The best image quality was achieved with a predose of 20-100 ug of cold cobalamin. The mean patient dose was 2.7 ± 0.9 mSv/patient. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, we report for the first time on (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin imaging in patients with metastatic cancer disease and show that tumor targeting is feasible.","Sah, Bert-Ram; Schibli, Roger; Waibel, Robert; von Boehmer, Lotta; Bläuenstein, Peter; Nexo, Ebba; Johayem, Anass; Fischer, Eliane; Müller, Ennio; Soyka, Jan D; Knuth, Alexander K; Haerle, Stefan K; Schubiger, Pius August; Schaefer, Niklaus G; Burger, Irene A","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.113.122499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24337606/,521
147078,Mouse dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is not a functional receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Acute postoperative pain remains a major problem, with both undertreatment and overtreatment leading to serious consequences, including increased risk of persistent postoperative pain, impaired rehabilitation, increased length of stay and/or hospital readmission, and adverse events related to excessive analgesic use, such as oversedation. New analgesic medications and techniques have been introduced that target the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods to better manage acute postoperative pain, with improvements in analgesic efficacy and safety over more traditional pain management approaches. This review provides an overview of these new analgesic medications and techniques. Specific topics that are discussed include the use of preoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants; intraoperative approaches such as neuraxial analgesia, continuous local anesthetic wound infusion, transversus abdominis plane block, extended-release epidural morphine, intravenous acetaminophen, and intravenous ketamine; and postoperative use of intravenous ibuprofen, new opioids (eg, tapentadol) or opioid formulations (morphine-oxycodone), and patient-controlled analgesia. CONCLUSION New, targeted, analgesic medications and techniques may provide a safer and more effective approach to the management of acute postoperative pain than traditional approaches such as postoperative oral analgesics.","Argoff, Charles E",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23945010/,521

Previous DBS-fMRI studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral (VL) thalamus can modulate sensorimotor cortices in a frequency and amplitude dependent manner. Here, we investigated, using a swine animal model, how the direction and orientation of the electric field, induced by VL-thalamus DBS, affects activity in the sensorimotor cortex. Adult swine underwent implantation of a novel 16-electrode (4 rows x 4 columns) directional DBS lead in the VL thalamus. A within-subject design was used to compare fMRI responses for (1) directional stimulation consisting of monopolar stimulation in four radial directions around the DBS lead, and (2) orientation-selective stimulation where an electric field dipole was rotated 0°-360° around a quadrangle of electrodes. Functional responses were quantified in the premotor, primary motor, and somatosensory cortices. High frequency electrical stimulation through leads implanted in the VL thalamus induced directional tuning in cortical response patterns to varying degrees depending on DBS lead position. Orientation-selective stimulation showed maximal Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast when the electric field was oriented approximately parallel to the DBS lead, which is consistent with known axonal orientations of the cortico-thalamocortical pathway. These results demonstrate that directional and orientation-selective stimulation paradigms in the VL thalamus can tune network-level modulation patterns in the sensorimotor cortex, which may have translational utility in improving functional outcomes of DBS therapy.","Slopsema, Julia P; Canna, Antonietta; Uchenik, Michelle; Lehto, Lauri J; Krieg, Jordan; Wilmerding, Lucius; Koski, Dee M; Kobayashi, Naoharu; Dao, Joan; Blumenfeld, Madeline; Filip, Pavel; Min, Hoon-Ki; Mangia, Silvia; Johnson, Matthew D; Michaeli, Shalom",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916285/,521

Factors of primary curative resection are available and potential in the prognosis of follow-up treatment. Our aim was to assess the prognostic significance of primary curative resection factors in recurrent HCC patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA). Methods In this retrospective study, we assessed 235 patients who underwent limited RFA of HCC recurrences (tumors ≤ 5 cm; nodules ≤ 3) after primary curative resection. Factors of primary curative resection were collected, and overall survival and recurrence-free survival were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify significant prognostic factors. Results After a median follow-up of 36 months, 54 patients died, and 128 patients had hepatic recurrence. On univariate analyses, patients whose primary tumors were less differentiated (p = 0.032 and p = 0.048) and required less time to recur (p = 0.013 and p = 0.001) after curative resection displayed poorer overall survival and higher recurrence rates following RFA. On multivariate analyses, the pathologic tumor grade (p = 0.026 and p = 0.038) and recurrence-free survival after primary curative resection (p = 0.028 and p < 0.001) emerged as independent risk factors of survival and HCC recurrence. Conclusions Primary tumor differentiation and time to recurrence after curative resection are viable prognostic factors of overall survival and further recurrence risk in patients undergoing RFA of recurrent HCC.","Ma, Hui; Li, Zhongchen; Yuan, Jia; Zhang, Lan; Xie, Xiaoying; Yin, Xin; Chen, Rongxin; Ren, Zhenggang",Gastroenterology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8878417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488700/,521

However, serum and lung biomarkers that can predict RPILD development remain unclear. OBJECTIVES To determine potential serum and lung biomarkers that can predict RPILD development in patients with PM/DM-ILD. METHODS In total, 49 patients with PM/DM-ILD were enrolled. We measured the serum levels of 41 cytokines/chemokines, ferritin and anti-MDA5 antibody, compared them between the RPILD (n = 23) and non-RPILD (n = 26) groups, and ranked them by their importance through random forest analysis. To distinguish the two groups, we determined biomarker combinations by logistic regression analysis. We also measured the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of 41 cytokines/chemokines. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined IL-15 expression in lung tissues. The IL-15 production was also investigated using A549 and BEAS-2B cells. RESULTS The RPILD group had significantly higher IL-15, IL-1RA, IL-6, CXCL10, VCAM-1, anti-MDA5 antibody and ferritin serum levels than the non-RPILD group, but it had a significantly low CCL22 level. Meanwhile, anti-MDA5 antibody, IL-15, CXCL8, CCL22, IL-1RA and ferritin were the best combination to distinguish the two groups. IL-15 and CCL22 were also predictive marker for RPILD development in anti-MDA5 antibody-positive patients. Additionally, the RPILD group had significantly high IL-15 levels in BALF. The lung tissues expressed IL-15, which increased after cytokine stimulation in the A549 cells. CONCLUSION This study identified a combination of biomarkers predicting PM/DM-RPILD progression, and IL-15 is an important cytokine for predicting RPILD development and reflecting ILD severity.","Shimizu, T; Koga, T; Furukawa, K; Horai, Y; Fujikawa, K; Okada, A; Okamoto, M; Endo, Y; Tsuji, S; Takatani, A; Umeda, M; Fukui, S; Sumiyoshi, R; Kawashiri, S-Y; Iwamoto, N; Igawa, T; Ichinose, K; Tamai, M; Sakamoto, N; Nakamura, H; Origuchi, T; Mukae, H; Kuwana, M; Kawakami, A",Journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691471/,521

In this study, we compared the incidence curves of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths in different countries and reported the classification of SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in our institute, as well as the kinetics and sources of the infections. We used mortality collected from a COVID-19 data repository for 221 countries. Viral variants were defined based on [≥]5 hallmark mutations shared by [≥]30 genomes. SARS-CoV-2 genotype was determined for 24,181 patients using next-generation genome and gene sequencing (in 47% and 11% of cases, respectively) or variant-specific qPCR (in 42% of cases). Sixteen variants were identified by analysing viral genomes from 9,788 SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed patients. Our data show that since the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic episode in Marseille, importation through travel from abroad was documented for seven of the new variants. In addition, for the B.1.160 variant of Pangolin classification (a.k.a. Marseille-4), we suspect transmission from mink farms. In conclusion, we observed that the successive epidemic peaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections are not linked to rebounds of viral genotypes that are already present but to newly-introduced variants. We thus suggest that border control is the best mean of combating this type of introduction, and that intensive control of mink farms is also necessary to prevent the emergence of new variants generated in this animal reservoir.","Colson, P.; Fournier, P.-E.; Chaudet, H.; Delerce, J.; GIRAUD-GATINEAU, A.; HOUHAMDI, L.; ANDRIEU, C.; BRECHARD, L.; BEDOTTO, M.; PRUDENT, E.; GAZIN, C.; BEYE, M.; BUREL, E.; DUDOUET, P.; TISSOT-DUPONT, H.; GAUTRET, P.; LAGIER, J.-C.; MILLION, M.; BROUQUI, P.; Parola, P.; Drancourt, M.; LA SCOLA, B.; LEVASSEUR, A.; Raoult, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.10.21262922v1?rss=1,521

The chapter asks, how do we understand the experience of interruption and amplified displacement arising from locative, temporal and social breakage experienced during stoppages of movement which we might conceptualise as immobile socialities? How do we understand what happens to sociality when movement and close contact between people is regulated and curtailed as in the 2020 COVID 19 lockdowns, as result of protests and blockades or as a result of police or security checkpoints? Two main ideas are suggested: the idea of a ‘respiratory ontology’ to suggest how mobility and immobility, sociality and antisociality give life to each other, and secondly, as part of this, the idea of radical antisociality. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Annette Hill, Maren Hartmann and Magnus Andersson.","Reading, A.",The Routledge Handbook of Mobile Socialities,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003089872-25,521
183191,MIDDLE EAST RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS (MERS-COV) – THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA,2019-11-11,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) offers localized and minimally invasive treatment of small-to-medium sized inoperable tumors. In RFA, tissue is ablated with high temperatures obtained from electrodes (needles) inserted percutaneously or via an open surgery into the target. RFA treatments are generally not planned in a systematic way, and do not account for nearby organs-at-risk (OARs), potentially leading to sub-optimal treatments and inconsistent treatment quality. We therefore develop a mathematical framework to design RFA treatment plans that provide complete ablation while minimizing healthy tissue damage. Borrowing techniques from radiosurgery inverse planning, we design a two-stage approach where we first identify needle positions and orientations, called needle orientation optimization, and then compute the treatment time for optimal thermal dose delivery, called thermal dose optimization. Several different damage models are used to determine both target and OAR damage. We present numerical results on three clinical case studies. Our findings indicate a need for high source voltage for short tip length (conducting portion of the needle) or fewer needles, and low source voltage for long tip length or more needles to achieve full coverage. Further, more needles yields a larger ablation volume and consequently more OAR damage. Finally, the choice of damage model impacts the source voltage, tip length, and needle quantity.","Aleman, D.

Distance rules and the constant threat of a partial or complete lockdown leading to limited access to classroom equipment make it challenging to plan for hands-on education where students experience robotics by experimenting and studying with robotic hardware. On the other hand, this hands-on active learning experience is one of the strengths of robotics education and the ability to handle hardware equipment a substantial learning goal of study programs on robotics. In this paper we present and discuss the approach taken for the course Robotics and Embedded Systems at Maastricht University. The course had been adjusted to meet COVID-19 safety regulations and to allow for a fast seamless transition between onsite education at university and online education where students can work with robotic hardware at home. We share experience, best practice advice as well as educational material to help other teachers benefit from our developments.

On Feb 20 and 21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in a location predicts life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon the existing chronic health issues and hours of exercise of the individuals. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epidemiologically, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","Zhang, Stephen X; Wang, Yifei; Rauch, Andreas; Wei, Feng",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20034496,521

Materials and Methods: The thorax CT examinations and RT-PCR test results were retrospectively evaluated in 177 children. According to the test results, the patients were divided into two groups as 'COVID-19-positive' and 'COVID-19-negative'. Results: In the COVID-19-positive group, 65.71% of the patients with a family history of COVID-19 (p&lt;0.01). In the same group, 50.00% of patients with normal CT findings were older than 16 years (p&lt;0.01), and single-lobe involvement was more common (54.54%, p&lt;0.01). The most observed CT finding was consolidation with ground-glass opacities (GGO) in both groups. Fibrotic bands (51.46%, p&lt;0.01), reticular pattern (34.95%, p&lt;0.01), atelectasis (9.71%, p&lt;0.01), mosaic perfusion (26.21%, p&lt;0.01), and pleural effusion (19.42%, p&lt;0.01) were mostly seen in the COVID-19-negative group. In patients with underlying diseases, the sensitivity values were calculated as 0.441 for CT and 0.863 for the RT-PCR test. Conclusion: In patients with a family history of COVID-19, the chest CT showed focal GGO with or without consolidation as the most common finding. If CT findings diffuse and severe, the patient most likely does not have COVID-19. The RT-PCR test results are more reliable than CT in children with underlying diseases. © 2021 Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University.","Ilıkan, G.

188852,Middle East respiratory syndrome novel corona MERS-CoV infection. Epidemiology and outcome update.,2013,"It has been shown previously that an avirulent Semliki Forest virus (SFV) clone, rA774, engineered to carry the nsP3 gene of the virulent clone SFV4 becomes highly neurovirulent and is lethal for adult BALB/c mice. rA774, like several other alphaviruses, has an opal termination codon close to the 5' end of nsP3 (aa 469), while SFV4 has an arginine residue at this position. Mutation of the opal codon to an arginine residue increases the virulence of rA774 but does not reconstruct the severe neurovirulence of SFV4. Additionally, nsP3 amino acid sequences differ between these two strains by eight amino acids and by a deletion of seven amino acids in the C-terminal third of rA774 nsP3. This study shows that neurovirulence can be reconstituted gradually by exchanging individual amino acids and is fully retained when combinations of two nsP3 mutations, V(11)-->I and L(201)-->F, V(11)-->I and D(249)-->N, A(48)-->E and G(70)-->A or T(435)-->A and F(442)-->L, are introduced into an rA774 derivative carrying R(469). The critical role of the arginine codon for neurovirulence was confirmed further by the acquisition of a fully lethal phenotype following the introduction of R(469) into a moderately virulent rA774 recombinant carrying the SFV4 nsP1 and nsP2 genes. In conclusion, virulence determinants in SFV are distributed over a wide region of the nonstructural genes.","Tuittila, Minna; Hinkkanen, Ari E",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12771422/,521
189637,Design of potential RNAi (miRNA and siRNA) molecules for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) gene silencing by computational method.,2014,"After influenza infection, C57BL/6J mice develop increased slow-wave sleep (SWS) during the dark phase of the day-night cycle, whereas BALB/cByJ mice develop decreased SWS during the light phase. A previous analysis of CXB recombinant inbred mice revealed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) designated Srilp (sleep response to influenza, light phase) that was related to expression of the BALB/cByJ sleep phenotype. Srilp was localized to the 10- to 12-cM region of mouse Chr 6 between D6Mit74 and D6Mit188. Temt (thioether S-methyltransferase), which is located at region B3 of Chr 6, is a potential candidate gene for Srilp. We evaluated the expression of Temt and other Srilp candidate genes in hypothalamus and basal forebrain of uninfected and influenza-infected C57BL/6J and BALB/cByJ mice. We report here that Temt expression varies significantly with respect to mouse strain, health status, brain region, and day-night phase. C57BL/6J mice show day-night variation in Temt expression in hypothalamus, but BALB/cByJ mice do not. Temt expression in basal forebrain is much higher in C57BL/6J mice than in BALB/cByJ mice. During influenza infection, both C57BL/6J and BALB/cByJ mice show reduced Temt mRNA in basal forebrain at 30 h postinoculation, but expression remains much lower in the BALB/cByJ strain. In contrast, prostaglandin-D-synthase (Ptgds) and lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) mRNA increase in basal forebrain of both strains after influenza infection. Administration of the TEMT inhibitor sinefungin reduces sleep in uninfected BALB/cByJ mice and attenuates influenza-induced sleep enhancement in C57BL/6J mice. These data suggest that strain- and infection-related alterations in sleep may be influenced by Temt expression and perhaps by subsequent effects on prostaglandin metabolism.","Ding, Ming; Toth, Linda A",Physiological genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16403846/,521

METHODS: Two health centers at 2 campuses of a large California corporation have chiropractic care integrated into physical medicine services. Care was suspended beginning on March 17, 2020 to prevent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among patients and staff. On March 19, the Governor of California issued a stay at home order. With musculoskeletal problems being common in the employee patient population, telehealth services were quickly developed to continue chiropractic care for patients. Using existing infrastructure, several members of the health center team developed chiropractic telehealth operations within 2 days. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal telehealth services included examinations, risk assessment, advice, and rehabilitative exercises. These telehealth visits facilitated care that would have otherwise been unavailable to employees. Patients reported that the appointments were helpful, addressed their concerns, and provided a safe method to see their doctor. Regular interprofessional teamwork and relations between the clinic operator and client company were key contributors to operationalizing this service in our integrated healthcare environment. CONCLUSION: We were able to quickly implement real time video conferencing and other forms of telehealth for chiropractic services at 2 worksite health centers. This paper includes information and insights to providers about setting up similar telehealth systems so they may also provide this benefit for patients in their communities during pandemics or disasters.","Green, Bart N; Pence, Ti V; Kwan, Lawrence; Rokicki-Parashar, Jesse",J Manipulative Physiol Ther,,521

This single-center retrospective survey included all patients with STEMI admitted to our CPC from January 22, 2020 to April 30, 2020 (during COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan), compared with those admitted during the analogous period in 2019, in respect of important time points of PPCI and clinical outcomes of STEMI patients. In the present article, we observed a descending trend in STEMI hospitalization and a longer time from symptom onset to first medical contact during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the control period (4.35 h versus 2.58 h). With a median delay of 17 minutes in the door to balloon time (D2B), the proportion of in-hospital cardiogenic shock was significantly higher in the COVID-19 era group (47.6% versus 19.5%), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) tend to increase in the 6-month follow-up period (14.3% versus 2.4%). Although the reorganization of CPC may prolong the D2B time, immediate revascularization of the infarct-related artery could be offered to most patients within 90 minutes upon arrival.

METHODS: We recruited 4909 participants through an online survey advertising on Facebook and Instagram to assess exposure to COVID-19 and psychiatric symptoms from April 27 to July 13. We also recruited through the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and other health care systems around Pittsburgh. The primary outcomes were clinically significant depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, suicidal ideation or behavior, and grief reactions since COVID-19. RESULTS: Adolescents were significantly more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression (55% vs. 29%; &#967;2 = 122, df = 1; p < .001), anxiety (48% vs. 29%; &#967;2 = 73; df = 1; p < .001), PTSD (45% vs. 33%; &#967;2 = 12; df = 1; p < .001), suicidal ideation or behavior (38% vs. 16%; &#967;2 = 117; df = 1; p < .001), and sleep problems (69% vs. 57%; &#967;2 = 26; df = 1; p < .001) compared to adults. The rates of intense grief reactions among those who lost someone to COVID-19 was 55%. Loneliness was the most common predictor across outcomes and higher number of hours spent on social media and exposure to media about COVID-19 predicted depression symptoms and suicidal ideation or behavior in adolescents.

To date, the feasibility of an outpatient program for people recovering from COVID-19 has not been investigated. This study presents data for a physiotherapy-led, comprehensive outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Patients were recruited after hospital discharge. Training consisted of twice weekly, interval-based aerobic cycle endurance (ACE) training, followed by resistance training (RT); 60-90 min per session at intensities of 50% peak work rate; education and physical activity coaching were also provided. Feasibility outcomes included: recruitment and dropout rates, number of training sessions undertaken, and tolerability for dose and training mode. Of the 65 patients discharged home during the study period, 12 were successfully enrolled onto the program. Three dropouts (25%) were reported after 11-19 sessions. Tolerability of interval-based training was 83% and 100% for exercise duration of ACE and RT, respectively; 92% for training intensity, 83% progressive increase of intensity, and 83% mode in ACE. We tentatively suggest from these preliminary findings that the PR protocol used may be both feasible, and confer benefits to a small subgroup of patients recovering from COVID-19.","Betschart, Martina; Rezek, Spencer; Unger, Ines; Beyer, Swantje; Gisi, David; Shannon, Harriet; Sieber, Cornel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,521

Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. The survey was anonymous and a free Google Forms® software was used. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey. Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 &#8805; 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs. 79.2%, p=.025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs. 19.8%, p=.024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs. 23.8%, p=.049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 ± 27.30 vs. 9.52 ± 11.75, p=.041).

A common approach to developing new immunoassays is to modify existing platforms (e.g., automated ELISA and lateral flow assays) for the new analyte, even though this does not address the drawbacks of existing platforms. An alternate approach is to search for robust assays that have been superseded but could in fact solve important challenges using modern technologies.

Herein, we investigate the microstructure of these precipitin rings using a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy and also perform a mass spectrometry investigation to determine the proteomic composition of the rings. We observed that the rings were composed of microparticles, which we termed ""precipitin complexes"", and that these complexes were composed of at least 19 key proteins, including immunoglobulins and complement factors along with a range of plasma proteins, possibly related to immune complexes and/or high-density lipoprotein particles.

The mechanisms include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, reduction of neurotrophic factors, insulin resistance, excessive amyloid beta (Aß) deposition and Tau phosphorylation. Both antidiabetic and neuroprotective effects of the phytoestrogen genistein have been reported. However, the beneficial effect of genistein in brain of the ob/ob mouse model of severe obesity and diabetes remains to be determined. Methods: In this study, female ob/ob mice and lean control mice were fed with either a standard diet or a diet containing genistein (600mg/kg) for a period of 4 weeks. Body weight was monitored weekly. Blood was collected for the measurement of glucose, insulin and common cytokines. Mice brains were isolated for Western immunoblotting analyses. Results: Treatment with genistein reduced weight gain of ob/ob mice and decreased hyperglycemia compared to ob/ob mice fed the standard diet. The main findings show that genistein treatment increased insulin sensitivity and the expression levels of the neurotrophic factors nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF). In these mice, genistein also reduced Aß deposition and the level of hyper-phosphorylated Tau protein. Conclusion: The results of our study indicate the beneficial effects of genistein in the obese diabetic mouse brain, including improving brain insulin signaling, increasing neurotrophic support, and alleviating Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.","Li, Rong-Zi; Ding, Xiao-Wen; Geetha, Thangiah; Al-Nakkash, Layla; Broderick, Tom L; Babu, Jeganathan Ramesh",Drug Des Devel Ther,,521

590117,Unfolded Protein Response Inhibition Reduces Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-Induced Acute Lung Injury,2021-08-10,"Viral entry mechanisms for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an important aspect of virulence. Proposed mechanisms involve host cell membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), such as transmembrane serine protease isoform 2 (TMPRSS2), lysosomal endopeptidase Cathepsin L (CTSL), subtilisin-like proprotein peptidase furin (FURIN), and even potentially membrane bound heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The distribution and expression of many of these genes across cell types representing multiple organ systems in healthy individuals has recently been demonstrated. However, comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with worse outcomes. Whether these conditions contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remains unclear. Here, we show that the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other viral entry-related genes, as well as potential downstream effector genes such as bradykinin receptors, are modulated in the target organs of select disease states. In tissues, such as the heart, which normally express ACE2 but minimal TMPRSS2, we found that TMPRSS2 as well as other TTSPs are elevated in individuals with comorbidities compared to healthy individuals. Additionally, we found the increased expression of viral entry-related genes in the settings of hypertension, cancer, or smoking across target organ systems. Our results demonstrate that common comorbidities may contribute directly to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and we suggest new therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in vulnerable patient populations.","Breidenbach, Joshua D.; Dube, Prabhatchandra; Ghosh, Subhanwita; Abdullah, Belal N.; Modyanov, Nikolai N.; Malhotra, Deepak; Dworkin, Lance D.; Haller, Steven T.; Kennedy, David J.",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992731/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm10040146,521

Many people worldwide have died or hospitalised due to the severe impact of COVID-19 on the vulnerable population, and in particular to the elderly residents of long term care facilities (LTCF). The problem is amplified due to the fact that many of those occupants also suffer from comorbidities (e.g. respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, etc.) and are therefore regarded as a susceptible host to severe COVID-19 disease. Impacts can be felt in the wider societal safety level. The aim of the present study is, therefore, to present the first National multimodal quality and safety improvement strategy plan for the LTCF in the Republic of Cyprus. The current program focused on the intensification of COVID-19 epidemiological surveillance, the promotion of educational training on best practises in infection control and prevention, and the implementation of additional non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), according to the recommendations of ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and WHO (World Health Organization). This innovative program fostered the interconnectivity and collaboration among the local authorities, academia and the local leaders of the LTCF. In addition, this program reinforced the importance of volunteerism and active participation of medical students in the National initiatives against the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of the adopted multimodal advanced care-safety planning program is appraised based on the reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases among LTCF healthcare workers and occupants, after the introducing and implementation of the selected NPIs. This multimodal strategy plan seems to be capable of reducing significantly the number of new cases of COVID-19 infections in LTCF and as a result, to also affect the residents’ death number.","Vogazianos, Paris; Argyropoulos, Christos D.; Haralambous, Christos; Varianou Mikellidou, Cleo; Boustras, George; Andreou, Michalis; Silvestros, Valentinos; Theofanous, Fani; Soteriou, Soteroulla; Gregoriou, Ioanna; Jaber Apostolidou, Andri; Demetriou, Anna; Athanasiadou, Maria; Stylianou, Carolina; Michael, Maria; Herodotou, Herodotos; Alexandrou, Denise; Kalakouta, Olga; Dorothea Pana, Zoi",Saf Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305320/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753521002599?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0925753521002599; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105415,521

That provides a precious window to study how the air quality response to quick decline of anthropogenic emissions in terms of national scale, which would be critical basis to make atmospheric governance policies in the future. In this work, we utilized observations from both remote sensing and in-situ measurements to investigate impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on different air pollutions in different regions of China. It is witnessed that the PM2.5 concentrations exhibited distinct trends in different regions, despite of plunges of NO2 concentrations over the whole country. The steady HCHO concentration in urban area provides sufficient fuels for generations of tropospheric O3, leading to high concentrations of O3, especially when there is not enough NO to consume O3 via the titration effect. Moreover, the SO2 concentration kept steady at a low level regardless of cities. As a conclusion, the COVID-19 lockdown indeed helped reduce NO2 concentration. However, the atmospheric quality in urban areas of China has not improved overall due to lockdown measures. It underscores the significance of comprehensive control of atmospheric pollutants in cleaning air. Reducing VOCs (volatile organic compounds) concentrations in urban areas would be a critical mission for better air quality in the future.","Pei, Zhipeng; Han, Ge; Ma, Xin; Su, Hang; Gong, Wei",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720344089; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140879; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720344089?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758857/,521

Significantly fewer patients presented with macula-on RRD in the 2020 cohort (20/82 patients, 24.4%) than in 2019 (55/111 patients, 49.5%, p = 0.001). Patients in the 2020 cohort had worse median VA at presentation (LogMAR 1.00, Snellen 20/200 in 2020 versus LogMAR 0.48, Snellen 20/60 in 2019, p = 0.008), fewer patients presenting within one day of symptoms (16/80 patients [19.5%] in 2020 versus 41/106 patients [36.9%] in 2019, p = 0.005), and a greater proportion with primary PVR (11/82 patients [13.4%] in 2020 versus 5/111 patients [4.5%] in 2019, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, younger age (p = 0.03) and established patient status (p = 0.02) were independent predictors of macula-on status in the 2020 cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with primary RRD during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to be macula-on and more likely to have delayed presentation, worse vision, and PVR.","Patel, Luv G.; Peck, Travis; Starr, Matthew R.; Ammar, Michael J.; Khan, M.

RNA extraction step constitutes a major bottleneck to perform diagnostic. The aim of this study was to assess performances of different extraction-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays compared to a reference RT-PCR assay. The panel of evaluation consisted of 94 samples: 69 positive and 25 negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reference RT-PCR. Three extraction-free RT-PCR assays were assessed: (i) PrimeDirect® Probe RT-qPCR Mix (Takara), (ii) PrimeScript®RT-PCR (Takara), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 SANSURE®BIOTECH Novel Coronavirus (Sansure). The overall sensitivity of PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays was 55.1 %, 69.6 % and 69.6 %, respectively. The sensitivity increased among samples with Ct<30: 91.9 % (n = 34/37), 89.2 % (n = 33/37) and 94.6 % (n = 35/37) for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively. The specificity was 88 %, 100 % and 100 % for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively. In the present study, we showed a good sensitivity of extraction-free PCR assays, especially for high viral loads (Ct<30), except PrimeDirect that displayed imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Despite a lower sensitivity for low viral loads, extraction-free reagents can provide a valuable option, cheaper, easier and less reagent consuming for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, especially in laboratory with lower experience and equipment for molecular assays.","Visseaux, Benoit; Collin, Gilles; Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Ferré, Valentine Marie; Damond, Florence; Ichou, Houria; Descamps, Diane; Charpentier, Charlotte",J Virol Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577957/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093421000252?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114086; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093421000252,521

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare differences in stigma experiences of COVID-19 survivors versus healthy controls after the COVID-19 outbreak peak in China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised 154 COVID-19 survivors and 194 healthy controls recruited through consecutive and convenience sampling methods, respectively. COVID-19 related stigma was measured by the Social Impact Scale (SIS). Stigma differences between the two groups were compared with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify independent correlates of COVID-19-related stigma in this study. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, COVID-19 survivors reported more overall stigma (F((1,347)) = 60.82, p < 0.001), and stigma in domains of social rejection (F((1,347)) = 56.54, p < 0.001), financial insecurity (F((1,347)) = 19.96, p < 0.001), internalized shame (F((1,347)) = 71.40, p < 0.001) and social isolation (F((1,347)) = 34.73, p < 0.001). Status as a COVID-19 survivor, having family members infected with COVID-19, being married, economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with higher overall stigma levels (all p values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related stigma is commonly experienced among COVID-19 survivors even though the outbreak has been well-contained in China. Routine assessment of stigma experiences should be conducted on COVID-19 survivors and appropriate psychological assistance, public education, and anti-stigma campaigns and policies should be enforced to reduce stigma within this vulnerable subpopulation.","Yuan, Yuan; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qing-E; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Jackson, Todd; Jiang, Guo-Qing; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962651/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00705-4,521
606456,Stillbirth During Infection With Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2014-01-28,"Camptothetin (CPT) is a quinoline alkaloid originally isolated from the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata Decne. CPT was found to have anticancerous and antiviral properties. Derivatives of natural CPT, including toptecan and irinotecan are used clinically to treat a variety of cancers. Apart from Camptotheca acuminata Decne, CPT production was also found in the perennial plant Ophiorrhiza mungos. In this study we attempted the immobilization of the tissue culture grown callus of Ophiorrhiza mungos for the continuous production of a higher concentration of CPT. As evident from previous studies about the antiviral effects of CPT, we wanted to bioinformatically analyze the binding potential of CPT towards two important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, protease (M(pro)) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Further docking analysis of the CPT against the exterior spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was also done to determine their potential interaction. The immobilized callus of Ophiorrhiza mungos produced CPT at a concentration of 420 µg/l by the end of 12 days of growth. The HPLC analysis was done to determine the purity of the CPT synthesized by the immobilization technique. The bioinformatic analysis revealed a higher binding efficiency of CPT and its derivatives, toptecan and irinotecan against M(pro) and RdRp. The docking analysis of CPT against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 showed hydrogen bonding with the amino acids at K466 with a bond distance of 2.56A° and K355 with a bond distance of 2.40A°. This finding was of particular importance that other compounds including hydroxychloroquine sulphate, lopinavir and ivermectin could bind with the spike protein only by weak Vander wall bonds and no hydrogen bond formation was noticed. Our studies hence evaluate the efficiency of CPT against SARS-CoV-2, by potentially blocking the interaction of the spike glycoprotein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor found on host cells.","Mamkulatil Devasia, Rajesh; Altaf, Mohammad; Fahad Alrefaei, Abdulwahed; Manoharadas, Salim",J King Saud Univ Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531790/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1018364721000057; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018364721000057?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101344,521

When returning to the dental practice or training, staff and students alike should abide by the new rules and regulations. In the process of controlling viral spread, clinical dental facilities face a higher risk of disease transmission among patients as well as clinical and non-clinical staff. Aerosols formation and diffusion into the surrounding air can be a real concern of viral transmission, if no protective measures are established. We aim in this review to present the currently implemented measures and propose changes in clinical dental facilities to minimize the risk of transmission. Dental professionals should be prepared to treat every patient as a suspected COVID-19 carrier and be ready to receive and manage an overwhelming number of patients. We suggest that dental practices establish a sensible workforce shift schedule, improve ventilation levels, reduce dental aerosol generating procedures, and develop a comprehensive guidance to Healthcare Workers to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Al Kawas, Sausan; Al-Rawi, Natheer; Talaat, Wael; Hamdoon, Zaid; Salman, Basheer; Al Bayatti, Saad; Jerjes, Waseem; Samsudin, A.

During the onset of a novel epidemic, there are public health priorities that need to be estimated, such as risk factors for infection, hospitalization, and clinical severity to allocate resources and issue health policies. In this work we calculate the risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19 conferred by demographic, lifestyle, and co-morbidity factors. Material and methods. This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects). Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure (HBP), asthma, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease other than HBP, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. The risk of infection and hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Results. The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are protective factors against infection, while suffering from COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in [≥] 70 years-old) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in Juarez City). Unlike the protective risk against infection, immunosuppression (OR=2.69) and COPD (OR=3.63), contribute to the risk of being hospitalized, while having asthma (OR=0.7) also provides protection against hospitalization. Conclusions. In addition to confirming that older age, diabetes, HBP and obesity are the main risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19, we found that being indigenous, immunosuppression, smoking and asthma protect against infection, and the latter also against hospitalization.","Berumen, J.; Schmulson, M.; Alegre, J.; Guerrero, G.; Olaiz, G.; Wong-Chew, R.

This study aims to examine the ruminative thinking and alexithymia levels of people in the COVID-19 pandemic process. METHODS The descriptive, cross-sectional, and the correlational designed study was conducted with 852 people in ?stanbul\Turkey during the COVID-19 pandemic process between March and May 2020. The data of the research was collected with the Sociodemographic Form Toronto Alexithymia Scale and Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire. RESULTS It was found that the average of ruminative thought score of the people was 92.49±19.89 and the alexithymia score average was 71.76±13.70. A positive and significant relationship was found between the Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and subscale scores (p<0.05). According to the results, ruminative thinking levels were affected by 12% alexithymia level and 9% time spent on conversation. A statistically significant relationship was found between rumination, alexithymia, and its sub-dimensions and the number of times people spend for conversation during the day and the number of people they live with (p<0.05). It was determined that those living with family/friends were lower than those who were alone, and those with good communication in relationships had lower rumination and alexithymia (p<0.05). CONCLUSION Care should be taken against alexithymia and rumination during the COVID-19 pandemic process, and attention should be given to interpersonal relationships, conversation, and communication in the quarantine process.","Ayaz, Elif Yıldırım; Dincer, Berna",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185756/; https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2021.240,521

Cancer mortality rates in Africa are substantially higher than those of the rest of the world, which may be partly attributed to lack of RT access and insufficient human resources. The Access to Care (A2C) Cape Town RT training programme was created in 2014 with the aim of supplementing practical RT training in the region, focusing on clinics moving from 2 to 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). The programme makes use of hybrid teaching methods, including pre-course e-learning followed by 17 on-site days of free-thinking design exercises, didactic learning, hands-on treatment planning computer sessions (39% of total teaching time), virtual simulation training and departmental demonstration sessions. Email support is offered to all teams for 3 months after each course to develop clinical protocols. Thirteen teams (radiation oncologist, medical physicist and radiation therapy technologist) from Africa attended the course between 2015 and 2019, with additional participants from seven South African and four international centres. E-learning done on the LäraNära training platform was only successful once formal progress tracking was introduced in 2019 (34% vs. 76% test completion rate). Delays between course attendance and initial clinical use of equipment proved to be detrimental to knowledge retention, with some centres having to send a second team for training. The course will be modified for remote teaching in 2021, to make provision for the global changes in travel due to Covid-19.","Burger, Hester; Wyrley-Birch, Bridget; Joubert, Nanette; Trauernicht, Christoph Jan; Valentim, Jose-Manuel; Groll, Jens; Berz, Stefan; Vowles, Natalia; Parkes, Jeannette",J Cancer Educ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-021-02010-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928527/,521

We evaluated the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infection compared to RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab alone in patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 324 consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital. All hospitalized patients who had RT-PCR testing and HRCT were included in the study. HRCTs were classified as Category 1, 2 or 3. Patients were then divided into four groups based on HRCT category and RT-PCR swab results for analysis. Results: The average age of patients was 59.4 (+15.2) years and 123 (38.9%) were female. Predominant ethnicity was African American 148 (46.11%). 161 patients tested positive by RT-PCR, while 41 tested positive by HRCT. 167 (52.02%) had category 1 scan, 63 (19.63%) had category 2 scan and 91 (28.35%) had category 3 HRCT scans. There was substantial agreement between our radiologists for HRCT classification ({kappa} = 0.64). Sensitivity and specificity of HRCT classification system was 77.6 and 73.7 respectively. Ferritin, LDH, AST and ALT were higher in Group 1 and D-dimers levels was higher in Group 3; differences however were not statistically significant.

The combination of an exceptionally large single payment and the life-long clinical follow-up needed for understanding the long-term benefits and safety of gene therapy, represent new types of scientific, financial, social and ethical challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, regulators and society. With special consideration of the uniqueness and importance of gene therapy, the authors propose a three points plan for a close cooperation between the pharmaceutical industry and society to develop orphan gene therapy. (1) In fully transparent health technology negotiations a close and long-lasting, contractually fixed cooperation should be established between the manufacturers and local health-care stakeholders for sharing the medical and scientific benefits, the financial risks as well as the burdens of the post-authorization clinical and regulatory development. (2) The parties should agree on a fair, locally affordable drug price without the usually very high premium price calculated to compensate for the low number of patients. In case of high manufacturing costs, the companies should offer prolonged, 15–20 years long payment by installment with risk-sharing, especially considering that the late outcome of the treatment is unknown. Society should assist scientifically and financially organizing a specific patient registry, treatment in specialized hospitals and adequate long-term follow-up of patients, the coordinated management of financial transactions related to the risk sharing program. (3) The post-authorization treatment and prolonged observation of additional new cases coordinated by society should provide real world data needed for the modern complex regulatory evaluation of gene therapy products by the competent authorities. We assume that fair sharing of the benefits and risks as well as a well-organized cooperation of society with the industry in collecting real world evidence might result in better drug evaluation and improved accessibility due to lower prices. The outlined concept might support gene therapy more efficiently than the presently requested outstandingly high prices.","Kerpel-Fronius, Sandor; Baroutsou, Varvara; Becker, Sander; Carlesi, Roberto; Collia, Luis; Franke-Bray, Brigitte; Kleist, Peter; Kurihara, Chieko; Laranjeira, Luis Filipe; Matsuyama, Kotone; Naseem, Shehla; Schenk, Johanna; Silva, Honorio",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.608249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425952/,521

A molecular characterization of nine monoclonal antibodies raised in immune mice, using highly purified, inactivated SARS-CoV as the inoculating antigen, is presented in this report. These antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets, and six of them are able to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV in vitro, including one with a neutralizing titre of 0.075 nM. A phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals that the mAbs share considerable homology. The majority of the heavy chains belong to a single Ig germline V-gene family, while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences. These analyses demonstrate that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine V(H)-gene alleles. For instance, one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the V(H) chains of the neutralizing mAbs, particularly in CDR-1 and CDR-2. The results suggest that optimization of murine mAbs for neutralization of SARS-CoV infection will likely be possible, and will aid in the development of diagnostic tools and passive treatments for SARS-CoV infection.","Gubbins, Michael J.; Plummer, Frank A.; Yuan, Xin Y.; Johnstone, Darrell; Drebot, Mike; Andonova, Maya; Andonov, Anton; Berry, Jody D.",Mol Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589004002548; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589004002548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488951/,521

According to the China Statistical Yearbook and China Center for Disease Control records, regional, pathological, medical and response attributes were selected as regional vulnerability factors of infectious diseases. Then the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to build a regional vulnerability index model for the infectious disease. The influence of the COVID-19 outbreak at a certain place was assessed computationally in terms of the number of days of epidemic duration and cumulative number of infections, and then fitted to the city data. The resulting correlation coefficient was 0.999952. The range of the regional vulnerability index for COVID-19 virus was from 0.0513 to 0.9379. The vulnerability indexes of Wuhan, Urumqi, Beijing and Dalian were 0.8733, 0.1951, 0.1566 and 0.1119, respectively. The lack of understanding of the virus became the biggest breakthrough point for the rapid spread of the virus in Wuhan. Due to inadequate prevention and control measures, the city of Urumqi was unable to trace the source of infection and close contacts, resulting in a relatively large impact. Beijing has both high population density and migration rate, which imply that the disease outbreak in this city had a great impact. Dalian has perfect prevention and good regional attributes. In addition, the regional vulnerability index model was used to analyze other Chinese cities. Accordingly, the regional vulnerability index and the prevention and control suggestions for them were discussed.

627333,Biochemical Characterization of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Helicase,2016-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the mental health of the people all around the world is severely disrupted. AIM: The purpose of this study is to identify whether ‘Fear of COVID-19’ impacted on future workforces’ career anxiety at the first place and whether depression from COVID-19 has any indirect effect on ‘Fear of COVID-19’ and future workforces’ career anxiety. METHOD: Based on three different scales related to ‘Fear of COVID-19’, depression and career anxiety, a structured questionnaire was developed and the survey data was collected for this study. RESULTS: The empirical result of the study reveals that, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 fear, the future workforce is getting anxious about their future career. Again, depression from COVID-19, caused by ‘Fear of COVID-19’, as a mediator, has a significant indirect impact on the relationship between ‘Fear of COVID-19’ and future career anxiety, resulting in a full mediation. This means, due to the outbreak of ‘Fear of COVID-19’ people are becoming depressed and anxious about their future career which is creating a long-term negative effect on human psychology. CONCLUSION: These research findings will be a major tool for the policymakers, as well as the human resource planning professionals, to sketch plans after COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a novel work combining the concepts of fear and depression with career anxiety in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, and also assists future researchers in many folds.","Mahmud, Md.

To break the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2, public health safety measures such as social distancing, regular hand hygiene, border closure, restrictions on internal movement, and lockdown were implemented. Some of these measures have however contributed to reduced economic power, shortage of labor for agricultural production, and huge losses in the agricultural sector. To avert the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food losses in the agricultural value chain in Nigeria, much precedence should be placed on adequate stakeholder engagement. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, logistics for unhindered agricultural trade should be put in place. In addition, policy makers should implement the institutionalization and implementation of social protection system in Nigeria.

Since the vaccination program targets girls age 9–13, the success of vaccination depends on the parental decision and their willingness to vaccinate their daughters. Therefore, a study on parental willingness to vaccinate their daughter and factors associated is needed. OBJECTIVE: To assess parent's willingness to vaccinate their daughter against the human papillomavirus and its associated factors in Bench-Sheko Zone, southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 502 participants in Bench-Sheko Zone, southwest Ethiopia. The participants were selected using a systematic random sampling method. Frequency tables, mean and standard deviation were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with parental willingness to vaccinate their daughter. The level of significance was declared at P-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 502 participants interviewed, 399 (79.5%), 95% CI (76%, 83%) of parents were willing to vaccinate their daughter. The study found that primary education and above (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI [1.79, 4.95]), having good knowledge (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI [1.15, 4.10]) and positive attitude (AOR = 2, 95% CI [1.30, 3.41]) were significantly associated with parental willingness to vaccinate their daughter. CONCLUSION: This study found that there was a high parental willingness to vaccinate their daughter against the human papillomavirus in the study area. Primary education and above, having good knowledge and positive attitude were factors associated with parental willingness to vaccinate their daughter. Therefore, providing health information's regarding human papillomavirus vaccination with emphasis to raise community awareness should be designed especially less educated parents need to be targeted.","Destaw, Alemnew; Yosef, Tewodros; Bogale, Biruk",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041397/,521

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We obtained monthly patterns of KD from the seventh nationwide survey and viral detection data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2011 and evaluated temporal correlations between them for each month. The respiratory viruses detected using a multiplex real-time-polymerase chain reaction kit were influenza virus (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, and B), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (type 1, 2, 3), respiratory syncytial virus (type A, B), human rhinovirus, human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63), human bocavirus, and enterovirus. RESULTS: We obtained data from a total of 13031 patients who were treated for acute KD from 87 hospitals with pediatric residence programs. During this survey, KD showed highest overall incidence in summer and winter seasons and lowest incidence in February and October. We received viral detection data for a total of 14267 patients. Viral detection was highest during winter and spring seasons. The most commonly detected virus was human rhinovirus (32.6%), followed by influenza virus (26.8%). The monthly incidence of KD showed significant correlation with the monthly overall viral detection (p=0.022, r=0.382). In particular, human bocavirus and enterovirus have significant correlations with monthly patterns of KD occurrence (p=0.032 and p=0.007, respectively) and influenza virus correlated with KD occurrence with borderline significance (p=0.063).

To assess potential risks from this pathway, there is a need for surrogates for SARS coronavirus to provide representative data on viral survival in contaminated water. This study evaluated survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV). These viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25 °C, time required for 99% reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. In pasteurized settled sewage, times for 99% reduction were 9 days for TGEV and 7 days for MHV. At 4 °C, there was <1 log(10) infectivity decrease for both viruses after four weeks. Coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated.","Casanova, Lisa; Rutala, William A.; Weber, David J.; Sobsey, Mark D.",Water Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135409000785; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2009.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19246070/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135409000785,521

All individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 s) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800(®) system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Of 76 individuals, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 of 76 (17%) infections, but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs.

Serology testing allows for the detection of asymptomatic infections and 19-COVID cases once the virus has been cleared. We analyzed the usefulness of the SARS-CoV-2 rapid test of Autobio and tried to correlate its pattern with the severity of COVID19 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the accuracy and clinical usefulness of a point-of-care IgM and/or IgG test for SARS-CoV-2 in 35 COVID-19 patients [12 (34.3%) mild-moderate and 23 (65.7%) severe-critical] admitted to a field hospital in Madrid, as well as in 5 controls. RESULTS: The mean time from the first day of symptoms to the antibody test was 28 days (SD: 8.7), similar according to the severity of the disease. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ showed the corresponding IgG positivity, while these results were negative in all control individuals. A total of 26 (74%) cases also presented with positive IgM, 19 (83%) were severe-critical cases and 7 (58%) were mild-moderate cases. The IgM response lasted longer in the severe critical cases (mean: 29.7 days; SD: 8.4) compared to the moderate cases (mean: 21.2 days; SD: 2.0).

Early prediction of progression to severe cases is needed. We retrospectively collected patients with COVID‐19 in two hospital of Chongqing from 1st January to 29th February 2020. At admission, we collected the demographics and laboratory tests to predict whether the patient would progress to severe cases in hospitalization. Severe case was confirmed when one of the following criteria occurred: (a) dyspnea, respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min, (b) blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, and (c) PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≤ 300 mm Hg. At admission, 348 mild cases were enrolled in this study. Of them, 20 (5.7%) patients progressed to severe cases after median 4.0 days (interquartile range: 2.3‐6.0). Pulmonary inflammation index, platelet counts, sodium, C‐reactive protein, prealbumin, and PaCO(2) showed good distinguishing power to predict progression to severe cases (each area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics [AUC] ≥ 0.8).

Pharyngeal-cervical-brachial (PCB) variant is an extremely rare variant of GBS (3%), which presents with muscle weakness initially involving the neck, oropharynx, and upper extremities. GBS often has an infectious inciting event leading to an autoimmune response. There has been an increase in the incidence of GBS during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several case studies have shown an association between the development of GBS and COVID-19 infection. High clinical suspicion is needed to reach a diagnosis. As PCB variant of GBS can have fatal outcomes, a good clinical knowledge of its presentation can allow timely life-saving interventions. Here, we report a case of GBS with acute onset of neck and respiratory muscle weakness that progressed to upper limb weakness. The patient developed these symptoms two weeks after the onset of cough, fever, and malaise.

658342,The influence of interferon-lambda on restricting Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus replication in the respiratory epithelium,2020-06-19,"Neurological symptoms are frequently reported in patients suffering from COVID‐19. Common CNS‐related symptoms include anosmia, caused by viral interaction with either neurons or supporting cells in nasal olfactory tissues. Diffuse encephalopathy is the most common sign of CNS dysfunction, which likely results from the CNS consequences of the systemic inflammatory syndrome associated with severe COVID‐19. Additionally, microvascular injuries and thromboembolic events likely contribute to the neurologic impact of acute COVID‐19. These observations are supported by evidence of CNS immune activation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in autopsy tissue, along with the detection of microvascular injuries in both pathological and neuroimaging studies. The frequent occurrence of thromboembolic events in patients with COVID‐19 has generated different hypotheses, among which viral interaction with perivascular cells is particularly attractive, yet unproven. A distinguishing feature of CSF findings in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is that clinical signs characteristic of neurotropic viral infections (CSF pleocytosis and blood–brain barrier injury) are mild or absent. Moreover, virus detection in CSF is rare and often of uncertain significance. In this review, we provide an overview of the neurological impact that occurs in the acute phase of COVID‐19, and the role of CSF biomarkers in the clinical management and research to better treat and understand the disease. In addition to aiding as diagnostic and prognostic tools during acute infection, the use of comprehensive and well‐characterized CSF and blood biomarkers will be vital in understanding the potential impact on the CNS in the rapidly increasing number of individuals recovering from COVID‐19.","Edén, Arvid; Simrén, Joel; Price, Richard W.; Zetterberg, Henrik; Gisslén, Magnus",J Neurochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170549/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15459,521
660051,Analysis of the codon usage pattern in Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2017-11-27,"The etiological agent for novel coronavirus (COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not only affects the human respiratory system, but also the gastrointestinal tract resulting in gastrointestinal manifestations. The high rate of asymptomatic infected individuals has challenged the estimation of infection spread based on patients’ surveillance, and thus alternative approaches such as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have been proposed. Accordingly, the number of publications on this topic has increased substantially. The present systematic review thus aimed at providing state-of-the-knowledge on the occurrence and existing methods for sampling procedures, detection/quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage samples, as well as anticipating challenges and providing future research direction to improve the current scientific knowledge. Articles were collected from three scientific databases. Only studies reporting measurements of virus in stool, urine, and wastewater samples were included. Results showed that improving the scientific community’s understanding in these avenues is essential if we are to develop appropriate policy and management tools to address this pandemic pointing particularly towards WBE as a new paradigm in public health. It was also evident that standardized protocols are needed to ensure reproducibility and comparability of outcomes. Areas that require the most improvements are sampling procedures, concentration/enrichment, detection, and quantification of virus in wastewater, as well as positive controls. Results also showed that selecting the most accurate population estimation method for WBE studies is still a challenge. While the number of people infected in an area could be approximately estimated based on quantities of virus found in wastewater, these estimates should be cross-checked by other sources of information to draw a more comprehensive conclusion. Finally, wastewater surveillance can be useful as an early warning tool, a management tool, and/or a way for investigating vaccination efficacy and spread of new variants.","Amereh, Fatemeh; Negahban-Azar, Masoud; Isazadeh, Siavash; Dabiri, Hossein; Masihi, Najmeh; Jahangiri-rad, Mahsa; Rafiee, Mohammad",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451410/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10080946,521

To overcome this challenge, increasing efforts have been driven towards the development of single-molecule analytical platforms. In this context, recent progress in plasmonic biosensing has enabled the design of novel detection strategies capable of targeting individual molecules while evaluating their binding affinity and biological interactions. This review compiles the latest advances in plasmonic technologies for monitoring clinically relevant biomarkers at the single-molecule level. Functional applications are discussed according to plasmonic sensing modes based on either nanoapertures or nanoparticle approaches. A special focus was devoted to new analytical developments involving a wide variety of analytes (e.g., proteins, living cells, nucleic acids and viruses). The utility of plasmonic-based single-molecule analysis for personalized medicine, considering technological limitations and future prospects, is also overviewed.","Mauriz, Elba; Lechuga, Laura M.",Biosensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bios11040123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921010/,521

The rampant spread of contagiosity has challenged the solidarity of the medical fraternity of the developed and developing world. The rising turmoil enforces to trudge with stoicism and expresses the need for planning because of subjugating the prevailing conditions with judicial channelization of available resources. In many developed and developing countries, the resources such as appropriate equipment as well as personnel have been extended to combat the pandemic substantially. At the same time, the populous country such as India has taken a stand to cancel electively planned orthopedic surgeries. However, under the issued guidelines of apex authorities, trauma and emergency services had have been in continuity with a reorganized manner. Hereby, we discuss the present shift in paradigm in the field of orthopedics with an interplay of regenerative orthopedics and telemedicine and its pivotal role against the odds of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, we see over the future perspectives and challenges in the purview of resorting to an effective clinical practice in orthopedics specialty. Albeit these guidelines expound strategies to manage trauma and orthopedic cases amidst pandemics but the subsequent post-COVID-19 phase warrants explicable vision and planning. Indeed, resuming elective orthopedics surgical intervention in post-phase of pandemic shall definitively be a task invoking fundamental planning, especially in a resource-limited background. With the rollout of vaccines in the country, the scenario is in favor of returning to normalcy with evaluation for COVID-19 being added to the list of routine medical and surgical screening profiles.","Jeyaraman, Madhan; Muthu, Sathish; Shyam, Ashok",J Orthop Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327178/; https://doi.org/10.13107/jocr.2021.v11.i04.2174,521

Two models are estimated: one with a sample covering post-lockdown period only and another spanning both post-lockdown and post-reopening periods. The first model reveals that the lockdown caused an immediate fall in the daily growth rate of the ACC by 14.30% and 33.26% fall in the long run. The parameters of the second model show that the lockdown had an impact effect of 8.56% and steady state effect of 20.88% reduction in the growth rate of the ACC. The effect of reopening on the ACC is insignificant. However, the doubling time of the ACC has increased after reopening. The study warns against complete reopening until sufficient post-reopening data series is available for exact estimation.

672655,Inactivation and safety testing of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus,2015-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Despite improved health and during a strong job market (pre-COVID-19), a substantial proportion of HIV+ adults remained unemployed. This study sought to provide time-limited counseling to promote employment goals. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether behavioral activation (BA) or supportive counseling (SC), would be more effective in promoting vocational goals (full or part-time, paid or volunteer). METHODS: The study included two groups: those with clinically significant fatigue, who were first treated with armodafinil. Once their fatigue diminished, they were enrolled in the counseling program. Those without fatigue were enrolled directly. Both BA and SC interventions were manualized, consisting of eight individual sessions plus a follow-up. RESULTS: 116 participants entered counseling, including 87 assigned to BA and 29 to SC. Of these, 79 completed counseling or found a job by session eight. By follow-up, 51%of BA versus 41%of SC participants had found jobs, a non-significant difference either clinically or statistically. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple issues contributed to difficulty in employment, including gaps in resumes, loss of contact with former colleagues, and uncertainty about career direction. Ongoing barriers included substance use, housing instability, ambivalence about forfeiting government benefits, as well as inadequately treated depression. Success in employment for about half of participants is, in this context, a reasonable outcome.","McElhiney, Martin C; Rabkin, Judith G; Wainberg, Milton L; Finkel, Madeline R; Scodes, Jennifer",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-213529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219692/,521

Objective evidence of a specific individual's physiologic response to that vaccine are not routinely tracked but may offer insights into the acute immune response and personal and/or vaccine characteristics associated with that.

Of 4,110 individuals who reported at least one mRNA vaccination dose, 3,312 provided adequate resting heart rate data from the peri-vaccine period for analysis. We found changes in resting heart rate with respect to an individual baseline increased the days after vaccination, peaked on day 2, and returned to normal on day 6, with a much stronger effect after second dose with respect to first dose (average changes 1.6 versus 0.5 beats per minute). The changes were more pronounced for individuals who received the Moderna vaccine (on both doses), those who previously tested positive to COVID-19 (on dose 1), and for individuals aged <40 years, after adjusting for possible confounding factors. Taking advantage of continuous passive data from personal sensors could potentially enable the identification of a digital fingerprint of inflammation, which might prove useful as a surrogate for vaccine-induced immune response.","Quer, G.; Gadaleta, M.; Radin, J.

Monitoring sites included an urban subwatershed, a rural subwatershed, and the Milwaukee River at the mouth. To collect samples that characterize variability throughout changing hydrologic periods, a process control system was developed for unattended, large-volume (56–2800 L) filtration over extended durations. This system provided flow-weighted mean concentrations during runoff and extended (24-h) low-flow periods. Human viruses and bovine viruses were detected by real-time qPCR in 49% and 41% of samples (n = 63), respectively. All human viruses analyzed were detected at least once including adenovirus (40% of samples), GI norovirus (10%), enterovirus (8%), rotavirus (6%), GII norovirus (1.6%) and hepatitis A virus (1.6%). Three of seven bovine viruses analyzed were detected including bovine polyomavirus (32%), bovine rotavirus (19%), and bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (5%). Human viruses were present in 63% of runoff samples resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 20% of low-flow samples. Maximum human virus concentrations exceeded 300 genomic copies/L. Bovine viruses were present in 46% of runoff samples resulting from precipitation and snowmelt and 14% of low-flow samples. The maximum bovine virus concentration was 11 genomic copies/L. Statistical modeling indicated that stream flow, precipitation, and season explained the variability of human viruses in the watershed, and hydrologic condition (runoff event or low-flow) and season explained the variability of the sum of human and bovine viruses; however, no model was identified that could explain the variability of bovine viruses alone.

SARS-CoV-2 can infect a variety of host cells, including intestinal epithelial cells. We sought to characterize the role of the gastrointestinal immune system in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We measured cytokines, inflammatory markers, viral RNA, microbiome composition and antibody responses in stool and serum samples from a prospectively enrolled cohort of 44 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool of 41% of patients and was found more frequently in patients with diarrhea than those without (16[44%] vs 5[19%], p=0.06). Patients who survived had lower median viral genome copies than those who did not (p=0.021). Compared to uninfected controls, COVID-19 patients had higher median fecal levels of IL-8 (166.5 vs 286.5 pg/mg; p=0.05) and lower levels of fecal IL-10 (678 vs 194 pg/mg; p<0.001) compared to uninfected controls. Stool IL-23 was higher in patients with more severe COVID-19 disease (223.8 vs 86.6 pg/mg; p=0.03) and we find evidence of intestinal virus-specific IgA responses, which was associated with more severe disease. Fecal cytokines and calprotectin levels were not correlated with gastrointestinal symptoms or with the level of virus detected. CONCLUSIONS: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in the stools of COVID-19 patients and select individuals had evidence for a specific mucosal IgA response, intestinal inflammation was limited, even in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms.","Britton, Graham J.; Chen-Liaw, Alice; Cossarini, Francesca; Livanos, Alexandra E.; Spindler, Matthew P.; Plitt, Tamar; Eggers, Joseph; Mogno, Ilaria; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S.; Siu, Sophia; Tankelevich, Michael; Grinspan, Lauren Tal; Dixon, Rebekah E.; Jha, Divya; Martinez-Delgado, Gustavo; Amanat, Fatima; Hoagland, Daisy A.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Dubinsky, Marla C.; Merad, Miriam; van Bakel, Harm; Krammer, Florian; Bongers, Gerold; Mehandru, Saurabh; Faith, Jeremiah J.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.03.20183947v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909002/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.03.20183947,521

690048,Considerations Left behind Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Outbreaks in Republic of Korea,2015-08-28,"Background: Neutropenia is commonly encountered in cancer patients, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim) is widely given to oncology patients to counteract neutropenia and prevent infection. G-CSF is both a growth factor and cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients, who are also afflicted with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains unknown. Methods: An observational cohort of 304 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia (N=55) and G-CSF administration (N=16) on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were assessed as time-dependent predictors using an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, a similar model was constructed with patients that received G-CSF, categorized into high- and low-response, based on the level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rise 24 hours after growth factor administration. Results: Neutropenia (ANC < 1 K/mcL) during COVID-19 course was not independently associated with severe respiratory failure or death (HR: 0.71, 95% Cl: 0.34-1.50, P value: 0.367) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. When controlling for neutropenia, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06-8.28, P value: 0.038). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 5.18, 95% CI: 1.61-16.64, P value: 0.006). Conclusion: Possible risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be weighed in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19 infection, as G-CSF may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status in this setting.","Morjaria, S.; Zhang, A.; Kaltsas MD, A.; Parameswaran, R.; Patel, D.; Zhou, W.; Predmore, J.; Perez Johnston, R.; Jee, J.; Perales, M.; Daniyan, A.; Taur, Y.; Mailankody, S.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.20174565; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.13.20174565v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817981/,521
