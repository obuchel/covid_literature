2229,Interventions in live poultry markets for the control of avian influenza: A systematic review,2016-03-22,"BACKGROUND: Live poultry markets (LPMs) pose a threat to public health by promoting the amplification and dissemination of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) and by providing the ideal setting for zoonotic influenza transmission. OBJECTIVE: This review assessed the impact of different interventions implemented in LPMs to control the emergence of zoonotic influenza. METHODS: Publications were identified through a systematic literature search in the PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. Eligible studies assessed the impact of different interventions, such as temporary market closure or a ban on holding poultry overnight, in reducing i) AIV-detection rates in birds and the market environment or ii) influenza incidence in humans. Unpublished literature, reviews, editorials, cross-sectional studies, theoretical models and publications in languages other than English were excluded. Relevant findings were extracted and critically evaluated. For the comparative analysis of findings across studies, standardized outcome measures were computed as i) the relative risk reduction (RRR) of AIV-detection in LPMs and ii) incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of H7N9-incidence in humans. RESULTS: A total of 16 publications were identified and reviewed. Collectively, the data suggest that AIV-circulation can be significantly reduced in the LPM-environment and among market-birds through (i) temporary LPM closure, (ii) periodic rest days (iii) market depopulation overnight and (iv) improved hygiene and disinfection. Overall, the findings indicate that the length of stay of poultry in the market is a critical control point to interrupt the AIV-replication cycle within LPMs. In addition, temporary LPM closure was associated with a significant reduction of the incidence of zoonotic influenza. The interpretation of these findings is limited by variations in the implementation of interventions. In addition, some of the included studies were of ecologic nature or lacked an inferential framework, which might have lead to cosiderable confounding and bias. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence collected in this review endorses permanent LPM-closure as a long-term objective to reduce the zoonotic risk of avian influenza, although its economic and socio-political implications favour less drastic interventions, e.g. weekly rest days, for implementation in the short-term.","Offeddu, Vittoria; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Peiris, J.S.

3261,mHealth Technology Use and Implications in Historically Underserved and Minority Populations in the United States: Systematic Literature Review,2018-06-18,"BACKGROUND: The proportion of people in the United States who are members of at least two ethnic groups is projected to increase to 10% by the year 2050. This makes addressing health disparities and health inequities in minority populations increasingly more difficult. Minority populations, including those who classify themselves as African American and Hispanic, are using mobile phones to access health information via the internet more frequently than those who classify themselves as white, providing unique opportunities for those in public health and health education to reach these traditionally underserved populations using mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to assess studies conducted in the United States that have used mHealth tools and strategies to develop and implement interventions in underserved populations. This review also examines the ways in which mHealth strategies are being employed in public health interventions to these priority population groups, as mobile phone capabilities include text messaging, mobile apps, internet access, emails, video streaming, social media, instant messaging, and more. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using key search phrases, the matrix method, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowchart diagram to identify key studies conducted between the years of 2009-2016 in the United States. These studies were reviewed for their use of mHealth interventions in historically underserved and minority populations. RESULTS: A total of 16,270 articles were initially identified using key search phrases in three databases. Titles were reviewed and articles not meeting criteria were excluded, leaving 156 articles for further review. After additional review for relevance and inclusion criteria, 16 articles were qualified and analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth is a promising area of development for public health and health education. While successful research has been done using text messaging (short message service, SMS) and other mHealth strategies, there is a need for more research using mobile phones and tablet applications. This literature review demonstrates mHealth technology has the ability to increase prevention and health education in health disparate communities and concludes that more specified research is needed.","Anderson-Lewis, Charkarra; Darville, Gabrielle; Mercado, Rebeccah Eve; Howell, Savannah; Di Maggio, Samantha",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028762/,345
4438,Mobile device use and the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in residential care homes,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: With the fast-paced aging and increasing digitalization of society, there has been a growing interest in the effect of mobile device use on cognitive function and depression in older adults. However, research examining this issue among older adults in residential care homes (RCHs) is scant. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of mobile device use on the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in RCHs. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). RESULTS: A total of 235 senior residents (aged 82.58 ± 5.54) in four RCHs were surveyed. Users of mobile devices had a significantly higher total MoCA score (25.02 ± 4.14) and a significantly lower GDS-15 score (3.28 ± 2.74) than non-users (MoCA: 19.34 ± 5.21, GDS-15: 4.69 ± 2.90). Multivariate linear regression indicate that mobile device use is significantly associated with total MoCA score, six of the seven sub-scores (visuospatial abilities and execution functions, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation)(P < 0.05). Logistic regression showed that mobile device use was significantly associated with the level of depressive symptoms (OR = 0.458, 95%CI = 0.249–0.845). CONCLUSIONS: Use of mobile devices has a significant association with the cognitive function and depressive symptoms of older adults living in RCHs, and thus should be encouraged as a measure to maintain and improve cognition and prevent depression.","Lin, Lu; Jing, Xiu-Chen; Lv, Shu-Jiao; Liang, Jing-Hong; Tian, Li; Li, Hui-Ling; Puts, Martine; Xu, Yong",BMC Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6998827/,345
6103,Die Lungentuberkulose – aktuelle radiologische Diagnostik einer alten Krankheit,2000,"Pulmonary surfactant is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II cells and constitutes an important component of the alveolar lining fluid. It comprises a unique mixture of phospholipids and surfactant-specific proteins. More than 30 years after its first biochemical characterization, knowledge of the composition and functions of the surfactant complex has grown considerably. Its classically known role is to decrease surface tension in alveolar air spaces to a degree that facilitates adequate ventilation of the peripheral lung. More recently, other important surfactant functions have come into view. Probably most notable among these, surfactant has been demonstrated to enhance local pulmonary defense mechanisms and to modulate immune responses in the alveolar milieu. These findings have prompted interest in the role and the possible alterations of the surfactant system in a variety of lung diseases and in environmental impacts on the lung. However, only a limited number of studies investigating surfactant changes in human lung disease have hitherto been published. Preliminary results suggest that surfactant analyses, e.g., from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, may reveal quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of the surfactant system in human lung disorders. It is hypothesized that in the future, surfactant studies may become one of our clinical tools to evaluate the activity and severity of peripheral lung diseases. In certain disorders they may also gain diagnostic significance. Further clinical studies will be necessary to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of surfactant substitution and the usefulness of pharmacologic manipulation of the secretory activity of alveolar type II cells in pulmonary medicine.","Hamm, H.; Fabel, H.; Bartsch, W.",Clin Investig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095985/,345

11120,Preclinical Evaluation of Vaccines to Treat Opioid Use Disorders: How Close are We to a Clinically Viable Therapeutic?,2020-04-04,"Sepsis is being recognized as an important complication of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and its presence is a poor prognostic marker and increases the overall mortality. The survival rate differs in the various types of cannulation techniques. Adult patients with prolonged duration of ECMO constitute the major risk population. Ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections form the main sources of sepsis in these patients. It is important to know the most common etiological agents for sepsis in ECMO, which varies partly with the local epidemiology of the hospitals. A high index of suspicion, drawing adequate volumes for blood culture and early and timely administration of appropriate empirical antimicrobials can substantially decrease the morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population. The dosing of antimicrobials is influenced by the pharmacological variations on ECMO machine and is an important consideration. Infection control practices are of paramount importance and need to be followed meticulously to prevent sepsis in ECMO.","Gopalakrishnan, Ram; Vashisht, Rohit",Indian J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223121/,345

11600,"A Multicenter Study into Burnout, Perceived Stress, Job Satisfaction, Coping Strategies, and General Health among Emergency Department Nursing Staff",2020-04-02,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to determine the acceptability, feasibility and safety of a novel digital intervention (Entourage) for young people with prominent social anxiety symptoms, with a particular focus on the engagement of young men. The secondary aim was to explore whether the intervention was associated with clinically significant improvements to clinical and social variables known to co-occur with social anxiety. METHOD: A multidisciplinary team comprising of mental health clinicians, researchers, young adult fiction writers, a comic artist and young people with a lived experience of social anxiety developed the Entourage platform in collaboration. Entourage combines evidence-based therapeutic techniques for social anxiety with an engaging, social-media-based interface that allows users to build social connections, while also receiving expert clinical moderation and support from peer workers. Acceptability, feasibility and safety outcomes of Entourage were tested in a 12-week pilot study with 89 young people (48.3% male; age M = 19.8 years, SD = 3.3 years). Eligible participants were recruited via liaison with four headspace early-intervention centres in north-western Melbourne. RESULTS: 56.8% of the sample reported social anxiety symptoms in the severe or very severe range at baseline. Results demonstrated the Entourage intervention was feasible, safe, and potentially acceptable, with 98.6% of participants reporting they would recommend Entourage to another young person experiencing social anxiety. Usage results were also comparable across male and non-male participants. Results showed that young people reliably and significantly improved on clinical and social variables. In particular, young males showed a clinically significant improvement on social anxiety symptoms (d = 0.79, p < .001), depression (d = 0.71, p < .001), belongingness (d = 0.58, p = .001), increased feelings of social connectedness (d = 0.46, p = .004) and decreased loneliness (d = 0.46, p = .006). Non-male participants also experienced a significant increase in social connectedness (d = 0.76, p < .001), alongside reduced social anxiety (d = 0.78, p < .001) and experiential avoidance (d = 0.81, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Entourage is a highly engaging and potentially effective intervention that represents a novel combination of features designed both to reduce social anxiety symptoms and improve social connection among young people. Entourage demonstrated some acceptability, feasibility and safety, with encouraging benefits to clinical and social variables. Entourage also showed favorable results for the engagement and support of young men with social anxiety symptoms.","Rice, Simon; O'Bree, Bridget; Wilson, Michael; McEnery, Carla; Lim, Michelle H.; Hamilton, Matthew; Gleeson, John; Bendall, Sarah; D'Alfonso, Simon; Russon, Penni; Valentine, Lee; Cagliarini, Daniela; Howell, Simmone; Miles, Christopher; Pearson, Marc; Nicholls, Laura; Garland, Nicola; Mullen, Edward; McGorry, Patrick D.; Alvarez-Jimenez, Mario",Internet Interv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7232094/,345
16794,Self-removal of skin suture using the slip knot technique,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important immuno-regulatory cytokine and is elevated in inflammatory conditions. Neutrophils are the first immune cells to migrate to sites of infection and inflammation, where they generate, among other mediators, the potent oxidant hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Here, we investigated the impact of MIF on HOCl production in neutrophils in response to phagocytic stimuli. METHODS: Production of HOCl during phagocytosis of zymosan was determined using the specific fluorescent probe R19-S in combination with flow cytometry and live cell microscopy. The rate of phagocytosis was monitored using fluorescently-labeled zymosan. Alternatively, HOCl production was assessed during phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by measuring the oxidation of bacterial glutathione to the HOCl-specific product glutathione sulfonamide. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), an oxidant-dependent process, was quantified using a SYTOX Green plate assay. RESULTS: Exposure of human neutrophils to MIF doubled the proportion of neutrophils producing HOCl during early stages of zymosan phagocytosis, and the concentration of HOCl produced was greater. During phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa, a greater fraction of bacterial glutathione was oxidized to glutathione sulfonamide in MIF-treated compared to control neutrophils. The ability of MIF to increase neutrophil HOCl production was independent of the rate of phagocytosis and could be blocked by the MIF inhibitor 4-IPP. Neutrophils pre-treated with MIF produced more NETs than control cells in response to PMA. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a role for MIF in potentiating HOCl production in neutrophils in response to phagocytic stimuli. We propose that this newly discovered activity of MIF contributes to its role in mediating the inflammatory response and enhances host defence.","Schindler, Lisa; Smyth, Leon C.D.; Bernhagen, Jürgen; Hampton, Mark B.; Dickerhof, Nina",Redox Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047225/,345
16970,"Hematological and CD(4)+ T- cell count reference interval for pregnant women attending antenatal care at Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Hawassa Southern Ethiopia",2021-04-08,"Low-intensity psychological interventions that target cognitive risk factors for depressive relapse may improve access to relapse prevention programs and thereby reduce subsequent risk. This study provides the first evaluation of an autobiographical memory-based intervention for relapse prevention, to establish whether memory-training programs that are efficacious for acute depression may also aid those currently in remission. We also provide the longest follow-up to-date of the effects of autobiographical memory training on autobiographical memory processes themselves. This pre-registered randomized-controlled proof-of-concept trial (N = 74) compared an autobiographical Memory Flexibility (MemFlex) intervention to Psychoeducation about cognitive-behavioral mechanisms which maintain depression. Both interventions were primarily self-guided, and delivered via paper workbooks completed over four weeks. The key cognitive outcome was ability to retrieve and alternate between specific and general autobiographical memories. Co-primary clinical outcomes were time until depressive relapse and depression-free days in the twelve-months following intervention. Results indicated a small-moderate effect size (d = 0.35) in favor of MemFlex for the cognitive outcome. A small Hazard Ratio (1.08) was observed for time until depressive relapse, along with a negligible effect size for depression-free days (d = 0.11). Although MemFlex produced long-term improvement in memory retrieval skills, there was little support for MemFlex as a relapse prevention program for depression.","Hitchcock, Caitlin; Smith, Alicia J.; Elliott, Rachel; O'Leary, Cliodhna; Gormley, Siobhan; Parker, Jenna; Patel, Shivam D.; Esteves, Carlos V.; Rodrigues, Evangeline; Hammond, Emily; Watson, Peter; Werner-Seidler, Aliza; Dalgleish, Tim",Behav Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047774/,345
17729,"Sleep Education for Elders Program (SLEEP): Promising Pilot Results of a Virtual, Health Educator-Led, Community-Delivered Sleep Behavior Change Intervention",2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: In 2017, New Caledonia experienced an outbreak of severe dengue causing high hospital burden (4379 cases, 416 hospital admissions, 15 deaths). We decided to build a local operational model predictive of dengue severity, which was needed to ease the healthcare circuit. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and biological parameters associated with severe dengue in the cohort of patients hospitalized at the Territorial Hospital between January and July 2017 with confirmed dengue, in order to elaborate a comprehensive patient’s score. Patients were compared in univariate and multivariate analyses. Predictive models for severity were built using a descending step-wise method. RESULTS: Out of 383 included patients, 130 (34%) developed severe dengue and 13 (3.4%) died. Major risk factors identified in univariate analysis were: age, comorbidities, presence of at least one alert sign, platelets count < 30 × 10(9)/L, prothrombin time < 60%, AST and/or ALT > 10 N, and previous dengue infection. Severity was not influenced by the infecting dengue serotype nor by previous Zika infection. Two models to predict dengue severity were built according to sex. Best models for females and males had respectively a median Area Under the Curve = 0.80 and 0.88, a sensitivity = 84.5 and 84.5%, a specificity = 78.6 and 95.5%, a positive predictive value = 63.3 and 92.9%, a negative predictive value = 92.8 and 91.3%. Models were secondarily validated on 130 patients hospitalized for dengue in 2018. CONCLUSION: We built robust and efficient models to calculate a bedside score able to predict dengue severity in our setting. We propose the spreadsheet for dengue severity score calculations to health practitioners facing dengue outbreaks of enhanced severity in order to improve patients’ medical management and hospitalization flow.

17750,Use of Technology to Aid Clinical Audit in an Asian Emergency Medical Services Department,2021-04-22,"The inherited and acquired long QT is a risk marker for potential serious cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Smartwatches are becoming more popular and are increasingly used for monitoring human health. The present study aimed to assess the feasibility and reliability of evaluating the QT interval in lead I, lead II, and V2 lead using a commercially available Apple Watch. One hundred nineteen patients admitted to our Cardiology Division were studied. I, II, and V2 leads were obtained after recording a standard 12-lead ECG. Lead I was recorded with the smartwatch on the left wrist and the right index finger on the crown. Lead II was obtained with the smartwatch on the left lower abdomen and the right index finger on the crown. The V2 lead was recorded with the smartwatch in the fourth intercostal space left parasternal with the right index finger on the crown. There was agreement among the QT intervals of I, II, and V2 leads and the QT mean using the smartwatch and the standard ECG with Spearman’s correlations of 0.886; 0.881; 0.793; and 0.914 (p < 0.001), respectively. The reliability of the QTc measurements between standard and smartwatch ECG was also demonstrated with a Bland–Altman analysis using different formulas. These data show that a smartwatch can feasibly and reliably assess QT interval. These results could have an important clinical impact when frequent QT interval monitoring is required.","Spaccarotella, Carmen Anna Maria; Migliarino, Serena; Mongiardo, Annalisa; Sabatino, Jolanda; Santarpia, Giuseppe; De Rosa, Salvatore; Curcio, Antonio; Indolfi, Ciro",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8144193/,345
18852,From Enchantment to Disillusion: A Narrative Exploration of Cannabis Use Disorder Among Young Israeli Combat Veterans,2021-06-18,"Currently there are approximately 291,000 people suffering from a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is associated with traumatic changes in mobility and neuralgia, as well as many other long-term chronic health complications, including metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoporosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Due to medical advances, patients with SCI survive much longer than previously. This increase in life expectancy exposes them to novel neurological complications such as memory loss, cognitive decline, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, these usually age-associated disorders are more prevalent in people living with SCI. A common factor of these disorders is the reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis. Inflammation, which is elevated after SCI, plays a major role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis. While there is no clear consensus on the mechanism of the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition after SCI, we will examine in this review how SCI-induced inflammation could modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and provoke age-associated neurological disorders. Thereafter, we will discuss possible therapeutic options which may mitigate the influence of SCI associated complications on hippocampal neurogenesis.","Sefiani, Arthur; Geoffroy, Cédric G.",Front Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8249862/,345

Previous meta-analyses suggested that CHM is effective for IBS; nonetheless, its effectiveness is inconclusive owing to repeated significance testing. We aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of CHM for IBS through a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). Methods: We searched OVID Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from January 1, 1980, to September 20, 2020. The primary outcome was adequate relief of global IBS symptoms. The secondary outcomes included relief of abdominal pain and treatment-related adverse events. The relative ratio (RR) and required information size (RIS) were calculated for each outcome. Results: Ten trials recruiting 2,501 participants were included. Seven (70%) trials were at low risk of bias (RoB). Compared with placebo, CHM was associated with a significantly higher proportion of adequate relief of global IBS symptoms [RR 1.76 (95% confidence interval (95%CI), 1.33–2.33); I (2) = 81.1%; p < 0.001]. The RIS was 1,083 for the primary outcome, and the accrued information size was 1,716. The analysis of the relief of abdominal pain (three trials with 916 participants) showed similar results compared with placebo [RR 1.85 (95%CI, 1.59–2.14); I (2) = 0%; p < 0.001; RIS = 197 participants]. CHM was associated with a higher proportion of adverse events compared with placebo [RR 1.51 (95%CI, 1.14–2); I (2) = 0%; p = 0.004]. Conclusion: CHM was effective in relieving IBS symptoms but caused a higher adverse event rate than placebo.

20714,Exploring the experiences of nurses’ moral distress in long-term care of older adults: a phenomenological study,2021-08-31,"Marketing means the strategies and tactics an organization undertakes for attracting consumers to promote the buying or selling of a product or service. Active marketing is about receiving messages from potential buyers to create ways to influence their purchasing decisions. Advertising is one of the most prominent marketing strategies to promote products to consumers. It is well known that advertisement has a significant impact on the sale of certain goods or services. In this paper, we consider two mediums of advertisement, such as Facebook (which is an online medium) and Newspaper (which is a printed medium). We consider a dataset representing the advertising budget (in hundreds of US dollars) of an electronic company and the sales of that company. We apply the quantitative research approach, and the data which are used in this research are secondary data. For analysis purposes, we consider a statistical tool called simple linear regression modeling. To check the significance of the advertising on sale, definite statistical tests are applied. Based on the findings of this research, it is observed that advertising has a significant impact on sales. It is also showed that spending money on advertising through Facebook has better sales than newspapers. The finding of this research shows that the use of computer-based technologies and online mediums has a brighter future for advertising. Furthermore, a new statistical model is introduced using the Z family approach. The proposed model is very interesting and possesses heavy-tailed properties. Finally, the applicability of the proposed model is illustrated by considering the financial dataset.","Lin, Yushan; Ahmad, Zubair; Shafik, Wasswa; Khosa, Saima K.; Almaspoor, Zahra; Alsuhabi, Hassan; Abbas, Faheem",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8407982/,345

Many primary studies have estimated prevalence rates for mental disorders in homeless individuals. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the prevalence of any mental disorder and major psychiatric diagnoses in clearly defined homeless populations in any high-income country. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We systematically searched for observational studies that estimated prevalence rates of mental disorders in samples of homeless individuals, using Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2007, and searched until 1 April 2021. Studies were included if they sampled exclusively homeless persons, diagnosed mental disorders by standardized criteria using validated methods, provided point or up to 12-month prevalence rates, and were conducted in high-income countries. We identified 39 publications with a total of 8,049 participants. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for prevalence studies and a risk of bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses of prevalence rates were conducted, and heterogeneity was assessed by meta-regression analyses. The mean prevalence of any current mental disorder was estimated at 76.2% (95% CI 64.0% to 86.6%). The most common diagnostic categories were alcohol use disorders, at 36.7% (95% CI 27.7% to 46.2%), and drug use disorders, at 21.7% (95% CI 13.1% to 31.7%), followed by schizophrenia spectrum disorders (12.4% [95% CI 9.5% to 15.7%]) and major depression (12.6% [95% CI 8.0% to 18.2%]). We found substantial heterogeneity in prevalence rates between studies, which was partially explained by sampling method, study location, and the sex distribution of participants. Limitations included lack of information on certain subpopulations (e.g., women and immigrants) and unmet healthcare needs. CONCLUSIONS: Public health and policy interventions to improve the health of homeless persons should consider the pattern and extent of psychiatric morbidity. Our findings suggest that the burden of psychiatric morbidity in homeless persons is substantial, and should lead to regular reviews of how healthcare services assess, treat, and follow up homeless people. The high burden of substance use disorders and schizophrenia spectrum disorders need particular attention in service development.

21357,"Racial and ethnic disparities in HIV diagnoses among heterosexually active persons in the United States nationally and by state, 2018",2021-09-20,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide, have been established over decades of research as, on the one hand, important and versatile molecules involved in a plethora of homeostatic processes and, on the other hand, as inducers of damage, pathologies and diseases. Which effects ROS induce, strongly depends on the cell type and the source, amount, duration and location of ROS production. Similar to cellular pH and calcium levels, which are both strictly regulated and only altered by the cell when necessary, the redox balance of the cell is also tightly regulated, not only on the level of the whole cell but in every cellular compartment. However, a still widespread view present in the scientific community is that the location of ROS production is of no major importance and that ROS randomly diffuse from their cellular source of production throughout the whole cell and hit their redox-sensitive targets when passing by. Yet, evidence is growing that cells regulate ROS production and therefore their redox balance by strictly controlling ROS source activation as well as localization, amount and duration of ROS production. Hopefully, future studies in the field of redox biology will consider these factors and analyze cellular ROS more specifically in order to revise the view of ROS as freely flowing through the cell.","Herb, Marc; Gluschko, Alexander; Schramm, Michael",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452931/,345
22149,"Combatting COVID-19: an insight into the trials, tribulations and triumphs of the frontline dental team",2021-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder pain is a highly prevalent condition and a significant cause of morbidity and functional disability. Current data suggests that many patients presenting with shoulder pain at the primary care level are not receiving high quality care. Primary care decision-making is complex and has the potential to influence the quality of care provided and patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop a clinical decision-making tool that standardizes care and minimizes uncertainty in assessment, diagnosis, and management. METHODS: First a rapid review was conducted to identify existing tools and evidence that could support a comprehensive clinical decision-making tool for shoulder pain. Secondly, provincial consensus was established for the assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients presenting to primary care with shoulder pain in Alberta, Canada using a three-step modified Delphi approach. This project was a highly collaborative effort between Alberta Health Services’ Bone and Joint Health Strategic Clinical Network (BJH SCN) and the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute (ABJHI). RESULTS: A clinical decision-making tool for shoulder pain was developed and reached consensus by a province-wide expert panel representing various health disciplines and geographical regions. This tool consists of a clinical examination algorithm for assessing, diagnosis, and managing shoulder pain; recommendations for history-taking and identification of red flags or additional concerns; recommendations for physical examination and neurological screening; recommendations for the differential diagnosis; and care pathways for managing patients presenting with rotator cuff disease, biceps pathology, superior labral tear, adhesive capsulitis, osteoarthritis, and instability. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical decision-making tool will help to standardize care, provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of shoulder pain, and assist in clinical decision-making for primary care providers in both public and private sectors.

26829,Influence of Gender on Outcome of Severe Sepsis,2007,"Neutrophil granules contain serine proteases that are central components of the antimicrobial weapons of the innate immune system. Neutrophil proteases also contribute to the amplification and resolution of inflammatory responses through defined proteolytic cleavage of mediators, cell surface receptors, and extracellular matrix proteins. In the blood and at mucosal surfaces, neutrophil serine proteases are regulated by serpins found in plasma and by non-serpin secreted inhibitors. Distinct mechanisms leading to neutrophil cell death have been described for the granule serine proteases, neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3. Granule leakage in neutrophils triggers death pathways mediated by cathepsin G and proteinase-3, and both proteases are tightly regulated by their inhibitor SERPINB1 in a cell intrinsic manner. Although stored in the same types of granules, neutrophil elastase does not significantly contribute to cell death following intracellular release from granules into the cytoplasm. However, heterozygous mutations in ELANE, the gene encoding elastase, are the cause of severe congenital neutropenia, a life-threatening condition characterized by the death of neutrophils at an early precursor stage in the bone marrow. This chapter focuses on recent work exploring the biology of clade B intracellular serpins that inhibit neutrophil serine proteases and their functions in neutrophil homeostasis and serine protease control at sites of inflammation.","Benarafa, Charaf",The Serpin Family,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123840/,345

Freely available open-source algorithms, which have the ability to individualise algorithm parameters paired with commercial insulin pumps, and continuous glucose monitoring make up the so-called ""do it yourself"" (DIY) approach to AID. Limited data on the open-source approach have shown promising results, but data from a large randomised control trial are lacking. METHODS: The CREATE (Community deRivEd AutomaTEd insulin delivery) trial is an open-labelled, randomised, parallel 24-week, multi-site trial comparing sensor augmented pump therapy (SAPT) to our AnyDANA-loop. The three components of AnyDANA-loop are: 1) OpenAPS algorithm implemented in a smartphone (a version of AndroidAPS), 2) DANA-i™ insulin pump and, 3) Dexcom G6(R) continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The primary outcome measure is the percentage of time in target sensor glucose range (3.9 -10mmol/L). Secondary outcomes include psycho-social factors and platform performance. Analysis of online collective learning, characteristic of the open-source approach, is planned. 100 participants with T1D aged 7 – 70 years (age stratified into children/adolescents 7–15 years and adults 16–70 years), will be recruited from four sites in New Zealand.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most severe pulmonary complications after aSAH, with a reported incidence ranging from 11 to 50%. This study aims to assess in a large cohort of aSAH patients, during the first week after an intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the incidence of ARDS defined according to the Berlin criteria and its effect on outcome. METHODS: This is a multicentric, retrospective cohort study in 3 European intensive care units. We collected data between January 2009 and December 2017. We included adult patients (≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of aSAH admitted to the ICU. RESULTS: A total of 855 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. ARDS was assessable in 851 patients. The cumulative incidence of ARDS was 2.2% on the first day since ICU admission, 3.2% on day three, and 3.6% on day seven. At the univariate analysis, ARDS was associated with a poor outcome (p = 0.005) at ICU discharge, and at the multivariable analysis, patients with ARDS showed a worse neurological outcome (Odds ratio = 3.00, 95% confidence interval 1.16–7.72; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: ARDS has a low incidence in the first 7 days of ICU stay after aSAH, but it is associated with worse outcome.

In recent years, radio frequency identification (RFID) has been exploited to monitor physiological signs (e.g., respiration and heartbeat) of users in a contactless and convenient way. Motivated by such progresses, we conduct an experimental study on recognizing the emotion of users with commercial RFID devices. We propose Free-EQ, an emotion recognition framework which first extracts respiration-based features and heartbeat-based features from RFID signals and then uses these features to train a classifier to recognize different emotions of a target user.

Many factors, such as carbon and fuel prices as well as the capacity expansion of renewable energy sources, influence Germany’s CO(2) emissions. This ex-post regression analysis of the German power market from 2016 to 2019 investigates the contribution of each factor to the CO(2) emissions reduction. The results suggest that short-term market developments for gas prices are responsible for a major share of 2019’s CO(2) emissions reduction when compared to 2018 levels. The sustainable transition of the power system, in form of adequate CO(2) prices and additional renewable energy capacities, becomes the dominating factor when analyzing the CO(2) emissions reductions over the longer time span from 2016 to 2019. Exogenous factors, such as increasing gas prices, could raise Germany’s carbon emissions again. This reversion of carbon emissions reductions can be avoided if the overall-society compromise on the coal phase-out is realized sooner than later.","Anke, Carl-Philipp; Schönheit, David",Z Energiewirtsch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7716793/,345

In some negative phase II trials, a post-hoc NI analysis justified additional phase III trials that were successful. However, the risk of false positive achievements was not controlled in these early phase analyses. We propose to preplan NI analyses in superiority-based Simon's two-stage designs to control type I and II error rates. METHODS: Simulations have been proposed to assess the control of type I and II errors rates with this method. A total of 12,768 two-stage Simon's design trials were constructed based on different assumptions of rejection response probability, desired response probability, type I and II errors, and NI margins. P-value and type II error were calculated with stochastic ordering using Uniformly Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator. Type I and II errors were simulated using the Monte Carlo method. The agreement between calculated and simulated values was analyzed with Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: We observed the same level of agreement between calculated and simulated type I and II errors from both two-stage Simon's superiority designs and designs in which NI analysis was allowed. Different examples has been proposed to explain the utility of this method. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of NI analysis in superiority-based single-arm clinical trials may be useful for weighing additional factors such as safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, and biomarker data while assessing early efficacy. Implementation of this strategy can be achieved through simple adaptations to existing designs for one-arm phase II clinical trials.","Sampayo-Cordero, Miguel; Miguel-Huguet, Bernat; Pérez-García, José; Páez, David; Guerrero-Zotano, Ángel L.; Garde-Noguera, Javier; Aguirre, Elena; Holgado, Esther; López-Miranda, Elena; Huang, Xin; Malfettone, Andrea; Llombart-Cussac, Antonio; Cortés, Javier",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733004/,345

COVID-19 Prevalence Among COVID-19 Exposed Health Care Workers at a Tertiary Care Center in San Bernardino County, Ca",2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: More than 360,000 people infected with COVID-19 in New York State (NYS) by the end of May 2020. Although expanded testing could effectively control statewide COVID-19 outbreak, the county-level factors predicting the number of testing are unknown. Accurately identifying the county-level predictors of testing may contribute to more effective testing allocation across counties in NYS. This study leveraged multiple public datasets and machine learning algorithms to construct and compare county-level prediction models of COVID-19 testing in NYS. METHODS: Testing data by May 15(th) was extracted from the Department of Health in NYS. A total of 28 county-level predictors derived from multiple public datasets (e.g., American Community Survey and US Health Data) were used to construct the prediction models. Three machine learning algorithms, including generalized linear regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO), ridge regression, and regression tree, were used to identify the most important county-level predictors, adjusting for prevalence and incidence. Model performances were assessed using the mean square error (MSE), with smaller MSE indicating a better model performance. RESULTS: The testing rate was 70.3 per 1,000 people in NYS. Counties (Rockland and Westchester) closed to the epicenter had high testing rates while counties (Chautauqua and Clinton) located at the boundary of NYS and were far away from the epicenter had low testing rates. The MSEs of linear regression with the LASSO penalty, ridge regression, and regression tree was 123.60, 40.59, and 298.0, respectively. Ridge regression was selected as the final model and revealed that the mental health provider rate was positively associated with testing (β=5.11, p=.04) while the proportion of religious adherents (β=-3.91, p=.05) was inversely related to the variation of testing rate across counties. CONCLUSION: This study identified healthcare resources and religious environment as the strongest predictor of spatial variations of COVID-19 testing across NYS. Structural or policy efforts should address the spatial variations and target the relevant county-level predictors to promote statewide testing.

The immunoassay based on fluorescence labeling has good specificity but a high labeling cost. Herein, on the basis of G-triplex molecular beacon (G3MB) and thioflavin T (ThT), we developed a simple and label-free biosensor for protein detection. The biotin and streptavidin were used as model enzymes. In the presence of target streptavidin (SA), the streptavidin hybridized with G3MB-b (biotin-linked-G-triplex molecular beacon) perfectly and formed larger steric hindrance, which hindered the hydrolysis of probes by exonuclease III (Exo III). In the absence of target streptavidin, the exonuclease III successively cleaved the stem of G3MB-b and released the G-rich sequences which self-assembled into a G-triplex and subsequently activated the fluorescence signal of thioflavin T. Compared with the traditional G-quadruplex molecular beacon (G4MB), the G3MB only needed a lower dosage of exonuclease III and a shorter reaction time to reach the optimal detection performance, because the concise sequence of G-triplex was good for the molecular beacon design. Moreover, fluorescence experiment results exhibited that the G3MB-b had good sensitivity and specificity for streptavidin detection. The developed label-free biosensor provides a valuable and general platform for protein detection.","Xue, Jun; Yi, Jintao; Zhou, Hui",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156537/,345

This paper adopts the classical learning-by-doing framework of Wright (1936), which predicts that cost will fall as a function of the cumulative volume of past deployments. We first examine the learning curves for solar photovoltaic modules, wind turbines and electrolyzers. These estimates then become the basis for estimating the dynamics of the life-cycle cost of generating the corresponding clean energy, i.e., electricity from solar and wind power as well as hydrogen. Our calculations point to significant and sustained learning curves, which, in some contexts, predict a much more rapid cost decline than suggested by the traditional 80% learning curve. Finally, we argue that the observed learning curves for individual clean energy technologies reinforce each other in advancing the transition to a decarbonized energy economy.

HIV persists in cellular and anatomical reservoirs that show minimal decay during ART. A large number of studies conducted during the past 20 years have shown that HIV persists in a small pool of cells harboring integrated and replication-competent viral genomes. The majority of these cells do not produce viral particles and constitute what is referred to as the latent reservoir of HIV infection. Therefore, although HIV is not considered as a typical latent virus, it can establish a state of nonproductive infection under rare circumstances, particularly in memory CD4+ T cells, which represent the main barrier to HIV eradication. While it was originally thought that the pool of latently infected cells was largely composed of cells harboring transcriptionally silent genomes, recent evidence indicates that several blocks contribute to the nonproductive state of these cells. Here, we describe the virological and immunological factors that play a role in the establishment and persistence of the pool of latently infected cells and review the current approaches aimed at eliminating the latent HIV reservoir.","Dufour, Caroline; Gantner, Pierre; Fromentin, Rémi; Chomont, Nicolas",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci136227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609095/,345

Up to the end of May 2020 more than thirty-three thousand deaths had been recorded in Italy with a large prevalence among males, those over 75 years of age, and in association with co-morbidities. We describe the lung pathological and immunohistochemical post-mortem findings at the autopsy of 9 patients who died of SARS-COV 2 associated disease. We found in the lung tissues of all patients histological changes consistent with diffuse alveolar damage in various evolution phases ranging from acute exudative to acute proliferative to fibrotic phase. Alveolar damage was associated a prominent involvement of the vascular component in both the interstitial capillaries and in the mid-size vessels, with capillary fibrin micro-thrombi, as well as organized thrombi even in medium sized arteries, in most cases not related to sources of embolism. Eosinophilic infiltrate was also seen, probably reactive to pharmacological treatment. Viral RNA of SARS-COV 2 was detected from the lung tissues of all the nine patients. Immunohistochemistry for the receptor of the SARS-COV 2, ACE2, and its priming activatorTMPRSS2 revealed that both proteins co-localize in airway cells. In particular, the ACE2 protein was expressed in both endothelial cells and alveolar type I and II pneumocytes in the areas of histological diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Pneumocytes but not endothelial cells also expressed TMPRSS2. There are no distinctive histological features of SARS-COV 2 infection with respect to SARS-COV 1 and other DAD with different aetiology. The identification of the cause of death in course of SARS-COV 2 infection is more likely multi-factorial. This article is protected by copyright.

We investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. Most analyses used a bivariate random-effects model. For tuberculosis detection, we first estimated accuracy using all included studies and then only the subset of studies where participants were unselected, i.e. not selected based on prior microscopy testing. MAIN RESULTS We identified in total 95 studies (77 new studies since the previous review): 86 studies (42,091 participants) evaluated Xpert MTB/RIF for tuberculosis and 57 studies (8287 participants) for rifampicin resistance. One study compared Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra on the same participant specimen.Tuberculosis detectionOf the total 86 studies, 45 took place in high tuberculosis burden and 50 in high TB/HIV burden countries. Most studies had low risk of bias.Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% credible Interval (CrI)) were 85% (82% to 88%) and 98% (97% to 98%), (70 studies, 37,237 unselected participants; high-certainty evidence). We found similar accuracy when we included all studies.For a population of 1000 people where 100 have tuberculosis on culture, 103 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-positive and 18 (17%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); 897 would be Xpert MTB/RIF-negative and 15 (2%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)) was 88% (85% to 91%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 83% (79% to 86%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 96% (94% to 97%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 98% (97% to 99%), (1 study, 1439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 98% (97% to 98%) in smear-positive and 67% (62% to 72%) in smear-negative, culture-positive participants, (45 studies). Xpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity was 88% (83% to 92%) in HIV-negative and 81% (75% to 86%) in HIV-positive participants; specificities were similar 98% (97% to 99%), (14 studies).Rifampicin resistance detectionXpert MTB/RIF pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% Crl) were 96% (94% to 97%) and 98% (98% to 99%), (48 studies, 8020 participants; high-certainty evidence).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis, 114 would be positive for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and 18 (16%) would not have rifampicin resistance (false-positives); 886 would be would be negative for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis and four (0.4%) would have rifampicin resistance (false-negatives).Xpert Ultra sensitivity (95% CI) was 95% (90% to 98%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 95% (91% to 98%); Xpert Ultra specificity was 98% (97% to 99%) versus Xpert MTB/RIF 98% (96% to 99%), (1 study, 551 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found Xpert MTB/RIF to be sensitive and specific for diagnosing PTB and rifampicin resistance, consistent with findings reported previously. Xpert MTB/RIF was more sensitive for tuberculosis in smear-positive than smear-negative participants and HIV-negative than HIV-positive participants. Compared with Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra had higher sensitivity and lower specificity for tuberculosis and similar sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance (1 study). Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra provide accurate results and can allow rapid initiation of treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.","Horne, David J; Kohli, Mikashmi; Zifodya, Jerry S; Schiller, Ian; Dendukuri, Nandini; Tollefson, Deanna; Schumacher, Samuel G; Ochodo, Eleanor A; Pai, Madhukar; Steingart, Karen R",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009593.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31173647/,345
64660,Online Peer Support and Well-being of Mothers and Children: Systematic Scoping Review.,2020-10-31,"OBJECTIVE There are both opportunities and challenges with the implementation of oral health value-based care (OHVBC). To tackle concerns and advance conversation, a symposium was convened with subject matter experts to develop a gap analysis and capture insights into professional readiness for value-based care design. METHODS The symposium was convened as a private event for 46 participants over the course of one and a half days in December 2019. Thematic analyses utilized the OHVBC Readiness Framework (DentaQuest Partnership, 2019) to further codify conversations as part of the gap-analysis process. Poll Everywhere, a text messaging application that allows participants to answer questions in real time, was also employed to solicit responses. RESULTS Attendees of the symposium felt that OHVBC would have a large portion of market share within the next 10 years. A qualitative assessment of multiple table discussions determined that the participants developed more consensus around themes for the current state and the future-desired state than the action-planning needed to close the gap between the two. This may relate to individual ideology, and the siloed environment is still prevalent in the oral health realm. In a postsymposium survey, respondent attendees did not perceive that COVID-19 would delay or negatively impact the adoption of OHVBC and may result in accelerating its utilization. CONCLUSION The oral health community is experiencing multiple drivers to adopt more OHVBC within business and care models. However, there is still a lack of uniformity on how to execute this delivery model.","Boynes, Sean; Nelson, Joni; Diep, Vuong; Kanan, Christine; Pedersen, Da-Nell; Brown, Carolyn; Mathews, Rebekah; Tranby, Eric; Apostolon, Danielle; Bayham, Mary; Minter-Jordan, Myechia",Journal of public health dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1111/jphd.12402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33058156/,345

During the development of thoracoscopic anatomical lung cancer resections, eligibility criteria for the operation have been gradually extended. Currently, even as complicated cases as bronchial and vascular sleeve resections or pneumonectomies are being performed by VATS. However, minimally invasive surgery after previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery merits special consideration due to the consequences of potential injury to the bypass graft. This is particularly important in the case of VATS left upper lobectomy after left internal mammary artery grafting to the left anterior descending artery bypass.","Gabryel, Piotr; Piwkowski, Cezary; Zieliński, Paweł; Dyszkiewicz, Wojciech",Kardiochirurgia i torakochirurgia polska = Polish journal of cardio-thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.5114/kitp.2016.58967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27212981/,345

Molecular dynamics simulations with the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics potentials (QM(DFT)/MM-MD) followed by the electron density analysis are employed to evaluate geometry and electronic properties of the enzyme with different substrates along MD trajectories. We demonstrate that mapping the Laplacian of the electron density and the electron localization function provides easily visible images of the substrate activation that allow one to distinguish rES and nES. The computed fractions of reactive enzyme-substrate complexes along MD trajectories well correlate with the findings of recent experimental studies on the substrate specificity of Mpro. The results of our simulations demonstrate the role of the theory level used in QM subsystems for a proper description of the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine residue in Mpro. The activation of the carbonyl group of a substrate is correctly characterized with the hybrid DFT functional PBE0, whereas the use of a GGA-type PBE functional, that lacks the admixture of the Hartree-Fock exchange fails to describe activation.","Khrenova, Maria G; Tsirelson, Vladimir G; Nemukhin, Alexander V",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp03560b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812956/,345

The most striking postmortem finding was an acute interstitial pneumonia, which was found in nearly all examined mink that died at the peak of the outbreaks. Acute alveolar damage was a consistent histopathological finding in mink that died with pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by detection of viral RNA in throat swabs and by immunohistochemical detection of viral antigen in nasal conchae, trachea, and lung. Clinically, the outbreaks lasted for about 4 weeks but some animals were still polymerase chain reaction-positive for SARS-CoV-2 in throat swabs after clinical signs had disappeared. This is the first report of the clinical and pathological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in mink farms.","Molenaar, Robert Jan; Vreman, Sandra; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate W; Zwart, Rob; de Rond, Jan; Weesendorp, Eefke; Smit, Lidwien A M; Koopmans, Marion; Bouwstra, Ruth; Stegeman, Arjan; van der Poel, Wim H M",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985820943535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663073/,345

In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that repeated subsequent AVUS therapies are a possible approach to overcome these factors and improve the therapeutic efficacy of AVUS. HCC was induced in 30 Wistar rats by oral ingestion of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for 12 weeks. A total of 24 rats received treatment with low intensity, 2.8 MHz ultrasound with an intravenous injection of microbubbles. Treated rats were divided into three groups: single therapy group (ST), 2-days subsequent therapy group (2DST), and 7-days subsequent therapy group (7DST). A sham control group did not receive ultrasound therapy. Tumor perfusion was measured by quantitative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) nonlinear and power-Doppler imaging. Tumors were harvested for histologic evaluation of ultrasound-induced vascular changes. ANOVA was used to compare the percent change of perfusion parameters between the four treatment arms. HCC tumors treated with 2DST showed the largest reduction in tumor perfusion, with 75.3% reduction on average for all perfusion parameters. The ST group showed an average decrease in perfusion of 54.3%. The difference between the two groups was significant p < 0.001. The 7DST group showed a reduction in tumor perfusion of 45.3%, which was significant compared to the 2DST group (p < 0.001) but not different from the ST group (p = 0.2). The use of subsequent targeted AVUS therapies applied shortly (two days) after the first treatment enhanced the anti-vascular effect of ultrasound. This gain, however, was lost for a longer interval (1 week) between the therapies, possibly due to tumor necrosis and loss of tumor viability. These findings suggest that complex interplay between neovascularization and tumor viability plays a critical role in treatment and, therefore, must be actively monitored following treatment by CEUS for optimizing sequential treatment.","Sultan, Laith R; Karmacharya, Mrigendra B; Hunt, Stephen J; Wood, Andrew K W; Sehgal, Chandra M",Biology,https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10020079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499069/,345
68928,Changes in Elder Abuse Risk Factors Reported by Caregivers of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-21,"OBJECTIVE Cutting the intersegmental plane by using a stapler during segmentectomy might interfere with the expansion of the preserved lung due to visceral pleura caught in a staple line, especially in a large regional segmentectomy, such as left upper division or basal segmentectomy. We compared the preserved lung volume after segmentectomy among the methods using stapler, sharp dissection, and their combination for cutting the intersegmental plane in ex vivo pig lungs. We also examined a covering effect of polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue. METHODS To assume a large regional segmentectomy in clinical practice, segments of the left caudal lobe except the lateral segment 2 (L2 segment) were resected, and the lung volume of the preserved L2 segment was measured. The intersegmental plane was cut by the following three methods: (1) stapler (n = 8); (2) scissors (n = 8); and (3) the combined method, that is, cutting the shallow lung tissue with scissors and the deep one with stapler (n = 8). The opened intersegmental plane was covered with polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue. The air leakage was checked by injecting air through the bronchus at pressures of up to 30 cmH(2)O. Thereafter, normal saline was injected through the bronchus at pressures of 10, 20, and 30 cmH(2)O, to measure lung volumes by the volume-displacement method. RESULTS Polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue prevented air leakage completely at up to 30 cmH(2)O. At the saline injection pressures of 10, 20, and 30 cmH(2)O, the mean volumes of L2 segment were 72 ± 14, 96 ± 14, and 109 ± 26 ml with the stapler; 86 ± 11, 117 ± 19, and 135 ± 39 ml with scissors; and 98 ± 10, 140 ± 20, and 155 ± 40 ml with the combined methods, respectively. The volume of the preserved L2 segment was significantly lower with the stapler method than with either the scissors or combined method at each pressure (p < 0.01). The difference was not significant between the scissors and combined methods. CONCLUSIONS Coverage with polyglycolic acid mesh and fibrin glue prevented air leakage from the opened intersegmental plane. The stapler interferes with the expansion of preserved lung in comparison to scissors or combined methods in a large regional segmentectomy.","Asakura, Keisuke; Izumi, Yotaro; Kohno, Mitsutomo; Ohtsuka, Takashi; Okui, Masayuki; Hashimoto, Kohei; Nakayama, Takashi; Nomori, Hiroaki",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcts.2011.02.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21450477/,345

In the case of Colombia, a series of measures focused on isolation and remote services provision were introduced in a context marked by health inequities. This article reviews the theoretical and normative references on primary care interventions in the Colombian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A literature review was conducted in PubMed, LILACS, MEDLINE, and official documents and regulations issued in Colombia, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization. A narrative synthesis was done of 33 documents based on their contribution to the implementation of primary care in Colombia and their role in the pandemic. Results The information was organized into two categories: Actions taken in Colombia in response to COVID-19 and Opportunities in primary care in response to COVID-19. Colombias actions were contrasted with world experience. Better pandemic control was found in countries that adopted primary care as a response. Primary care has strengthened the handling of the pandemic through community action, the provision of coordinated services, mental health inclusion, and the adoption of telemedicine processes. Conclusions In Colombia, primary care is presented as an opportunity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the problems and needs derived from this situation. However, despite the above, there is resistance in the country to adopt this type of approach and complement the hospital-centric model to face the pandemic.","Hernández Rincón, Erwin Hernando; Pimentel González, Juan Pablo; Aramendiz Narváez, Manuel Felipe; Araujo Tabares, Raúl Andrés; Roa González, Julián Mateo",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.03.8147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955972/,345

The consequences are serious; leading to negative impacts on health decisions, including vaccine acceptance, and on trust in immunization advice from public health and/or healthcare professional. This article provides a brief overview of evidence-based strategies to address vaccine deniers in public, in clinical practice and in social situations. As well, a strategy to help differentiate between vaccine deniers and simple vaccine refusers in a practice or clinic is provided. Five tactics are widely used by vaccine deniers: conspiracy; fake experts; selectivity; impossible expectations; and misrepresentation and false logic. Recognizing and understanding these tactics can help protect against misinformation and science denialism propaganda. Highlighting the strong medical science consensus on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines also helps. Carefully and wisely choosing what to say and speaking up-whether you are at a dinner party, out with friends or in your medical office or clinic-is crucial. Not speaking up implies you agree with the misinformation. Having healthcare providers recognize and address misinformation using evidence-based strategies is of growing importance as the arrival of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is expected to further ramp up the vaccine misinformation and disinformation rhetoric. Healthcare providers must prepare themselves and act now to combat the vaccine misinformation tsunami.","MacDonald, Noni E",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v46i1112a11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447164/,345

Materials and Methods After the approval of study protocol by the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed voluntary consent, salivary samples were collected from 96 participants in each group of tobacco chewers with OSCC, tobacco chewers without precancerous or cancerous lesion, and healthy controls. Salivary protein-bound SA (PBSA) and salivary-free SA (FSA) were measured by Yao et al.'s method of acid ninhydrin reaction, and the data were subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. Results The salivary PBSA and FSA levels in the Groups 1, 2, and 3 participants were 31.17 ± 7.6 mg/dL and 63.45 ± 9.8 mg/dL, 25.45 ± 16.61 mg/dL and 33.18 ± 11.38 mg/dL, and 22.73 ± 3.01 mg/dL and 21.62 ± 8.86 mg/dL, respectively. Salivary FSA levels were significantly increased among the tobacco chewers with OSCC patients (Group 1) and tobacco chewers with no premalignant lesions of the oral cavity (Group 2) compared to the healthy controls (Group 3) with P < 0.05 being statistically significant. Salivary FSA levels were significantly increased in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. The salivary PBSA was high among Group 1 as compared to the control Group 3; there was however no significant difference in the levels of salivary PBSA between Group 1 and Group 2. There was no significant difference in the PBSA levels between OSCC patients of Group 1 and the tobacco chewers without precancerous or cancerous lesion in the oral cavity of Group 2. Conclusion Salivary PBSA and FSA are significantly raised in both tobacco chewers with OSCC and in tobacco chewers with no precancerous or cancerous lesions in the oral cavity. SA should therefore be used cautiously while considering it as a marker for the early detection of oral cancer. Tobacco can be a crucial confounding factor when SA is used as a biomarker in OSCC since their levels are elevated to some extent even in tobacco chewers without any clinically obvious precancerous or cancerous lesions in the oral cavity.","Azeem, Mahnaaz Sultana; Yesupatham, Susanna Theophilus; Mohiyuddin, S M Azeem; Sumanth, V; Ravishankar, S",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_337_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719275/,345

However, they exist in limited numbers in the human body. This study was aimed to produce EPCs, for autologous transplantation, using direct reprogramming of skin fibroblasts under GMP-compliant conditions. Fibroblasts were collected and cultured from the skin in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5% activated platelet-rich plasma and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution. They were then transfected with mRNA ETV2 and incubated in culture medium under hypoxia (5% oxygen) for 14 d. Phenotype analysis of transfected cells confirmed that single-factor ETV2 transfection successfully reprogrammed dermal fibroblasts into functional EPCs. Our results showed that ETV2 mRNA combined with hypoxia can give rise to functional EPCs. The cells exhibited functional phenotypes similar to endothelial cells derived from umbilical cord vein; they expressed CD31 and VEGFR2, and formed capillary-like structures in vitro. Moreover, these EPCs could significantly improve hindlimb ischemia in mouse models. Although the direct conversion efficacy was low (3.12 ± 0.98%), altogether our study demonstrates that functional EPCs can be produced from fibroblasts and can be used in clinical applications.","Van Pham, Phuc; Vu, Ngoc Bich; Dao, Thuy Thi-Thanh; Le, Ha Thi-Ngan; Phi, Lan Thi; Phan, Ngoc Kim",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

71852,"Lack of clarity on Medicare Advantage palliative, other cancer care benefits limits consumer uptake.",2020-04-01,"The rotator cuff is theorized to contribute to force couples required to produce glenohumeral kinematics. Impairment in these force couples would theoretically result in impaired ball-and-socket kinematics. Although less frequently used than traditional kinematic descriptors (e.g., Euler angles, joint translations), helical axes are capable of identifying alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics by quantifying the variability (i.e., dispersion) in axis orientation and position during motion. Consequently, assessing glenohumeral helical dispersion may provide indirect evidence of rotator cuff function. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the extent to which rotator cuff pathology is associated with alterations in ball-and-socket kinematics. Fifty-one participants were classified into one of five groups based on an assessment of the supraspinatus using diagnostic imaging: asymptomatic healthy, asymptomatic tendinosis, asymptomatic partial-thickness tear, asymptomatic full-thickness tear, symptomatic full-thickness tear. Glenohumeral kinematics were quantified during coronal plane abduction using a biplane x-ray system and described using instantaneous helical axes. The degree to which glenohumeral motion coincided with ball-and-socket kinematics was described using the angular and positional dispersion about the optimal helical axis and pivot, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between groups in angular dispersion. However, symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear had significantly more positional dispersion than asymptomatic individuals with a healthy supraspinatus or tendinosis. These findings suggest that symptomatic individuals with a full-thickness supraspinatus tear exhibit impaired ball-and-socket kinematics, which is believed to be associated with a disruption of the glenohumeral force couples.","Lawrence, Rebekah L; Ruder, Matthew C; Zauel, Roger; Bey, Michael J",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2020.109924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807327/,345

72173,A Payer Digital Health Study Shows Scalable Approach to Cost Savings and Outcomes.,2020-08-12,"Non-malarial febrile illness outbreaks were documented in 2007 and 2010 in Gabon. After investigation, these outbreaks were attributed to the chikungunya and dengue viruses (CHIKV and DENV). However, for more than half of the samples analyzed, the causative agent was not identified. Given the geographical and ecological position of Gabon, where there is a great animal and microbial diversity, the circulation of other emerging viruses was suspected in these samples lacking aetiology. A total of 436 undiagnosed samples, collected between 2007 and 2013, and originating from 14 urban, suburban, and rural Gabonese locations were selected. These samples were used for viral isolation on newborn mice and VERO cells. In samples with signs of viral replication, cell supernatants and brain suspensions were used to extract nucleic acids and perform real-time RT-PCR targeting specific arboviruses, i.e., CHIKV, DENV, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, and West Nile and Zika viruses. Virus isolation was conclusive for 43 samples either on newborn mice or by cell culture. Virus identification by RT-PCR led to the identification of CHIKV in 37 isolates. A total of 18 complete genomes and 19 partial sequences containing the E2 and E1 genes of CHIKV were sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology or the Sanger method. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes showed that all the sequences belong to the East Central South Africa lineage. Furthermore, we identified 2 distinct clusters. The first cluster was made up of sequences from the western part of Gabon, whereas the second cluster was made up of sequences from the southern regions, reflecting the way CHIKV spread across the country following its initial introduction in 2007. Similar results were obtained when analyzing the CHIKV genes of the E2 and E1 structural proteins. Moreover, study of the mutations found in the E2 and E1 structural proteins revealed the presence of several mutations that facilitate the adaptation to the Aedes albopictus mosquito, such as E2 I211T and E1 A226V, in all the Gabonese CHIKV strains. Finally, sequencing of 6 additional viral isolates failed to lead to any conclusive identification.","Simo Tchetgna, Huguette; Sem Ouilibona, Rita; Nkili-Meyong, Andriniaina Andy; Caron, Melanie; Labouba, Ingrid; Selekon, Benjamin; Njouom, Richard; Leroy, Eric M; Nakoune, Emmanuel; Berthet, Nicolas",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000495136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625488/,345

We measured 34 immune mediators, cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood every 4-7 days over one month per patient using a bio-plex multiplex immunoassay.Results We found that the chemokine RANTES(CCL5) was significantly elevated, from an early stage of the infection, in patients with mild but not severe disease. We also found that early production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly associated with disease severity, and a combination of CCL5, IL-1Ra and IL-10 at week 1 may predict patient outcomes. The majority of cytokines that are known to be associated with the cytokine storm in virus infections such as IL-6 and IFN-gamma were only significantly elevated in the late stage of severe COVID-19 illness. TNF- alpha and GM-CSF showed no significant differences between severe and mild cases.Conclusion Together our data suggest early intervention to increase expression of CCL5 may prevent patients from developing severe illness. Our data also suggest that measurement of levels of CCL5, as well as IL-1Ra, IL-10 in blood individually and in combination might be useful prognostic bio-markers to guide treatment strategies.","Zhao, Yan; Qin, Ling; Zhang, Ping; Li, Kang; Liang, Lianchun; Sun, Jianping; Xu, Bin; Dai, Yanchao; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Chi; Peng, Yanchun; Feng, Yingmei; Li, Ang; Hu, Zhongjie; Xiang, Haiping; Ogg, Graham; Ho, Ling-Pei; McMichael, Andrew J; Jin, Ronghua; Knight, Julian C; Dong, Tao; Zhang, Yonghong",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.139834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501293/,345

DEB is associated with higher HbA1c levels and increased risk of developing complications to T1D. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of DEB in a Danish cohort of children and adolescents with T1D aged 11-19 years and to characterize them regarding metabolic control and relevant clinical data. RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS In a cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence of DEB using the revised Diabetes Eating Problem Survey (DEPS-R) questionnaire. HbA1c and relevant clinical data were obtained at the time they filled in the questionnaire. RESULTS 192 children and adolescents (46% girls) aged 11-19 years with T1D were included from the pediatric diabetes outpatient clinic. A total of 40 participants (21%) had DEB. The prevalence was higher amongst girls compared with boys (34.1% vs 8.9%) and those who had DEB were older (16.7 vs 15.0 years, P < 0.001), had longer duration of T1D (7.5 vs 4.9 years, P < 0.001), higher BMI Z-scores (1.2 vs 0.3, P < 0.001), higher HbA1c (72.8 (8.8%) vs 62.0 (7.8%) mmol/mol, P < 0.001), higher total cholesterol (4.6 mmoL/L vs 4.2 mmoL/L, P = 0.0048) and LDL (2.7 vs 2.3, P = 0.001) compared with those with no signs of DEB. CONCLUSION As in other countries, the prevalence of DEB is high in Danish adolescents with T1D. Early detection of DEB is essential to prevent short- and long-term complications to T1D.

75656,"High anemia prevalence in Korean older adults, an advent healthcare problem: 2007-2016 KNHANES.",2020-11-26,"Lithium is a mood stabiliser widely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of mania, bipolar disorders and recurrent depression. Treatment with lithium can give rise to various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including thyroid dysfunction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypercalcaemia. Lithium may induce hypercalcaemia through both acute and chronic effects. The initial acute effects are potentially reversible and occur as a result of lithium's action on the calcium-sensing receptor pathway and glycogen synthase kinase 3, giving rise to a biochemical picture similar to that seen in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. In the long term, chronic lithium therapy leads to permanent changes within the parathyroid glands by either unmasking hyperparathyroidism in patients with a subclinical parathyroid adenoma or possibly by initiating multiglandular hyperparathyroidism. The latter biochemical picture is identical to that of primary hyperparathyroidism. Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients on chronic lithium therapy, is associated with increased morbidity. Hence, regular monitoring of calcium levels in patients on lithium therapy is of paramount importance as early recognition of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism can improve outcomes. This review focuses on the definition, pathophysiology, presentation, investigations and management of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism.","Mifsud, Simon; Cilia, Kyle; Mifsud, Emma L; Gruppetta, Mark",British journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12968/hmed.2020.0457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263481/,345
75675,Incorporating telemedicine as part of COVID-19 outbreak response systems.,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND Swine outbreaks of pandemic influenza A (pH1N1) suggest human introduction of the virus into herds. This study investigates a pH1N1 outbreak occurring on a swine research farm with 37 humans and 1300 swine in Alberta, Canada, from 12 June through 4 July 2009. METHODS The staff was surveyed about symptoms, vaccinations, and livestock exposures. Clinical findings were recorded, and viral testing and molecular characterization of isolates from humans and swine were performed. Human serological testing and performance of the human influenza-like illness (ILI) case definition were also studied. RESULTS Humans were infected before swine. Seven of 37 humans developed ILI, and 2 (including the index case) were positive for pH1N1 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Swine were positive for pH1N1 by RT-PCR 6 days after contact with the human index case and developed symptoms within 24 h of their positive viral test results. Molecular characterization of the entire viral genomes from both species showed minor nucleotide heterogeneity, with 1 amino acid change each in the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes. Sixty-seven percent of humans with positive serological test results and 94% of swine with positive swab specimens had few or no symptoms. Compared with serological testing, the human ILI case definition had a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 33.3%. The only factor associated with seropositivity was working in the swine nursery. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic data support human-to-swine transmission, and molecular characterization confirms that virtually identical viruses infected humans and swine in this outbreak. Both species had mild illness and recovered without sequelae.","Forgie, Sarah E; Keenliside, Julia; Wilkinson, Craig; Webby, Richard; Lu, Patricia; Sorensen, Ole; Fonseca, Kevin; Barman, Subrata; Rubrum, Adam; Stigger, Evelyn; Marrie, Thomas J; Marshall, Frank; Spady, Donald W; Hu, Jia; Loeb, Mark; Russell, Margaret L; Babiuk, Lorne A",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciq030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21148514/,345

76400,Longitudinal Neurocognitive and Pulmonological Profile of Long Covid: the COVIMMUNE-Clin Study Protocol.,2021-09-08,"Accurate predictions of motor impairment after stroke are of cardinal importance for the patient, clinician, and healthcare system. More than 10 years ago, the proportional recovery rule was introduced by promising that high-fidelity predictions of recovery following stroke were based only on the initially lost motor function, at least for a specific fraction of patients. However, emerging evidence suggests that this recovery rule is subject to various confounds and may apply less universally than previously assumed. Here, we systematically revisited stroke outcome predictions by applying strategies to avoid confounds and fitting hierarchical Bayesian models. We jointly analysed 385 post-stroke trajectories from six separate studies-one of the largest overall datasets of upper limb motor recovery. We addressed confounding ceiling effects by introducing a subset approach and ensured correct model estimation through synthetic data simulations. Subsequently, we used model comparisons to assess the underlying nature of recovery within our empirical recovery data. The first model comparison, relying on the conventional fraction of patients called 'fitters', pointed to a combination of proportional to lost function and constant recovery. 'Proportional to lost' here describes the original notion of proportionality, indicating greater recovery in case of a more severe initial impairment. This combination explained only 32% of the variance in recovery, which is in stark contrast to previous reports of >80%. When instead analysing the complete spectrum of subjects, 'fitters' and 'non-fitters', a combination of proportional to spared function and constant recovery was favoured, implying a more significant improvement in case of more preserved function. Explained variance was at 53%. Therefore, our quantitative findings suggest that motor recovery post-stroke may exhibit some characteristics of proportionality. However, the variance explained was substantially reduced compared to what has previously been reported. This finding motivates future research moving beyond solely behaviour scores to explain stroke recovery and establish robust and discriminating single-subject predictions.","Bonkhoff, Anna K; Hope, Thomas; Bzdok, Danilo; Guggisberg, Adrian G; Hawe, Rachel L; Dukelow, Sean P; Rehme, Anne K; Fink, Gereon R; Grefkes, Christian; Bowman, Howard",Brain : a journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601678/,345

METHODS Sixty extracted, single-rooted human teeth were cleaned, shaped, and divided into four groups. Experimental groups 1 (n = 20) and 2 (n = 20) were irrigated with 1 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml of S. persica, respectively. The positive controls (n = 10) were irrigated with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), while the negative controls (n = 10) were irrigated with saline. Approximately 5 ml of the irrigating solution was delivered into the root canals for 5 min, and the final rinse was performed with 5 ml of 1% sodium hypochlorite. Scanning electron microscopy was used to evaluate the endodontic smear layer removal at the coronal, middle, and apical thirds of the specimens. RESULTS A significant difference in smear layer removal between groups 1 and 2 at the coronal and middle thirds of the canal was observed, and no significant difference was seen between group 2 and the positive control at the coronal third. At the apical third, both concentrations of S. persica had similar effects and were less effective than the positive control in removing the smear layer. CONCLUSION The 5 mg/ml S. persica solution was significantly more effective than the 1 mg/ml solution. In addition, the 5 mg/ml S. persica solution was as effective as 17% EDTA in removing the smear layer from the coronal third of the canal wall.","Balto, Hanan; Ghandourah, Basma; Al-Sulaiman, Hala",The Saudi dental journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sdentj.2012.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23960532/,345
77057,A Review of Dry Eye Questionnaires: Measuring Patient-Reported Outcomes and Health-Related Quality of Life.,2020-08-05,"Residues within processed protein fragments bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) glycoproteins have been considered to function as a series of ""independent pegs"" that either anchor the peptide (p) to the MHC-I and/or interact with the spectrum of alphabeta-T-cell receptors (TCRs) specific for the pMHC-I epitope in question. Mining of the extensive pMHC-I structural database established that many self- and viral peptides show extensive and direct interresidue interactions, an unexpected finding that has led us to the idea of ""constrained"" peptides. Mutational analysis of two constrained peptides (the HLA B44 restricted self-peptide (B44DPalpha-EEFGRAFSF) and an H2-D(b) restricted influenza peptide (D(b)PA, SSLENFRAYV) demonstrated that the conformation of the prominently exposed arginine in both peptides was governed by interactions with MHC-I-orientated flanking residues from the peptide itself. Using reverse genetics in a murine influenza model, we revealed that mutation of an MHC-I-orientated residue (SSLENFRAYV --> SSLENARAYV) within the constrained PA peptide resulted in a diminished cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and the recruitment of a limited pMHC-I specific TCR repertoire. Interactions between individual peptide positions can thus impose fine control on the conformation of pMHC-I epitopes, whereas the perturbation of such constraints can lead to a previously unappreciated mechanism of viral escape.","Theodossis, Alex; Guillonneau, Carole; Welland, Andrew; Ely, Lauren K; Clements, Craig S; Williamson, Nicholas A; Webb, Andrew I; Wilce, Jacqueline A; Mulder, Roger J; Dunstone, Michelle A; Doherty, Peter C; McCluskey, James; Purcell, Anthony W; Turner, Stephen J; Rossjohn, Jamie",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1000032107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20212169/,345

81741,Why we stopped using the term 'aftercare'.,2021-05-27,"BACKGROUND Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common congenital infection globally, however information about CMV is not routinely included in antenatal education in the United Kingdom. This feasibility study aimed to gather the essential data needed to design and power a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the efficacy of a digital intervention in reducing the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy. In order to do this, we carried out a single-centre RCT, which explored the knowledge, attitudes and risk reduction behaviours in women in the intervention and treatment as usual groups, pre- and post-intervention. METHODS CMV seronegative women living with a child less than four years old, receiving antenatal care at a single UK tertiary centre, were randomised to the digital intervention or 'treatment as usual' groups. Participants completed questionnaires before the digital intervention and after and at 34 gestational weeks, and responses within groups and between groups were compared using tailored randomisation tests. CMV serology was tested in the first trimester and at the end of pregnancy. RESULTS Of the 878 women screened, 865 samples were analysed with 43% (n = 372) being CMV seronegative and therefore eligible to take part in the RCT; of these, 103 (27.7%) women were enrolled and 87 (84%) of these completed the study. Most participants (n = 66; 64%) were unfamiliar with CMV at enrolment, however at 34 gestational weeks, women in the intervention group (n = 51) were more knowledgeable about CMV compared to the treatment as usual group (n = 52) and reported engaging in activities that may increase the risk of CMV transmission less frequently. The digital intervention was highly acceptable to pregnant women. Overall, four participants seroconverted over the course of the study: two from each study group. CONCLUSIONS A large multi-centre RCT investigating the efficacy of a CMV digital intervention is feasible in the United Kingdom; this study has generated essential data upon which to power such a study. This single-centre feasibility RCT demonstrates that a digital educational intervention is associated with increase in knowledge about CMV and can result in behaviour change which may reduce the risk of CMV acquisition in pregnancy.

Herein, we aimed to investigate unclear issues related to transmission and pathogenesis of disease as well as accuracy of diagnostic tests and treatment modalities. A literature search on PubMed, Ovid, and EMBASE databases was conducted, and articles pertinent to identified search terms were extracted. A snow-ball search strategy was followed in order to retrieve additional relevant articles. It was reported that viral spread may occur during the asymptomatic phase of infection, and viral load was suggested to be a useful marker to assess disease severity. In contrast to immune response against viral infections, cytotoxic T lymphocytes decline in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be partially explained by direct invasion of T lymphocytes or apoptosis activated by SARS-CoV-2. Dysregulation of the urokinase pathway, cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by FXa and FIIa, and consumption coagulopathy were the proposed mechanisms of the coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19. False-negative rates of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction varied between 3% and 41% across studies. The probability of the positive test was proposed to decrease with the number of days past from symptom onset.

Optimal donor and recipient sites remain a matter of debate. We describe the technique and outcomes of a laparoscopically harvested extended gastroepiploic VLN flap with two levels of inset. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between 2014 and 2015, four-patients with upper limb breast cancer-related lymphedema and three-patients with lower limb pelvic cancer-related lymphedema who underwent VLN transfers were included. After harvest, the gastroepiploic VLN flap was divided into two halves that were separately inset at the level of elbow and wrist (upper limb) or knee and ankle (lower limb). The mean patient age was 53.1 years (range, 42-65 years). RESULTS The average flap size after division was 6.3 cm in length (range, 5-7 cm) and 3.4 cm in width (range, 3-4 cm). The mean pedicle length was 3.2 cm (range, 2.5-4 cm). All flaps survived completely. No donor or recepient site complication was noted. At a mean follow-up of 9.7 months (range, 8-11 months), the mean circumference reduction rate was 43.7 ± 2.5% along the entire limb (P < 0.05). No episode of infection was noted postoperatively.

85489,Child Development Outcomes of DIR/Floortime TM-based Programs: A Systematic Review.,2020-02-04,"BACKGROUND Neurons are the basic structural unit of the brain, and their morphology is a key determinant of their classification. The morphology of a neuronal circuit is a fundamental component in neuron modeling. Recently, single-neuron morphologies of the whole brain have been used in many studies. The correctness and completeness of semimanually traced neuronal morphology are credible. However, there are some inaccuracies in semimanual tracing results. The distance between consecutive nodes marked by humans is very long, spanning multiple voxels. On the other hand, the nodes are marked around the centerline of the neuronal fiber, not on the centerline. Although these inaccuracies do not seriously affect the projection patterns that these studies focus on, they reduce the accuracy of the traced neuronal skeletons. These small inaccuracies will introduce deviations into subsequent studies that are based on neuronal morphology files. RESULTS We propose a neuronal digital skeleton optimization method to evaluate and make fine adjustments to a digital skeleton after neuron tracing. Provided that the neuronal fiber shape is smooth and continuous, we describe its physical properties according to two shape restrictions. One restriction is designed based on the grayscale image, and the other is designed based on geometry. These two restrictions are designed to finely adjust the digital skeleton points to the neuronal fiber centerline. With this method, we design the three-dimensional shape restriction workflow of neuronal skeleton adjustment computation. The performance of the proposed method has been quantitatively evaluated using synthetic and real neuronal image data. The results show that our method can reduce the difference between the traced neuronal skeleton and the centerline of the neuronal fiber. Furthermore, morphology metrics such as the neuronal fiber length and radius become more precise. CONCLUSIONS This method can improve the accuracy of a neuronal digital skeleton based on traced results. The greater the accuracy of the digital skeletons that are acquired, the more precise the neuronal morphologies that are analyzed will be.","Jiang, Siqi; Pan, Zhengyu; Feng, Zhao; Guan, Yue; Ren, Miao; Ding, Zhangheng; Chen, Shangbin; Gong, Hui; Luo, Qingming; Li, Anan",BMC bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03714-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887543/,345
85555,A systematic review of occupational therapy interventions in the transition from homelessness.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION There are no pharmacotherapies available for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and many compounds have failed clinical trials. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a β-galactoside binding protein associated with many disease pathologies, including chronic inflammation and fibrogenesis. It has been implicated in the disease severity of NASH, although its precise role is unknown. Inhibition of Galectin-3 has shown to improve and prevent fibrosis progression and has now reached phase III clinical trial in NASH patients. AREAS COVERED This review discusses the role of Galectin-3 in NASH. It brings together what we currently know of the role of Gal-3 in NASH and hepatic fibrosis by analyzing recent data from animal model studies and clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION Galectin-3 inhibitors, in particular Belapectin (GR-MD-02), have shown to be promising therapies for NASH with advanced fibrosis. In a phase 2 trial, Belapectin didn't meet the primary endpoint. However, a sub-analysis of Belapectin among a separate group of patients without esophageal varices showed that 2 mg/kg of GR-MD-02 reduced HVPG and the development of new varices. There is a subsequent study in the way, aiming to replicate the positive findings in phase 2 and demonstrate greater efficacy. If Belapectin is shown to be effective, it is expected that it will be combined with other drugs such as those that target steatohepatitis to maximize efficacy and disease reversal.","Al Attar, Atef; Antaramian, Ani; Noureddin, Mazen",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2021.1894127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612037/,345
85973,Treatment-refractory posttraumatic stress disorder (TRPTSD): a review and framework for the future.,2016,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are among the World Health Organization's top 8 emerging pathogens. Both zoonoses share nonspecific early symptoms, a high lethality rate, and a reduced number of specific treatment options. Therefore, we evaluated extracorporeal virus and glycoprotein (GP) elimination by lectin affinity plasmapheresis (LAP). METHODS For both MERS-CoV (pseudovirus) as well as MARV (GPs), 4 LAP devices (Mini Hemopurifiers, Aethlon Medical, San Diego, CA, USA) and 4 negative controls were tested. Samples were collected every 30 min and analyzed for reduction in virus infectivity by a flow cytometry-based infectivity assay (MERS-CoV) and in soluble GP content (MARV) by an immunoassay. RESULTS The experiments show a time-dependent clearance of MERS-CoV of up to 80% within 3 h (pseudovirus). Up to 70% of MARV-soluble GPs were eliminated at the same time. Substantial saturation of the binding resins was detected within the first treatment hour. CONCLUSION MERS-CoV (pseudovirus) and MARV soluble GPs are eliminated by LAP in vitro. Considering the high lethality and missing established treatment options, LAP should be evaluated in vivo. Especially early initiation, continuous therapy, and timed cartridge exchanges could be of importance.","Koch, Benjamin; Schult-Dietrich, Patricia; Büttner, Stefan; Dilmaghani, Bijan; Lohmann, Dario; Baer, Patrick C; Dietrich, Ursula; Geiger, Helmut",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000487224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29698959/,345
86190,COVID-19 and Racial/Ethnic Disparities.,2020-05-11,"PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Definitive diagnosis of disease involving the parenchymal abdominal viscera often requires a representative specimen of affected tissue. Methods used to obtain tissue samples range from those that are minimally invasive, such as fine-needle aspiration (FNA), to more invasive techniques such as surgical biopsy. CLINICAL CHALLENGES FNA and cytological examination can be a useful diagnostic tool and is commonly used for hepatic, splenic and lymph node specimens. FNA is an easy and cheap procedure that is best suited to diffuse disease and can be performed at low risk to the patient. However, its accuracy and agreement with the histopathological findings vary depending on the underlying disease and it often fails to provide information on parenchymal architecture. Importantly, FNA for cytological examination of the liver has serious limitations when used to identify the primary disease process due to the small sample size obtained. AUDIENCE This review is aimed at clinicians undertaking more detailed and specialist investigation of diseases of feline parenchymal abdominal organs and provides practical guidance on the different methods used to obtain hepatic, renal, pancreatic and splenic specimens in cats.

86430,The outbreak that was always here: Racial trauma in the context of COVID-19 and implications for mental health providers.,2020-06-18,"Whether burnout is a form of depression or a distinct phenomenon is an object of controversy. The aim of the present article was to provide an up-to-date review of the literature dedicated to the question of burnout-depression overlap. A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, PsycINFO, and IngentaConnect. A total of 92 studies were identified as informing the issue of burnout-depression overlap. The current state of the art suggests that the distinction between burnout and depression is conceptually fragile. It is notably unclear how the state of burnout (i.e., the end stage of the burnout process) is conceived to differ from clinical depression. Empirically, evidence for the distinctiveness of the burnout phenomenon has been inconsistent, with the most recent studies casting doubt on that distinctiveness. The absence of consensual diagnostic criteria for burnout and burnout research's insufficient consideration of the heterogeneity of depressive disorders constitute major obstacles to the resolution of the raised issue. In conclusion, the epistemic status of the seminal, field-dominating definition of burnout is questioned. It is suggested that systematic clinical observation should be given a central place in future research on burnout-depression overlap.","Bianchi, Renzo; Schonfeld, Irvin Sam; Laurent, Eric",Clinical psychology review,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2015.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25638755/,345

We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. RECENT FINDING To date, no randomized prospective studies have been published; recommendations are based on some observational studies, case reports, and expert opinions. The article provides an overview of the most important publications, presents the current results of the German Registry for PIMS and expert recommendations for treatment. SUMMARY MIS-C PIMS is a new syndrome that is associated with a variety of virus infections, and also with SARS-CoV-2. The main characteristics are fever, multiple organ dysfunction due to a hyper-inflammatory state. In particular, cardiac dysfunction and severe shock. A high proportion of patients require intensive medical care, but the absolute number of children with SARS-CoV-2 MIS-C is low. Medical therapy is based on pathophysiologic considerations and is not evidence-based. Immunoglobulins, steroids and biologics are used and lead to effective treatment. Therefore, the mortality rate is very low. Patients usually recover within days, sequelae are reported only in a minority of cases.","Piekarski, Florian; Steinbicker, Andrea U; Armann, Jakob P",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000001024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34052825/,345
87188,Improving medication appropriateness in nursing homes via structured interprofessional medication-review supported by health information technology: a non-randomized controlled study.,2020-11-26,"BACKGROUND In 2017, the American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) published expert panel recommendations for patients at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) and those affected by BCRL. This study sought to determine BCRL practice patterns. METHODS A survey was sent to 2975 ASBrS members. Questions evaluated members' clinical practice type, practice duration, and familiarity with BCRL recommendations. Descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were used. RESULTS Of the ASBrS members surveyed, 390 (13.1%) responded. Most of the breast surgeons (58.5%, 228/390) indicated unfamiliarity with recommendations. Nearly all respondents (98.7%, 385/390) educate at-risk patients. Most (60.2%, 234/389) instruct patients to avoid venipuncture, injection or blood pressure measurements in the at-risk arm, and 35.6% (138/388) recommend prophylactic compression sleeve use during air travel. Nearly all (97.7%, 380/389) encourage those at-risk to exercise, including resistance exercise (86.2%, 331/384). Most do not perform axillary reverse mapping (ARM) (67.9%, 264/389) or a lymphatic preventive healing approach (LYMPHA) (84.9%, 331/390). Most (76.1%, 296/389) screen at-risk patients for BCRL. The most frequently used screening tools include self-reported symptoms (81%, 255/315), circumferential tape measure (54%, 170/315) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (27.3%, 86/315). After a BCRL diagnosis, most (90%, 351/390) refer management to a lymphedema-certified physical therapist. For affected patients, nearly all encourage exercise (98.7%, 384/389). Many (49%, 191/390) refer affected patients for consideration of lymphovenous bypass or lymph node transfer. CONCLUSION Most respondents were unfamiliar with the ASBrS expert panel recommendations for patients at risk for BCRL and those affected by BCRL. Opportunities exist to increase awareness of best practices and to acquire ARM and LYMPHA technical expertise.","DeSnyder, Sarah M; Yi, Min; Boccardo, Francesco; Feldman, Sheldon; Klimberg, V Suzanne; Smith, Mark; Thiruchelvam, Paul T R; McLaughlin, Sarah",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-021-10494-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34333706/,345
87257,The COVID-19 pandemic reduced paediatric emergency department visits but did not significantly increase urgent cases.,2021-10-06,"Glucocorticoids are extensively used for a variety of conditions including those associated with dysregulation of immune and inflammatory responses as primary etiopathogenic factors. Indeed, the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm of COVID-19 is the latest condition for which the use of a glucocorticoid has been advocated. Recognition of serious adverse effects of glucocorticoids has led to research aimed at unraveling molecular basis by which they impact immune and inflammatory events with the ultimate objective of devising novel therapies to circumvent glucocorticoids-related adverse outcomes. Consequently, GILZ protein was discovered and is increasingly recognized as the pivotal regulator of the effects of glucocorticoids on immune and inflammatory responses. Importantly, the advent of GILZ-based options raises the prospect of their eventual therapeutic use for a variety of conditions accompanied with dysregulation of immune and inflammatory responses and associated target organ complications. Thus, the objective of this minireview is to describe our current understanding of the role of GILZ in the cardiovascular system and the kidney along with outcome of GILZ-based interventions on associated disorders. This information is also of relevance for emerging complications of COVID-19. Significance Statement GILZ was initially discovered as the pivotal mediator of immune regulatory/suppressive effects of glucocorticoids. Since the use of glucocorticoids is associated with serious adverse effects, GILZ-based formulations could offer therapeutic advantages. Thus, this minireview will describe our current understanding of the role of GILZ in the kidney and the cardiovascular system which is of relevance and significance for pathologies affecting them including the multiorgan complications of COVID-19.","Mozaffari, Mahmood",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008869/,345

There is a lack of data on disrespect and abuse of women during the process of childbirth at health facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of disrespect and abuse of women during the process of childbirth at health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS The PRISMA guideline protocol was followed to write the systematic review and meta-analysis. Published studies were searched from Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Maternal and infant care, science direct, and PsycINFO. Articles were accessed by three reviewers (ZY, BT and AA) using the following key terms, ""attitude of health personnel"" AND ""delivery obstetrics*/nursing"" OR ""maternity care"" AND ""disrespect"" OR ""abuse"" OR ""professional misconduct"" AND ""parturition"" AND ""prevalence"" AND ""professional-patient relations"" AND ""Sub-Saharan Africa"". Additional articles were retrieved by cross referencing of reference. The heterogeneity of studies were weighed using Cochran's Q test and I2 test statistics. Publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. RESULTS Thirty three studies met the inclusion and included in this systematic review and meta-analysis of disrespect and abuse of women during the process of childbirth at health facilities. The pooled prevalence of disrespect and abuse women during the process of childbirth at health facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa was 44.09% (95% CI: 29.94-58.24).Particularly physical abuse was 15.77% (95% CI: 13.38-18.15), non-confidential care was 16.87% (95% CI: 14.49-19.24), abandonment was 16.86% (95% CI: 13.88-19.84) and detention was 4.81% (95% CI: 3.96-5.67). CONCLUSION In this study disrespect and abuse of women during the process of childbirth at health facilities are high compared with other studies, particularly non-confidential care and abandonment his high compared with other studies.

Given that challenge, there have been limited studies exploring this issue. Through a nationwide online survey, we assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward COVID-19 among Indonesian youth and potential interventions to improve their behavior. We found that Indonesian youth had good knowledge of COVID-19, but their practices remained poor. Noncompliance was more frequent in males, students in Islamic high schools, those residing outside the Java-Bali islands, and students living in a lower income household. Significant barriers included lack of regulation, difficulties in avoiding crowds, and soap shortage. Their exposure to and trust in the internet was very high.

Meanwhile, excessive arterial stiffness and impaired vasorelaxation, in turn, contribute to worsening insulin resistance and the development of diabetes. Molecular mechanisms promoting hypertension in diabetes include inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system, mitochondria dysfunction, excessive oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. This review highlights recent studies which have uncovered new underlying mechanisms for the increased propensity for the development of hypertension in association with diabetes. These include enhanced activation of epithelial sodium channels, alterations in extracellular vesicles and their microRNAs, abnormal gut microbiota, and increased renal sodium-glucose cotransporter activity, which collectively predispose to hypertension in association with diabetes. This review also covers socioeconomic factors and currently recommended blood pressure targets and related treatment strategies in diabetic patients with hypertension.","Jia, Guanghong; Sowers, James R",Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.121.17981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34601960/,345

Rapid increases in patient volumes have exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems and challenged our ability to provide optimal patient care and adequate safety measures to healthcare workers (HCWs). OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that US neurologists were experiencing significant challenges with lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), rapid changes in practice and varying institutional protocols, we conducted this survey study. METHODS A 36-item survey was distributed to neurologists around the US through various media platforms. RESULTS Over a one-week period, 567 responses were received. Of these, 56% practiced in academia. A total of 87% had access to PPE with 45% being asked to reuse PPE due to shortages. The pandemic caused rapid changes in practice, most notably a shift towards providing care by teleneurology, although a third experienced challenges in transitioning to this model. Wide variations were noted both in testing and in the guidance provided for the exposed, sick or vulnerable HCWs. Notably, 59% of respondents felt that their practices were doing what they could, although 56% did not feel safe taking care of patients. CONCLUSIONS Results from our survey demonstrate significant variability in preparedness and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic in neurology, impacted by region, health care setting and practice model. Practice guidelines from professional societies and other national entities are needed to improve protection for physicians and their patients, promote recommended practice changes during a pandemic, and optimize future preparedness for public health emergencies.","Sharma, Akanksha; Maxwell, Christina R; Farmer, Jill; Greene-Chandos, Diana; LaFaver, Kathrin; Benameur, Karima",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000009844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32439820/,345

92283,Getting down to business: an examination of occupational outcomes in cognitive behavioral therapy for depression.,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND Although documentation of harm towards children and young people has existed for centuries, it was not until the 1960s that it became a specific focus for health professionals. Since that time, the importance of protective social networks has become better understood. The concept of trusted adults has come into sharper focus, with children being encouraged to develop networks of dependable adults to turn to for support in times of need. While many child protection processes highlight risks to younger children, there has been less emphasis on older children. The role of trusted adults may be particularly important during adolescence, due to burgeoning independence, developing sexuality, relationship formation, and associated vulnerabilities. While important choices relating to health and education are made during this period, there is little formal evidence relating to the impact of trusted adults on such outcomes. This review therefore aims to focus on the role and influence of trusted adults for adolescents. METHODS This study is a scoping review. A broad range of databases will be searched, including MEDLINE, ERIC, Education Abstracts, Web of Science, ASSIA, Sociological Abstracts, and PsycINFO. Predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria will be used, with a focus on outcomes relating to health and education. Two reviewers will blind screen papers independently at all screening stages, with conflicts being resolved by a third reviewer. Quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as unpublished (grey) literature/reports, will be included. We will use the World Health Organization's 'second decade' definition of adolescence. We aim to collate and map evidence in a broad overview and produce meta-analyses of homogenous data. Where this is not possible, a narrative summary will be produced. DISCUSSION There appears to be sparse knowledge regarding the role of trusted adults for adolescents. Potential benefits to health and wellbeing may impact on educational attainment, and vice versa. These areas are of particular relevance during the second decade, when decisions that affect future direction, achievement, and wellbeing are being made. The increased understanding of the role of trusted adults provided by this review may help to inform practice and policy and lead to potential benefits for the health and education of adolescents.

We constructed an integrated disease outbreak and surge capacity model to evaluate the ability of a region's healthcare system to provide care in the event of a pandemic. In a case study, we implement the model to investigate how an influenza pandemic similar to the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic would affect the population of the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill metropolitan statistical area and the ability of the region's hospital system to respond to such an event. Under varying scenarios for hospital capacity, we found that the population needing care would overwhelm the system's ability to provide care in the case study. Our model is presented as a framework that can be augmented and expanded to suit the needs of the particular event and healthcare system or services required. By integrating concepts and models from epidemiology, geography, and health care services research, we provide a valuable tool for potential use in disaster planning, hospital system evaluation, and pandemic preparedness.","Woodul, Rachel L; Delamater, Paul L; Emch, Michael",Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2019.100285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421794/,345

In January 2016, diarrhoea with occasional vomiting was observed in a small pig farm in Hungary. All animals became affected, while mortality (of up to 30%) was only seen in piglets. Samples from different age groups and the carcass of a piglet were examined by various methods including pathology, bacteriology and molecular biology. PEDV was confirmed by PCR and its whole genome sequence was determined. The sequence PEDV HUN/5031/2016 showed high identity with recently reported European viruses. Differences were found mostly in the S gene, where recombination was detected with a newly identified and already recombinant swine enteric coronavirus (Se-CoV) from Italy. The present report describes the first porcine epidemic diarrhoea outbreak in Hungary after many years and gives an insight into the genetics of the Hungarian PEDV.","Valkó, Anna; Biksi, Imre; Cságola, Attila; Tuboly, Tamás; Kiss, Krisztián; Ursu, Krisztina; Dán, Ádám",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/004.2017.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28605965/,345

The aim of this follow-up study was to investigate the prognostic value of the surgical margin and the parenchyma- sparing liver resection technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of the data of 319 patients [123 (36.6%) female and 196 (61.4%) male] who had colorectal cancer and underwent surgery to treat colorectal liver metastases in our Department between 2005 and 2014. RESULTS The most commonly used resection type was the non-anatomic resection (43%). Multivariate analysis indicated that there was no significant difference in survival (p=0.473) between the microscopically-negative (R0) and microscopically-positive (R1) resections, as well as between the resection types (p=0.257). CONCLUSION Parenchymal-sparing non-anatomic resection and spray diathermy on the resection surface of the liver should be applied not only for hemostasis, but also to destroy the area containing possible tumor cells after an R1 resection and not to have worse survival outcomes.","Palkovics, András; Vereczkei, András; Kalmár, Károly Nagy; Fincsur, András; Kiss, Isván; Németh, Balázs; Papp, András",Anticancer research,https://doi.org/10.21873/anticanres.13004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396968/,345
94682,Responding to a COVID-19 Outbreak at a Long-Term Care Facility.,2020-09-17,"Ventral hernia repair (VHR) for large abdominal wall defects is challenging. Prior research established that the use of mesh is superior to suture closure alone and that component separation is an effective technique to combat loss of abdominal domain. Studies comparing component separation technique (CST) outcomes utilizing synthetic versus biologic mesh are limited. A retrospective review was conducted of 72 consecutive patients who underwent VHR with CST between 2006 and 2010 at our institution. Surgeon preference and the presence of contamination guided whether synthetic mesh (27 patients) or biologic mesh (45 patients) was used. Mean follow-up interval for all comers was 13.9 months and similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Degree of contamination and severity of premorbid medical conditions were significantly higher in the biologic mesh group, as reflected in the higher Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) score (2.04 versus 2.86). Clinical outcomes, as measured by both minor and major complication rates and recurrence rates, were not significantly different. Minor complication rates were 26% in the synthetic group and 37% in the biologic group and major complication rates 15% in the synthetic group and 22% in the biologic group. There was 1 recurrence (4%) in the synthetic mesh group versus 5 (11%) in the biologic mesh group. Multivariable analysis for major complications revealed no significant difference for either synthetic or biologic mesh while controlling for other variables. Subset analysis of uncontaminated cases revealed recurrence rates of 4% in the synthetic mesh group and 6% in the biologic mesh group. VHR using CST and either synthetic mesh or biologic mesh resulted in low recurrence rates with similar overall complication profiles, despite the higher average VHWG grading score in the biologic mesh group. Our results support the VHWG recommendation for biologic mesh utilization in higher VHWG grade patients. In VHWG grade 2 patients, our clinical outcomes were similar, supporting the use of either type of mesh.","Sandvall, Brinkley K; Suver, Daniel W; Said, Hakim K; Mathes, David W; Neligan, Peter C; Dellinger, E Patchen; Louie, Otway",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000000253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003419/,345
94849,Prevalence of Psychotropic and Opioid Prescription Fills Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Dementia in the US.,2020-08-18,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to explore the perceived effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) social distancing restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss. DESIGN Participants were 129 adults (48.1% female, mean age 64.4 years) with an audiometric hearing loss, living in Glasgow, Scotland. A rapidly deployed 24-item online questionnaire asked about the effects of certain aspects of lockdown, including face masks, social distancing, and video calling, on participants' behavior, emotions, hearing performance, practical issues, and tinnitus. Data were analyzed descriptively across the entire sample, and with Chi-squared tests for differences between subgroups self-reporting relatively good and relatively poor unaided hearing, respectively. Additional free-text responses provided further perspectives. RESULTS Behavior: Video calls are used more frequently than prelockdown. The better-hearing group use their hearing aids less. Emotions: There is increased anxiety (especially among the worse hearing group) concerning verbal communication situations and access to audiology services, and greater rumination about one's own hearing loss. Enjoyment of group video calls is mixed. The worse hearing group shows substantial relief at not being obliged to attend challenging social gatherings. Across both groups, a majority would like to see all key workers equipped with transparent face masks. Hearing performance: A large majority finds it hard to converse with people in face masks due to muffled sound and lack of speechreading cues, but conversing at a safe distance is not universally problematic. In the worse hearing group, performance in video calls is generally inferior to face-to-face, but similar to telephone calls. Those who use live subtitling in video calls appreciate their value. TV and radio updates about Covid-19 are easy to follow for most respondents. There is only weak evidence of face mask fixtures interfering with hearing aids on the ear, and of tinnitus having worsened during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS With due regard for the limitations of this rapid study, we find that there are many negative-and a few positive-effects of Covid-19 restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss. From a societal perspective, the widespread adoption of clear face masks may alleviate some of the difficulties and anxieties this population experience. From an individual perspective, one may consider using live subtitles on video calls. Manufacturers of hearing devices should consider developing processing modes and accessories specifically designed for video calls. Finally, repair and maintenance services should be resumed as soon as it is safe to do so.","Naylor, Graham; Burke, Louise A; Holman, Jack A",Ear and hearing,https://doi.org/10.1097/aud.0000000000000948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136621/,345
95490,The relative incidence of COVID-19 in healthcare workers versus non-healthcare workers: evidence from a web-based survey of Facebook users in the United States.,2020,"The newly emerging Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like disease with ∼43% mortality. Given the recent detection of virus in dromedary camels, zoonotic transfer of MERS-CoV to humans is suspected. In addition, little is known about the role of human neutralizing Ab (nAb) pressure as a driving force in MERS-CoV adaptive evolution. Here, we used a well-characterized nonimmune human Ab-phage library and a panning strategy with proteoliposomes and cells to identify seven human nAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV Spike protein. These nAbs bind to three different epitopes in the RBD and human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) interface with subnanomolar/nanomolar binding affinities and block the binding of MERS-CoV Spike protein with its hDPP4 receptor. Escape mutant assays identified five amino acid residues that are critical for neutralization escape. Despite the close proximity of the three epitopes on the RBD interface, escape from one epitope did not have a major impact on neutralization with Abs directed to a different epitope. Importantly, the majority of escape mutations had negative impacts on hDPP4 receptor binding and viral fitness. To our knowledge, these results provide the first report on human nAbs against MERS-CoV that may contribute to MERS-CoV clearance and evolution. Moreover, in the absence of a licensed vaccine or antiviral for MERS, this panel of nAbs offers the possibility of developing human mAb-based immunotherapy, especially for health-care workers.","Tang, Xian-Chun; Agnihothram, Sudhakar S; Jiao, Yongjun; Stanhope, Jeremy; Graham, Rachel L; Peterson, Eric C; Avnir, Yuval; Tallarico, Aimee St Clair; Sheehan, Jared; Zhu, Quan; Baric, Ralph S; Marasco, Wayne A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402074111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24778221/,345

The Quebec Lung Cancer Network, which oversees thoracic oncology services in the province of Quebec under the direction of the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, convened to develop recommendations to deal with the potential disruption of services in thoracic oncology in the province of Quebec. The summary provided here has been adapted from the original document posted on the Programme québécois du cancer Web site at: https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/documents/coronavirus-2019-ncov/PJ1_Recommandations_oncologie-thoracique-200415.pdf. Methods Plans to optimize the health care system and potentially to prioritize services were discussed with respect to various levels of activity. For each level-of-activity scenario, suggestions were made for the services and treatments to prioritize and for those that might have to be postponed, as well as for potential alternatives to care. Results The principal recommendation is that the cancer centre executive committee and the multidisciplinary tumour board always try to find a solution to maintain standard-of-care therapy for all patients with thoracic tumours, using novel approaches to treatment and the adoption of a network approach to care, as needed. Conclusions The effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the health care system remains unpredictable and requires that cancer teams unite and offer the most efficient and innovative therapies to all patients under the various conditions that might be forced upon them.","Blais, N; Bouchard, M; Chinas, M; Lizotte, H; Morneau, M; Spicer, J; Martel, S",Current oncology,https://doi.org/10.3747/co.27.6685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669938/,345

However, safe evacuation of stagnant air during laparoscopic surgery is also necessary to safeguard health care warriors. Methods: We are reporting experience of 24 laparoscopic surgeries using a closed smoke evacuation/filtration system using a ultra low-particulate air (ULPA) filtration capability (ConMed AirSeal® System) at a single center between March 22, 2020, and May 30, 2020. All surgeries were either urgent or emergency in nature. Results: Totally, 17 males and 7 females who required urgent surgery. Most common indication for laparoscopic intervention was acute cholecystitis and complications related to acute cholecystitis. Owing to the closed smoke evacuation system, low intra-abdominal pressure was maintained during all surgeries. Of all procedures, only 0.8 time per procedure, the laparoscope taken out for cleaning. Mean time for completion of surgery was 58 minutes. Compliance of surgical staff was high due to the deemed safe smoke evacuation system. Mean of postoperative pain score was low. Mean hospital stay was 4.9 days. Conclusions: We propose to use a closed smoke evacuation/filtration system with ULPA filtration capability or similar devices in each minimally invasive surgery to reduce risks of transmission as minute as possible until we have enough knowledge about the pattern of disease transmission.","Vaishnav, Dhaivat; Patel, Bhavin",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

97460,Do sleep quality and sleep duration before or after COVID-19 vaccination affect antibody response?,2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND Transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery (TOVS) was developed as a new distinct surgical procedure for hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) and supraglottic cancer (SGC) staged at up to T3. However, long-term treatment outcomes of TOVS remain to be validated. METHODS Under a straight broad intraluminal view provided by combined use of a distending laryngoscope and a videolaryngoscope, we performed en bloc tumor resection via direct bimanual handling of the ready-made straight-form surgical instruments and devices. We retrospectively analyzed functional and oncologic outcomes of 72 patients with HPC (n = 58) or SGC (n = 14) whose minimum follow-up was 24 months or until death. RESULTS The cohort comprised nine patients of Tis, 23 of T1, 33 of T2, and 7 of T3. Among 36 patients (50%) who underwent neck dissection simultaneously, all but one were pathologically node-positive. Twelve patients underwent postoperative concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) as adjuvant treatment, and another four patients underwent radiation or CCRT for second or later primary cancer. The endotracheal tube was removed in an operation room in all but two patients who underwent temporary tracheostomy. Pharyngeal fistula was formed transiently in two patients. The median time until patients resumed oral intake and could take a soft meal was 2 and 5 days, respectively. Eventually, 69 patients (96%) took normal meals. The 5-year cause-specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), larynx-preserved CSS, and loco-regional controlled CSS were 87.3%, 77.9%, 86.0%, and 88.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed N2-3 as an independent prognostic factor in both CSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 25.51, P = 0.008) and OS (HR = 4.90, P = 0.022), which indirectly reflected higher risk of delayed distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Considering its sound functional and oncological outcomes with various practical advantages, TOVS can be a dependable, less invasive, and cost-effective surgical option of an organ-function preservation strategy for HPC and SGC.","Imanishi, Yorihisa; Ozawa, Hiroyuki; Sakamoto, Koji; Fujii, Ryoichi; Shigetomi, Seiji; Habu, Noboru; Otsuka, Kuninori; Sato, Yoichiro; Watanabe, Yoshihiro; Sekimizu, Mariko; Ito, Fumihiro; Tomita, Toshiki; Ogawa, Kaoru",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-017-3396-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28651556/,345
97774,Ankle muscle activation in people with haemophilia.,2012,"Fish contains bioactive polar lipids (PL) and is mainly consumed cooked. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensory characteristics of sous-vide cooked salmon and the in vitro cardio-protective properties of its PL. PL were extracted from brined and un-brined sous-vide preparations in 52 °C, 65 °C, and 80 °C, while their antithrombotic cardio-protective properties were assessed in human platelets and their fatty acid (FA) content was evaluated by LC-MS. Sensory tests were performed using napping followed by check-all-that apply (CATA). Mild temperatures (52 °C, 65 °C) did not affect the inhibitory effect of PL from brined and un-brined salmon, against human platelet aggregation induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF), thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or collagen. In higher temperatures used for pasteurization (80 °C), a reduction of antithrombotic properties was observed in PL from both un-brined and brined salmon samples. This reduction was accompanied by a decrease of their n3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and overall polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) content, but only in the PL of the un-brined salmon preparations. Thus, changes in the fatty acid content of PL of all sous vide salmon preparations, and especially of specific PUFA, seem to be associated with the observed changes in their antithrombotic potency. Changes in the content of the n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), a precursor of EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), seem to be associated with differences observed in the antithrombotic potency of PL from different sous vide salmon preparations. Taste attributes were not affected by the conditions of sous-vide preparations, whereas slight textural differences were observed in samples treated at 65 °C and 80 °C. These outcomes, if combined with the observed low values of the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in PL of all sous-vide preparations, further suggest a beneficial role for such a mild cooking procedure for preserving the antithrombotic and cardio-protective properties of salmon without affecting its sensory characteristics.","Redfern, Shane; Dermiki, Maria; Fox, Shelley; Lordan, Ronan; Shiels, Katie; Kumar Saha, Sushanta; Tsoupras, Alexandros; Zabetakis, Ioannis",Food research international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509521/,345

These value types are linked to three consumer behavior outcomes, i.e., Satisfaction, Repurchase intention, and Word-of-Mouth. The impact of the retail formats is evaluated on the importance and performance of the value types, using a questionnaire for each of the retail formats. The relationship between the value types and outcomes is tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Aesthetics, Altruistic value, and Efficiency are positively linked to Satisfaction. In addition, Efficiency is the key driver for Repurchase intention and has a positive impact on Word-of-Mouth. A positive Word-of-Mouth is predicted by Social value and Service excellence. The three examined retail formats show a difference in Holbrook's value types. Overall, the results of the non- and soft discounters differ from the hard discounters. Remarkably, and contrary to previous studies, the soft discounter's scores are the highest meaning that consumers are most critical for this retail format. It seems that consumers expect the best of both worlds at soft discounters: low prices, interesting bargains, easy access, but also appealing store design, and excellent service.","Janssens, Kim; Lambrechts, Wim; Keur, Henriëtte; Semeijn, Janjaap",Behavioral sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/bs10080127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764232/,345
98208,Trends in Pediatric Primary Care Visits during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-10,"Ribosomal frameshifting occurs when a ribosome slips a few nucleotides on an mRNA and generates a new sequence of amino acids. Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) is used in various systems to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA at precisely regulated levels. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study the dynamics of -1PRF in the Escherichia coli dnaX gene. The frameshifting mRNA (FSmRNA) contained the frameshifting signals: a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a slippery sequence, and a downstream stem loop. The dynamics of ribosomal complexes translating through the slippery sequence were characterized using smFRET between the Cy3-labeled L1 stalk of the large ribosomal subunit and a Cy5-labeled tRNA(Lys) in the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA-binding (P) site. We observed significantly slower elongation factor G (EF-G)-catalyzed translocation through the slippery sequence of FSmRNA in comparison with an mRNA lacking the stem loop, ΔSL. Furthermore, the P-site tRNA/L1 stalk of FSmRNA-programmed pretranslocation (PRE) ribosomal complexes exhibited multiple fluctuations between the classical/open and hybrid/closed states, respectively, in the presence of EF-G before translocation, in contrast with ΔSL-programmed PRE complexes, which sampled the hybrid/closed state approximately once before undergoing translocation. Quantitative analysis showed that the stimulatory stem loop destabilizes the hybrid state and elevates the energy barriers corresponding to subsequent substeps of translocation. The shift of the FSmRNA-programmed PRE complex equilibrium toward the classical/open state and toward states that favor EF-G dissociation apparently allows the PRE complex to explore alternative translocation pathways such as -1PRF.","Kim, Hee-Kyung; Liu, Fei; Fei, Jingyi; Bustamante, Carlos; Gonzalez, Ruben L; Tinoco, Ignacio",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1403457111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706807/,345

The primary endpoint was the percentage of EWL from baseline to 12 months after randomization. Implantable gastric stimulation has been proposed as a first-line treatment for severely obese patients; however, previous investigations have reported inconclusive results. METHODS A total of 190 subjects were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. All patients underwent implantation with the implantable gastric stimulator and were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: the control group (stimulation off) or treatment group (stimulation on). The patients were evaluated on a monthly basis. All individuals who enrolled in this study agreed to consume a diet with a 500-kcal/d deficit and to participate in monthly support group meetings. RESULTS The procedure resulted in no deaths and a low complication rate. The primary endpoint of a difference in weight loss between the treatment and control groups was not met. The control group lost 11.7% +/- 16.9% of excess weight and the treatment group lost 11.8% +/- 17.6% (P = .717) according to an intent-to-treat analysis.

The aims of the present animal study in pigs were to verify: (1) the feasibility of the trans-umbilical route compared with the trans-oral route in gastric upper body ESD; (2) the non-inferiority of single port laparoscopic lymph node dissection (LLND) compared with multiport LLND; and (3) the safety of 2-basin LLND (upper greater and lesser curvature). METHODS We separated the pigs (~40 kg each) into two groups: conventional and experimental (n = 5 per group). We performed ESD in the fundus and upper body anterior wall (UBAW) via the trans-oral route and multiport LLND in the conventional group, and via the trans-umbilical route and single port LLND in the experimental group. RESULTS The completion rates, tissue weights, and specimen diameters of both routes showed no statistical differences in either the fundus or the UBAW. The operative time was shorter with the trans-umbilical route than with the trans-oral route in both areas (p < 0.05). In LLND, there were no differences in surgical outcomes between the multiport and single port groups. Intraoperative perforation was seen in the trans-oral route group (n = 1). Delayed perforation was observed in 30 % of the ESD sites. CONCLUSIONS The trans-umbilical route is feasible and has lower complication rates than the trans-oral route in gastric upper body ESD. Additionally, single port LLND is not inferior to multiport LLND, and one-side-basin dissection is safer than two-side.","Jeong, Sang-Ho; Park, Ji-Ho; Yoo, Moon-Won; Choi, Sang-Kyung; Hong, Soon-Chan; Jung, Eun-Jung; Ju, Young-Tae; Jeong, Chi-Young; Ha, Woo-Song; Ha, Chang Yoon; Lee, Young-Joon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3196-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043643/,345

The total number of extracted myomas was 35 and the types of extracted myoma were subserosal (16 myomas, 45.7%), intramural (nine myomas, 25.7%) and intraligamentary (seven myomas, 20%). In subserosal and intramural myoma, 21 myomas were located at the anterior wall and four myomas were located at the posterior wall of the uterus. Median operation time was 131min (range: 35-232). Estimated intraoperative blood loss was 65mL (range: 20-300), hemoglobin change was 2g/dL (range: 0.5-2.9) and hospital stay was 3 days (range: 1-4). There was no conversion to laparotomy but in one patient (3.6%), LESS-M converted to two-port laparoscopic myomectomy. There was no blood transfusion during and after operation. Intraoperative and postoperative complications did not occur. CONCLUSION Careful selection of patients considering the type and location of myomas is important for successful LESS-M. Myomas located in the anterior wall, subserosal or intraligamentary myomas are appropriate for LESS-M.","Yoon, Aera; Kim, Tae-Joong; Lee, Yoo-Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Bae, Duk-Soo; Kim, Byoung-Gie","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502871/,345

The purpose of this review is to provide the current known clinical characteristics of and management for COVID-19 as it relates to otolaryngology. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory disease with common presenting symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue. In the absence of available vaccines or antiviral therapies, symptomatic and respiratory support is the current standard of therapy. Measures to prevent further transmission have been enacted globally including social distancing and cancellation of public events. Given elevated viral load in the upper aerodigestive tract, extra precautions in patients with otolaryngology needs have been recommended for protection of both healthcare workers and patients. SUMMARY Otolaryngologists face unique risk from COVID-19. Maintaining appropriate preventive health measures and remaining updated on institutional clinical guidelines is paramount for both caretaker safety and patient care.","Miller, Lauren E; Shaye, David A; Lee, Linda N",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/moo.0000000000000632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32618844/,345

We find that the 4f electrons in CeN are highly itinerant and mixed-valence, showing a prominent quasi-particle peak near the Fermi level. On the contrary, they become well localized and display weak valence fluctuation in CeBi. It means that a 4f itinerant-localized crossover could emerge upon changing the X atom from N to Bi. Moreover, according to the low-energy behaviors of 4f self-energy functions, we could conclude that the 4f electrons in CeX also demonstrate interesting orbital-selective electronic correlations, which are similar to the other cerium-based heavy fermion compounds.","Lu, Haiyan; Huang, Li",Journal of physics.

The primary outcome of this study was the required dose of propofol alone or combined with lidocaine to achieve induction of general anesthesia. METHODS This multicenter, double-blinded trial randomized patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III) just before elective surgery with the use of a computer-generated list. Three different propofol 1% formulations-Diprivan (Astra-Zeneca, Cheshire, United Kingdom), Propoven (Fresenius-Kabi AG, Bad Homburg, Germany), and Lipuro (B-Braun, Melshungen AG, Germany)-were compared with either placebo (saline solution) or lidocaine 1% mixed to the propofol solution. Depth of anesthesia was automatically guided by bispectral index and by a computerized closed-loop system for induction, thus avoiding dosing bias. The authors recorded the total dose of propofol and duration of induction and the patient's discomfort through a behavioral scale (facial expression, verbal response, and arm withdrawal) ranging from 0 to 6. The authors further evaluated postoperative recall of pain using a Visual Analog Scale. RESULTS Of the 227 patients enrolled, 217 were available for analysis. Demographic characteristics were similar in each group. Propoven required a higher dose for induction (2.2 ± 0.1 mg/kg) than Diprivan (1.8 ± 0.1 mg/kg) or Lipuro (1.7 ± 0.1 mg/kg; P = 0.02). However, induction doses were similar when propofol formulations were mixed with lidocaine. Patient discomfort during injection was significantly reduced with lidocaine for every formulation: Diprivan (0.5 ± 0.3 vs. 2.3 ± 0.3), Propoven (0.4 ± 0.3 vs. 2.4 ± 0.3), and Lipuro (1.1 ± 0.3 vs. 1.4 ± 0.3), all differences significant, with P < 0.0001. No adverse effect was reported. CONCLUSION Plain propofol formulations are not equipotent, but comparable doses were required when lidocaine was concomitantly administered.","Le Guen, Morgan; Grassin-Delyle, Stanislas; Cornet, Camille; Genty, Antoine; Chazot, Thierry; Dardelle, Dominique; Liu, Ngai; Dreyfus, Jean-François; Mazoit, Jean-Xavier; Devillier, Philippe; Alvarez, Jean-Claude; Sessler, Daniel I; Fischler, Marc",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.anes.0000435741.97234.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24051391/,345

Laboratory test alterations have been described in COVID-19 patients, but differences with other pneumonias have been poorly investigated to date, especially in Caucasian populations. The aim of this study was to investigate differences and prognostic potential of routine blood tests in a series of Italian patients with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia. METHODOLOGY Clinical data and routine laboratory tests of a consecutive series of 30 COVID-19 patients and 30 age and sex matched patients with non COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia have been retrospectively collected. Differences in laboratory tests between patients with COVID-19 and non COVID-19 pneumonias have been investigated, as well as differences between COVID-19 survivors and non survivors. RESULTS COVID-19 patients had lower white blood cells, monocytes, neutrophils, and higher platelet counts. In addition, COVID-19 patients showed higher mean platelet volume, lower C reactive protein concentrations, and higher De Ritis ratio. Combined blood cell indexes of systemic inflammation were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients. In further analysis of the COVID-19 group, the neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR, systemic inflammation response index and De Ritis ratio, were significantly higher in non survivors than in survivors, while the number of platelets was significantly lower in non survivors. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed several alterations in blood cell populations and indexes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in comparison with patients with non COVID-19 pneumonia. Some of these indexes showed promising prognostic abilities. Further studies are necessary to confirm these results.","Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Zinellu, Angelo; Scano, Valentina; Mulas, Giulia; De Riu, Giacomo; Pascale, Rosa M; Arru, Luigi B; Carru, Ciriaco; Pirina, Pietro; Mangoni, Arduino A; Fois, Alessandro G",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.12879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794454/,345
103268,Alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a SARS outbreak.,2008,"Pesticides can enter aquatic environments potentially affecting non-target organisms. Unfortunately, the effects of such substances are still poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of the active neonicotinoid substance thiacloprid (TH) and the commercial product Calypso 480 SC (CA) (active compound 40.4% TH) on Mytilus galloprovincialis after short-term exposure to sublethal concentrations. Mussels were tested for seven days to 0, 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 TH and 0, 10, 50 and 100 mg L-1 CA. For this purpose, several parameters, such as cell viability of haemocytes and digestive cells, biochemical haemolymph features, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity of gills and digestive gland, as well as histology of such tissues were analysed. The sublethal concentrations of both substances lead to abatement or completely stopping the byssal fibres creation. Biochemical analysis of haemolymph showed significant changes (P < 0.01) in electrolytes ions (Cl-, K+, Na+, Ca2+, S-phosphor), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity and glucose concentration following exposure to both substances. The TH-exposed mussels showed significant imbalance (P < 0.05) in CAT activity in digestive gland and gills. CA caused significant decrease (P < 0.05) in SOD activity in gills and in CAT activity in both tissues. Results of histological analyses showed severe damage in both digestive gland and gills in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This study provides useful information about the acute toxicity of a neonicotinoid compound and a commercial insecticide on mussels. Nevertheless, considering that neonicotinoids are still widely used and that mussels are very important species for marine environment and human consumption, further researches are needed to better comprehend the potential risk posed by such compounds to aquatic non-target species.","Stara, Alzbeta; Pagano, Maria; Capillo, Gioele; Fabrello, Jacopo; Sandova, Marie; Albano, Marco; Zuskova, Eliska; Velisek, Josef; Matozzo, Valerio; Faggio, Caterina",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888623/,345

METHODS This prospective, National Institutes of Health-supported study enrolled 34 consecutive patients with 53 CLMs ablated between January 2011 and December 2014. Immediately after ablation, core needle sampling of the ablation zone was performed. Tissue samples were evaluated with fluorescent viability (MitoTracker Red) and nuclear (Hoechst) stains. Confocal microscope imaging was performed within 30 min after ablation. The same samples were subsequently fixed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Identified tumor cells underwent IHC staining for proliferation (Ki67) and viability (OxPhos). The study pathologist, blinded to the H&E and IHC assessment, evaluated the fluorescent images separately to detect viable tumor cells. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall concordance of the fluorescent versus H&E and IHC assessments were calculated. RESULTS A total of 63 tissue samples were collected and processed. The overall concordance rate between the immediate fluorescent and the subsequent H&E and IHC assessments was 94% (59/63). The fluorescent assessment sensitivity and specificity for the identification of tumor cells were respectively 100% (18/18) and 91% (41/45). CONCLUSIONS The study showed a high concordance rate between the immediate fluorescent assessment and the standard H&E and IHC assessment of the ablation zone. Given the documented prognostic value of ablation zone tissue characteristics for outcomes after ablation of CLM, the fluorescent assessment offers a potential intra-procedural biomarker of complete tumor ablation.","Sotirchos, Vlasios S; Fujisawa, Sho; Vakiani, Efsevia; Solomon, Stephen B; Manova-Todorova, Katia O; Sofocleous, Constantinos T",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-018-07133-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830537/,345

TRIM56 is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is stimulated by type I interferon and may function as an antiviral agent. Here, the authors conducted a systematic search on papers that reported antiviral effects of TRIM56. AREAS COVERED The authors conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed database without time or language limitation, after using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Database terms. Initially, a structured search and full article review yielded 31 papers. Relevant original and review articles on TRIM56 were included. The reference lists were then reviewed, and the cited articles were added. Expert opinion: TRIM56 has been shown to have direct antiviral actions against positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses from the families Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae, and Retroviridae. Moreover, it may be effective against negative-sense single-strand RNA viruses from the families Paramyxoviridae and Orthomyxoviridae, as well as a DNA virus, Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). These studies could suggest the potential of a TRIM56-based antiviral against COVID-19 from the family Coronaviridae, containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. However, its efficacy and antiviral mechanisms need to be further examined.","Heidary, Fatemeh; Gharebaghi, Reza",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2020.1822168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32903131/,345

Given the critical role of virus-host interactions in the viral life cycle, the development of entry or shedding inhibitors may expand the current repertoire of antiviral agents; the combination of antireplication inhibitors and entry or shedding inhibitors would create a multifaceted drug cocktail with a tandem antiviral mechanism. Therefore, we provide critical information about triterpenoids as potential antiviral agents targeting entry and release, focusing specifically on the emerging aspect of triterpenoid-mediated inhibition of a variety of virus-host membrane fusion mechanisms via a trimer-of-hairpin motif. These properties of triterpenoids supply their host an evolutionary advantage for chemical defense and may protect against an increasingly diverse array of viruses infecting mammals, providing a direction for antiviral drug discovery.","Li, Haiwei; Sun, Jiaqi; Xiao, Sulong; Zhang, Lihe; Zhou, Demin",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201699/,345

With the ability to simulate native tissue function, hydrogels are potentially well suited for cellular therapy applications. In this study, we have fabricated nanofibrillar cellulose-alginate (NFCA) suture coatings as biomedical devices to help overcome some of the limitations related to cellular therapy, such as low cell survivability and distribution out of target tissue. The addition of sodium alginate 8% (w/v) increased the NFCA hydrogel viscosity, storage and loss moduli by slightly under one order of magnitude, thus contributing significantly to coating strength. Confocal microscopy showed nearly 100% cell viability throughout the 2-week incubation period within and on the surface of the coating. Additionally, typical morphologies in the dual cell culture of spheroid forming HepG2 and monolayer type SK-HEP-1 were observed. Twelve out of 14 NFCA coated surgical sutures remained intact during the suturing operation with various mice and rat tissue; however, partial peeling off was observed in 2 of the coated sutures. We conclude that NFCA suture coatings could perform as cell-carrier systems for cellular based therapy and post-surgical treatment.","Laurén, Patrick; Somersalo, Petter; Pitkänen, Irina; Lou, Yan-Ru; Urtti, Arto; Partanen, Jouni; Seppälä, Jukka; Madetoja, Mari; Laaksonen, Timo; Mäkitie, Antti; Yliperttula, Marjo",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829830/,345

METHODS Thirty-four patients (5 males, 29 females; median age, 61 years; range, 34 to 80) were injected with 4 x 1 ml of NASHA Dx gel, just above the dentate line in the submucosal layer. The primary end point was change in the number of incontinence episodes and a treatment response was defined as a 50 percent reduction compared with pretreatment. All patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS The median number of incontinence episodes during four weeks was 22 (range, 2 to 77) before treatment, at 6 months it was 9 (range, 0 to 46), and at 12 months it was 10 (range, 0 to 70, P = 0.004). Fifteen patients (44 percent) were responders at 6 months, compared with 19 (56 percent) at 12 months. No long-term side effects or serious adverse events were reported.

Once released into aquatic environments, these pollutants will interact with various substances including suspended particles, colloidal or nano particles, which will greatly influence their distribution and ultimate fate. Understanding these interactions in aquatic environments continues to be an important issue because of their possible risk. In this study, bisphenol A (BPA) in the water column of Bentong River, Malaysia, was investigated in both its soluble and colloidal phase. A spatially explicit hydrological model was established to illustrate the associated dispersion processes of colloidal-bound BPA. Modelling results demonstrated the significance of spatial detail in predicting hot spots or peak concentrations of colloidal-bound BPA in the sediment and water columns as well. The magnitude and setting of such spots were system based and depended mainly on flow conditions. The results highlighted the effects of colloidal particles' concentration and density on BPA's removal from the water column. It also demonstrated the tendency of colloidal particles to aggregate and the impact all these processes had on BPA's transport potential and fate in a river water. All scenarios showed that after 7.5-10 km mark BPA's concentration started to reach a steady state with very low concentrations which indicated that a downstream transport of colloidal-bound BPA was less likely due to minute BPA levels.","Shehab, Zakariya Nafi'; Jamil, Nor Rohaizah; Aris, Ahmad Zaharin",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818827/,345

In observational studies, obesity and insulin resistance have been consistently associated with lower concentrations of natriuretic peptides. It has been proposed that insulin influences natriuretic peptide production. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the acute effects of insulin administration on natriuretic peptide concentrations. METHODS 31 men and women (11 lean, 10 overweight, and 10 obese), ages 30-70 years, without cardiovascular disease or overt diabetes underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp. Plasma concentrations of N-terminal pro atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proANP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured at baseline and steady-state (the final 30 minutes of the clamp protocol). RESULTS From baseline to steady-state, insulin levels increased from a mean level of 9.5 to 176.7 μU/ml (p<0.001). Over this period, circulating NT-proANP concentrations decreased by 9% (-1933 ng/L, p = 0.01). The changes in NT-proANP did not differ between lean, overweight, and obese individuals. Steady-state NT-proANP levels, adjusted for baseline, were lower in individuals with greater insulin resistance, independent of BMI. In contrast to NT-proANP, NT-proBNP levels did not change significantly during the clamp (p = 0.41). CONCLUSION Insulin administration was associated with a moderate decrease in circulating NT-proANP, but not NT-proBNP. The lowest NT-proANP concentrations were found in insulin-resistant individuals. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying the effects of insulin on the cardiac hormonal axis.","Bachmann, Katherine N; Deger, Serpil Muge; Alsouqi, Aseel; Huang, Shi; Xu, Meng; Ferguson, Jane F; Su, Yan Ru; Niswender, Kevin D; Ikizler, T Alp; Wang, Thomas J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29758041/,345

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the prognostic value of the peri-infarct zone on late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance in ischemic cardiomyopathy. METHODS We searched MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), and CENTRAL (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) from inception to January 2019 for prognostic studies relating peri-infarct size with clinical outcomes in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two authors independently performed study selection and data extraction. Pooled effect estimates were calculated with random effects models, risk of bias and strength of evidence were assessed by the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Education, respectively. RESULTS Twenty studies were eligible, representing 14 cohort studies (n=1518) with mean follow-up of 3.6 years and 6 cross-sectional studies (n=189). The extent of the peri-infarct zone was significantly predictive of all-cause mortality (3 studies; n=539; hazard ratio, 1.34/10 g [95% CI, 1.13-1.59]; I2=0%; high-quality evidence), appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy (5 studies; n=361; hazard ratio, 1.31/10 g [95% CI, 1.17-1.47]; I2=0%; high-quality evidence), and inducibility of ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiological study (5 studies; n=167; OR, 2.63/g [95% CI, 1.39-4.96]; I2=14%; low-quality evidence). After adjusting for age and left ventricular ejection fraction, the peri-infarct zone, as a percentage of total infarct size, remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (2 studies; n=445; hazard ratio, 1.29/10% [95% CI, 1.15-1.44]; I2=0%; high-quality evidence). CONCLUSIONS There is limited but consistent evidence that quantification of the peri-infarct zone predicts long-term mortality and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Future studies should confirm whether late gadolinium enhancement-cardiac magnetic resonance assessment may improve implantable cardioverter-defibrillator treatment decisions.

There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of recurrence rate (p=0.337) and overall survival (p=0.423). However, patients in the laparoscopic RFA group had significantly shorter hospital stay (14.1 vs. 5.9 days, p<0.05) and experienced fewer complications (Grade I: 62.5% vs. 26.3%, p=0.102). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic RFA can be performed for malignant liver tumors with lower morbidity rates, less invasiveness and lower expense compared to open surgical approach.","Yun, Duhwan; Kim, Seokhwan; Song, Insang; Chun, Kwangsik",Korean journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,https://doi.org/10.14701/kjhbps.2014.18.4.122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26155264/,345
110366,"A Review of the State of HIV Nursing Science With Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity/Expression Peoples.",2021,"BACKGROUND Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically important pathogen of swine. OBJECTIVE Serum neutralization (SN) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test results as well as the utility of spike proteins S1, S2, and S3 and entire nucleocapsid protein were compared. ANIMALS AND METHODS Serum samples from 400 pigs vaccinated against PEDV strain SM98P were collected from 78 farms in Korea. SN test and ELISA were performed to confirm the presence of antibodies. For prokaryotic expression of partial fragments of spike protein the size and location of S1, S2, and S3, and full nucleocapsid protein, polymerase chain reaction was performed using specific primers. RESULTS Comparison of these results demonstrated that there was a correlation between the SN and ELISA results. Sera with higher neutralizing activity also had higher IgG titer. The antibody profiling data presented the correlation of neutralizing activity with the level of spike protein antibody. In particular, the S3 region may have an important role in neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONS We confirmed that the carboxy-terminal region that includes the endodomain of the S protein induced stronger neutralizing activity than the region that includes the ectodomain. CLINICAL RELEVANCE The region of the S protein may have a stronger neutralizing KPEDV-9 epitope and could be useful for the evaluation of future PEDV vaccine efficacy.","Paudel, S; Park, J E; Jang, H; Shin, H J",The Veterinary quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.2014.979512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25415042/,345

The purpose of this study is to compare surgical outcomes of PPS tumor patients who underwent robotic surgery with those of patients who received conventional surgical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathologic data from 136 patients who underwent surgical removal of PPS tumors via conventional or robotic approaches. RESULTS We identified PPS tumors in pre- and poststyloid regions in 87 (64%) and 49 (36%) patients, respectively. There were 48 (35.3%) pleomorphic adenomas, 36 (26.5%) schwannomas, and 24 (17.6%) paragangliomas. Conventional surgical techniques were performed in 83 patients, and robotic surgical approaches were administered to 53 patients. Transcervical-parotid and transcervical approaches were most commonly performed in conventional surgery, while transoral and retroauricular approaches were the preferred surgical methods in robotic surgery for pre- and poststyloid PPS tumors, respectively. Robotic surgery resulted in less estimated blood loss during poststyloid PPS tumor surgery. Postoperative cranial nerve complications were noted in 36 of 83 cases (43.4%) in the conventional surgery group and in 17 of 53 cases (32.1%) in the robotic surgery group. Intraoperative tumor spillage of pleomorphic adenoma showed no significant differences between the two groups (13.6% in conventional vs. 15.4% in robotic surgery). The mean follow-up time was 4.9 ± 3.4 years, and recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up without a significant difference between the two groups (4.5% in conventional vs. 3.8% in robotic surgery). CONCLUSIONS Robotic surgery in PPS tumors is feasible through transoral, retroauricular, or combined approaches and provides treatment outcomes comparable to those of conventional open surgery.","Lim, Jae-Yol; Park, Young Min; Kang, Min Seok; Kim, Da Hee; Choi, Eun Chang; Kim, Se-Heon; Koh, Yoon Woo",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08536-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474818/,345

Experiences of general practitioners.,2021-05-27,"INTRODUCTION The recent Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has led to growing research to explain the poor clinical prognosis in some patients. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION While early observational studies highlighted the role of the virus in lung failure, in a second moment thrombosis emerged as a possible explanation of the worse clinical course in some patients. Despite initial difficulties in management of such patients, the constant increase of literature in the field is to date clarifying some questions from clinicians. However, several other questions need answer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS A novel disease (Covid-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was responsible for thousands of hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory syndrome, with several cases of thrombotic complications due to excessive inflammation, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. Covid-19 and hospitalizations for Covid-19 may carry several potential risk factors for thrombosis. Severe coagulation abnormalities may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS Despite a strong pathophysiological rationale, the evidences in literature are not enough to recommend an aggressive antithrombotic therapy in COVID- 19. However, it is our opinion that an early use, even at home at the beginning of the disease, could improve the clinical course.","Casale, Matteo; Dattilo, Giuseppe; Imbalzano, Egidio; Gigliotti De Fazio, Marianna; Morabito, Claudia; Mezzetti, Maurizio; Busacca, Paolo; Signorelli, Salvatore S; Brunetti, Natale D; Correale, Michele",Panminerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.03999-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32549531/,345

The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the effect of both pure BG and BG doped with 5-wt% of Li (BGLi) on both the remineralization of in vitro demineralized human-teeth and the antimicrobial behavior against strains from caries and periodontitis. METHODS Bioglass® 45S5 (BG) and BGLi were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The remineralization tests were carried out using in vitro demineralized enamel teeth and evaluated by Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Vickers micro-hardness (HV). The antimicrobial behavior of the particles was evaluated against S. mutans, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. gingivalis, representing pathogens from caries and periodontitis. RESULTS Enamel lesion was partially remineralized when both bioglasses (BG and BGLi) were applied on its surface with micro-hardness recoveries around 45%. They further inhibited the growth of S. mutans and P. gingivalis, at 50 and 200 mg/mL, respectively. BGLi presented a higher toxicity against A. actinomycetemcomitans than BG, with inhibition concentrations of 20 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Bioglasses could be used in the treatment of two of the most prevalent oral diseases: caries and periodontitis, promoting the remineralization of the teeth and killing the main pathogens. The presence of Li did not affect the bioactivity of the bioglass and improved the antibacterial effect over A. actinomycetemcomitans strain.","Palza Cordero, Humberto; Castro Cid, René; Diaz Dosque, Mario; Cabello Ibacache, Rodrigo; Palma Fluxá, Patricia",Journal of dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385532/,345

Therefore, this study used odds ratio analysis and logistic regression modeling on historical accident data to investigate the contributing factors impacting occupational accidents among small electrical contracting enterprises. After conducting a thorough content analysis to ensure the reliability of reports, the authors adopted a purposeful variable selection approach to determine the most significant factors that can explain the fatality rates in different scenarios. Thereafter, this study performed an odds ratio analysis among significant factors to determine which factors increase the likelihood of fatality. For example, it was found that having a fatal accident is 4.4 times more likely when the source is a ""vehicle"" than when it is a ""tool, instrument, or equipment"". After validating the consistency of the model, 105 accident scenarios were developed and assessed using the model. The findings revealed which severe accident scenarios happen commonly to people in this trade, with nine scenarios having fatality rates of 50% or more. The highest fatality rates occurred in ""fencing, installing lights, signs, etc."" tasks in ""alteration and rehabilitation"" projects where the source of injury was ""parts and materials"". The proposed analysis/modeling approach can be applied among all specialty contracting companies to identify and prioritize more hazardous situations within specific trades.

117616,Estimating the unknown: greater racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden after accounting for missing race and ethnicity data.,2020-11-30,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic total extraperitoneal mesh repair (TEP) of inguinal hernia has become well accepted with low recurrence and high patient satisfaction rates. However, inguinal pain has also been reported. Source of this pain has been suggested to be the fixation method, especially the use of tacks. Introduction of fibrin glue and absorbable tacks were suggested to lower chronic pain and inguinal discomfort rates. This study analyses the different methods of fixation. PATIENTS AND METHODS 201 patients were analysed. Primary end-points were patients' satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and specific inguinal conditions (e.g. pulling, swelling, troubles at coughing). Secondary endpoints were duration of operation, length of hospital stay, and material costs. RESULTS Fibrin glue was used in 101 patients and tacks in 100 patients, in 21 of those absorbable tacks. Patients were fully satisfied with the results in more than 90%, irrespective of the fixation method. Health-related quality of life along the SF-12(®) questionnaire attested no differences. Inguinal pulling occurred significantly more often after fibrin glue (25.7 %) than after tack fixation (11 %; p = 0.026), whereas no differences in the other specific inguinal sensations occurred. CONCLUSION Mesh fixation in TEP can be performed either by tacks or by fibrin glue with similar long-term results concerning satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and pain. No advantage of fibrin glue could be found, in fact, a higher percentage of patients had inguinal pulling and burning sensations after the use of fibrin glue. The use of absorbable tacks showed no advantage.","Horisberger, K; Jung, M K; Zingg, U; Schöb, O",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-013-1974-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23604341/,345

This study aims to evaluate the incidence and 1-year results of all such treatments during 2009 in Sweden. METHODS The design was a one-year follow-up through the Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) of all 775 patients from the Swedish population of 10 million inhabitants in whom 843 invasive infrainguinal procedures (796 index procedures and 47 secondary procedures) were performed for IC in 2009. Index procedures were open surgery in 290 (37%) patients, bilateral in nine cases, giving a total of 299 limbs, endovascular treatment in 447 (58%) patients, bilateral in 10, giving a total of 457 limbs, and hybrid treatment in 38 (5%) patients, bilateral in two cases, giving a total of 40 limbs. Data were analysed both with regard to the number of patients (775) and the number of procedures (843). Clinical outcome was calculated from patient-reported leg function (unchanged, improved, deteriorated) and whether amputation had been necessary or death had occurred. Patent reconstruction at 1 year was also counted as improvement. RESULTS Improvement at 1 year was seen in 567 (73.2%) patients, (225 [77.6%] in the open surgery group, 320 [71.6%] in the endovascular treatment group, and 22 [57.9%] in the hybrid treatment group). No significant difference was found between the open surgery and endovascular treatment groups comprising 737/775 patients (p = .350). Hybrid treatment gave significantly worse results (p = .046). Fifty-seven (7.3%) patients reported unchanged limb function and 32 (4.1%) patients reported deterioration. Within 30 days two patients died and one patient underwent amputation. Within 1 year 10 patients underwent 11 amputations: five (1.7%) in the open surgery group, three (0.6%) in the endovascular treatment group, and two (7.5%) in the hybrid treatment group; one underwent bilateral amputation (p = .07). Twenty-two patients died: 10 (3.4%) in the open surgery group, 12 (2.7%) in the endovascular treatment group and none in the hybrid treatment group (p = .465). CONCLUSIONS Reported improvement at 1 year was 73.2% in patients invasively treated for infrainguinal IC. Patients reporting an unchanged or deteriorated clinical state are a considerable clinical challenge. Further studies to determine whether or not invasive treatment of infrainguinal IC is appropriate are justified.","Lindgren, H; Gottsäter, A; Qvarfordt, P; Bergman, S; Troëng, T",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2014.02.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24661922/,345

Diffusion tensor imaging data from 167 individuals were included: 41 healthy controls, 55 schizophrenia probands, 47 schizoaffective disorder probands, and 24 probands with psychotic bipolar disorder. Compared to healthy controls, FAt reductions were observed in the body of corpus callosum (BCC) for schizoaffective disorder (d = 0.91) and schizophrenia (d = 0.64). Grouping by Biotype, Biotype 1 showed FAt reductions in the CC and fornix, with largest effect in the BCC (d = 0.87). Biotype 2 showed significant FAt reductions in the BCC (d = 0.90). Schizoaffective disorder individuals had elevated FW in the CC, fornix and anterior corona radiata (ACR), with largest effect in the BCC (d = 0.79).

119062,Treatment for eating disorders in a post-COVID world: The case of TRIANGLE.,2020-07-26,"OBJECTIVE During totally minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE), the gastric conduit is typically constructed via laparoscopy. Trauma from laparoscopic instruments, inability to palpate the gastroepiploic arcade, and challenges in optimal positioning of the stomach for intra-abdominal stapling have led to the widespread use of laparotomy as part of hybrid MIE procedures. Our objective was to evaluate the safety of transthoracic extracorporeal gastric conduit preparation. We hypothesize that this alternative technique is equivalent in safety to the laparoscopic approach. METHODS This is a retrospective comparison of laparoscopic and transthoracic extracorporeal gastric conduit preparation with regard to anastomotic and respiratory outcomes. RESULTS During a 3-year period, 30 patients underwent MIE with a right intrathoracic anastomosis (extracorporeal conduit, 15; laparoscopic conduit, 15). Mean age (58.6 vs 67 years, P = 0.59), tumor location (gastroesophageal junction vs middle and lower esophageal, P = 0.27), and histology (adenocarcinoma vs other 26.7%, P = 0.68) were similar between groups. Anastomotic technique and operating surgeon were the same for all patients. Patients in the laparoscopic gastric conduit group were more likely to have undergone induction chemoradiotherapy (40% vs 80%, P = 0.030). There was no significant difference between groups with respect to anastomotic complications, including anastomotic leak and anastomotic stricture (20% vs 13.3%, P = 0.70). Transthoracic gastric conduit preparation was not associated with increased respiratory complications (8% vs 12%, P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS Transthoracic gastric conduit preparation is a simple, minimally invasive alternative laparotomy for gastric conduit preparation during MIE. No additional incision is required. The technique may help surgeons overcome shortcomings of the laparoscopic approach without impacting perioperative risk.","McGuire, Anna L; Gilbert, Sebastien",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0000000000000177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26368035/,345

The method allows highly specific and sensitive visualization of viral RNA by relying on HCR initiated by probe localization. Split-initiator probes help amplify the signal by fluorescently labeled amplifiers, resulting in negligible background fluorescence in confocal microscopy. Labeling amplifiers with different fluorescent dyes facilitates the simultaneous recognition of various targets. This, in turn, allows the mapping of the infection in tissues to better understand viral pathogenesis and replication at the single-cell level. Coupling this method with immunofluorescence may facilitate better understanding of host-virus interactions, including alternation of the host epigenome and immune response pathways. Owing to sensitive and specific HCR technology, this protocol can also be used as a diagnostic tool. It is also important to remember that the technique may be modified easily to enable detection of any RNA, including non-coding RNAs and RNA viruses that may emerge in the future.","Kula-Pacurar, Anna; Wadas, Jakub; Suder, Agnieszka; Szczepanski, Artur; Milewska, Aleksandra; Ochman, Marek; Stacel, Tomasz; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427241/,345

RESULTS Cerebral oxygenation remained normal in 1,483 of 1,515 measurements (97.9%). rSO(2) decreased significantly during 3 of 13 hypoxic events occurring in 13 patients and during 5 of 17 hypercarbic events occurring in 8 patients, with 15 measurements of greater than 20% decrease from baseline. Cerebral oxygenation increased transiently in 88% of children. During 31 cerebral desaturation recordings, 3 hypoxic recordings (9.3%, always in combination with hypercarbia) and 5 hypercarbic recordings (15.6%) were observed, whereas in 23 (74.2%), cardiorespiratory characteristics were unchanged. There was poor correlation between rSO(2) and both SpO(2) and etco(2), with correlation coefficients of 0.05 (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.07) and 0.01 (95% confidence interval -0.01 to 0.02), respectively. CONCLUSION Cerebral oxygenation as measured by near infrared spectroscopy demonstrated few significant negative changes during pediatric procedural sedation. Transient cardiorespiratory events seldom altered rSO(2), with hypercarbia having a greater effect than hypoxemia. However, cerebral desaturations frequently occurred without associated cardiorespiratory changes.","Padmanabhan, Pradeep; Berkenbosch, John W; Lorenz, Doug; Pierce, Mary Clyde",Annals of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2009.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19285362/,345
120613,The Effect of the Familiarity of a Survey Sender on Response Outcomes in a Large-Scale Survey of Emergency Medical Services Agencies.,2021-09-01,"OBJECTIVE The role of physician experience and patient volumes on the outcome of surgical or endovascular procedures has been well-studied but there are limited data on how these factors affect the outcome of medical therapy. METHODS In the stenting and medical cohorts of the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for the Prevention of Recurrent Ischemic Stroke (SAMMPRIS) trial, we compared Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves for the primary endpoint (any stroke or death within 30 days of enrollment or ischemic stroke in the territory beyond 30 days) using the log-rank test and the percentages of patients achieving target levels for primary and secondary risk factors during the study using Fisher exact test between patients at high-enrolling (≥12 patients) vs low-enrolling (<12 patients) sites. RESULTS In the stenting group, the K-M curves for the primary endpoint were similar at high-enrolling sites and low-enrolling sites (p = 0.93) with rates of 13.5% vs 14.7% at 30 days and 19.0% vs 20.6% at 2 years. In the medical group, the K-M curves differed between high-enrolling sites and low-enrolling sites (p = 0.0005) with rates of 1.8% vs 9.8% at 30 days and 7.3% vs 20.9% at 2 years. The percentages of patients who achieved targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure at high- vs low-enrolling sites in both treatment groups combined were 64% vs 49% (p = 0.003) and 70% vs 59% (p = 0.026), respectively. CONCLUSIONS High-enrolling sites in SAMMPRIS achieved better control of primary risk factors and much lower rates of the primary endpoint than low-enrolling sites in the medical group, suggesting that experience with medical management is an important determinant of patient outcome.","Chiu, David; Klucznik, Richard P; Turan, Tanya N; Lynn, Michael J; McCane, Charles D; Katz, Lawrence B; Nizam, Azhar; Derdeyn, Colin P; Fiorella, David; Lane, Bethany F; Montgomery, Jean; Janis, Scott; Chimowitz, Marc I",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26561294/,345
121694,Differential expression and transcription factor binding associated with genotype at a pharmacogenetic variant in OPRD1.,2021-08-18,"INTRODUCTION Food hypersensitivity (FHS), including food allergy, coeliac disease and food intolerance, is a major public health issue. The Food Standards Agency (FSA), an independent Government department working to protect public health and consumers' wider interests in food, sought to identify research priorities in the area of FHS. METHODS A Priority Setting Exercise was undertaken, using a methodology adapted from the James Lind Alliance - the first such exercise with respect to food hypersensitivity. A UK-wide public consultation was held to identify unanswered research questions. After excluding diagnostics, desensitisation treatment and other questions which were out of scope for FSA or where FSA was already commissioning research, 15 indicative questions were identified and prioritised by a range of stakeholders, representing food businesses, patient groups, healthcare and academia, local authorities and the FSA. RESULTS 295 responses were received during the public consultation, which were categorised into 70 sub-questions and used to define 15 key evidence uncertainties (""indicative questions"") for prioritisation. Using the JLA prioritisation framework, this resulted in 10 priority uncertainties in evidence, from which 16 research questions were developed. These could be summarised under the following 5 themes: communication of allergens both within the food supply chain and then to the end-consumer (ensuring trust in allergen communication); the impact of socioeconomic factors on consumers with FHS; drivers of severe reactions; mechanism(s) underlying loss of tolerance in FHS; and the risks posed by novel allergens/processing. DISCUSSION In this first research prioritisation exercise for food allergy and FHS, key priorities identified to protect the food-allergic public were strategies to help allergic consumers to make confident food choices, prevention of FHS and increasing understanding of socioeconomic impacts. Diagnosis and treatment of FHS was not considered in this prioritisation.","Turner, Paul J; Andoh-Kesson, Elizabeth; Baker, Sarah; Baracaia, Alexa; Barfield, Alisha; Barnett, Julie; Brunas, Karen; Chan, Chun-Han; Cochrane, Stella; Cowan, Katherine; Feeney, Mary; Flanagan, Simon; Fox, Adam; George, Leigh; Gowland, M Hazel; Heeley, Christina; Kimber, Ian; Knibb, Rebecca; Langford, Kirsty; Mackie, Alan; McLachlan, Tim; Regent, Lynne; Ridd, Matthew; Roberts, Graham; Rogers, Adrian; Scadding, Guy; Stoneham, Sarah; Thomson, Darryl; Urwin, Heidi; Venter, Carina; Walker, Michael; Ward, Rachel; Yarham, Ross; Young, Maggie; O'Brien, John",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.13983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34233055/,345
121922,Prospective study to explore changes in quality of care and perinatal outcomes after implementation of perinatal death audit in Uganda.,2020-07-08,"INTRODUCTION Appendectomy remains the gold standard for treating uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. However, the vermiform appendix may play a significant role in immune system (secondary immune function) and maintain a reservoir of the normal microbiome for human body. The aim of this study was to summarize the long-term effects after appendectomy and discuss whether appendectomy is suitable for all appendicitis patients. AREAS COVERED A comprehensive and unbiased literature search was performed in PubMed. The terms ""appendix,"" ""appendicitis,"" ""appendectomy,"" and ""endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy"" were searched in the title and/or abstract. This review summarizes long-term effects of appendectomy on some diseases in humans and describes three methods including appendectomy, medical treatment and an ""organ-sparing"" technique, named endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT) to treat appendicitis. EXPERT OPINION Appendectomy remains the first-line therapy for appendicitis. The patient problem is appendix not appendicitis. If we treat the appendicitis, the problem should be resolved. During COVID-19, an initial antibiotic treatment of mild appendicitis represents a promising strategy. Patients who are worried about the long-term adverse effect after appendectomy and have a strong desire to preserve the appendix and are aware of the risk of appendicitis recurrence, medical treatment or ERAT could be proposed.","Song, Ming-Yang; Ullah, Saif; Yang, Hui-Yu; Ahmed, Md Robin; Saleh, Abd-Arrahman; Liu, Bing-Rong",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2021.1868298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350352/,345

Using longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, 1984-2017, we examine the role of extrahousehold kin wealth and poverty in shaping racial inequalities in the risk of exiting homeownership. Our nonlinear decomposition results indicate that racial differences in family network resources explain a nontrivial portion of the racial gap in homeownership exit, but there is little evidence that the effects of kin resources on exit are moderated by race. Among both Black and White owners, having wealthier noncoresident kin does not lessen the negative impacts of adverse economic or health shocks on the probability of losing homeownership. Our findings have implications for policies and programs designed to buttress the ability of minority households, especially those in financial distress, to sustain the wealth-building state of homeownership.","Sharp, Gregory; Whitehead, Ellen; Hall, Matthew",Demography,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-020-00913-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901406/,345

MATERIALS AND METHODS Orthodontically relevant sources of information were searched using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar and current reports from major health bodies such as Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, National Institutes of Health, and major national orthodontic associations. RESULTS Where available, peer-reviewed and more recent publications were given priority. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 and limitations in quality of evidence, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Relevant to orthodontics, human-to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs predominantly through the respiratory tract via droplets, secretions (cough, sneeze), and or direct contact, where the virus enters the mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, and eyes. The virus can remain stable for days on plastic and stainless steel. Most infected persons experience a mild form of disease, but those with advanced age or underlying comorbidities may suffer severe respiratory and multiorgan complications. CONCLUSIONS During the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, elective orthodontic treatment should be suspended and resumed only when permitted by federal, provincial, and local health regulatory authorities. Emergency orthodontic treatment can be provided by following a contingency plan founded on effective communication and triage. Treatment advice should be delivered remotely first when possible, and where necessary, in-person treatment can be performed in a well-prepared operatory following the necessary precautions and infection prevention and control (IPAC) protocol.","Suri, Sunjay; Vandersluis, Yona R; Kochhar, Anuraj S; Bhasin, Ritasha; Abdallah, Mohamed-Nur",The Angle orthodontist,https://doi.org/10.2319/033120-236.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32396601/,345

We aimed to evaluate acute anti-SI effects of single-dose ketamine in different formulations/routes of administration by pooling results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search was conducted on Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and PubMed from inception to July 1st, 2020. Studies were selected based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Effect sizes of different formulations/routes at various time points were computed using random-effects models. With data from nine eligible RCTs (n = 197), the pooled effect size for anti-SI effects at the 24-h time point was 1.035 (N = 6, CI: 0.793 to 1.277, p < 0.001) for intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine and 1.309 (N = 1, CI: 0.857 to 1.761, p < 0.001) for intranasal (IN) esketamine. An additional five RCTs were available for qualitative analysis. RCTs were identified for oral/sublingual ketamine for depression, however, none of these trials reported anti-SI effects preventing quantitative analysis for these routes of delivery. No RCTs for intramuscular (IM) ketamine were identified. The findings suggest that single-dose IV ketamine/IN esketamine is associated with robust reductions in suicidal thoughts at 2-h, 4-h, and 24-h post-intervention. In addition, future studies on IM/oral/sublingual ketamine and comparative studies are warranted to evaluate the anti-SI efficacy of distinct formulations and routes of administration.","Xiong, Jiaqi; Lipsitz, Orly; Chen-Li, David; Rosenblat, Joshua D; Rodrigues, Nelson B; Carvalho, Isabelle; Lui, Leanna M W; Gill, Hartej; Narsi, Flora; Mansur, Rodrigo B; Lee, Yena; McIntyre, Roger S",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360864/,345

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, LILACS, Africa-Wide, CINAHL and Web of Science up to 12 December 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of people with diabetes and/or hypertension plus any other disease, in LMICs; assessing the effects of integrated care. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two authors independently screened retrieved records; extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We conducted meta-analysis where possible and assessed certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS Of 7568 records, we included five studies-two ITS studies and three cluster RCTs. Studies were conducted in South Africa (n=3), Uganda/Kenya (n=1) and India (n=1). Integrated models of care compared with usual care may make little or no difference to mortality (very low certainty), the number of people achieving blood pressure (BP) or diabetes control (very low certainty) and access to care (very low certainty); may increase the number of people who achieve both HIV and BP/diabetes control (very low certainty); and may have a very small effect on achieving HIV control (very low certainty). Interventions to promote integrated delivery of care compared with usual care may make little or no difference to mortality (very low certainty), depression (very low certainty) and quality of life (very low certainty); and may have little or no effect on glycated haemoglobin (low certainty), systolic BP (low certainty) and total cholesterol levels (low certainty).

The founding members, rhomboids, were first identified in Drosophila as serine intramembrane proteases that cleave transmembrane proteins, enabling signaling. This led to the discovery of the wider rhomboid superfamily, a clan that in metazoans is dominated by pseudoproteases. These so-called rhomboid pseudoproteases inherited from their catalytically active ancestors a conserved rhomboid-like domain and a propensity to regulate signaling. Lacking catalytic activity, they developed new ""pseudoenzyme"" functions that include regulating the trafficking, turnover and activity of their client proteins. Rhomboid pseudoproteases have preeminent roles in orchestrating immune cell activation, antiviral responses and cytokine release in response to microbial infection, or in chronic diseases, and have also been implicated in growth factor signaling, cancer and more recently, metabolism. Here we discuss the mechanism(s) of action of rhomboid pseudoproteases, contrasted with rhomboid proteases. We also highlight the roles of rhomboid pseudoproteases in mammalian physiology, which quite paradoxically among pseudoenzymes, is understood much better than active rhomboids.","Adrain, Colin; Cavadas, Miguel",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894651/,345

Good visualization of the submucosal dissection plane is essential to perform a safe and effective ESD. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a novel traction method using an over-the-scope steerable grasper to improve the exposure of the dissection plane during gastric ESD. RESULTS A total of 24 ESDs were performed without any complications in various locations of porcine stomachs, including antrum, gastric body, and cardia. En bloc complete resections were achieved in all cases. The mean specimen size was 44.92 ± 8.30 mm, mean total procedure time was 29.17 ± 11.27 minutes, and mean dissection time was 15.08 ± 7.21 minutes. The optimal dissection plane could be obtained by controlling the grasper in all cases.

Methods Telemonitoring protocol included phone calls and e-mails. Patients were asked to rate COVID-19-like symptoms, psychological symptoms, epidemiological issues, and adherence to diabetes management (insulin, exercise, and diet) using a 0-to-10 scale. An e-mail address and phone number were offered for further contact if needed. Clinical, demographic, and laboratorial data from the consultations before the pandemic were collected from medical records. Results Among 321 patients with a previously scheduled consultation over the first 15 weeks of social distancing, 237 (73.8%) could be successfully contacted. Of these, 207 (87.3%) were exclusively evaluated by telemonitoring (190 only by phone or text message and 17 who were also reached by email), and 30 (12.7%) patients attended the consultation for medical reasons detected during the telephone screening. Overall, 44 (18.5%) patients reported COVID-19-like symptoms. One (2.3%) patient was hospitalized and subsequently died. Psychological symptoms were reported by 137 (60.4%) patients and 30 (12.7%) required remote psychological assistance. Appropriate social distancing was performed by 203 (87.9%) patients, and 221 (97.8%) referred use of masks. Conclusion Telemonitoring T1D patients during the pandemic helped reduce the need for in-person consultations, detect clinical and psychological needs, and offer support to patients in addition to monitoring suspected COVID-19 cases and the adherence to protective measures.","de Mattos Matheus, Alessandra Saldanha; Cabizuca, Carolina Alves; Tannus, Lucianne Righetti Monteiro; Passos, Aline Camin; Schmidt, Amábile Cristyne; de Gouveia, Ana Tarasiuk; de Albuquerque Pessoa, Bruno Moraes; Matheus, Felipe Cerqueira; Yang, Gabriela Yea-Huey; da Silva Divino, Josimara Araujo; Mathiles, Juliana Affonso; Teixeira, Juliana Leite; de Souza Barroso, Luiza; da Fonseca de Brito, Max Benicio; Suassuna, Paula Melichar; Cobas, Roberta Arnoldi",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.20945/2359-3997000000309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166438/,345

A cross sectional analysis of six hospitals in the north-west of England.,2020-10-18,"Evidence-based medicine is the most prevalent paradigm adopted by physicians. Clinical practice guidelines typically define a set of recommendations together with eligibility criteria that restrict their applicability to a specific group of patients. The ever-growing size and availability of health-related data is currently challenging the broad definitions of guideline-defined patient groups. Precision medicine leverages on genetic, phenotypic, or psychosocial characteristics to provide precise identification of patient subsets for treatment targeting. Defining a patient similarity measure is thus an essential step to allow stratification of patients into clinically-meaningful subgroups. The present review investigates the use of patient similarity as a tool to enable precision medicine. 279 articles were analyzed along four dimensions: data types considered, clinical domains of application, data analysis methods, and translational stage of findings. Cancer-related research employing molecular profiling and standard data analysis techniques such as clustering constitute the majority of the retrieved studies. Chronic and psychiatric diseases follow as the second most represented clinical domains. Interestingly, almost one quarter of the studies analyzed presented a novel methodology, with the most advanced employing data integration strategies and being portable to different clinical domains. Integration of such techniques into decision support systems constitutes and interesting trend for future research.","Parimbelli, E; Marini, S; Sacchi, L; Bellazzi, R",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2018.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29864490/,345
129655,Early COVID-19 Successes in Skilled Nursing Facilities in San Francisco.,2020-12-01,"Objective: Optimal selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) management for neonatal aortic arch surgery has not been extensively studied. We induced mild hypothermia during SCP and used the tissue oxygenation monitor to ensure adequate perfusion during the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods: Eight cases were recruited from September 2018 to April 2020. SCP was maintained at 30°C, and CPB was adjusted to achieve a mean right radial artery pressure of 30 mmHg. The near-infrared tissue saturation (NIRS) monitor was applied to assess the right and left brain, flank, and lower extremity during the surgery. Results: During surgery, the mean age was 4.75 days, the mean body weight was 2.92 kg, the CPB duration was 86.5 ±18.7 min, the aortic cross-clamp time was 46.1 ± 12.7 min, and the SCP duration was 14.6±3.4 min. The brain NIRS before, during, and after SCP was 64.2, 67.2, and 71.5 on the left side and 67.9, 66.2, and 70.1 on the right side (p = NS), respectively. However, renal and lower extremity tissue oxygenation, respectively decreased from 61.6 and 62.4 before SCP to 37.7 and 39.9 after SCP (p < 0.05) and then increased to 70.1 and 90.4 after full body flow resumed. No stroke was reported postoperatively. Conclusion: SCP under mild hypothermia can aid in efficient maintenance of brain perfusion during neonatal arch reconstruction. The clinical outcome of this strategy was favorable for up to 20 min, but the safety duration of lower body ischemia warrants further analysis.","Huang, Chi-Hsiang; Wang, Yi-Chia; Chou, Hen-Wen; Huang, Shu-Chien",Frontiers in medicine,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.637257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996851/,345
130042,"An epidemiological study of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted in a tertiary care hospital of Pune, Maharashtra.",2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to examine the independent associations between actionable bleeding (AB) and coronary thrombotic events (CTE) on mortality risk after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND The independent impact of AB and CTE on mortality risk after PCI remains poorly characterized. METHODS A post hoc analysis was conducted of the PARIS (Patterns of Non-Adherence to Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Stented Patients) registry, a real-world cohort of 5,018 patients undergoing PCI with stent implantation. CTE included definite or probable stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction. AB was defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2 or 3. Associations between CTE and AB, both of which were modeled as time-dependent covariates, and 2-year mortality risk were examined using extended Cox regression. RESULTS Over 2 years, the cumulative incidence of CTE, AB, and all-cause mortality was 5.9% (n = 289), 8.1% (n = 391), and 4.7% (n = 227), respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios for mortality associated with CTE and AB were 3.3 (95% confidence interval: 2.2 to 4.9) and 3.5 (95% confidence interval: 2.3 to 5.4), respectively. Temporal gradients in risk after either event were highest in the first 30 days and declined rapidly thereafter. Thrombotic events occurring while patients were on versus off dual-antiplatelet therapy were associated with a higher mortality risk, whereas risk related to AB was not influenced by dual-antiplatelet therapy status at the time of bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Intracoronary thrombosis and AB are associated with mortality risks of comparable magnitude over a 2-year period after PCI, findings that might inform risk/benefit calculations for extension versus discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy.","Baber, Usman; Dangas, George; Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Sartori, Samantha; Steg, Philippe Gabriel; Cohen, David J; Giustino, Gennaro; Ariti, Cono; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Henry, Timothy D; Kini, Annapoorna S; Krucoff, Mitchell W; Gibson, C Michael; Chieffo, Alaide; Moliterno, David J; Weisz, Giora; Colombo, Antonio; Pocock, Stuart; Mehran, Roxana",JACC.

130309,Why even the threat of a twindemic isn't swaying the most vulnerable: Black women.,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVE Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) with Sonazoid® and dynamic computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Local recurrence rate was used as the gold standard of evaluation. METHODS From January 2007 to December 2011, 86 HCCs from 70 patients were treated with RFA. CEUS with Sonazoid and dynamic CT were then used to evaluate the effect of RFA. For CEUS and dynamic CT, effects were classified as follows: (1) complete ablated response with safety margin >5 mm (CRSM+); (2) complete ablated response but with safety margin <5 mm (CRSM-); (3) incomplete, residual tumor detected after treatment. RESULTS CEUS judged 33 cases as CRSM+, while dynamic CT identified 49 cases. None of these 33 cases from the CEUS group had local recurrences, while dynamic CT had 1 case. CEUS judged 49 cases as CRSM-, compared to 34 cases with dynamic CT. Of these, 9 cases of CEUS and 8 cases of dynamic CT showed local recurrences. Two cases diagnosed as 'incomplete' by CEUS and dynamic CT had recurrences within 1 year. CONCLUSION CEUS can be used to assess the efficacy of RFA for HCC, with the potential to reduce the number of CT scans required for confirmation.","Inoue, Tatsuo; Kudo, Masatoshi; Hatanaka, Kinuyo; Arizumi, Tadaaki; Takita, Masahiro; Kitai, Satoshi; Yada, Norihisa; Hagiwara, Satoru; Minami, Yasunori; Sakurai, Toshiharu; Ueshima, Kazuomi; Nishida, Naoshi",Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000345890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23428859/,345

Efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of the NHS have been broadly focussed on reducing demand, through prevention and patient empowerment, and modifying supply side factors by focussing on lean care systems and low carbon alternatives. This narrative review is focussed on supply side factors to identify sustainable practices with a focus on actions that could be implemented in dermatology departments. A literature review was conducted In MEDLINE in April 2020. The search terms included 'environmental sustainability', 'climate change' with 'dermatology', 'telemedicine', 'NHS', 'surgery' and 'operating theatres'. Out of 95 results, 20 were deemed relevant to the review. Whilst there is clearly growing interest in environmental sustainability, identified literature lacked examples of comprehensive implementation and evaluation of initiatives. The literature discussed distinct areas including transport, waste management and procurement as part of a lean healthcare system. A number of papers highlighted the potential contribution of carbon reducing actions without citing verifiable outcome data. This narrative review highlights the need for detailed environmental impact assessments of treatment options in dermatology, in tandem with economic analysis. We have identified a clear need for evidence-based guidance setting out implementable actions with identifiable benefits achievable within local clinical teams. This will require engagement between clinicians, patients and healthcare organisations.","Allwright, E; Abbott, R A",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215752/,345

However, the strength of biexciton interaction remains highly controversial due to the entangled spectral features of the exciton- and biexciton-related transitions in conventional measurement approaches. Here, we tackle the limitation by using polarization-dependent two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy and quantify the excitation energy-dependent biexciton binding energy at cryogenic temperatures. The biexciton binding energy increases with excitation energy, which can be modeled as a near inverse-square size dependence in the effective mass approximation considering the quantum confinement effect. The spectral line width for the exciton-biexciton transition is much broader than that for the ground state to exciton transition, suggesting weakly correlated broadening between these transitions. These inhomogeneity effects should be carefully considered for the future demonstration of optoelectronic applications relying on coherent exciton-biexciton interactions.","Huang, Xinyu; Chen, Lan; Zhang, Chunfeng; Qin, Zhengyuan; Yu, Buyang; Wang, Xiaoyong; Xiao, Min",The journal of physical chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197186/,345

132522,Erratum: Percentage of Black Population and Primary Care Shortage Areas Associated with Higher COVID-19 Case and Death Rates in Georgia Counties: Erratum.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND The presence of muscular deficiency seems to be a major cause of back pain that requires counteractions. Considering that the autochthonous back muscles, responsible for straightening and stabilizing the spine, cannot be activated voluntarily, they can be strengthened only through specific training. The computer-supported test and training system (CTT) Centaur (BfMC GmbH, Leipzig, SN, Germany) seems well suited for this purpose. To show its potential as a reliable diagnostic and training tool, this study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of this 3D spatial rotation device. METHODS A prospective pilot study was conducted in 20 healthy volunteers of both sexes. For test-retest reliability analysis, three measurements were performed with a two-day interval between each measurement. Each measurement consisted of a one-minute endurance test performed in eight different positions (transverse plane). During the test, the subject was tilted by 90° in the sagittal plane from a neutral, upright position. Meanwhile, the subject's level of upper body stabilization along the body axis was assessed. All trunk movements (momentum values) were quantified by a multicomponent force sensor and standardized relative to the subject's upper body mass. The range of motion was assessed by 95% confidence ellipse analysis. Here, all position-specific confidence ellipses for each measurement were merged to a summarized quantity. Finally, ICC analysis using a single-rating, absolute agreement, two-way mixed-effects model and a Bland-Altman plot was performed to determine the reliability. RESULTS Considering all measurements (t1, t2, t3), the ICC for reliability evaluation was 0.805, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was [0.643, 0.910]. Moreover, the Bland-Altman plots for all three pairs of time points did not show significant differences. CONCLUSION This study concludes that the CTT Centaur shows good test-retest reliability, indicating it can be used in clinical practice in the future.","Pfeifle, Christian; Edel, Melanie; Schleifenbaum, Stefan; Kühnapfel, Andreas; Heyde, Christoph-Eckhard",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-020-03597-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894106/,345
132797,A scoping review of the role of HIV-related stigma and discrimination in noncommunicable disease care.,2018,"Peptides that bind poorly to MHC class I molecules often elicit low-functional avidity T cell responses. Peptide modification by altering the anchor residue facilitates increased binding affinity and may elicit T cells with increased functional avidity toward the native epitope (""heteroclitic""). This augmented MHC binding is likely to increase the half-life and surface density of the heteroclitic complex, but precisely how this enhanced T cell response occurs in vivo is not known. Furthermore, the ideal heteroclitic epitope will elicit T cell responses that completely cross-react with the native epitope, maximizing protection and minimizing undesirable off-target effects. Such epitopes have been difficult to identify. In this study, using mice infected with a murine coronavirus that encodes epitopes that elicit high (S510, CSLWNGPHL)- and low (S598, RCQIFANI)-functional avidity responses, we show that increased expression of peptide S598 but not S510 generated T cells with enhanced functional avidity. Thus, immune responses can be augmented toward T cell epitopes with low functional avidity by increasing Ag density. We also identified a heteroclitic epitope (RCVIFANI) that elicited a T cell response with nearly complete cross-reactivity with native epitope and demonstrated increased MHC/peptide abundance compared with native S598. Structural and thermal melt analyses indicated that the Q600V substitution enhanced stability of the peptide/MHC complex without greatly altering the antigenic surface, resulting in highly cross-reactive T cell responses. Our data highlight that increased peptide/MHC complex display contributes to heteroclitic epitope efficacy and describe parameters for maximizing immune responses that cross-react with the native epitope.","Trujillo, Jonathan A; Gras, Stephanie; Twist, Kelly-Anne; Croft, Nathan P; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Rossjohn, Jamie; Purcell, Anthony W; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1400111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24795457/,345

The major cause of fatality in infected patients, now referred to as the ""Cytokine Storm Syndrome"" (CSS), is a direct result of aberrant immune activation following SARS-CoV2 infection and results in excess release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and IL-6, by macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Single cell analysis has also shown significantly elevated levels of galectin 3 (Gal-3) in macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells in patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to mild disease. Inhibition of Gal-3 reduces the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α from macrophages in vitro, and as such may hold promise in reducing the incidence of CSS. In addition, Gal-3 inhibition shows promise in reducing transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) mediated pulmonary fibrosis, likely to be a major consequence in survivors of severe COVID-19. Finally, a key domain in the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 has been shown to bind N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a process that may be essential to cell entry by the virus. This Neu5Ac-binding domain shares striking morphological, sequence, and functional similarities with human Gal-3. Here we provide an updated review of the literature linking Gal-3 to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Dually targeting galectins and the Neu5Ac-binding domain of SARS-CoV2 shows tentative promise in several stages of the disease: preventing viral entry, modulating the host immune response, and reducing the post-infectious incidence of pulmonary fibrosis.","Caniglia, John L; Asuthkar, Swapna; Tsung, Andrew J; Guda, Maheedhara R; Velpula, Kiran K",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.25979.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082935/,345

Anesthesiologists have historically championed the adoption of new technologies. However, the rapid evolution of these technologies has outpaced attempts at studying their potential impact on healthcare providers' well-being. This document introduces several categories of workplace technologies commonly encountered by the anesthesiologist. We examine examples of novel technology and the impact of these digital interventions on the anesthesiologist's well-being. We also review popular personalized technology aimed at improving wellness and the impact on well-being examined. Finally, technology acceptance models are introduced to improve technology adoption, which, when appropriately applied, may minimize the negative impacts of technology on anesthesiologists' well-being. Incorporating quantitative, serial assessments of well-being as part of technology implementation is proposed as a future direction for examining the wellness impact of technology on anesthesiologists.","Lo, Calvin; Yu, Julie; Görges, Matthias; Matava, Clyde",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119935/,345

We aimed to evaluate whether intracranial atherosclerotic disease influences the clinical outcomes following endovascular treatment of acute vertebrobasilar occlusive stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-one patients with acute vertebrobasilar occlusive stroke were included. The onset-to-groin puncture time was ≤12 hours, and aspiration- or stent-based thrombectomy was used as the primary treatment method. Following primary endovascular treatment, intracranial atherosclerotic disease (IAD group) was angiographically diagnosed when a fixed focal stenosis was observed at the occlusion site, whereas embolism (embolic group) was diagnosed if no stenosis was observed. Clinical and treatment variables were compared in both groups, and IAD was evaluated as a prognostic factor for clinical outcomes. RESULTS The baseline NIHSS score tended to be lower (14 versus 22, P = .097) in the IAD group (n = 19) than in the embolic group (n = 32). The procedural time was longer in the IAD group (96 versus 61 minutes, P = .002), despite similar rates of TICI 2b-3 (89.5% versus 87.5%, P = 1.000). The NIHSS score at 7 days was higher (21 versus 8, P = .060) and poor outcomes (mRS 4-6 at 3 months) were more frequent in the IAD group (73.7% versus 43.8%, P = .038). IAD (odds ratio, 5.469; 95% CI, 1.09-27.58; P = .040) was independently associated with poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS An arterial occlusion related to IAD was associated with a longer procedural time and poorer clinical outcome. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the appropriate endovascular strategy.","Kim, Y W; Hong, J M; Park, D G; Choi, J W; Kang, D-H; Kim, Y S; Zaidat, O O; Demchuk, A M; Hwang, Y H; Lee, J S",AJNR.

We looked for documented systematic screening for COVID-19 disease and fever (>38°C) and results of SARS-COV-2 testing, and proposed a minimum acceptable documenting rate of 85%.ResultsThe study included 2197 consecutive patients (1279 (58%) undergoing elective surgery, 917 (42%) undergoing non-elective surgery) across most specialities. Although 926 (72%) patients undergoing elective surgery had both systematic screening and temperature documented, approximately half that percentage undergoing non-elective surgery (n=347; 38%) had both documented. However, 871 (95%) of non-elective surgery patients had temperature documented. Acknowledging limited screening, 85 (9.3%) non-elective surgery patients had positive screening, compared with 39 (3.0%) elective surgery patients. All 152 (7%) patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative, and no cases were reported from external contact tracing.ConclusionsAlthough 'not documented' does not necessarily equal 'not done', we found that documenting of COVID-19 screening could be improved. Better understanding of implementing screening practices in pandemics and other crises, particularly for non-elective surgery patients, is warranted.What is known about the topic?Little is known about routine screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical patients. However, it is well established that implementing effective uptake of safety and quality initiatives can be difficult.What does this paper add?We found that although most patients had documented temperature, fewer than 75% had a documented systematic questionnaire screen for COVID, particularly patients undergoing non-elective surgery.What are the implications for practitioners?Clear documenting is important in managing patients. Pandemics and other crises can require rapid changes in practice. Implementing such measures may be less complete than anticipated and may require greater use of evidence-based implementation strategies, particularly in the less predictable care of non-elective surgery patients.","Story, David; Coyle, Elizabeth; Devapalasundaram, Abarna; Sidiropoulos, Sofia; Ou Yang, Bobby; Coulson, Tim",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,https://doi.org/10.1071/ah20169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962798/,345

The proposed approach for this management system handles the various factors that affect the health of people with diabetes by combining multiple artificial intelligence algorithms. The proposed framework factors the diabetes management problem into subgoals: building a Tensorflow neural network model for food classification; thus, it allows users to upload an image to determine if a meal is recommended for consumption; implementing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm to recommend meals; using cognitive sciences to build a diabetes question and answer chatbot; tracking user activity, user geolocation, and generating pdfs of logged blood sugar readings. The food recognition model was evaluated with cross-entropy metrics that support validation using Neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm. The model learned features of the images fed from local Ghanaian dishes with specific nutritional value and essence in managing diabetics and provided accurate image classification with given labels and corresponding accuracy. The model achieved specified goals by predicting with high accuracy, labels of new images. The food recognition and classification model achieved over 95% accuracy levels for specific calorie intakes. The performance of the meal recommender model and question and answer chatbot was tested with a designed cross-platform user-friendly interface using Cordova and Ionic Frameworks for software development for both mobile and web applications. The system recommended meals to meet the calorific needs of users successfully using KNN (with k = 5) and answered questions asked in a human-like way. The implemented system would solve the problem of managing activity, dieting recommendations, and medication notification of diabetics.","Sowah, Robert A; Bampoe-Addo, Adelaide A; Armoo, Stephen K; Saalia, Firibu K; Gatsi, Francis; Sarkodie-Mensah, Baffour",International journal of telemedicine and applications,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8870141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724304/,345

METHODS All patients hospitalized from 1 February to 15 March 2020 were included in the study (n = 35; 16 men; mean age 78 years). The overall population was divided into two groups: group 1 included 10 patients who presented with a clinical picture of COVID-19 infection and were isolated, and group 2 included 25 patients who were COVID-19-negative. In group 1, nine patients were on chronic oral anticoagulant therapy and one patient was on acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel. A chest computed tomography scan revealed interstitial pneumonia in all 10 patients. RESULTS During hospitalization, COVID-19 patients received azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine in addition to their ongoing therapy. Only the patient on ASA with clopidogrel therapy was transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation because of worsening respiratory failure, and subsequently died from cardiorespiratory arrest. All other patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy recovered and were discharged. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that COVID-19 patients on chronic anticoagulant therapy may have a more favorable and less complicated clinical course. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm this preliminary observation.","Inama, Giuseppe; Dodi, Claudio; Provini, Martino; Bossoni, Enzo; Inama, Lorenza; Balzarini, Laura; Mancini, Chiara; Ramponi, Sara; Marvisi, Maurizio",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890069/,345

Research shows that many factors influence a person's fear of crime, demonstrating that certain groups are generally more fearful than others. Even though they are typically young, college students express being fearful of crime on and off campus. What has yet to be investigated is whether college students who attend school in the United States are fearful at similar levels to their Canadian counterparts. Further, the correlates of fear of crime may also be different. To explore these issues, data from the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment II survey of U.S. and Canadian college students are used. Results show that Canadian college students generally perceive their safety as being higher than U.S. college students, even though they face elevated victimization risks. Further, some correlates of fear of crime differ for U.S. and Canadian college students.

This scoping review aimed to provide insight into the incidence, patterns, risk factors, histopathological findings, and relationship with disease severity of COVID-19-associated liver injury. Furthermore, we identified existing gaps in the research on the hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 and highlighted areas for future investigations. METHODS A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Mallay. Five online databases, along with grey literature, were searched for articles published until 22 May 2020, and we included 62 articles in the review. The research domains, methodological characteristics, and key conclusions were included in the analysis. RESULTS Retrospective observational studies comprised more than one third (41.9%) of the included publications, and 77.8% were conducted on living patients. The incidence of liver injury varied widely across the studies (4.8%-78%), and liver injury was frequently associated with severe COVID-19. We identified the following risk factors for liver injury: male sex, lymphopoenia, gastrointestinal involvement, old age, increased neutrophil count, and the use of hepatotoxic drugs. Histopathological findings indicate that COVID-19 has direct cytopathic effects and causes liver function test derangements secondary to inflammation, hypoxia, and vascular insult. CONCLUSIONS Liver injury following COVID-19 infection is common and primarily hepatocellular, with a greater elevation of aspartate aminotransferase than of alanine aminotransferase. However, the evidence regarding hepatic failure secondary to COVID-19 is insufficient. Standardised criteria to diagnose liver injury need to be devised. Current use of hepatotoxic drugs necessitates close monitoring of liver function.","Bin Arif, T; Khalid, S; Siddiqui, M S; Hussain, H; Sohail, H",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33122448/,345

It is treated as a potential bioterrorism agent because of its rapid transmission by aerosols. JUNV is a negative-sense ssRNA virus that belongs to the genus Arenavirus within the family Arenaviridae, and its genomic RNA contains two segments encoding four proteins. Among these, the nucleoprotein (NP) has essential roles in viral RNA synthesis and immune suppression, but the molecular mechanisms of its actions are only partially understood. Here, we determined a 2.2 Å crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of JUNV NP. This structure showed high similarity to the Lassa fever virus (LASV) NP C-terminal domain. However, both the structure and function of JUNV NP showed differences compared with LASV NP.

140341,Interdisciplinary Telemedicine Services for Huntington's Disease: A 20-Year Experience.,2020-10-06,"Nutritional interventions are not commonly a standard of care in rehabilitation interventions. A nutritional approach has the potential to be a low-cost, high-volume strategy that complements the existing standard of care. In this commentary, our aim is to provide an evidence-based, practical guide for athletes with injuries treated surgically or conservatively, along with healing and rehabilitation considerations. Injuries are a normal and expected part of exercise participation. Regardless of severity, an injury typically results in the athlete's short- or long-term removal from participation. Nutritional interventions may augment the recovery process and support optimal healing; therefore, incorporating nutritional strategies is important at each stage of the healing process. Preoperative nutrition and nutritional demands during rehabilitation are key factors to consider. The physiological response to wounds, immobilization, and traumatic brain injuries may be improved by optimizing macronutrient composition, caloric consumption, and nutrient timing and using select dietary supplements. Previous research supports practical nutrition recommendations to reduce surgical complications, minimize deficits after immobilization, and maximize the chance of safe return to play. These recommendations include identifying the individual's caloric requirements to ensure that energy needs are being met. A higher protein intake, with special attention to evenly distributed consumption throughout the day, will help to minimize loss of muscle and strength during immobilization. Dietary-supplement strategies may be useful when navigating the challenges of appropriate caloric intake and timing and a reduced appetite. The rehabilitation process also requires a strong nutritional plan to enhance recovery from injury. Athletic trainers, physical therapists, and other health care professionals should provide basic nutritional recommendations during rehabilitation, discuss the timing of meals with respect to therapy, and refer the patient to a registered dietitian if warranted. Because nutrition plays an essential role in injury recovery and rehabilitation, nutritional interventions should become a component of standard-of-care practice after injury. In this article, we address best practices for implementing nutritional strategies among patients with athletic injuries.","Smith-Ryan, Abbie E; Hirsch, Katie R; Saylor, Hannah E; Gould, Lacey M; Blue, Malia N M",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-550-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991705/,345

However, the quantitative prediction of genetic response and the correlation between the mechanism and the response curve is poorly understood. Here, we report in silico binding studies of GR systems to show that the transcription factor (TF) binds to multiple DNA sites with high cooperativity spreads from specific binding sites into adjacent non-specific DNA and bends the DNA. Our analysis is not limited only to the isolated model system but also can be applied to a system containing multiple interacting genes. The controlling role of TF oligomerization, TF-ligand interactions, and DNA looping for gene expression has been also characterized. The predictions are validated against detailed grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations and published data for the lac operon system. Overall, our study reveals that the expression of target genes can be quantitatively controlled by modulating TF-ligand interactions and the bending energy of DNA.","Gautam, Pankaj; Kumar Sinha, Sudipta","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062105/,345

This relationship is often measured in terms of life-space, defined as the spatial area through which a person moves within a specific period of time. Life-space is traditionally reported using questionnaires or travel diaries and is, thus, subject to inaccuracies. More recently, studies are using a global positioning system to accurately measure life-space. Although life-space provides useful insights into older adults' relationships with their environment, it does not capture the inherent complexities of environmental exposures.

We describe our method of performing transanal specimen extraction in laparoscopic colorectal surgery, addressing bacteriological and oncological concerns in its implementation. METHODS Data of consecutive patients undergoing natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) laparoscopic colorectal surgery in our institution were retrospectively analysed. All specimens were extracted transanally via a wound protector, followed by intracorporeal end-to-end colorectal anastomosis. Perioperative details, microbiological and oncological findings were reviewed. RESULTS Between November 2014 and February 2015, five patients underwent NOSE laparoscopic colorectal procedures in our institution. All cases were completed laparoscopically and specimens were extracted transanally via a wound protector. There were no cases of post-operative anastomotic leaks, wound infections, intra-abdominal sepsis or faecal incontinence. Oncological margins and lymph node harvest were adequate for malignant cases. Transanal specimen extraction did not result in a malignant yield on peritoneal fluid cytology. CONCLUSIONS Early bacteriological, oncological and functional results show that NOSE is safe and feasible. Follow-up is required to establish that long-term oncological outcome is not compromised.","Ngu, James; Wong, Andrew Siang Yih",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.13383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603221/,345

Appropriate wound electrotherapy may limit incident planktonic and polymicrobial colonization, inhibit biofilm formation and accelerate healing. METHODS The Modular Adaptive Electrotherapy Delivery System (MAEDS) is a lightweight, flexible, battery-powered disposable bandage which delivers controlled reliable electrotherapy to the wound for up to 7 days. Large full-thickness excisional wounds (6 cm diameter) were created in a porcine model and freshly cultured 0.5 McFarland green fluorescent protein-labeled Pseudomonas aeruginosa evenly applied to the wound bed. Control wounds received standard wound care, Tegaderm HP Transparent Dressing (3 M Health Care, St. Paul, MN, USA) applied in a sterile fashion. Treatment wounds received MAEDS electrotherapy for up to 28 days or until healed. Onboard Bluetooth facilitated remote real-time monitoring of MAEDS function. Dressing changes occurred on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Punch biopsies were taken at the wound margin and center. Bacterial samples were processed to determine infection status. RESULTS Acute infected wounds treated with MAEDS electrotherapy were 92% smaller than baseline by POD21. Healing rate was significantly faster (p < 0.01) and infection significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) at POD10, relative to control wounds. CONCLUSION The MAEDS electrotherapy can significantly inhibit infection and enhance healing rate in acute infected wounds.","Bogie, Kath M",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usy276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30395273/,345

In addition to improve response rate, induction therapy should preserve an adequate stem-cell collection. In the present retrospective study, we analyzed stem-cell collection in 325 newly diagnosed myeloma patients who received either VTD or VRD induction before ASCT. Stem-cell mobilization consisted of intravenous cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF. Plerixafor was administered preemptively to rescue mobilization. In comparison with VTD, VRD induction was associated with a more frequent use of plerixafor (19.3% versus 5.4%, p = 0.004) and with an increased number of apheresis to reach adequate collection (>2 apheresis required in 42.3% versus 30.2%, p = 0.05). Moreover, more patients experienced collection failure in the VRD group (6% versus 1.8%, p = 0.004). The median number of CD34-positive cells (×106/kg) was lower in the VRD group: 8.5 versus 9.3 (p = 0.05) in the VTD group. The vast majority of patients underwent ASCT (93% versus 98%, in VRD and VTD group, respectively).

Such worries were a documented concern during the 2013 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Using published experimental data on virus inactivation rates in wastewater and similar matrices, we extracted data to construct a model predicting the T90 (1 × log10 inactivation measured in seconds) of a virus. Extracted data were as follows: RNA or DNA genome, enveloped or not, primary transmission pathway, temperature, pH, light levels, and matrix. From the primary details, we further determined matrix level of contamination, genus, and taxonomic family. Prior to model construction, three records were separated for verification. A censored normal regression model provided the best fit model, which predicted T90 from DNA or RNA structure, enveloped status, whether primary transmission pathway was fecal-oral, temperature, and whether contamination was low, medium, or high. Model residuals and predicted values were evaluated against observed values. Mean values of model predictions were compared to independent data and considering 95% confidence ranges (which could be quite large). A relatively simple model can predict virus inactivation rates from virus and matrix attributes, providing valuable input when formulating risk management strategies for little studied pathogens.","Brainard, Julii; Pond, Katherine; Hunter, Paul R",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b05190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28051304/,345

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is the latest innovation in minimally invasive surgery, and shortens incisions, improves cosmesis, and reduces postoperative pain. We report here the first description of a patient with epidermoid cyst of the cecum treated by ileocecal resection by single-incision laparoscopic surgery. CASE PRESENTATION A 20-year-old woman presented to our hospital with abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 56 × 35-mm cystic mass in the ileocecal area. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 56 × 43-mm, T1-hypointense, T2-hyperintense mass attached to the cecum. Gastrointestinal tumor or duplication cyst was suspected, and ileocecal resection was performed using single-incision laparoscopic surgery. Intraoperative examination showed the tumor as a round, whitish mass arising from the cecum. Operation time was 162 min, and intraoperative blood loss was 10 ml. Macroscopic examination showed a 56 × 45-mm elastic-hard, whitish, round mass arising from the cecal wall. Microscopic examination revealed the cyst wall lined by keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. No malignant findings were identified. The final diagnosis was epidermoid cyst of the cecum. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on postoperative day 5. CONCLUSIONS A rare case of cecal epidermoid cyst is reported. Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy using an organ retractor represents a promising option for treating cecal epidermoid cyst.","Tominaga, Tetsuro; Nonaka, Takashi; Fukuda, Akiko; Moriyama, Masaaki; Oyama, Shosaburo; Ishii, Mitsuhisa; Sawai, Terumitsu; Ueki, Nozomi; Nagayasu, Takeshi",Surgical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40792-021-01138-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630182/,345

Mesh fixation may affect chronic pain and recurrence after inguinal hernia surgery, but long-term results of comparative trials are lacking. METHODS Lichtenstein hernioplasty was performed under local anaesthesia on 625 patients in day care units. The patients were randomised to receive either a cyanoacrylate glue (n = 216), self-gripping mesh (n = 202) or non-absorbable 3-0 polypropylene sutures (n = 216) for the fixation of mesh. A standardised telephone interview or postal questionnaire was conducted 5 years after the index operation. The patients with complaints suggesting recurrence or chronic pain (visual analogue scale ≥ 3, 0-10) were examined clinically. The rate of occasional pain, chronic severe pain, recurrence, re-operations, daily use of analgesics, overall patient satisfaction and sensation of a foreign object were recorded. RESULTS A total of 82% of patients (n = 514) completed the 5-year audit including 177, 167 and 170 patients in the glue, self-fixation and suture groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of pain (7-8%), operated recurrences (2-4%), overall re-operations (4-5%), need for analgesics (1-2%), patient's satisfaction (93-97%) or in the feeling of a foreign object (11-18%) between the study groups. CONCLUSION The choice of the mesh or fixation method had no effect on the overall long-term outcome, pain or recurrence of hernia. Less penetrating fixation (glue or self-gripping mesh) is a safe option for the fixation of mesh in Lichtenstein hernia repair.","Matikainen, M; Vironen, J; Kössi, J; Hulmi, T; Hertsi, M; Rantanen, T; Paajanen, H",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05835-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099665/,345

Natural orifice surgery is an emerging field in which surgical procedures are performed by using an endoluminal approach through an existing body orifice. PATIENTS AND SETTING Two patients at our institution, an academic, tertiary care center. DESIGN Two patients who underwent a standard, stapled, surgical cystgastrostomy for drainage of a complex, infected pseudocyst by using a flexible stapling device are described. These procedures were performed under endoscopic observation and guidance, all transorally, without the need for laparotomy or laparoscopy. RESULTS Both patients had a technically successful outcome, and both did well after surgery, with only mild chest pain and throat discomfort in one, and no adverse sequelae at all in the other patient. Both patients had complete resolution of their complex, debris-filled pseudocysts at 6 weeks when examined by endoscopy and at 3 months when examined by CT. CONCLUSIONS An entirely endoscopic, peroral, stapled pseudocystgastrostomy is feasible and can lead to an excellent outcome.

SETTING Outpatient clinics, inpatient units, residential settings. PARTICIPANTS People with criterion-based diagnoses of dementia and depression. MEASUREMENTS Numbers of participants randomized; baseline and end point depression scale scores; and response, remission, and discontinuation rates were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for response and remission rates, change scores using standardized mean differences, and discontinuation rates. Sensitivity analyses were planned to examine effects of depression diagnosis, severity, and trial duration. RESULTS Seven trials with 330 participants met selection criteria. The odds ratio (OR) for six trials reporting response rates with antidepressant and placebo was 2.12 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.95-4.70; Z=1.84, P=.07). The OR for five trials reporting remission rates was 1.97 (95% CI=0.85-4.55; Z=1.59, P=.11). Both analyses demonstrated heterogeneity. The standardized mean difference in trials was 0.29 (95% CI=0.02-0.60, Z=1.86, P=.06). This analysis did not demonstrate significant heterogeneity. Adverse event discontinuation rates (9.0%) were not significantly higher with drug than placebo (6.0%), and were low.

METHODS An African American-enriched multiinstitutional cohort of 726 PCa patients consisting of both African American men (AAM; n = 254) and European American men (EAM; n = 472) was used in the analyses. Methods of categorical analysis were used. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression differences between anterior and posterior tumor lesions were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with multiple comparison corrections. RESULTS Anti-ERG immunohistochemistry staining showed that the association between ERG status and anterior tumors is independent of race and is consistently robust for both AAM (ERGnegative 81.4% vs. ERGpositive 18.6%; p = .005) and EAM (ERGnegative 60.4% vs. ERGpositive 39.6%; p < .001). In a multivariable model, anterior tumors were more likely to be IHC-ERGnegative (odds ratio [OR]: 3.20; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.14-4.78; p < .001). IHC-ERGnegative were also more likely to have high-grade tumors (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06-2.82; p = .02). In the exploratory genomic analysis, mRNA expression of location-dependent genes is highly influenced by ERG status and African American race. However, tumor location did not impact the expression of AR or the major canonical AR-target genes (KLK3, AMACR, and MYC). CONCLUSIONS ERGnegative tumor status is the strongest predictor of anterior prostate tumors, regardless of race. Furthermore, AR expression and canonical AR signaling do not impact tumor location.","Yamoah, Kosj; Lal, Priti; Awasthi, Shivanshu; Naghavi, Arash O; Rounbehler, Robert J; Gerke, Travis; Berglund, Anders E; Pow-Sang, Julio M; Schaeffer, Edward M; Dhillon, Jasreman; Park, Jong Y; Rebbeck, Timothy R",The Prostate,https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.24086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141952/,345

METHODS A retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the A. Manzoni Hospital (Lecco, Lombardy Region, Italy) and referred to the UCP-H between 11 March 2020 and 18 April 2020, the period of maximum spread of COVID-19 in this area. Data were collected on the type of hospitalisation, triage process, modality of palliative care and psychological support provided. RESULTS 146 COVID-10 patients were referred to the UCP-H. Of these, 120 died during the observation time (82%) while 15 (10.2%) improved and were discharged from the UCP-H care. 93 had less favourable characteristics (rapid deterioration of respiratory function, old age, multiple comorbidities) and an intensive clinical approach was considered contraindicated, while 48 patients had more favourable presentations. Mean follow-up was 4.8 days. A mean of 4.3 assessments per patient were performed. As to respiratory support, 94 patients were treated with oxygen only (at different volumes) and 45 with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP).

The Palliative Care Quality Collaborative (PCQC) provides unique infrastructure for rapid data collection and analysis. Objectives: To capture and describe real-time, real-world experiences of specialty palliative care professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 through a rapid reporting tool and registry. Setting: Palliative care clinicians consulted for patients either positive for COVID-19, under investigation for COVID-19, or recovered from COVID-19. Design: The PCQC created a 13-item COVID-19 case report form (CRF), modeled after the PCQC core dataset for specialty palliative care quality measurement. Twelve items offered discrete answer choices and one was open-ended. The CRF was publicized widely (e.g., social media, e-mail list serves) and completed through a link on the PCQC website. Results: Three hundred six reports (298 adult, 8 pediatric) were submitted between April 6, 2020 and October 7, 2020. The majority of patients (83%) were 50 years or older; 25% were 80 or older, and 78% were COVID-19 positive. Male gender identity was significantly more prevalent than female (58% vs. 40%, p < 0.002). The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular disease (23%). Of adult hospital-based patients, 69% were full code before palliative care consultation versus 28% after (p < 0.05). All pediatric patients were full code before and after palliative care consult. Qualitative themes were strained communication with patients, family visitation challenges, communication barriers between clinicians and families, rapid changes in palliative care medical management, community care options difficult to find, lack of testing in community-based settings, and guardianship and legal challenges. Conclusion: Preliminary data from the first 306 patients reported to the PCQC COVID-19 Registry describe palliative care use concentrated among older and higher risk patients and challenges to the provision of palliative care during this pandemic.","Kamal, Arif H; Thienprayoon, Rachel M; Aldridge, Melissa; Bull, Janet; Fazzalaro, Kristyn; Meier, Diane E; Mueller, Lance; Rodgers, Phillip E; McKenna, Kelly A; Pantilat, Steven Z",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34160293/,345

We performed a retrospective study of patients age 17 years and older with metastatic PPGL who were treated with ablative therapy at Mayo Clinic, USA, between June 14, 1999 and November 14, 2017. Our outcomes measures were radiographic response, procedure-related complications, and symptomatic improvement. Thirty-one patients with metastatic PPGL had 123 lesions treated during 42 RFA, 23 CRYO, and 4 PEI procedures. The median duration of follow-up was 60 months (range, 0⁻163 months) for non-deceased patients. Radiographic local control was achieved in 69/80 (86%) lesions. Improvement in metastasis-related pain or symptoms of catecholamine excess was achieved in 12/13 (92%) procedures. Thirty-three (67%) procedures had no known complications. Clavien-Dindo Grade I, II, IV, and V complications occurred after 7 (14%), 7 (14%), 1 (2%), and 1 (2%) of the procedures, respectively. In patients with metastatic PPGL, ablative therapy can effectively achieve local control and palliate symptoms.","Kohlenberg, Jacob; Welch, Brian; Hamidi, Oksana; Callstrom, Matthew; Morris, Jonathan; Sprung, Juraj; Bancos, Irina; Young, William",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11020195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30736463/,345
154304,Visualization approaches to support healthy aging: A systematic review.,2016,"INTRODUCTION In thermally injured patients, inhalation injury is often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is an independent predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. Extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) therapy offers new possibilities in protective mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients. We performed an early application of ECCO2R in mild-to-moderate ARDS in sheep ventilated in BiPAP mode. Our aim was to investigate its effect on severity of the lung injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS Non-pregnant farm-bred ewes (n = 15) were anesthetized and injured by a combination of wood-bark smoke inhalation and a 40% total body surface area full-thickness burn, and were observed for 72 h or death. The animals were randomized to a Hemolung group (n = 7) or a Control group (n = 8) at time of ARDS onset. ECCO2R was performed in the Hemolung group after onset of ARDS.Histopathology, CT scans, systemic and pulmonary variables, and CO2 removal were examined. RESULTS Early application of ECCO2R therapy with Hemolung in spontaneously breathing sheep decreased PaCO2 significantly, while the device removed about 70 mL of CO2 per minute. This did not result in lower minute ventilation in the Hemolung group. Lungpathology and CT scans did not show a difference between groups. CONCLUSION In an ovine model of ARDS due to smoke inhalation and burn injury, early institution of ECCO2R in spontaneously breathing animals was effective in removing CO2 and in reducing PaCO2. However, it had no effect on reducing the severity of lung injury or mortality. Further studies are necessary to detail the interaction between extracorporeal CO2 removal and pulmonary physiology.","Kreyer, Stefan; Scaravilli, Vittorio; Linden, Katharina; Belenkiy, Slava M; Necsoiu, Corina; Li, Yansong; Putensen, Christian; Chung, Kevin K; Batchinsky, Andriy I; Cancio, Leopoldo C",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674455/,345

We carried out a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of ocriplasmin studies conducted in real-world settings (RWS) and compared outcomes with those from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS We included prospective and retrospective studies from RWS documenting effectiveness of ocriplasmin in patients with VMT with or without MH, and RCTs of ocriplasmin versus control. Key end-points were vitreomacular adhesion resolution (VMAR), nonsurgical MH closure, need for vitrectomy and safety. We conducted meta-regression on pooled results to evaluate effects of baseline covariates and study design on outcomes. RESULTS Thirty RWS (2402 patients) and 5 RCTs (737 patients) were included epiretinal membrane (ERM) and broad VMA were more prevalent in RCTs. Primary VMAR, vitrectomy and MH closure rates were comparable between RWS and RCTs. Rates of nsVMAR were significantly higher in RWS than RCTs (odds ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-2.34). nsVMAR rates were inversely associated with ERM prevalence (odds ratio 0.20; 95% CI: 0.08-0.51). Compared with the recent OASIS trial, RWS reported a higher incidence of new/worsening subretinal fluid cases and less photophobia, photopsia, vitreous floaters, electroretinogram abnormalities and MH progression. CONCLUSIONS Ocriplasmin was significantly more effective in achieving nsVMAR in RWS than in RCTs. Lower ERM prevalence in RWS was the single significant explanatory variable for this difference. Conclusions on ocriplasmin safety in RWS are limited due to inconsistent reporting.","Khanani, Arshad M; Constantine, Ryan N; Blot, Koenraad H; Lescrauwaet, Benedicte; Szurman, Peter",Acta ophthalmologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369248/,345
154421,Autotraumatic Stress Disorders: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Variants When the Victim Bears Responsibility for the Trauma.,2020-09-09,"OBJECTIVE To compare the different self-management models (multidisciplinary case management, regularly supported self-management, and minimally supported self-management) and self-monitoring models against usual care and education to determine which are most effective at reducing healthcare use and improving quality of life in asthma. DESIGN Systematic review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EconLit, Embase, Health Economics Evaluations Database, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2000 to April 2019. REVIEW METHODS Randomised controlled trials involving the different self-management models for asthma were included. The primary outcomes were healthcare use (hospital admission or emergency visit) and quality of life. Summary standardised mean differences (SMDs) and 95% credible intervals were estimated using bayesian network meta-analysis with random effects. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS From 1178 citations, 105 trials comprising 27 767 participants were included. In terms of healthcare use, both multidisciplinary case management (SMD -0.18, 95% credible interval -0.32 to -0.05) and regularly supported self-management (-0.30, -0.46 to -0.15) were significantly better than usual care. For quality of life, only regularly supported self-management (SMD 0.54, 0.11 to 0.96) showed a statistically significant benefit compared with usual care. For trials including adolescents/children (age 5-18 years), only regularly supported self-management showed statistically significant benefits (healthcare use: SMD -0.21, -0.40 to -0.03; quality of life: 0.23, 0.03 to 0.48). Multidisciplinary case management (SMD -0.32, -0.50 to -0.16) and regularly supported self-management (-0.32, -0.53 to -0.11) were most effective at reducing healthcare use in patients with symptoms of severe asthma at baseline. CONCLUSIONS This network meta-analysis indicates that regularly supported self-management reduces the use of healthcare resources and improves quality of life across all levels of asthma severity. Future healthcare investments should provide support that offer reviews totalling at least two hours to establish self-management skills, reserving multidisciplinary case management for patients with complex disease.

By using intravenous or topical fluorescent agents, CLE highlights certain mucosal elements that facilitate an optical biopsy in real time. CLE technology has been used in different organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. There has been numerous studies evaluating this technology in gastrointestinal endoscopy, our aim was to evaluate the safety, value, and efficacy of this technology in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) Technology and Value Assessment Committee (TAVAC) performed a PubMed/Medline database search of clinical studies involving CLE in May of 2018. The literature search used combinations of the keywords: confocal laser endomicroscopy, pCLE, Cellvizio, in vivo microscopy, optical histology, advanced endoscopic imaging, and optical diagnosis. Bibliographies of key references were searched for relevant studies not covered by the PubMed search. Case reports and small case series were excluded. The manufacturer's website was also used to identify key references. The United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) Manufacturer And User facility and Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for reports regarding the device malfunction or injuries. RESULTS The technology offers an excellent safety profile with rare adverse events related to the use of fluorescent agents. It has been shown to increase the detection of dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, gastric intraepithelial neoplasia/early gastric cancer, and dysplasia associated with inflammatory bowel disease when compared to standard screening protocols. It also aids in the differentiation and classification of colorectal polyps, indeterminate biliary strictures, and pancreatic cystic lesions. CONCLUSIONS CLE has an excellent safety profile. CLE can increase the diagnostic accuracy in a number of gastrointestinal pathologies.","Al-Mansour, Mazen R; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Davis, Brian R; Alawashez, Abdulrahim; Docimo, Salvatore; Qureshi, Alia; Tsuda, Shawn",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07607-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405892/,345
155703,Telemedicine and Telehealth in Nursing Homes: An Integrative Review.,2021-04-02,"Background: There is little research examining adherence to practice guidelines for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). We assessed same-day LARC provision and adherence to other guideline-recommended practices among providers in a large academic health care system. Materials and Methods: We surveyed 363 providers who had billed using LARC-related codes within the prior 12 months. Primary outcomes were, for women requesting an intrauterine device (IUD) or implant, the typical number of visits for method provision and ability to add an insertion procedure to an annual examination. We used chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with primary outcomes and described other practices and barriers to same-day LARC. Results: Our response rate was 42% (153/363). A typical single visit for women requesting an IUD or implant was reported by 37% of IUD providers and 51% of implant providers, respectively, and was associated with obstetrician-gynecologist specialty versus family medicine (IUD: 44% vs. 12%, p = 0.001; implant: 57% vs. 26%, p = 0.002) and practicing in the county of the main academic medical center versus any other county (IUD: 48% vs. 20%, p = 0.001; implant: 65% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). High ability to add LARC insertion to an annual examination was reported by 48% of IUD providers and 51% of implant providers, with similar associations of specialty and county. Barriers to same-day LARC included scheduling constraints, insurance and billing concerns, and device stocking. Nearly all respondents provide LARC to nulliparous women and adolescents. Among IUD providers, 73% schedule routine follow-up after insertion. Conclusions: Same-day LARC provision is low among providers in a large academic health care system. Provider-identified barriers suggest interventions to improve LARC access, including incentivizing device stocking and billing and insurance education.","Judge-Golden, Colleen P; Wiesenfeld, Harold C; Chen, Beatrice A; Borrero, Sonya",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.8169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667847/,345
155709,Rapid Implementation and Adaptation of a Telehospitalist Service to Coordinate and Optimize Care for COVID-19 Patients.,2020-08-14,"LncRNAs are of functional long non-coding RNAs, which have been shown to be involved in critical pathways in cancer development. LncRNA-HOTAIR gene overexpression has been reported in several cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between two variants of lncRNA-HOTAIR (rs1899663 G>T and rs4759314 A>G) gene polymorphisms and the risk of ovarian cancer (OC) susceptibility. We performed a case and control analysis on two hundred individuals consisting of 100 cases with OC and 100 women cancer-free in East Azerbaijan of Iranian population. To evaluate the association between two SNPs of lncRNA-HOTAIR with the risk of OC susceptibility used the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. We revealed that two SNPs in the lncRNA-HOTAIR gene were significantly associated with the risk of OC. The dominant model of rs4759314 in lncRNA-HOTAIR (AA vs. GA/GG) showed a significantly increased risk with an OR of 10.036 (CI 2.253-44.712, P = 0.000); the recessive model of rs1899663 (TT vs. GT/GG) revealed a significantly increased risk with OR of 0.910 (CI 0.856-0.968; P = 0.002). In addition, our findings demonstrated that the 4759314G (OR 13.500; CI 3.146-57.940; P = 0.000) and 1899663T (OR 3.273; CI 1.433-7.475; P = 0.003) alleles are increased the risk of OC susceptibility.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Recent data have confirmed the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive liver surgery. Despite these reports, no programmatic approach to minimally invasive liver surgery has been proposed. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent a minimally invasive procedure for the management of hepatic tumors between January 2001 and April 2008. Patients were divided into 3 groups: laparoscopy with intraoperative ultrasound and biopsy only, laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and minimally invasive resection. To compare the various forms of surgery, we analyzed the incidence of complications, tumor recurrence, mortality, and cost. Statistical analysis was performed using chi(2) analysis, Student t test, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the log-rank test, and multivariable Cox models. RESULTS A total of 590 minimally invasive hepatic procedures were performed during 489 operative interventions. The representative tumor histologies were: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; N = 210), colorectal carcinoma (N = 40), miscellaneous liver metastases (N = 42), biliary cancer (N = 20), and benign tumors (N = 176). Thirty-five patients underwent laparoscopic ultrasound and confirmatory biopsy alone; 201 patients underwent 240 laparoscopic RFAs, and 253 patients underwent 306 minimally invasive resections. Conversion rates to open surgery for the RFA and resection group were 2% overall. One hundred ninety-nine (40.6%) patients were cirrhotic; 31 resections were performed in cirrhotic patients. Complication and mortality rates for RFA and resection were comparable (11% vs. 16%, and 1.5% vs. 1.6%). However, complication rates (14% vs. 29%; P = 0.02) and mortality (0.3% vs. 9.7%; P = 0.006) rates were higher in the cirrhotic versus noncirrhotic resection group. Overall recurrence rates for RFA and resection groups were 24% and 23%, respectively. Local recurrence rates were higher in the RFA group (6.3% versus 1.5%; P < 0.06). Overall patient survival differed between HCC patients receiving RFA alone and those receiving RFA and OLT (P < 0.0001). Overall survival for cancer patients receiving RFA versus resection differed significantly when unadjusted for other covariates (P = 0.01), and remained marginally significant in a multivariable model (P = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive hepatic surgery has become a viable alternative to open hepatic surgery. Our present data are equivalent or superior to those encountered in any large open series. Our experience with RFA confirms a low local recurrence rate and an excellent technique for bridging patients to transplantation. Morbidity and mortality rates for minimally invasive hepatic resections in cirrhotics, is similar to other reported open resection series. This series confirmed excellent interim survival rates after laparoscopic HR and superiority over RFA in the treatment of cancer, with significantly lower local tumor recurrence rate.","Buell, Joseph F; Thomas, Mark T; Rudich, Steven; Marvin, Michael; Nagubandi, Ravi; Ravindra, Kadiyala V; Brock, Guy; McMasters, Kelly M",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e318185e647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18791368/,345

A total of 204 topsoil samples containing nine HMs were collected from 78 urban parks of Shanghai in China, and used to assess the health risks caused by HMs in soils. The results revealed that the Hg, Cd and Pb were the main enriched pollutants and posed higher ecological risks than the other HMs. Four HM sources (including natural sources, agricultural activities, industrial production and traffic emissions) were identified by combining the Positive matrix factorization model and Correlation analysis, with the contribution rate of 48.24%, 7.03%, 13.04% and 31.69%, respectively. The assessment of Probabilistic health risks indicated that the Non-carcinogenic risks for all populations were negligible. However, the Total carcinogenic risk cannot be negligible and children were more susceptible than adults. The assessment results of source-oriented health risks showed that industrial production and traffic emissions were estimated to be the most important anthropogenic sources of health risks for all populations.

We used a panel dataset for the period 2000-2015. The following health care inputs were used in the analysis: density of general practitioners, specialists and nurses, as well as density of hospital beds. We find that amenable mortality fell from 136 per 100,000 in 2000, to 124.1 per 100,000 in 2015 nationally, with significant heterogeneity in the trends across states. Mortality due to infectious diseases, diseases of childhood, and cardiovascular diseases decreased, while deaths due to other non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, increased. There was a significant negative association between the density of general practitioners and specialist physicians, and amenable mortality. Our results indicate that reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases must be a health system priority. Improvements in primary health care could lead to improved disease detection and earlier diagnosis which could further reduce amenable mortality in Mexico.","Nikoloski, Zlatko; Albala, Sarah; Montero, Andres Madriz; Mossialos, Elias",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932691/,345

DESIGN A response-anonymous 19-question survey was electronically distributed to all general surgery residents at a single academic university-based general surgery residency program. SETTING University of Southern California (USC) general surgery residency participants: Voluntarily participating general surgery residents at the University of Southern California. RESULTS The response rate from USC general surgery residents was 100%. A majority of residents (76%) had utilized either video- or telephone-based visits during their careers. No resident had undergone formal training to provide telemedicine, although most residents indicated a desire for training (57.1%) and acknowledged that telemedicine should be a part of surgical training (75.6%). A wide variety of opinions regarding the educational experience of residents participating in telemedicine visits was elicited. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic brought telemedicine to the forefront as an integral part of future patient care, including for surgical patients.

Easy accessibility and rapid protein changes in response to disease pathogenesis makes serum an attractive sample for clinical research. Despite these advantages, the analysis of serum proteome is very challenging due to the wide dynamic range of proteins, difficulty in finding low-abundance target analytes due to the presence of high-abundance serum proteins, high levels of salts and other interfering compounds, variations among individuals and paucity of reproducibility. Sample preparation introduces pre-analytical variations and poses major challenges to analyze the serum proteome. The label-free detection techniques such as surface plasmon resonance, microcantilever, few nanotechniques and different resonators are rapidly emerging for the analysis of serum proteome and they have exhibited potential to overcome few limitations of the conventional techniques.

After suggestions and assessments of several therapeutic options, remdesivir (GS-5734), a direct-acting antiviral drug previously tested against Ebola virus disease, was found to be moderately effective and probably safe for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Finally, on 1 May 2020, remdesivir (GS-5734) was granted emergency use authorization as an investigational drug for the treatment of Covid-19 by the Food and Drug Administration. However, without a doubt, there are challenging days ahead. Here, we provide a review of the latest findings (based on preprints, post-prints, and news releases in scientific websites) related to remdesivir efficacy and safety for the treatment of Covid-19, along with covering remdesivir history from bench-to-bedside, as well as an overview of its mechanism of action. In addition, active clinical trials, as well as challenging issues related to the future of remdesivir in Covid-19, are covered.

159531,The impact of telemedicine on patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia: Findings and implications.,2021-02-01,"A disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family are widely implicated in tissue remodeling events manifested in cancer development. ADAMTS1, the most fully characterized ADAMTS, plays conflicting roles in different cancer types; however, the role of ADAMTS1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. Herein, we found that ADAMTS1 is highly expressed in RCC tissues compared to normal renal tissues, and its expression was correlated with an advanced stage and a poor prognosis of RCC patients. In vitro, we observed higher expression of ADAMTS1 in metastatic (m)RCC cells compared to primary cells, and manipulation of ADAMTS1 expression affected cell invasion and clonogenicity. Results from protease array showed that ADAMTS1 is modulated by melatonin through mechanisms independent of the MT1 receptor in mRCC cells, and overexpression of ADAMTS1 relieved the invasion/clonogenicity and growth/metastasis inhibition imposed by melatonin treatment in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft model. The human microRNA (miR) OneArray showed that miR-181d and miR-let-7f were induced by melatonin and respectively targeted the 3'-UTR and non-3'UTR of ADAMTS1 to suppress its expression and mRCC invasive ability. Clinically, RCC patients with high levels of miR-181d or miR-let-7f and a low level of ADAMTS1 had the most favorable prognoses. In addition, ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of ADAMTS1 can also be triggered by melatonin. Together, our study indicates that ADAMTS1 may be a useful biomarker for predicting RCC progression. The novel convergence between melatonin and ADAMTS1 post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation provides new insights into the role of melatonin-induced molecular regulation in suppressing RCC progression.","Wen, Yu-Ching; Lin, Yung-Wei; Chu, Chih-Ying; Yang, Yi-Chieh; Yang, Shun-Fa; Liu, Yu-Fan; Hsiao, Michael; Lee, Wei-Jiunn; Chien, Ming-Hsien",Journal of pineal research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jpi.12668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408377/,345

Herein, we present a case of a 50-year-old healthy woman who had an early postoperative anastomotic obstruction which was revealed caused by a blood clot and successfully managed by endoscopic approach. The patient was discharged after laparoscopic anterior resection and visited the emergency department one day after because of abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed that the anastomosis site was obstructed with low-density material. Intraoperative endoscopy was performed under general anesthesia and blood clot filling the lumen were identified. As the scope was advanced to the blood clot with air inflation, the blood clot was evacuated. The anastomosis site could be obstructed by blot clot with mucous debris albeit it is a rare condition. An endoscopic approach seems to be the first option in the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative obstruction at the anastomosis site and it could prevent unnecessary laparotomy.","Kwon, Soon Keun; Han, Jin Soo; Seo, Jihyun; Yoon, Yong Sik",Annals of coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.3393/ac.2020.06.11.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207114/,345

As conventional mechanical ventilation, inspiratory gas humidification is essential. However, humidification during HFOV has not been clarified. In this bench study, we evaluated humidification during HFOV in the open circumstance of ICU. Our hypothesis is that humidification during HFOV is affected by circuit design and ventilatory settings. METHODS/MATERIALS We connected a ventilator with HFOV mode to a neonatal lung model that was placed in an infant incubator set at 37 degrees C. We set a heated humidifier (Fisher & Paykel) to obtain 37 degrees C at the chamber outlet and 40 degrees C at the distal temperature probe. We measured absolute humidity and temperature at the Y-piece using a rapid-response hygrometer. We evaluated two types of ventilator circuit: a circuit with inner heating wire and another with embedded heating element. In addition, we evaluated three lengths of the inspiratory limb, three stroke volumes, three frequencies, and three mean airway pressures. RESULTS The circuit with embedded heating element provided significantly higher absolute humidity and temperature than one with inner heating wire. As an extended tube lacking a heating wire was shorter, absolute humidity and temperature became higher. In the circuit with inner heating wire, absolute humidity and temperature increased as stroke volume increased. CONCLUSION Humidification during HFOV is affected by circuit design and ventilatory settings.","Chikata, Yusuke; Imanaka, Hideaki; Onishi, Yoshiaki; Ueta, Masahiko; Nishimura, Masaji",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03068.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19624365/,345

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on the accuracy of the alpha-defensin immunoassay and leukocyte esterase colorimetric strip test for the diagnosis of PJI compared with the Musculoskeletal Infection Society diagnostic criteria. METHODS We performed a systematic review to identify diagnostic technique studies evaluating the accuracy of alpha-defensin or leukocyte esterase in the diagnosis of PJI. MEDLINE and Embase on Ovid, ACM, ADS, arXiv, CERN DS (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire Document Server), CrossRef DOI (Digital Object Identifier), DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project), Espacenet, Google Scholar, Gutenberg, HighWire, IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers digital library), INSPIRE, JSTOR (Journal Storage), OAlster (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), Open Content, Pubget, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for appropriate studies indexed from inception until May 30, 2015, along with unpublished or gray literature. The classification of studies and data extraction were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Data extraction permitted meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity with construction of receiver operating characteristic curves for each test. RESULTS We included 11 eligible studies. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of alpha-defensin (6 studies) for PJI were 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.00) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.99), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for alpha-defensin and PJI was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98 to 1.00). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase (5 studies) for PJI were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.95) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.99), respectively. The AUC for leukocyte esterase and PJI was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies for both diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy for PJI was high for both tests.

In the third world countries, information about CAP etiology is scarce. Therefore, rapid and highly sensitive diagnostic methods are crucial to determine etiological agents. METHODS Between March 2016 and March 2017, we have prospectively studied the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and molecular aspects of patients with CAP at 2 tertiary-level hospitals in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS A total of 274 children were evaluated, with a median age of 13 months. An etiologic agent was identified in 187 patients (68.2%): 54% (n = 148) were viruses and 14.2% (n = 39) were bacteria. CAP prevalence was highest among children under 2 years (71%; 195/274); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent cause in 22% (60/274), especially among infants, followed by influenza (14.5%; 40/274). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 7% of the total (19/274), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (3%;8/274) and Haemophilus influenzae (1.4%;4/274). Together, these cases accounted for 79.5% (31/39) of all bacterial CAP. Pleural effusion (PE) complicated CAP in 13.8% (38/274), of which 29 were of bacterial etiology. RT-PCR increased the detection rate of pneumococcus by 47%. Coinfection occurred in 28 patients (10%); 26 (9.5%) required intensive care and 9 patients (3%) died. CONCLUSIONS RT-PCR provided additional diagnostic value to conventional, clinical, and laboratory methods. The higher prevalence of RSV, influenza, and Streptococcus pneumoniae reveals the need for preventive measures with better vaccine uptake and future research for RSV vaccines.","Gareca Perales, José; Soleto Ortiz, Lorena; Loayza Mafayle, Roxana; Machuca Soto, Blanca; Hidalgo Flores, Lucia; López Montaño, Javier; Zuna Calle, Neida; Jarovsky, Daniel; Naaman Berezin, Eitan",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006878/,345
162072,A scoping review of feed interventions and livelihoods of small-scale livestock keepers.,2020-10-01,"RATIONALE Acute lung dysfunction of noninfectious etiology, known as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), is a severe complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Several mouse models have been recently developed to determine the underlying causes of IPS. A cohesive interpretation of experimental data and their relationship to the findings of clinical research studies in humans is needed to better understand the basis for current and future clinical trials for the prevention/treatment of IPS. OBJECTIVES Our goal was to perform a comprehensive review of the preclinical (i.e., murine models) and clinical research on IPS. METHODS An ATS committee performed PubMed and OVID searches for published, peer-reviewed articles using the keywords ""idiopathic pneumonia syndrome"" or ""lung injury"" or ""pulmonary complications"" AND ""bone marrow transplant"" or ""hematopoietic stem cell transplant."" No specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were determined a priori for this review. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Experimental models that reproduce the various patterns of lung injury observed after HSCT have identified that both soluble and cellular inflammatory mediators contribute to the inflammation engendered during the development of IPS. To date, 10 preclinical murine models of the IPS spectrum have been established using various donor and host strain combinations used to study graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This, as well as the demonstrated T cell dependency of IPS development in these models, supports the concept that the lung is a target of immune-mediated attack after HSCT. The most developed therapeutic strategy for IPS involves blocking TNF signaling with etanercept, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS IPS remains a frequently fatal complication that limits the broader use of allogeneic HSCT as a successful treatment modality. Faced with the clinical syndrome of IPS, one can categorize the disease entity with the appropriate tools, although cases of unclassifiable IPS will remain. Significant research efforts have resulted in a paradigm shift away from identifying noninfectious lung injury after HSCT solely as an idiopathic clinical syndrome and toward understanding IPS as a process involving aspects of both the adaptive and the innate immune response. Importantly, new laboratory insights are currently being translated to the clinic and will likely prove important to the development of future strategies to prevent or treat this serious disorder.","Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela; Griese, Matthias; Madtes, David K; Belperio, John A; Haddad, Imad Y; Folz, Rodney J; Cooke, Kenneth R",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.2007-413st; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21531955/,345
162458,A Processed EEG based Brain Anesthetic Resistance Index Predicts Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults: A Dual Center Study,2021-01-08,"Background It is unclear whether intravenous thrombolysis ( IVT ) with alteplase before endovascular treatment ( EVT ) is beneficial for patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a large vessel occlusion. We compared clinical and procedural outcomes, safety, and workflow between patients treated with both IVT and EVT and those treated with EVT alone in routine clinical practice. Methods and Results Using multivariable regression, we evaluated the association of IVT + EVT with 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale), mortality, reperfusion, first-pass effect, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomised Controlled Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands) Registry. Of 1485 patients, 1161 (78%) were treated with IVT + EVT , and 324 (22%) with EVT alone. Patients treated with IVT + EVT had atrial fibrillation less often (16% versus 44%) and had better pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale scores (pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale 0: 73% versus 52%) than those treated with EVT alone. Procedure time was shorter in the IVT + EVT group (median 62 versus 68 minutes). Nontransferred IVT + EVT patients had longer door-to-groin-puncture times (median 105 versus 94 minutes). IVT + EVT was associated with better functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio 1.47; 95% CI : 1.10-1.96) and lower mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.58; 95% CI : 0.40-0.82). Successful reperfusion, first-pass effect, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage did not differ between groups. Conclusions In this observational study, patients treated with IVT + EVT had better clinical outcomes than patients who received EVT alone. This finding may demonstrate a true benefit of IVT before EVT , but its interpretation is hampered by the possibility of residual confounding and selection bias.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed of 204 consecutive patients with giant intracranial aneurysms who underwent surgical treatment in our department from 1995 to 2008. Clinical outcome was evaluated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale. RESULTS Surgical modalities included direct aneurysm neck clipping in 102 patients (50.0%), parent artery reconstruction in 51 patients (25.0%), proximal artery ligation in 23 patients (11.3%; 4 patients combined with revascularization), trapping in 26 patients (12.7%), and wrapping in 2 patients (1.0%). Follow-up data were available for 181 patients (88.7%), with a mean follow-up period of 62 months (range, 12-164 months). A good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 5) was observed in 114 patients (63.0%), and a poor outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-4) was observed in 67 patients (37.0%). Independent factors that affected prognosis were age and location of aneurysm. Older age (≥50 years) and location of aneurysm in posterior circulation were associated with poor outcome. In 85 patients with preoperative subarachnoid hemorrhage, patients with a higher Hunt and Hess grade (≥3) had a worse outcome compared with patients with a low Hunt and Hess grade (1 or 2). Surgical modalities and other factors were not significantly associated with clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS Giant intracranial aneurysms are effectively treated with craniotomy and surgical treatment. Older age, aneurysm location in posterior circulation, and higher Hunt and Hess grade are risk factors affecting prognosis.","Xu, Long; Deng, Xiaofeng; Wang, Shuo; Cao, Yong; Zhao, Yuanli; Zhang, Dong; Zhang, Yan; Wang, Rong; Qi, Wei; Zhao, Jizong",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2017.03.055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28342923/,345

164212,Prognosis of anosmia in patients of covid-19,2021,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the international community has been concerned about the emergence of mutations that alter the biological properties of the pathogen, for example, increasing its infectivity or virulence. In particular, since the end of 2020, several variants of concern have been identified around the world, including variants “alpha” (B.1.1.7, “British”), “beta” (B.1.351, “South African”), “gamma” (P.1, “Brazilian”) and “delta” (B.1.617.2, “Indian”). However, the existing mechanism for searching for important mutations and identifying strains may not be effective enough, since only a relatively small fraction of all identified pathogen samples can be examined for genetic changes by whole genome sequencing due to its high cost. In this study, we used the method of targeted high-throughput sequencing of the most significant regions of the gene encoding the S-glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, for which a primer panel was developed. Using this technique, we examined 579 random samples obtained from patients in Moscow and the Moscow region with coronavirus infection from February to June 2021. The study demonstrated the dynamics of the representation in the Moscow region of a number of SARS-CoV-2 strains and its most significant individual mutations in the period from February to June 2021. It was found that the strain B.1.617.2 began to spread rapidly in Moscow and the Moscow region in May, and in June it became dominant, partially displacing other varieties of the virus. The results obtained make it possible to accurately determine the belonging of the samples to the abovementioned and some other strains. The approach can be used to standardize the procedure for searching for new and existing epidemiologically significant mutations in certain regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which allows studying a large number of samples in a short time and to get a more detailed picture of the epidemiological situation in the region.","Borisova, N.I.; Kotov, I.A.; Kolesnikov, A.A.; Kaptelova, V.V.; Speranskaya, A.S.; Kondrasheva, L.Yu.; Tivanova, E.V.; Khafizov, K.F.; Akimkin, V.

Since that time, the disability benefit system has been subject to a series of reforms, all largely aimed at reducing the number of claims and targeting benefits more closely to those with the greatest health need. At the same time, the labour market has also evolved, and until the recent Covid-19 pandemic, it had a historically low level of unemployment, accompanied by falling real earnings. We use individual longitudinal data from 2010 to 2018 in a dynamic panel framework to explore the relative importance of health status, benefit generosity and local labour market conditions for disability benefit claims in the modern British labour market. We focus particularly on spatial variation in claims, and find that, in line with older evidence, while health status is clearly important, geographic variation in labour market conditions still influences the propensity to claim those disability benefits that are conditional on not working. © 2021 The Authors.

We have focused on serum expression levels of microRNA (miRNA) a novel concept of in host-virus interactions. MicroRNA expression profiles were investigated in serum samples of COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: The samples were collected from 40 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 patients and from 10 healthy controls. Expression profile of 20 miRNAs were examined using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).

Considering a mass range of $[10^{-7}-10^{-2}]M_\odot$, inspiraling primordial black holes could emit either continuous gravitational waves, quasi-monochromatic signals that last for many years, or transient continuous waves, signals whose frequency evolution follows a power law and last for $\mathcal{O}$(hours-months). We show that primordial black hole binaries in our galaxy may produce detectable gravitational waves for different mass functions and formation mechanisms. In order to detect these inspirals, we adapt methods originally designed to search for gravitational waves from asymmetrically rotating neutron stars. The first method, the Frequency-Hough, exploits the continuous, quasi-monochromatic nature of inspiraling black holes that are sufficiently light and far apart such that their orbital frequencies can be approximated as linear with a small spin-up. The second method, the Generalized Frequency-Hough, drops the assumption of linearity and allows the signal frequency to follow a power-law evolution. We explore the parameter space to which each method is sensitive, derive a theoretical sensitivity estimate, determine optimal search parameters and calculate the computational cost of all-sky and directed searches. We forecast limits on the abundance of primordial black holes within our galaxy, showing that we can constrain the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes compose, $f_{\rm PBH}$, to be $f_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 1$ for chirp masses between $[4\times 10^{-5}-10^{-3}]M_\odot$ for current detectors. For the Einstein Telescope, we expect the constraints to improve to $f_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for chirp masses between [$10^{-4}-10^{-3}]M_\odot$.","Miller, Andrew L.; Clesse, S'ebastien; Lillo, Federico De; Bruno, Giacomo; Depasse, Antoine; Tanasijczuk, Andres",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12983v2.pdf,345

Besides, a brief role of NSP6 in autophagosome formation, this is not studied significantly. Also, there is no structural information available till date. Based on the prediction by TMHMM server for transmembrane prediction, it is found that the N-terminal residues (1-11), middle region residues (91-112) and C-terminal residues (231-290) lies outside the membrane. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations showed that NSP6 consisting of helical structures, whereas membrane outside lying region (91-112) showed partial helicity, which further used as model and obtain disordered type conformation after 1.5 microsecond. Whereas, the residues 231-290 has both helical and beta sheet conformations in its structure model. A 200ns simulations resulted in the loss of beta sheet structures, while helical regions remained intact. Further, we have characterized the residue 91-112 by using reductionist approaches. The NSP6 (91-112) was found disordered like in isolation, which gain helical conformation in different biological mimic environmental conditions. These studies can be helpful to study NSP6 (91-112) interactions with host proteins, where different protein conformation might play significant role.

While there have been many simulations of droplet evaporation to determine whether droplets containing virions remain floating in air or rapidly fall to the ground, they typically conceal the fundamental mechanisms because of the use of numerics. To make the physics of emitted oral fluid droplets easily understood, we present simple and transparent algebraic equations that capture the essential physics of the problem. Calculations with these equations provide a straightforward way to determine the airborne lifetime of emitted droplets after accounting for the decrease in droplet size from water evaporation. At a relative humidity of 50%, droplets with initial radii larger than about 50 microns rapidly fall to the ground while smaller, potentially-virus containing droplets shrink in size and remain airborne for many minutes. Rough estimates of airborne virion emission rates while speaking support the proposal that covering the mouth can help end the pandemic more quickly.","Eaton, W. A.; Bax, A.; Netz, R.

For this reason, this study aims to address students as hosts of VFR travel and analyzes differences in the visitor and the host segment. As a result, marketing implications for destination marketing organizations that seek to realize the potential of the student VFR segment arise. Design/methodology/approach: This research project adopts a multi-method approach to derive a deeper empirical understanding of visitors’ behaviors and the role of students hosting friends and relatives (SHFR). The quantitative study aims to reveal the relevance and differences between visits to friends (VF) and visits to relatives (VR), whereas the qualitative study elaborates on the findings of the quantitative study and seeks to understand the role and experiences of students as hosts. Findings: The findings reveal that VR and VF travelers vary in terms of their expenditure. Hosts’ spending depends on visitors’ budgets;in general, both their direct and indirect (when relatives pay) spending increases when they have visitors. Furthermore, the data identify two distinct hosting styles: functional hosting is concerned with providing outstanding hospitality based on a more traditional, guest-oriented understanding of the role, whereas integrative hosting blurs the lines between hospitality and lifestyle based on a more modern, host-oriented understanding of the role. Research limitations/implications: Regarding limitations, this study did not differentiate between students who were simultaneously locals and students who resided in the city only for study purposes. In a similar vein, the cultural background of the students was not considered in the research. Finally, the differences between VF and VR could further be explored in a quantitative follow-up study and in testing for significant differences in SHFR spending behaviors. Further research could examine whether domestic travelers, travelers with cultural proximity and/or short-distance VFR travelers are more likely to visit after COVID-19 as suggested by Backer and Ritchie (2017) in the case of crises and disaster. Practical implications: Students as hosts differ from other hosts in VFR travel in their reluctance to embrace conventional tourism products. This study found that place attachment makes hosts of VFR travelers passionate ambassadors and advertisers for the destinations;destination marketing organizations (DMOs) could support this already positive image by providing and supporting students with more detailed information about their cities and the opportunities they offer. Results are of particular relevance because the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing DMOs to develop destination strategies that incorporate social-distancing and avoid crowded places. Social implications: When students take their friends out to events and nightclubs, they contribute significantly to experiences that go beyond typical tourism activities such as sightseeing and shopping. By offering special discounts to visitors who come with their hosts, DMOs could help visitors delve more deeply into city life and thereby reduce the likeliness of crowded city centers. Considering the findings relating to the social and emotional qualities of VFR travel, DMO marketing to VFR travelers could benefit from promoting socio-cultural spaces and offerings that value groups’ social ties (e.g. family prices for families with adult children) or alumni status. Originality/value: According to the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first which analyzes both, visitors and hosts of VFR travel using a two methods approach. Very recently, Griffin and Guttenberg (2020) miss VFR research focusing on the heterogeneity of the segment, and Backer et al. (2020) claim for more VFR research on the role of hosts carried out outside of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the USA. To the authors’ best knowledge, this study is the first which delivers empirical insights on SHFR in Ce tral Europe. © 2021, Tanja Petry, Birgit Pikkemaat, Chung-Shing Chan and Ursula Scholl-Grissemann.","Petry, T.; Pikkemaat, B.; Chan, C.

171759,Segmentation and shielding of the most vulnerable members of the population as elements of an exit strategy from COVID-19 lockdown,,"Background Numerous Ebola virus outbreaks have occurred in Equatorial Africa over the past decades. Besides human fatalities, gorillas and chimpanzees have also succumbed to the fatal virus. The 2004 outbreak at the Odzala-Kokoua National Park (Republic of Congo) alone caused a severe decline in the resident western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) population, with a 95% mortality rate. Here, we explore the immediate genetic impact of the Ebola outbreak in the western lowland gorilla population. Results Associations with survivorship were evaluated by utilizing DNA obtained from fecal samples from 16 gorilla individuals declared missing after the outbreak (non-survivors) and 15 individuals observed before and after the epidemic (survivors). We used a target enrichment approach to capture the sequences of 123 genes previously associated with immunology and Ebola virus resistance and additionally analyzed the gut microbiome which could influence the survival after an infection. Our results indicate no changes in the population genetic diversity before and after the Ebola outbreak, and no significant differences in microbial community composition between survivors and non-survivors. However, and despite the low power for an association analysis, we do detect six nominally significant missense mutations in four genes that might be candidate variants associated with an increased chance of survival. Conclusion This study offers the first insight to the genetics of a wild great ape population before and after an Ebola outbreak using target capture experiments from fecal samples, and presents a list of candidate loci that may have facilitated their survival.","Fontsere, Claudia; Frandsen, Peter; Hernandez-Rodriguez, Jessica; Niemann, Jonas; Scharff-Olsen, Camilla Hjorth; Vallet, Dominique; Gouar, Pascaline Le; Ménard, Nelly; Navarro, Arcadi; Siegismund, Hans R.; Hvilsom, Christina; Gilbert, M.

However, they have largely neglected the contributions of travellers’ skills and their perceived travel benefits and stresses. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the impacts that intrapersonal, nonverbal interpersonal, and verbal interpersonal skills have on travellers’ perceived travel benefits and stresses, and the effects of these phenomena on travellers’ preferences for travel and tourism activities. Using data gathered from a structured survey of young respondents in Vietnam (n = 496), this study found that intrapersonal and nonverbal interpersonal skills had significant effects on perceived travel benefits and stresses. Verbal interpersonal skills only had a significant effect on perceived travel benefits. In addition, the study revealed that perceived travel benefits and verbal interpersonal skills were significant antecedents of the respondents’ preferences. These findings expand the existing literature by investigating the correlations among travellers’ skills, their perceived travel benefits and stresses, and their preferences. Practical implications for tour operators and travellers, especially under the COVID-19 circumstances, are then discussed based on these findings. © 2021 World Leisure Organization.","Nghiêm-Phú, B.",World Leisure Journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078055.2021.1961165,345

During the pandemic, institutional closure was the only solution to hamper the virus spread. However, the adoption of E-learning largely sustained educational activities, raises several questions about its effectiveness. This study examines E-learning acceptance during the Covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan. It employed cross-sectional design and a random sample of n = 314 students from Sahiwal Medical College, Sahiwal, Pakistan. The researcher further applied Media Dependency Theory to provide support to the conceptual model Theory. Findings indicated a strong significant relationship between students’ positive perceptions towards E-learning during Covid-19. Respondents considered E-learning as an effective substitute for the traditional learning environment, leading to improved academic performance. The implications of the study lean on the fact that using E-learning during in unforeseen times has not only highlighted the role of internet-based learning, but it has also demonstrated a greater dependence on new media technology. We suggest that, suggesting that E-learning is a potential solution to the problem of sustaining educational activities during institutional closure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Habes, M.; Ali, S.; Khalid, A.; Haykal, H.

173919,The sleep maths: A strong correlation between more daytime light and better night-time sleep,2021,"Background: The symptoms of severe COVID-19 are complex and wide-ranging even in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, who may successfully discontinue respiratory support in a short period or conversely require prolonged respiratory support. Damage in the lungs of COVID-19 patients is characterized pathologically as diffuse alveolar damage, the degree of which correlates with the severity of the disease. We hypothesized that the ventilatory ratio (VR), a surrogate parameter for the dead space fraction, might stratify the severity of COVID-19 and predict the successful discontinuation of respiratory support. Methods: Forty COVID-19 patients in our ICU were enrolled in this study. Respiratory variables were collected from 2 hours (day 0) after the initiation of respiratory support. We monitored the longitudinal values of VR and other respiratory parameters for 28 days. Patients successfully discontinued from respiratory support by day 28 of ICU stay were defined as the successfully discontinued group, while those who died or failed to discontinue were defined as the failed to discontinue group. VR and other respiratory parameters were compared between these groups. Results: Except for advanced age, prolonged ventilation period, and higher mortality in the failed to discontinue group, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of any other background or respiratory parameter at 2 hours (day 0) after initiation of respiratory support. Longitudinal VR monitoring revealed significantly higher VR values in the failed to discontinue group than the successfully discontinued group on day 4 of respiratory support. Upon predicting the failure to discontinue respiratory support, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of VR values on day 4 of respiratory support was 0.748. A threshold of 1.56 achieved the highest predictive performance with a sensitivity of 0.667 and a specificity of 0.762. This threshold enabled the prediction of the successfully discontinued outcome at 0.810 of the negative predictive value. Conclusions: Elevated VR values on day 4 of respiratory support were predictive of successful discontinuation of respiratory support in patients with severe COVID-19. Longitudinal VR values after initiation of respiratory support can be used as a practical index to stratify severe COVID-19.","Kaku, N.; Nakagama, Y.; Shirano, M.; Shinomiya, S.; Shimazu, K.; Yamazaki, K.; Maehata, Y.; Morita, R.; Nitahara, Y.; Yamamoto, H.; Mizobata, Y.; Kido, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.20.21260754v1?rss=1,345

This level of complexity is best dealt with by a multispecialty multidisciplinary team (MDT) model. Methods This was a single centre observational study (January 2020-December 2020) that was undertaken in a British university hospital looking at effect of HF multispecialty virtual MDT meetings on HF outcomes. Patients acted as their own controls outcomes compared for equal period pre versus post MDT meeting. The multi-specialty meeting was conducted once monthly via video-conferencing. It consisted of heart failure cardiologists (from primary secondary and tertiary care), heart failure specialist nurses (hospital and community), nephrologist, endocrinologist, palliative care specialists, chest physician, pharmacist, pharmacologist and geriatrician. Recommendations were made as consensus from the multispecialty meeting. The main outcome measures were 1) number of hospitalisations and 2) outpatient clinic attendances 3) cost savings. Results A total of 189 patients were discussed from January- December 2020. This was uninterrupted during the COVID- 19 pandemic. The mean age was 70.3 ± 18.1 years and median follow-up 6 months (range 1-13 months). The mean Charlson Co-morbidity score was 5.3 ± 1.2 and Rockwood Frailty Score was 4.9 ± 1. The mean number of outpatient clinic attendances avoided was 1.7 ± 0.4. This reduced inconvenience to patients, saved patients money (transport and parking costs) and led to carbon footprint reduction. The MDT meeting total costs were £15,400 and the 31 clinic appointments they generated cost an estimated £3720. However, the MDT meetings prevented 277 clinic appointments (cost saving £33,352). Finally, the mean number of hospitalisations pre-MDT was 0.7 Vs 0.2 post MDT (p&lt;0.01) with a saving of around 730 bed days (estimated cost-saving £260,000). Conclusion The HF multispecialty virtual MDT approach provides seamless integration of primary care community services with secondary and tertiary care. Consensus decision from MDT meetings provides holistic approach for HF patients with comorbidities and frailty, and reduces inconvenience to patients by preventing the need to attend multiple specialty clinics. This approach can also lead to significant cost-savings to the healthcare system.","Essa, H.; Oguguo, E.; Douglas, H.; Foster, A.; Walker, L.; Hadcroft, J.; Bellieu, J.; Kahn, M.; Rao, A.; Cuthbertson, D.; Akpan, A.; Wong, C.; Sankaranarayanan, R.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.129,345

Here, the synonymous nucleotide composition (SNC) of Sarbecovirus genomes was analysed by examining third codon-positions, dinucleotides, and degenerate codons. The results show evidence for the eigth following groups: (i) SARS-CoV related coronaviruses (SCoVrC including many bat viruses from China), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SCoV2rC; including five bat viruses from Cambodia, Thailand and Yunnan), (iii) pangolin viruses, (iv) three bat viruses showing evidence of recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC genomes, (v) two highly divergent bat viruses from Yunnan, (vi) the bat virus from Japan, (vii) the bat virus from Bulgaria, and (viii) the bat virus from Kenya. All these groups can be diagnosed by specific nucleotide compositional features except the one concerned by recombination between SCoVrC and SCoV2rC. In particular, SCoV2rC genomes are characterised by the lowest percentages of cyosine and highest percentages of uracil at third codon-positions, whereas the genomes of pangolin viruses exhibit the highest percentages of adenine at third codon-positions. I suggest that latitudinal and taxonomic differences in the imbalanced nucleotide pools available in host cells during viral replication can explain the seven groups of SNC here detected among Sarbecovirus genomes. A related effect due to hibernating bats is also considered. I conclude that the two independent host switches from Rhinolophus bats to pangolins resulted in convergent mutational constraints and that SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from a horseshoe bat virus.","Hassanin, Alexandre",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.26.457807,345

Large cohort study suggested a protective potential of lipid-lowering drugs in COVID-19 outcomes, but the nature of observational study precludes it to draw a causal inference. Objectives: To assess the causal effect of lipid-lowering drugs (HMGCR inhibitors, PCSK9 inhibitors and NPC1L1 inhibitors) on COVID-19 outcomes using 2-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) study. Methods: We used two kinds of genetic instruments to proxy the exposure of lipid-lowering drugs, including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of drugs target genes, and genetic variants within or nearby drugs target genes associated with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from genome-wide association study (GWAS). GWASs of COVID-19 outcomes (susceptibility, hospitalization and very severe disease) were obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Summary-data-based MR (SMR) and inverse-variance weighted MR (IVW-MR) were used to calculate the effect estimates. Results: SMR analysis found that a higher expression of HMGCR was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=1.38, 95%CI=1.06-1.81; P=0.019). Similarly, IVW-MR analysis observed a positive association between HMGCR-mediated LDL cholesterol and COVID-19 hospitalization (OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.00-1.74; P=0.049). No consistent evidence from both SMR and IVW-MR analyses was found for the association of HMGCR inhibitors with COVID-19 susceptibility or very severe disease, or for the association of PCSK9 inhibitors and NPC1L1 inhibitor with COVID-19 outcomes. Conclusions: In this 2-sample MR study, we found potential causal evidence that HMGCR inhibitors could reduce the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Further research is needed to explore the therapeutic role of statins for COVID-19.","Huang, W.; Xiao, J.; Ji, J.; Chen, L.-W.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.20.21260813v1?rss=1,345
177892,Health-related quality of life measures in spondyloarthropaty patients under biological therapies in real life,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemia has been one of the most difficult challenges humankind has recently faced. Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a tool for surveillance and mitigation of potential viral outbreaks, circumventing biases introduced by clinical patient testing. Due to the situation urgency, protocols followed for isolating viral RNA from sewage were not adapted for such sample matrices. In parallel to their implementation for fast collection of data to sustain surveillance and mitigation decisions, molecular protocols need to be harmonized to deliver accurate, reproducible, and comparable analytical outputs. Here we studied analytical variabilities linked to viral RNA isolation methods from sewage. Three different influent wastewater volumes were used to assess the effect of filtered volumes (50, 100 or 500 mL) for capturing viral particles. Three different concentration strategies were tested by electronegative membranes, polyethersulfone membranes, and anion-exchange diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns. To compare the number of viral particles, different RNA isolation methods (column-based vs. magnetic beads) were compared. The effect of extra RNA purification steps and different RT-qPCR strategies (one step vs. two-step) were also evaluated. Results showed that the combination of 500 mL filtration volume through electronegative membranes and without multiple RNA purification steps (using column-based RNA purification) using two-step RT-qPCR avoided false negatives when basal viral load in sewage are present and yielded more consistent results during the surveillance done during the second-wave in Delft (The Hague area, The Netherlands). By paving the way for standardization of methods for the sampling, concentration and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from sewage, these findings can help water and health surveillance authorities to use and trust results coming from wastewater based epidemiology studies in order to anticipate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Calderon-Franco, D.; Orschler, L.; Lackner, S.; Agrawal, S.; Weissbrodt, D.

The mechanical ventilators companies, however, were unable to respond to the new volume of orders due to logistical, manufacturing, design and financial problems. Emphasizing the scope of ergonomics, works published within the last 15 years that analysed the interfaces of respirators were reviewed, and, as a result, it was possible to verify the various failures of human factors existing in mechanical ventilators. The pandemic scenario, because of the observed consequences, highlighted the importance of a good interface, as well as the simplification of design, which can bring advantages not only for moments of crisis but also for the common hospital routine.

Automated screening plays a critical role in the fight against this pandemic, and much of the previous work has been very successful in designing effective screening models. However, they would lose effectiveness under the semi-supervised learning environment with only positive and unlabeled (PU) data, which is easy to collect clinically. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving semi-supervised screening of COVID-19 from PU data. We propose a new PU learning method called Constraint Non-Negative Positive Unlabeled Learning (cnPU). It suggests the constraint non-negative risk estimator, which is more robust against overfitting than previous PU learning methods when giving limited positive data. It also embodies a new and efficient optimization algorithm that can make the model learn well on positive data and avoid overfitting on unlabeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes PU learning of COVID-19. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm remarkably outperforms state of the art in real datasets of two medical imaging modalities, including X-ray and computed tomography. These advantages endow our algorithm as a robust and useful computer-assisted tool in the semi-supervised screening of COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Han, Z.; He, R.; Li, T.; Wei, B.; Wang, J.; Yin, Y.","27th International Conference on Information Processing in Medical Imaging, IPMI 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78191-0_47,345

As waiting passengers occupy more platform space than circulating passengers, evaluation of their distribution across the platform is important. Public transport systems have been affected by the global pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This may have affected the waiting passenger distribution on BRT platform space. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on waiting passenger distribution on a platform during the peak period at an important station on the BRT system in Brisbane, Australia. Manual data collection was carried out before COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Waiting passenger counts in each case were evaluated separately to identify variation across the platform. The total waiting passenger count on the platform at a given time reduced significantly during COVID-19. To compare the two cases, data sets were normalized, and statistical analysis performed. The test results indicated that the distribution of waiting passengers during COVID-19 has significantly changed, bringing more waiting passengers into the platform center than the two ends, whereas before COVID-19, more waiting passengers were observed at the upstream half of the platform. There was also greater temporal variation across the whole platform during COVID-19.

The catalyst for the development of the network was the underrepresentation of female participants in sport and exercise medicine research (Costello, Bieuzen, & Bleakley, 2014). Due to this underrepresentation, research evidence based on men is often inappropriately generalized and applied to women (Sims & Heather, 2018). Gender bias is also apparent in conference speakers and academic panel members (Bekker et al., 2018) as well as in leadership positions in sport (Pape, 2020), where males consistently outnumber females. The network, therefore, exists to help minimize gender inequalities in research and academia, through promoting female-focused research as part of the annual conference and by supporting female researchers through its mentoring scheme.

With early research evidence suggesting that COVID-19 had heightened gender inequalities in sport, employment, and academia (Bowes, Lomax, & Piasecki, 2020;Collins, Landivar, Ruppanner, & Scarborough, 2020;Oleschuk, 2020), the focus of the conference, ‘getting back on their feet’, aimed to virtually connect individuals from a range of disciplines to ensure that sport and exercise research had a focus on women during COVID-19 and beyond. The conference also provided networking opportunities to connect with others in sport and exercise, as well as providing training and motivation through knowledge gained via others’ research and experience. The Conference Scientific Committee comprised Dr. Jacky Forsyth (Staffordshire University), Dr. Rachael Bullingham (University of Gloucestershire), Dr. Nicola Brown (St Mary’s University), and Dr. Claire-Marie Roberts (Premier League, UK), with technical direction from Mr. Matthew Coombe-Boxall (Staffordshire University). Conference Review A total of 474 delegates registered for the event from 37 different countries. Most delegates were from the United Kingdom, with high numbers also joining from the United States, Qatar, and Australia. The virtual conference was specifically designed to allow delegates the flexibility to join sessions ad hoc, with sessions running over an extended time period to accommodate international time zones. Consequently, the number of delegates viewing each session varied throughout the course of the conference, reaching a peak of 126. Given this was WiSEAN’s first online event, the Conference Committee were keen to obtain feedback from delegates to feedforward for future virtual events. Conference evaluations were overwhelmingly positive, with the breadth, quality, and style of presentations rated highly. All those who completed the survey said that they would recommend the event to others. Some examples of the comments left by delegates are as follows: Brilliant online conference with a great variety of speakers and topics. I’ll be taking away lots of learning and potential contacts to follow up with! The ability to have some of the world’s leading experts because of the virtual nature of the event was a strength of the conference. Having people from all different backgrounds/disciplines but all working towards increasing the presence of women in research was inspiring. I found the conference inspirational and stimulating and has fired me up to be an advocate for more research on females and ensure research on females is better represented in our curriculum. Suggested areas for improvement included more opportunities for collaborative and face-to-face (online) communication via the chat facility, which was difficult to negotiate for some delegates. Additionally, comments were received about the duration of the conference days, lasting all day and into the evening;however, in order to accommodate international speakers and delegates, this was unavoidable. Looking Ahead The fourth WiSEAN conference will take place on April 19–22, 2021 and will be hosted virtually by the University of Worcester, UK. This conference will maintain the multidisciplinary approach of previous years and will cover all aspects of women’s involvement in sport. The conference will have an international focus and aim to bring together practitioners and academics from a range of disciplines to allow discussion and debate surrounding women’s participation in sport, exercise, and physical activity. The conference has been titled ‘Redressing the Balance’ and the purpose of the conference is to raise awareness and address inequalities from both an academic’s and practitioner’s perspective, in addition to assessing impact and sharing areas of good practice. On day four, there will be a parallel virtual conference, as part of a European Commission–funded Erasmus+ project which the University of Worcester is leading with six other international partners. The project is entitled the ‘Gender Equity Toolkit for Generation Z’ (an educational online resource via a MOOC [massive open online course]) and aims to educate Generation Z in issues of equity in sport with the purpose of increasing the number of women and girls in all forms of sport leadership and management. The impact and implications for practice from this three-year project will be shared along with key research studies focusing on gender perceptions, communication, and Generation Z.

181720,"COVID-19 Situation in India: Fundamental Epidemiological, Operational, and Ethical Questions for the policy-makers",2021,"In times of pandemics, people are required to wear personal protective equipment especially facemasks to minimize exposure to hazards. The purpose of facemasks is to prevent the transmission of viruses through the respiratory system from one person to another. Besides their advantages, they have disadvantages too. They may cause facial complications and negatively affect communication. Wearing a facemask is considered a new experience around the world. Therefore, it is useful to know the experience of people who wear it, especially for long periods. This research aims to study the experience of nurses who wore facemasks for extended hours. Researchers used the phenomenological method that explores the meaning that individuals give to the experiences they have had towards a particular phenomenon. The sample consisted of fifteen (15) adult nurses who were intentionally chosen from one hospital in the city of Oran (Algeria). Researchers used face-to-face semi-structured interviews with nurses. The following question: “What was your experience as a nurse wearing a facemask while working for more than eight hours a day?” was asked to each of them. Nurses were encouraged to speak freely while expressing their experience. The analysis of the nurses’ experience while wearing the facemask showed they were embodied in four major themes which are: 1- Health and safety concerns (headache and face wounds), 2- Physical ergonomic concerns (facemask design and anthropometric data), 3- Communication ergonomics concerns (communication disturbances) and 4- Aesthetic ergonomics (Appearance and Color). The research concluded with a discussion of all these four themes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Mokdad, M.; Mebarki, B.; Mebarki, I.

Methods: We used blood samples from health care workers (HCW) with or without history of COVID-19 to define test accuracy of a novel interferon-{gamma} release assay. Usefulness of qualitative and quantitative results after COVID-19 vaccination was examined in HCW receiving homologous or heterologous vaccination regimens. For a real-life performance evaluation, we analysed interferon-{gamma} response to complete vaccination in 149 patients receiving immunosuppressive or immune modulating therapies. Results: Using a double-cut-off strategy integrating the result of background stimulation the assay had a specificity of 100%. Sensitivity of the IGRA was 83.5 and 100% in HCW after SARS-CoV-2 infection more or less than 6 months ago. Quantitative results showed significant differences between first and second vaccine dose, but no difference between homologous and heterologous vaccination regimen. The majority of immunocompromised patients showed no immune response or isolated T-cell or antibody response to complete vaccination. Conclusions: The novel IGRA proved to be a highly specific and sensitive tool to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response to COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 vaccination. In perspective, it may serve as a standardized tool in COVID-19 vaccine trials and in clinical care of immunosuppressed patients.","Huzly, D.; Panning, M.; Smely, F.; Enders, M.; Komp, J.; Steinmann, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.17.21260316v1?rss=1,345

183327,Top 20 Research Studies of 2014 for Primary Care Physicians.,2015,"Objectives Vaccination remains the most effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most vaccines use two-dose regimens. In turn, single-dose vaccines also have high potential, since, on the one hand, they simplify the vaccination program, make it more accessible and convenient for more people around the world, and on the other hand, they are better suited for subsequent revaccination. However, there is not enough data on the effectiveness of single-dose vaccine variants against new genetic lines to assess their current potential. It is not clear how much a single dose of immunization protects against the globally dominant delta variant. In this work, we investigated the effectiveness of a single dose vaccine (Sputnik Light, the first component of Sputnik V vaccine) against the Delta variant in Moscow. Methods To assess the effectiveness of one dose of viral vector vaccine based on rAd26 against the delta variant in Moscow, we used data from the Moscow registries of vaccination against COVID-19 and the incidence of COVID-19. The availability of data on the number of seropositive residents of Moscow made it possible to consider the size of the immune layer formed because of a previous COVID-19 disease or vaccination. To calculate the effectiveness, the proportion of COVID-19 cases among those vaccinated with a single dose and the proportion of cases among those who were not vaccinated in July 2021. Results Our data indicate that throughout July 2021, the dominant variant of the coronavirus at the level of 99.5% in Moscow was the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant and its subsidiary lines. Considering the immune layer of 46% allowed us to calculate the effectiveness of a one-shot vaccine against the delta variant in Moscow during the first three months after vaccination at the level of 69.85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.08 to 74.70). In the 18-29-year-old group, the overall vaccine efficacy against the delta variant was 88.61%, in the 18-59 group - 75.28%. Sputnik Light demonstrates higher efficacy against Delta variant than many two-shot vaccines. Conclusion The results indicate a high efficacy of a single immunization first component of Sputnik V vaccine against delta variant among young and middle-aged people (86.2% and 75.28%, respectively), at least during the first 3 months after receiving the one-shot vaccine.","Dolzhikova, I.; Gushchin, V.; Shcheblyakov, D.; Tsybin, A.; Shchetinin, A.; Pochtovyi, A.; Komissarov, A.; Kleymenov, D.; Kuznetsova, N.; Tukhvatulin, A.; Zubkova, O.; Dzharullaeva, A.; Kovyrshina, A.; Lubenets, N.; Grousova, D.; Erokhova, A.; Izhaeva, F.; Popova, O.; Ozharovskaya, T.; Semikhin, A.; Tokarskaya, E.; Shmarov, M.; Nikitenko, N.; Shidlovskaya, E.

186267,An outbreak of SARS among healthcare workers.,2003,"BACKGROUND: Many treatments are being assessed for repurposing to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC(50)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (C(max ): EC(50 )roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. METHODS: A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5–14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1–4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. RESULTS: Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited. Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. CONCLUSION: Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","Pepperrell, Toby; Pilkington, Victoria; Owen, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Hill, Andrew M",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213070/,345
187325,End of life care.,2016,"Since December 2019, the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been reported unexpectedly in Wuhan, China, with staggering infection speed across China and around the world. To date, seven known strains of HCoVs belonging to four genera (i.e., α?, β?, γ, and δ-CoV) have been recognized; the latest one has been identified as the SARS-CoV-2. Although the common transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it seems that other routes such as the gastrointestinal tract may be effective for the entry of the virus in the body. Although there are no biological markers to predict the susceptibility of humans to COVID-19, several risk factors have been identified to predict the susceptibility of patients to COVID-19. Initial data revealed that males, pregnant women, elderly, and underlying conditions predispose patients to higher morbidity or mortality and also might be at risk for a severe infection of COVID-19. There is a greater need to better understand the mechanisms and risk factors of transmission routes. To date, despite the whole world effort to review various aspects of SARS-CoV-2, including epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options, there are still gaps in the knowledge of this disease and many issues remain unclear. Therefore, there is an urgent need for update data on SARS-CoV-2. Here, this study provide the current epidemiological status (transmission routes and risk of transmission, possible origins and source, mortality and morbidity risk, and geographical distribution) of the SARS-CoV-2 in the world in 2020.","Halaji, Mehrdad; Farahani, Abbas; Ranjbar, Reza; Heiat, Mohammad; Dehkordi, Farhad Safarpoor",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532933/,345
187466,The Emotional Impact of the Operator in the Care of Patients With Mental Disorders during the Pandemic: Measure of Interventions on Compassion Fatigue and Burn-Out.,2021-09-01,"Middle cerebral artery mean velocity (MCAvmean) is attenuated with increasing age both at rest and during exercise. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the age-dependent reduction in arterial Pco2 (PaCO2) and physical fitness herein. We administered supplemental CO2 (CO2 trial) or no additional gas (control trial) to the inspired air in a blinded and randomized manner, and assessed middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity during graded exercise in 1) 21 young [Y; age 24 ± 3 yr (±SD)] volunteers of whom 11 were trained (YT) and 10 considered untrained (YUT), and 2) 17 old (O; 66 ± 4 yr) volunteers of whom 8 and 9 were considered trained (OT) and untrained (OUT), respectively. A resting hypercapnic reactivity test was also performed. MCAvmean and PaCO2 were lower in O [44.9 ± 3.1 cm/s and 30 ± 1 mmHg (±SE)] compared with Y (59.3 ± 2.3 cm/s and 34 ± 1 mmHg, P < 0.01) at rest, independent of aerobic fitness level. The age-related decreases in MCAvmean and PaCO2 persisted during exercise. Supplemental CO2 reduced the age-associated decline in MCAvmean by 50%, suggesting that PaCO2 is a major component in the decline. On the other hand, relative hypercapnic reactivity was neither influenced by age (P = 0.46) nor aerobic fitness (P = 0.36). Although supplemental CO2 attenuated exercise-induced reduction in cerebral oxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy), this did not influence exercise performance. In conclusion, PaCO2 contributes to the age-associated decline in MCAvmean at rest and during exercise; however exercise capacity did not diminish this age effect.","Flück, Daniela; Braz, Igor D; Keiser, Stefanie; Hüppin, Fabienne; Haider, Thomas; Hilty, Matthias P; Fisher, James P; Lundby, Carsten",American journal of physiology.

191342,Early intervention for first episode psychosis: secondary care must become more responsive to primary care.,2004,"A combinatorial immunoglobulin gene library was constructed from peripheral blood lymphocytes of eight patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum and was screened for the production of human monoclonal antibody Fab fragments to the C-terminal 19-kDa fragment of P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1(19)). Three Fab clones recognized recombinant MSP-1(19) under nonreducing conditions. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that three Fab clones stained the surfaces of late trophozoites/schizonts and merozoites of the FCR3 and 3D7 strains, suggesting the Fabs' reactivities to a conserved epitope. Sequence analysis of the heavy-chain genes revealed that the closest germ line V segments were VH1-8 and VH7-81, with 91% to 98% homology. The closest germ line D segment was D3-10, and the closest germ line J segment was JH4 or JH5, with 90% to 97% homology. In the light-chain genes, the closest germ line V segment was A27 for the Jkappa2, Jkappa4, and Jkappa5 segments. The dissociation constants of these Fab fragments for recombinant MSP-1(19) ranged from 1.09 x 10(-9) to 2.66 x 10(-9) M. The binding of the three Fab fragments to MSP-1(19) was competitively inhibited by the anti-MSP-1(19) mouse monoclonal antibody 12.8, which inhibits erythrocyte invasion by merozoites. However, the human Fab fragment with the highest affinity did not inhibit in vitro growth of P. falciparum. This is the first report of gene analysis and bacterial expression of human monoclonal antibodies to P. falciparum MSP-1(19). The combinatorial immunoglobulin gene library derived from malaria patients provides a potential tool for producing high-affinity human antibodies specific for P. falciparum.","Cheng, Xun-Jia; Hayasaka, Hitoshi; Watanabe, Katsuomi; Tao, Yan-Lin; Liu, Jin-Ye; Tsukamoto, Hideo; Horii, Toshihiro; Tanabe, Kazuyuki; Tachibana, Hiroshi",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17452466/,345
191978,"[Prevalence, structure, and risk factors for mental disorders in older adults.]",2021,"BACKGROUND The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted the delivery of healthcare, including dermatological services. In the initial stages of the pandemic, reduced patient flow produced a dramatic drop in the volume of skin cancer screening. Consistent with COVID-19 precautions, our practice conducted visual skin examinations (VSE) utilizing semi-automated total body photography (TBP). METHODS A cross-sectional study of patient characteristics and self-reported melanoma risk factors associated with TBP usage was conducted on all patients from May to November 2020 in a single practitioner private dermatology setting. The process and histopathology-confirmed outcomes were compared to those in the same 6-month period in 2019. RESULTS For the May-November 2020 timeframe, those who opted for the home TBP (35%) compared to clinic TBP were younger, had higher self-reported skin cancer risk, and were more likely to have had previous TBP sessions. Overall, the number of TBP sessions increased, while dermoscopy usage and biopsy number decreased. There was no change in the number and distribution of skin cancer diagnoses compared to the same period in 2019. The Melanoma-In-Situ:Invasive Melanoma (MIS:INV) ratio was above the U.S. ratio reported for 2020 of 0.95:1 (95,710 MIS:100,350 INV). CONCLUSION Semi-automated TBP was successfully implemented during the pandemic without affecting skin cancer detection.","Drugge, Elizabeth D; Sarac, Rebecca M; Fay, Patricia; Drugge, Rhett J",Dermatology online journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999574/,345

The objective of this research was to characterize the respiratory excretion of these pathogens by acutely infected pigs. Pigs were inoculated under experimental conditions with 1 pathogen. Samples were collected from the upper respiratory tract and exhaled air. All pathogens were detected in swabs of the upper respiratory tract, but only M. hyopneumoniae and B. bronchiseptica were detected in expired air from individually sampled, acutely infected pigs. These findings suggest either that the acutely infected pigs did not aerosolize the viruses or that the quantity of virus excreted was below the detection threshold of current sampling or assay systems, or both, at the individual-pig level.","Hermann, Joseph R; Brockmeier, Susan L; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18783027/,345
199328,"The role of eHealth, telehealth, and telemedicine for chronic disease patients during COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid systematic review",2021,"The pathogenesis of infection induced by cytopathogenic isolates from the newly identified genetic cluster Id of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type I was studied in two experimental infections of previously seronegative, immunocompetent calves. Experiment 1 focused on the evaluation of clinical patterns, viremia, and serological responses. All infected calves in this experiment developed respiratory symptoms and seroconverted to BVDV positivity. Contact calves also contracted a respiratory tract infection following exposure to infected animals. Viremia was demonstrated between postinfection days 2 and 17, and the virus was detected in organ specimens of all but one each of the infected and contact calves. In experiment 2, the distribution of BVDV in various tissues of calves euthanized at defined days postinfection was studied. In two of these calves recurrent shedding of BVDV in nasal secretions was shown. BVDV was detected in various tissues of all infected calves throughout the experiment and also following seroconversion and the clearance of BVDV from the circulatory system. Despite the widespread distribution of the virus in various organs, significant tissue damage was found mainly in respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues. These experiments revealed that viruses from cluster Id of BVDV are able to induce primary respiratory disease in previously seronegative, immunocompetent calves. Contact transmission and virus recurrence, contrary to observations from acute experimental infections with noncytopathogenic BVDV, are likely to reflect differences in biological features of these cytopathogenic isolates. Virus shedding and its presence in tissues following peripheral clearance and in the presence of antibodies may have implications in the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of BVDV-induced syndromes in cattle.","Baule, C; Kulcsár, G; Belák, K; Albert, M; Mittelholzer, C; Soós, T; Kucsera, L; Belák, S",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11136763/,345

In 2006, an estimated 19.6 million workers in the United States were Hispanic, 56% of whom were foreign born. To characterize work-related injury deaths among Hispanic workers in the United States, CDC, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and certain state agencies analyzed data from 1992-2006. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, during 1992-2006, a total of 11,303 Hispanic workers died from work-related injuries. The death rate for Hispanic workers decreased during this period; however, the rate was consistently higher than the rate for all U.S. workers, and the proportion of deaths among foreign-born Hispanic workers increased over time. During 2003-2006, 34% of Hispanic worker deaths occurred in the construction industry. Additional efforts are needed to reduce the risk for death among Hispanic workers because of projected increases in their employment, involvement in work with high risk for injury, susceptibility to miscommunication caused by language differences, and other potential risks associated with culture and economic status.",,MMWR.

Progressive orthopnoea was found as well. Her neck was swollen for two weeks and there was generalised itching for months. Given the nature of her symptoms, she was assessed at the coronavirus station. A diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was assumed. Due to limited testing capacity, the diagnosis was not confirmed. She was treated with supportive treatment that had no effect on her dyspnoea. Tunnel vision ensured that the symptoms that did not fit COVID-19, were not recognised. Moreover, a scheduled ultrasound of her neck was cancelled because of the coronavirus restrictions, which did not help matters. She was eventually admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit with respiratory failure associated with cervical and mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma.","Zijtregtop, E A M; Dors, N; Bakker, H; Klasen, L D; Oegema, S; Beishuizen, A",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201643/,345

Therefore, we devised a new strategy in which the pancreatic stump is enveloped with the elevated jejunum (EJ) by a modified Blumgart anastomotic technique. Eighty-one patients who underwent open DP with splenectomy from January 2008 to December 2014 were enrolled. Comparisons were made between 42 patients who underwent placement of an EJ patch using the modified Blumgart method after scalpel transection and 39 patients who underwent scalpel transection alone, using unmatched and propensity score-matched analysis. After 25 patients from each group were selected by propensity score matching, the EJ patch technique was significantly associated with a lower incidence of clinically relevant POPF (P = 0.036). Multivariate analysis showed that the EJ patch was an independent predictor of a lower incidence of POPF (odds ratio, 0.16; 95 % confidence interval, 0.01–0.48; P = 0.017) as was the estimated remnant pancreatic volume. Addition of the EJ patch improves postoperative outcomes in patients who undergo open DP with splenectomy by scalpel transection and hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant.","Fujii, Tsutomu; Yamada, Suguru; Murotani, Kenta; Sugimoto, Hiroyuki; Hattori, Masashi; Kanda, Mitsuro; Takami, Hideki; Nakayama, Goro; Nomoto, Shuji; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Nakao, Akimasa; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26497190/,345

Temperature affected hatch success, time to hatching, and larval growth. Eggs hatched in 61 h at 21 degrees C but in < 22 h at 35 degrees C. Larvae achieved peak weight in < 8 d at 35 degrees C but needed 17 d at 21 degrees C. Diet had comparatively little effect on larval survivorship or maximum weight, although larvae fed only bee pupae had lower survivorship. Access to soil influenced pupation success. Duration of the life stage spent in the soil, during which pupation occurs, was also affected by temperature: adults emerged after 32.7 d at 21 degrees C but after only 14.8 d at 35 degrees C, albeit with high mortality. Minimum temperature for development was estimated at 13.5 degrees C for eggs, and 10.0 degrees C for larvae and pupae. Temperature influenced adult longevity and oviposition: on a honey and pollen diet average adult lifespan was 92.8 d at 24 degrees C but only 11.6 d at 35 degrees C. Beetles lived longer at 28 degrees C or lower but produced the most eggs per female, regardless of diet, at 32 degrees C. Beetle density influenced fecundity: beetles kept at three pairs per vial laid 6.7 times more eggs per female than those kept as single pairs. Overall, beetles fared best at 28-32 degrees C with mortality of all stages highest at 35 degrees C.","Meikle, William G; Patt, Joseph M",Journal of economic entomology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735891/,345

The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapies has been limited in consideration of the risk of occupational infection in health-care professionals. Aims: In preclinical experimental simulations, evaluate occupational and environmental safety of the newly developed isolation system for aerosol-transmitted infections (ISATI). Method: Simulations were conducted to test ISATI's capability to isolate aerosolized molecular (caffeine), and biological (SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA) markers. Caffeine deposition was analyzed on nitrocellulose sensor discs by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: ISATI demonstrated efficacy in isolating molecular and biological markers within the enclosed environment in simulated conditions of CPAP, HFNO and mechanical ventilation therapy. Neither the molecular marker nor substantial amounts of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in the surrounding environment, outside ISATI, indicating appropriate occupational safety for health-care professionals. Conclusion: Aerosolized markers were successfully contained within ISATI in all experimental simulations, offering occupational and environmental protection against the dissemination of aerosolized microparticles under CPAP or HFNO therapy conditions, which are indicated for patients with acute respiratory infections.","Quadros, Claudio Almeida; Leal, Maria Carolina Bezerra Di Medeiros; Baptista-Sobrinho, Carlos de Almeida; Nonaka, Carolina Kymie Vasques; Souza, Bruno Solano De Freitas; Milan-Mattos, Juliana Cristina; Catai, Aparecida Maria; Pires Di Lorenzo, Valéria Amorim; Ferreira, Antonio Gilberto",Expert Rev Med Devices,,345

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with Lycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation treatments, and microbial diversity studies.","Kowal, Jill; Arrigoni, Elena; Serra, Jordi; Bidartondo, Martin",Mycorrhiza,,345

212529,Protecting Pregnant Healthcare Workers,2021,"AIM: To investigate nurses' core emergency competencies for handling the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and analyse the factors associated with those competencies. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become a major global public health event. Nursing staff have played an important role in COVID-19 prevention and control. Understanding their emergency competencies for handling COVID-19, and the potential disadvantages will help governments to develop targeted training policies and improve nurses' capacities in relation to pandemics and emergency preparedness. INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is a disastrous infectious disease, but the competencies of nurses in China to handle COVID-19 have not been well documented. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on nurses from 22 provinces of China in February 2020. The scores of self-report questionnaires were used to analyse their competencies for core emergency care, and linear regression analysis was used to explore influential factors. RESULTS: A total of 2570 nurses participated. The study revealed that nurses had a good grasp of COVID-19 knowledge, but the majority of nurses lacked experience in isolation ward work and emergency training. We found that age, professional title, work department, major work content, total work time, disaster rescue history, emergency training and infectious disease training were associated with core emergency competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese nurses were qualified for handling COVID-19 but still need to strengthen the accumulation of practical experience. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses should actively participate in emergencies to strengthen their operational capacity, whether in training or actual practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING/HEALTH POLICY: Managers should improve relevant policies to ensure that nurses have more opportunities to participate in the practical training of health emergencies and explore effective training methods to improve the ability of nurses to respond to these.","Li, Hongdan; Dong, Shuju; He, Li; Wang, Rui; Long, Shiyan; He, Fengming; Tang, Huairong; Feng, Ling",Int. nurs. rev,,345
213032,COVID-19: are not all workers 'essential'?,2021,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogen which causes chronic infections in immunocompromised patients and leads to high mortality rate. It is identified as a common coinfecting pathogen in COVID-19 patients causing exacerbation of illness. In our hospital, P. aeruginosa is one of the top coinfecting bacteria identified among COVID-19 patients. We collected a strong biofilm-forming P. aeruginosa strain displaying small colony variant morphology from a severe COVID-19 patient. Genomic and transcriptomic sequencing analyses were performed with phenotypic validation to investigate its adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 infected environment. Genomic characterization predicted specific genomic islands highly associated with virulence, transcriptional regulation, and DNA restriction-modification systems. Epigenetic analysis revealed a specific N6-methyl adenine (m6A) methylating pattern including methylation of alginate, flagellar and quorum sensing associated genes. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that this isolate formed excessive biofilm by reducing flagellar formation (7.4 to 1,624.1 folds) and overproducing extracellular matrix components including CdrA (4.4 folds), alginate (5.2 to 29.1 folds) and Pel (4.8-5.5 folds). In summary, we demonstrated that P. aeuginosa clinical isolates with novel epigenetic markers could form excessive biofilm, which might enhance its antibiotic resistance and in vivo colonization in COVID-19 patients.","Qu, Jiuxin; Cai, Zhao; Liu, Yumei; Duan, Xiangke; Han, Shuhong; Liu, Jihong; Zhu, Yuao; Jiang, Zhaofang; Zhang, Yingdan; Zhuo, Chao; Liu, Yang; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Yang, Liang",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,345
213401,Sex differences in immunological responses to COVID-19: a cross-sectional analysis of a single centre cohort,2021,"BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is a simple strategy recommended for the prevention of influenza infection and its complications. This meta-analysis aimed to provide current supportive evidence for the breadth and validity of the observed protective effects of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular and respiratory adverse outcomes and all-cause mortality in older adults and in general adult population. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify all published studies comparing influenza vaccination with placebo from the database inception to November 11, 2018. These included studies reporting the associations of influenza vaccination with the risk of aforementioned adverse outcomes. RESULTS: The pooled adjusted relative risks among influenza-vaccinated people relative to unvaccinated people for the outcomes of interest were 0.74 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-0.78) for cardiovascular diseases (63 studies), 0.82 (95 % CI = 0.75-0.91) for respiratory diseases (29 studies), and 0.57 (95 % CI = 0.51-0.63) for all-cause mortality (43 studies). We performed subgroup analysis of age, sex, and region/country and found that these protective effects were evident in the general adult population and particularly robust in older adults and in those with pre-existing specific diseases. CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccine is associated with a significant risk reduction of cardiovascular and respiratory adverse outcomes as well as all-cause mortality. Such a preventative measure can benefit the general population as well as those in old age and with pre-existing specific diseases.","Cheng, Yangyang; Cao, Xinxi; Cao, Zhi; Xu, Chenjie; Sun, Li; Gao, Ying; Wang, Yuan; Li, Shu; Wu, Cunjin; Li, Xin; Wang, Yaogang; Leng, Sean X",Ageing Res Rev,,345

Collaborators recruited community members and patients from previous research studies to examine COVID-19 experiences and mental health symptoms through self-report surveys. The current report descriptively presents findings from the initial survey characterized by both community and clinical cohorts, and discusses challenges encountered with rapid implementation. The clinical cohort exhibited higher rates of symptoms of mental health difficulties (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) as compared to the community cohort. COVID-19 positivity rates were similar among both groups and lower than the national average. While both groups reported low rates of job loss, community members reported higher rates of financial difficulty resulting from the pandemic.

213854,A modified urinary catheterisation technique to reduce urine leakage: A prospective randomised study,2021,"Zizania latifolia is a perennial aquatic vegetable, whose symbiosis with the fungus Ustilago esculenta (member of Basidiomycota, class Ustilaginaceae) results in the establishment of swollen gall formations. Here, we analyzed symbiotic relations of Z. latifolia and U. esculenta, using a triadimefon (TDF) treatment and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Specifically, accurately identify the whole growth cycle of Z. latifolia. Microstructure observations showed that the presence of U. esculenta could be clearly observed after gall formation but was absent after the TDF treatment. A total of 17,541 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, based on the transcriptome. According to gene ontology term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway results, plant hormone signal transduction, and cell wall-loosening factors were all significantly enriched due to U. esculenta infecting Z. latifolia; relative expression levels of hormone-related genes were identified, of which downregulation of indole 3-acetic acid (IAA)-related DEGs was most pronounced in JB_D versus JB_B. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that IAA, zeatin+trans zeatin riboside, and gibberellin 3 were increased under U. esculenta infection. Based on our results, we proposed a hormone-cell wall loosening model to study the symbiotic mechanism of gall formation after U. esculenta infects Z. latifolia. Our study thus provides a new perspective for studying the physiological and molecular mechanisms of U. esculenta infection of Z. latifolia causing swollen gall formations as well as a theoretical basis for enhancing future yields of cultivated Z. latifolia.[Formula: see text] The author(s) have dedicated the work to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 ""No Rights Reserved"" license by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law. 2021.","Li, Jie; Lu, Zhiyuan; Yang, Yang; Hou, Jinfeng; Yuan, Lingyun; Chen, Guohu; Wang, Chenggang; Jia, Shaoke; Feng, Xuming; Zhu, Shidong",Mol Plant Microbe Interact,,345

The National Transition of Care Coalition recommends shifting the discharge paradigm from discharge from the hospital, to transfer with continuous management. The patient centered medical home is a promising model, which improves care coordination and may reduce hospital readmissions. METHODS: This is a quality improvement report, the geriatric patient-aligned care team (GeriPACT) at Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) participated in ongoing quality improvement (Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA)) cycles during teamlet meetings. Post home discharge follow-up for GeriPACT patients was provided by proactive telehealth communication by the Registered Nurse (RN) care manager and nurse practitioner. Periodic operations data obtained from the Data and Statistical Services (DSS) coordinator informed the PDSA cycles and teamlet meetings. RESULTS: at baseline (July 2018-June 2019) the 30-day all-cause readmission for GeriPACT was 21%. From July to December 2019, 30-day all-cause readmissions were 13%. From January to June 2020, 30-day all-cause readmissions were 15%. CONCLUSION: PDSA cycles with sharing of operations data during GeriPACT teamlet meetings and fostering a shared responsibility for managing high-risk patients contributes to improved outcomes in 30-day all-cause readmissions.","Powers, James S; Abraham, Lovely; Parker, Ralph; Azubike, Nkechi; Habermann, Ralf",,,345

MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective analysis included 68 patients with COVID-19 in the Fifth People's Hospital of Suzhou City. Three radiologists performed a blind evaluation of 4 chest CT images that included the initial scans, the lesion peak, the lesion decreased to 25% of the peak, and the final scan. The score of chest CT lesion, the imaging characteristics of the lesion, the time of the appearance of symptoms related to the CT examination, quantitative assessment of PIT25, and the absorption of the lesion in last CT image were analyzed. Patients were divided into an obvious absorption group and a non-obvious absorption group according to the reduction of the lesion area by greater than 50% or less than 50%. RESULTS In the peak time, the most common images of CT were ground-glass opacities (94.1%), consolidation (85.3%) and reticulation (88.2%), multifocal (97.1%), center and subpleural (54.4%), subpleural distribution (45.6%), and pleural thickening (79.4%). The PIT25 with the prognosis (r=0.53, p=0.00) was significantly relevant. PIT25 was 4.3±0.7 days for the obvious absorption group and 6.8±1.4 days for the non-obvious absorption group. CONCLUSIONS The features of CT image are specific at the peak. The quantitative parameter PIT25 could be used to predict the prognosis of the patients with COVID-19, as COVID-19 patients with a shorter PIT25 have a better prognosis and vice versa.","Liu, Rongrong; Chen, Guangqiang; Zhu, Yi; Liu, Jing; Tang, Wei; Zhu, Jianbing; Li, Min",Med Sci Monit,,345

219277,Prevalence and correlates of chronic fatigue syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder after the outbreak of the COVID-19,2021,"The Vero cell line is considered the most used continuous cell line for the production of viral vectors and vaccines. Historically, it is the first cell line that was approved by the WHO for the production of human vaccines. Comprehensive experimental data on the production of many viruses using the Vero cell line can be found in the literature. However, the vast majority of these processes is relying on the microcarrier technology. While this system is established for the large-scale manufacturing of viral vaccine, it is still quite complex and labor intensive. Moreover, scale-up remains difficult and is limited by the surface area given by the carriers. To overcome these and other drawbacks and to establish more efficient manufacturing processes, it is a priority to further develop the Vero cell platform by applying novel bioprocess technologies. Especially in times like the current COVID-19 pandemic, advanced and scalable platform technologies could provide more efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet the global vaccine demand. Herein, we review the prevailing literature on Vero cell bioprocess development for the production of viral vectors and vaccines with the aim to assess the recent advances in bioprocess development. We critically underline the need for further research activities and describe bottlenecks to improve the Vero cell platform by taking advantage of recent developments in the cell culture engineering field.","Kiesslich, Sascha; Kamen, Amine A",Biotechnol Adv,,345

We find that the lockdown policy caused a large and immediate surge in price and price dispersion of Chinese cabbage, though they fluctuated smoothly for the same period in normal years. The DID results further show that the price surge peaked in the fourth week of lockdown but gradually came down to the level of a normal year by week 11. However, the price rose again (though to a much smaller extent) in response to the resurgence of COVID-19 in a few provinces in early-mid April but quickly returned to the normal level in week 15 when the lockdown measures were largely removed. We also find that the supply chain disruption is the driving factor for the price hike.

Several studies have now highlighted COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in the general public. However, little is known about the nature and extent of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in healthcare workers worldwide. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive worldwide assessment of published evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers. A scoping review method was adopted to include a final pool of 35 studies in this review with study sample size ranges from n = 123 to 16,158 (average = 2185 participants per study). The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy worldwide in healthcare workers ranged from 4.3 to 72% (average = 22.51% across all studies with 76,471 participants). The majority of the studies found concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and potential side effects as top reasons for COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in healthcare workers. The majority of the studies also found that individuals who were males, of older age, and doctoral degree holders (i.e., physicians) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Factors such as the higher perceived risk of getting infected with COVID-19, direct care for patients, and history of influenza vaccination were also found to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake probability. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers, communication and education strategies along with mandates for clinical workers should be considered to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake in these individuals. Healthcare workers have a key role in reducing the burden of the pandemic, role modeling for preventive behaviors, and also, helping vaccinate others.","Biswas, Nirbachita; Mustapha, Toheeb; Khubchandani, Jagdish; Price, James H",J. community health,,345

(Special Issue: Pandemic COVID19.),2020,"BACKGROUND: There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and dynamic clinical changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection diagnosed in the early phase of illness. This study is a case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to 11 hospitals in Korea. METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of respiratory specimens by active surveillance that were finally discharged between February 20 and April 30, 2020 were included. Patients were classified into mild and non-mild groups on initial admission according to oxygen demand and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the mild group was followed up and subgrouped into non-aggravation and aggravation groups. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection were enrolled. Among the mild group of 136 patients, 11.7% of patients experienced clinical aggravation during hospitalization, but there was no initial clinical parameter on admission predicting their aggravation. Fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.56), thrombocytopenia (OR, 12.87), fever (OR, 27.22) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 300 U/L (OR, 18.35), and CRP > 1 mg/dL (OR, 11.31) significantly indicated aggravation in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 5-day periods, respectively. PCR positivity lasted for a median of 22 days and 32 days after the onset of illness in the non-aggravation and aggravation groups, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate state resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in psychiatric patients (PP), unaffected relatives (UR) and community controls (CC). METHODS: This study is part of the Barcelona ResIlience Survey for Mental Health COVID-19 (BRIS-MHC) project. Logistic regression models were performed to identify mental health outcomes associated with bad state resilience and predictors of good state resilience. The association between state resilience and specific affective temperaments as well as their influence on the association between depressive symptoms and state resilience were verified. RESULTS: The study recruited 898 participants that took part in the survey. The presence of depressive symptoms was a predictor of bad state resilience in PP (ß=0.110, OR=1.117, p=0.028). No specific mental health outcome was associated with bad state resilience in UR and CC. Predictors of good state resilience in PP were having pursued hobbies/conducted home tasks (ß=1.261, OR=3.528, p=0.044) and level of organization in the family (ß=0.986, OR=2.682, p=0.008). Having a controlling family was inversely associated with good state resilience in CC (ß=-1.004, OR=0.367, p=0.012). The association between bad state resilience and depressive symptoms was partially mediated by affective temperaments.

A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of ""trust."" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.","Seddighi, Hamed",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,345

225469,COVID-19 Trials and Tribulations by Rebecca Gliksman MD MPH,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that causes the potentially lethal Covid-19 respiratory tract infection. It does so by binding to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, leading to endocytosis with the receptor, and subsequently using the host cell's machinery to replicate copies of itself and invade new cells. The extent of the spread of infection in the body is dependent on the pattern of ACE2 expression and overreaction of the immune system. Additionally, by inducing an imbalance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the loss of ACE2 would favour the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes in the lungs. No drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. Hundreds of clinical trials on existing approved drugs from different classes acting on a multitude of targets in the virus life cycle are ongoing to examine potential effectiveness for the prevention and treatment of the infection. This review summarizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus life cycle in the host cell and provides a biological and pathological point of view for repurposed and experimental drugs for this novel coronavirus. The viral life cycle provides potential targets for drug therapy.","Poduri, Ramarao; Joshi, Gaurav; Jagadeesh, Gowraganahalli",Cell Signal,,345

AIM: We evaluated if in-hospital administration of heparin improved survival in a large cohort of Italian COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, 2,574 unselected patients hospitalised in 30 clinical centres in Italy from February 19, 2020 to May 23, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, were analysed. The primary end-point in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received heparin (low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH)) with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores. RESULTS: Out of 2,574 COVID-19 patients, 70.1% received heparin. LMWH was largely the most used formulation (99.5%). Death rates for patients receiving heparin or not were 7.4 and 14.0 per 1,000 person-days, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found a 40% lower risk of death in patients receiving heparin (HR=0.60; 95%CI: 0.49 to 0.74; E-value=2.04). This association was particularly evident in patients with a higher severity of disease or strong coagulation activation. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital heparin treatment was associated with lower mortality, particularly in severely ill COVID-19 patients and in those with strong coagulation activation. The results from randomised clinical trials are eagerly awaited to provide clear-cut recommendations.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto Filippo; Costanzo, Simona; Iacoviello, Licia",Thromb. haemost,,345

Exact mechanisms for this extreme coagulation activation have not yet been elucidated. However, one of the consistent laboratory finding is the increase in fibrinogen, in some cases, marked elevation. High circulating levels of fibrinogen have been linked to thrombosis for years and for this reason, hyperfibrinogenemia is considered one of the mechanisms for COVID-19 coagulopathy. In this forum article, instead of the prothrombotic role, a protective function for fibrinogen is discussed. Fibrinogen, like the other well-known acute phase reactants, is increased in COVID-19 possibly to protect the host.","Thachil, Jecko",J. thromb. haemost,,345

As a simplistic but illustrative example, we examine interactions between urban and rural populations in the dynamics of disease spreading. Using a compartmental framework of susceptible--infected--susceptible ($\mathrm{SI\widetilde{S}}$) dynamics with some level of immunity, we formulate a model that allows nonlinear reinfection. We investigate the effects of population movement in the simplest scenario: a case with two patches, which allows us to model movement between urban and rural areas. To study the dynamics of the system, we compute a basic reproduction number for each population (urban and rural). We also compute steady states, determine the local stability of the disease-free steady state, and identify conditions for the existence of endemic steady states. From our analysis and computational experiments, we illustrate that population movement plays an important role in disease dynamics. In some cases, it can be rather beneficial, as it can enlarge the region of stability of a disease-free steady state.","Calvo, Juan G.; Hern'andez, Alberto; Porter, Mason A.; Sanchez, Fabio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08887v1.pdf,345

Objective: To assess present practice and perceptions among Indian neurosurgeons with respect to type of surgeries performed, PPE usage and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Materials and Methods: A 12-item questionnaire on surgeries performed in the 6 weeks prior to the survey date, PPE usage, and preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing was circulated electronically to Indian neurosurgeons from May 12, 2020 to May 31, 2020 and their responses analyzed. Results: Two hundred forty-four neurosurgeons (237 males) participated in the survey; of whom, 230 had performed surgeries during the pandemic period. In total, 84.3% of respondents were performing semiemergency or emergency procedures only. N95 masks were utilized by only 83% of the respondents (n = 230) while performing surgical procedures. Only 40.9% of the respondents were satisfied regarding adequacy of available PPE. Preoperative SARS-CoV2 testing as well as testing of all asymptomatic patients prior to admission into ward/intensive care unit was perceived to be beneficial in reducing transmission risk by more than 85% respondents. More than 90% respondents felt that HCWs including neurosurgeons were at risk of acquiring infection through an outpatient consultation from an asymptomatic individual. Conclusions: Access to and utilization of appropriate PPE was lacking among the one-fifth of neurosurgeons who participated in this survey. To gain the confidence of neurosurgeons, hospitals should address their concerns regarding PPE and testing of patients prior to surgery and admission to the hospital.","Moorthy, Ranjith K; Rajshekhar, Vedantam",Neurol India,,345

Based on a survey of 2125 Turkish farm enterprises, this study examined effects on agricultural production during the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions among agricultural branches. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Oslo Social Support Scale were used in the study. Survey data were collected from farmers by phone. Age, place of residence, income status, agricultural branches, land size, the use of trucks, animal husbandry, access to technical support from agricultural organizations, access to support from neighbors, and social support level were found to have a significant effect on anxiety level (p &lt;0.05). The anxiety levels of farmers engaged in animal husbandry and vegetable farming were found to be higher than those in other agricultural branches. The lowest anxiety level was observed in farmers engaged in cereal production. Taking these results into consideration is important for preventing problems in agricultural production. If anxiety levels are not improved, it is predicted that farmers in agricultural production branches with high levels of anxiety will move towards branches with lower levels of anxiety.","Cevher, Celal Altunkaynak Bulent Gürü Meltem",Sustainability,,345

Very little data exist on the attitudes and views of health professionals on providing nutrition care to this patient cohort delivered by electronic health methods. COVID-19 has fast-tracked the adoption of digital health care provision, so it is more important than ever to understand the needs of health professionals in providing health care via these modes. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of health professionals on providing nutrition care to upper gastrointestinal cancer patients by electronic methods to allow the future scaling-up of acceptable delivery methods. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and recorded, de-identified and transcribed. Thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo Pro 12. RESULTS: Interviews were conducted on 13 health professionals from a range of disciplines across several public and private health institutions. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (1) the ideal model, (2) barriers to the ideal model and (3) how to implement and translate the ideal model. Health professionals viewed the provision of nutrition interventions as an essential part of an upper gastrointestinal cancer patient's treatment with synchronous, telephone-based internal health service models of nutrition care overwhelmingly seen as the most acceptable model of delivery. Mobile application-based delivery methods were deemed too challenging for the current population serviced by these clinicians. CONCLUSION: The use of novel technology for delivering nutrition care to people receiving treatment for upper gastrointestinal cancers was not widely accepted as the preferred method of delivery by health professionals. There is an opportunity, given the rapid uptake of digital health care delivery, to ensure that the views and attitudes of health professionals are understood and applied to develop acceptable, efficacious and sustainable technologies in our health care systems.","Furness, Kate; Huggins, Catherine; Croagh, Daniel; Haines, Terry",Nutrients,,345

METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted on 313 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients were classified into two groups based on disease severity (nonsevere and severe) according to initial clinical presentation. Laboratory test results and epidemiological and clinical characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to detect potential risk factors associated with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients (197 nonsevere and 92 severe cases) with a median age of 45.0 (33.0, 61.0) years were included in this study, and 53.3% (154/289) were male. Fever (192/286, 67.1%) and cough (170/289, 58.8%) were commonly observed, followed by sore throat (49/289, 17.0%).

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness study comparing prophylaxis versus on-demand was conducted on 34 hemophilia patients (24 and 10 patients were on the prophylaxis and on-demand regimens respectively) in 2017. The Markov model was used to estimate the economic and clinical outcomes. The costs were collected from the societal perspective, and the utility criterion was the 'quality adjusted life year (QALY)' indicator. The required data were collected using a researcher-made cost checklist, the EQ5D standard questionnaire and Hemophilia Joint Health Score. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to determine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The means of costs, joint health score and QALY in the prophylaxis regimen were $478,963.1 purchasing power parity (PPP), 96.67, and 11.98 respectively, and in the on-demand regimen were $521,797.2 PPP, 93.46 and 10.99 respectively. The PSA confirmed the robustness of the model's results. The results of the scatter plots and acceptability curves showed that the prophylaxis regimen in 97% of the simulations for the thresholds below $20950 PPP was more cost-effective than on-demand regimen. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis regimen showed the lower costs and higher effectiveness and utility in comparison with the on-demand regimen. It is recommended that prophylaxis should be considered as the standard care for treatment of hemophilic patients.","Zahedi, Zohreh; Karimi, Mehran; Keshavarz, Khosro; Haghpanah, Sezaneh; Ravangard, Ramin",Hematology,,345

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has created unique and unexpected challenges to healthcare delivery, but has also provided opportunities for re-evaluation of practice patterns to optimize high-value practices. With ongoing uncertainty, key factors to appreciate for patient and population health include the continued touchstones of empathy and compassion, the use of effective risk communication with shared clinical decision-making when appropriate, attention to resource stewardship and vulnerable populations, importance of health literacy and need for critical assessment of media and medical literature to mitigate misinformation, and the hidden costs of the pandemic on children. Although there has been some international concern for allergic reactions to the recently approved Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, neither the United States Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorizations exclude patients without a specific allergy to a vaccine component from receiving vaccination.

RESULTS: The predictive model was extremely robust (R2 = 0.99) and predicted outcomes for period of lockdown up to 90 days. The predicted increment in HBA1c from baseline at the end of 30 days and 45 days lockdown was projected as 2.26% & 3.68% respectively. Similarly, the annual predicted percentage increase in complication rates at the end of 30-day lockdown was 2.8% for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 2.9% for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.5% for retinal photocoagulation, 9.3% for microalbuminuria, 14.2% for proteinuria, 2.9% for peripheral neuropathy, 10.5% for lower extremity amputation, 0.9% for myocardial infarction, 0.5% for stroke and 0.5% for infections. CONCLUSION: The duration of lockdown is directly proportional to the worsening of glycaemic control and diabetes-related complications. Such increase in diabetes-related complications will put additional load on overburdened healthcare system, and also increase COVID19 infections in patients with such uncontrolled glycemia.","Ghosal, Samit; Sinha, Binayak; Majumder, Milan; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,345

234906,COVID-19: establishing an oral surgery-led urgent dental care hub,2020,"2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19, previously known as novel coronavirus pneumonia) was first discovered in December 2019 and spread widely in China and all over the world in 2020. The initial symptoms of most patients include fever, cough, and fatigue. Dyspnea may occur with the progress of the disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur in severe cases. The CT manifestations of this disease are mainly ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lung, which may be accompanied by patchy consolidation, and fibrous changes may appear in the lung at the later stage of the disease. Combined with typical clinical and imaging findings and positive nucleic acid test results, the disease can be diagnosed. We report the first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Heilongjiang Province, China. The patient was seriously ill, who felt that he suffered from fever, fatigue, cough, and expectoration and sought medical treatment, with a history of contact with Wuhan. The leukocyte count was normal, and the lymphocyte count was decreased. CT imaging showed large GGO and partial patchy consolidation in both lungs. The patient recovered and was discharged after 26 days of treatment. This study is helpful for early diagnosis and timely clinical management by mastering the typical imaging of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","Wang, Ziao; Jiang, Huijie; Jiang, Hao; Zheng, Ruoshui; Yi, Ru",Open Med.,,345

Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients were forced to quarantine and closely monitor their symptoms and vital signs, most of the time at home. This paper describes e-CoVig, a novel mHealth application, developed as an alternative to the current monitoring paradigm, where the patients are followed up by direct phone contact. The e-CoVig provides a set of functionalities for remote reporting of symptoms, vital signs, and other clinical information to the health services taking care of these patients. The application is designed to register and transmit the heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, respiration, and cough. The system features a mobile application, a web/cloud platform, and a low-cost specific device to acquire the temperature and SpO2. The architecture of the system is flexible and can be configured for different operation conditions. Current commercial devices, such as oximeters and thermometers, can also be used and read using the optical character recognition (OCR) functionality of the system. The data acquired at the mobile application are sent automatically to the web/cloud application and made available in real-time to the medical staff, enabling the follow-up of several users simultaneously without the need for time consuming phone call interactions. The system was already tested for its feasibility and a preliminary deployment was performed on a nursing home showing promising results.","Raposo, Afonso; Marques, Luis; Correia, Rafael; Melo, Francisco; Valente, João; Pereira, Telmo; Rosário, Luis Brás; Froes, Filipe; Sanches, João; Silva, Hugo Plácido da",Sensors (Basel),,345

This review addresses the question of whether to test asymptomatic cancer patients before initiating systemic cancer treatments. Methods: This systematic review was conducted based on the PRISMA framework. Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched, as well as guidelines from international institutions involved in cancer care and COVID-19 research. Studies published in English, from 1 December 2019 to 27 May 2020 were considered eligible. We included studies which mentioned testing strategies for SARS-CoV-2 of asymptomatic cancer patients before starting immunosuppressive treatments. Results: We identified 1,163 studies and 4 guidelines through the literature search. A total of 18 articles were considered eligible and were included in the final analysis. Two articles were cohort studies, and the remaining were expert consensuses and published guidelines. The most common recommendation among the studies in this systematic review was to test asymptomatic patients for SARS-CoV-2 prior to treatment. Conclusion: There is a lack of studies which directly address COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic patients before treatment. Our systematic review showed that most of the published data favours routine test for SARS-CoV-2 before initiating systemic treatment but failed to identify a good level of evidence to support these recommendations. Based upon this review, we proposed local recommendations at our centre. Each institution should consider the pros and cons of testing asymptomatic patients, evaluating accessibility to testing resources and local epidemiology.","Haradaa, Guilherme; Antonacio, Fernanda F; Gongora, Aline Bl; Behar, Marina H; Capareli, Fernanda C; Bastos, Diogo A; Munhoz, Rodrigo R; Costa, Frederico P; Jardim, Denis L; Arrais-Rodrigues, Celso; Novis, Yana; Katz, Artur; de Castro Junior, Gilberto",Ecancermedicalscience,,345

Increases in incidence among adults aged &#8805;60 years, who might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19-related illness, have followed increases in younger adults (aged 20-39 years) by an average of 8.7 days (3). Institutions of higher education (colleges and universities) have been identified as settings where incidence among young adults increased during August (4,5). Understanding the extent to which these settings have affected county-level COVID-19 incidence can inform ongoing college and university operations and future planning. To evaluate the effect of large colleges or universities and school instructional format* (remote or in-person) on COVID-19 incidence, start dates and instructional formats for the fall 2020 semester were identified for all not-for-profit large U.S. colleges and universities (&#8805;20,000 total enrolled students). Among counties with large colleges and universities (university counties) included in the analysis, remote-instruction university counties (22) experienced a 17.9% decline in mean COVID-19 incidence during the 21 days before through 21 days after the start of classes (from 17.9 to 14.7 cases per 100,000), and in-person instruction university counties (79) experienced a 56.2% increase in COVID-19 incidence, from 15.3 to 23.9 cases per 100,000. Counties without large colleges and universities (nonuniversity counties) (3,009) experienced a 5.9% decline in COVID-19 incidence, from 15.3 to 14.4 cases per 100,000. Similar findings were observed for percentage of positive test results and hotspot status (i.e., increasing among in-person-instruction university counties). In-person instruction at colleges and universities was associated with increased county-level COVID-19 incidence and percentage test positivity. Implementation of increased mitigation efforts at colleges and universities could minimize on-campus COVID-19 transmission.","Leidner, Andrew J; Barry, Vaughn; Bowen, Virginia B; Silver, Rachel; Musial, Trieste; Kang, Gloria J; Ritchey, Matthew D; Fletcher, Kelly; Barrios, Lisa; Pevzner, Eric",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,345

Its trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with human ACE2-receptor to mediate viral entry into host-cells. Here we present cryo-EM structures of a tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer with packed fusion peptide, and an ACE2-bound S-trimer at 2.7 Å and 3.8 Å resolution, respectively. Accompanying ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD), the associated ACE2-RBD exhibits continuous swing-motions within the S-trimer. Noteworthy, SARS-CoV-2 S-trimer appears much more sensitive to ACE2-receptor than SARS-CoV S-trimer regarding receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2. Our findings depict the mechanism of ACE2-induced S-trimer conformational transitions from ground prefusion state toward postfusion state, facilitating development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics.","Xu, Cong; Wang, Yanxing; Liu, Caixuan; Zhang, Chao; Han, Wenyu; Hong, Xiaoyu; Wang, Yifan; Hong, Qin; Wang, Shutian; Zhao, Qiaoyu; Wang, Yalei; Yang, Yong; Chen, Kaijian; Zheng, Wei; Kong, Liangliang; Wang, Fangfang; Zuo, Qinyu; Huang, Zhong; Cong, Yao",Sci.

METHODS: A multicentre-retrospective-case-series study of COVID-19 patients, aged &#8805;65 years, hospitalised between March 1 and June 15, 2020. Patients were classified at admission into 3 groups based on their Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score: 1-3 (group A), 4-6 (group B) and 7-9 (group C). RESULTS: Of the 206 patients in the study, 60 (29%) were assigned to group A, 60 (29%) to B and 86 (42%) to C. Significantly more frequent in group C than in B or A were: mental confusion (respectively 65%, 33%, 7%; P < 0.001), kidney failure (39%, 22%, 20%; P = 0.019), dehydration syndrome (55%, 27%, 13%; P < 0.001), electrolyte imbalance (54%, 32%, 25%; P = 0.001), and diabetic decompensation (22%, 12%, 7%; P = 0.026).

253493,Nursing Home Physician with Normal Chest X-Ray and Probable COVID-19 Based on 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT Imaging,2020,"Rationale Awake proning has been described as an effective intervention to improve oxygenation in nonintubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it remains unclear whether awake proning can prevent intubation in these patients. A major concern is that delaying intubation with awake proning may potentially lead to worse outcomes. Our study aimed to identify the clinical parameters indicative of successful awake proning that prevents intubation. Methods We identified 54 patients who met the criteria for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and underwent awake proning, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 at a single center from April to August, 2020. All patients had radiographic evidence of bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined as oxygen saturations less than 88% on room air that required supplemental oxygen, high flow nasal cannula, or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Table 1 demonstrates a comparison between patients who did not require intubation and those who did. We used t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables for statistical analysis. Results 31 patients (57%) did not require mechanical ventilation. Baseline demographics and comorbidities were similar between the two groups. The group that did not require intubation had higher SpO2/FiO2 ratios at the beginning of awake proning and throughout the next 4 days. In contrast, the group that required intubation had a lower SpO2/FiO2 ratio at baseline, which did not improve during the next 4 days. Additionally, respiratory rate improved with awake proning in the group that did not require intubation 4 hours after awake proning started. Mortality was higher among the patients who were intubated. Serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers were elevated in both groups. However, d-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly lower in the group that did not require intubation by day 4. Conclusions Awake proning was associated with decreased intubation rates in patients with less severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Delaying intubation in patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may lead to worse outcomes. Clinical parameters that may aid as decision tools to predict failure of awake proning include SpO2/FiO2 ratio, respiratory rate, and biomarkers within 4 days of initiation of awake proning.","Li, C.; Reyes, S.

253677,Clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the global health care system. Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China. METHODS: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices. RESULTS: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies. The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated.","Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; Sun, Xin; Yang, Yue; Wang, Shuang; Zhu, Hong",J Med Internet Res,,345
253678,Clinical characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia,2021,"The research focuses on the participation of Latin American states in the South-South cooperation (SSC) against the background of the contradictions of the current stage of globalization. Analyzing the official documents, leaders' speeches, using quantitative data, the authors consider three factors that model such involvement today: (a) a new context in Latin America, i. e. the growing popularity of the right-wing forces, financial and economic difficulties after the end of the commodities boom in the 2000s, (b) the rise of China and its deepening confrontation with the United States, (c) today's global coronavirus crisis. According to the authors, all the mentioned factors affect the process of Latin America taking part in SSC in the following ways. First, due to internal and international changes, the foreign policy agendas and the way of self-identification of the Latin American countries in the global world are in transformation. While the cooperation with other developing nations, within the region and beyond, seems less relevant for the New Right, the South-South vector is still in demand as a foreign policy diversification tool. Second, the strategic partnership with China remains an indicator of the region's actors' commitment to the ideas of multilateralism, openness, and globalization as such, but at the same time, it goes against the principles of SSC as equal and horizontal by its nature and also because of the tensions between China and the US. As for the pandemic, although in discourse it revives the importance of international cooperation, including SSC, in practice it rather catalyzes the disconnecting trends that have developed in recent years in Latin America.","Kheifets, L.

As the medical community seeks better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19, several theories have been proposed. One widely shared theory suggests that SARS-CoV-2 proteins directly interact with human hemoglobin (Hb) and facilitate removal of iron from the heme prosthetic group, leading to the loss of functional hemoglobin and accumulation of iron. Herein, we refute this theory. We compared clinical data from 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients to 21 non-COVID-19 ARDS patient controls, generating hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curves from venous blood gases. This curve generated from the COVID-19 cohort matched the idealized oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve well (Pearson correlation, R2 = 0.97, P.","DeMartino, Anthony W; Rose, Jason J; Amdahl, Matthew B; Dent, Matthew R; Shah, Faraaz A; Bain, William; McVerry, Bryan J; Kitsios, Georgios D; Tejero, Jesús; Gladwin, Mark T",Haematologica,,345

In times of the corona pandemic surgery and rehabilitation appointments were cancelled or delayed leading to a more difficult access to auditory rehabilitation. Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.","Aschendorff, A; Arndt, S; Kröger, S; Wesarg, T; Ketterer, M C; Kirchem, P; Pixner, S; Hassepaß, F; Beck, R",HNO,,345

This begs the question, ""What is elective in structural heart disease intervention?"" The recently proposed Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions/American College of Cardiology consensus statement is, unfortunately, non-specific and insufficient in its scope and scale of response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose guidelines that are practical, multidisciplinary, implementable, and urgent. We believe that this will provide a helpful framework for our colleagues to manage their practices during the surge and peak phases of the pandemic. General principles that apply across structural heart disease interventions include tracking and reporting cardiovascular outcomes, ""healthcare distancing,"" preserving vital resources and personnel, shared decision-making between the heart team and hospital administration on resource-intensive cases, and considering delaying research cases. Specific guidance for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and MitraClip procedures varies according to pandemic phase. During the surge phase, treatment should broadly be limited to those at increased risk of complications in the near term. During the peak phase, treatment should be limited to inpatients for whom it may facilitate discharge.

257289,Clinical Pearls,2021,"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)-associated pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case series of five patients, representing the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 associated PTE. Patients were admitted to four hospitals in Germany, Italy, and France. Infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS: The onset of PTE varied from 2 to 4 weeks after the occurrence of the initial symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and led to deterioration of the clinical picture in all cases. PTE was the primary reason for hospital admission after a 2-week period of self-isolation at home (1 patient) and hospital readmission after initial uncomplicated hospital discharge (2 patients). Three of the patients had no past history of clinically relevant risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Severe disease progression was associated with concomitant increases in IL-6, ferritin, and D-Dimer levels. The outcome from PTE was related to the extent of vascular involvement, and associated complications. CONCLUSION: PTE is a potential life-threatening complication, which occurs frequently in patients with COVID-19. Intermediate therapeutic dose of anticoagulants and extend thromboprophylaxis are necessary after meticulous risk-benefit assessment.","Sakr, Yasser; Giovini, Manuela; Leone, Marc; Pizzilli, Giacinto; Kortgen, Andreas; Bauer, Michael; Tonetti, Tommaso; Duclos, Gary; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Buschbeck, Samuel; Ranieri, V Marco; Antonucci, Elio",J Crit Care,,345

The purpose of this study was to better understand the challenges experienced and strategies utilized by Australian athletes (n = 7) and coaches (n = 5) preparing for the Tokyo Paralympic Games using semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis highlighted challenges specific to participants' sport (e.g., budgetary constraints, decentralized experiences, athletes with various impairments), personal life (e.g., moving cities to access coaching, postponing vocational/educational developments, isolation from social circles), and associated uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19, qualifications, accreditations). Participants managed these challenges by utilizing strategies to 'anticipate and prepare' (e.g., detailed planning, effective communication, contingency plans) and 'manage expectations' (e.g., understanding specific roles and boundaries, focusing on the process [i.e., effort over results]). Trust and communication between athletes and coaches was key in coaches' better understanding of how athletes' impairments interact with their training and competition environments and tailor support to each athlete's unique needs. Last, participants reflected on the 'pressure' of the Games due to their performance having an impact on their career trajectory 'post-Tokyo' with some athletes contemplating retirement and others realizing the consequences of their performance on sport-related vocation and sponsorship. Coaches also accepted the success of their programs and job security will depend on outcomes at the Games. The findings from this study shed light on factors to consider to reduce challenges for teams preparing for major competitions but also highlight key practical implications to support athletes and coaches leading up, during, and post-major Games.","Dehghansai, N; Pinder, R A; Baker, J; Renshaw, I",PLoS One,,345
258925,What Did Chaplains Do During the Covid Pandemic? An International Survey,2021,"RATIONALE:Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phenotypes differ by pulmonary epithelial vs. endothelial injury marker predominance. Epithelial vs. endothelial injury patterns in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection have not been directly compared. METHODS:Adult patients presenting to a single ED in Boston from 3/24-4/30/20 were enrolled. Inclusion criteria: clinical concern for COVID-19 ARDS and 1) respirations ≥22/minute or 2) SpO2≤92% on room air or 3) respiratory support. For this study, we excluded patients without subsequently polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 or without supplemental oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation (non-invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 was against hospital policy during enrollment). On Day=0, 3, and 7, patients had dedicated research blood draws and detailed clinical data were recorded. Data included clinical/respiratory status using the World Health Organization (WHO)-scale, and non-pulmonary (renal, cardiovascular, and coagulation) dysfunctions. Clinical status on Day=28 was also recorded. Blood was analyzed using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay, an oligonucleotide-labelled antibody assay that provides high-specificity analysis of plasma proteins, including low abundance proteins. Targets included markers of epithelial injury (n=5), endothelial activation and injury (n=11), and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, soluble-Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-1 (sTNF-R1). We used multivariable mixed-effects generalized linear models to determine associations between biomarker and clinical status trajectories. Multivariable proportional-odds models measured associations between biomarker trajectories with 28-day outcome. Models were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, heart, lung, and renal comorbidities, and initial Sequential Organ-Failure Assessment score. RESULTS:Figure-A shows (n=225) patients' clinical status over time. At Day=0, epithelial injury markers were higher in patients requiring IMV vs. supplemental oxygen and decreased over time independent of respiratory status (Figure-B). They did not discriminate renal, cardiovascular, or coagulation dysfunctions. In contrast, endothelial markers were initially lower for IMV than supplemental oxygen patients;they fell over time in lower severity patients but rose sharply in IMV patients (Figure-C). Endothelial markers discriminated patients with non-pulmonary organ dysfunction from those without. More endothelial (8/11, 73%) than epithelial (1/5, 20%) markers were significantly associated with worse 28-day outcome (Figure-E). Change from Day=0 to Day=3 was significantly associated with 28-day WHO-scale for all 11 (100%) endothelial vs. 3/5 (60%) epithelial markers. Endothelial effect-sizes were substantially larger (median odds-ratio:3.60 vs. 1.58). CONCLUSIONS:In COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress, endothelial markers are more strongly associated with clinical progression, non-pulmonary organ dysfunction, and 28-day outcomes than pulmonary epithelial markers. Over the course of illness, endothelial dysfunction may play an important role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. (Table Presented).","Leisman, D.; Mehta, A.; Hacohen, N.; Filbin, M. R.; Goldberg, M.

OBJECTIVES: Follow-up on the global publication activity within the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a comparison of national contexts with regards to local infection rates and the involvement of the discipline of pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative analysis of the number of publications in the PubMed® database concerning COVID-19 with respect to publication type, date and place of publication, affiliation to an institute of pathology, and correlation with the number of SARS-CoV­2 infections over the same timeframe. RESULTS: After an initial peak with regards to the number of publications in the months of May and June 2020, a slight decrease was observed, followed by another increase starting in August/September 2020. Further, the time between data collection and publication contracted to approximately 3-4 months. Countries faced with early SARS-CoV­2 infections published promptly, even though there was no overall association between the number of publications and COVID-19 case numbers. On average, 4% of authors were affiliated to an institute of pathology, with a steady increase of this percentage within the course of the pandemic.

In contrast to other published studies, we target the general population using Twitter as a data source. Specifically, we aim to investigate differences in the number of back pain complaints between the pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. A total of 53,234 and 78,559 tweets were analyzed for November 2019 and November 2020, respectively. Because Twitter users do not always complain explicitly when they tweet about the experience of back pain, we have designed an intelligent filter based on natural language processing (NLP) to automatically classify the examined tweets into the back pain complaining class and other tweets. Analysis of filtered tweets indicated an 84% increase in the back pain complaints reported in November 2020 compared to November 2019. These results might indicate significant changes in lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions in daily body movements and reduced exposure to routine physical exercise.","Fiok, Krzysztof; Karwowski, Waldemar; Gutierrez, Edgar; Saeidi, Maham; Aljuaid, Awad M; Davahli, Mohammad Reza; Taiar, Redha; Marek, Tadeusz; Sawyer, Ben D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,345

EXPERT OPINION: There is excitement for agents with 'disease-modifying' properties and the authors found more than 130 assets, not including cell and gene therapies under investigation - most of them still in preclinical development - meaning that the science is progressing multiple, diverse new opportunities. Many limitations hamper the successful development of these drug candidates such as the translational accuracy of preclinical models, the current clinical development paradigm as well as the lack of biomarkers to be used in diagnosis and therapy management.","Colombo, Daniele; Pnevmatikou, Paraskevi; Melloni, Elsa; Keywood, Charlotte",Expert Rev Neurother,,345
261883,Cochrane Corner: Coronavirus (COVID-19): infection control and prevention measures,2020,"With the development of the Internet, social networking sites have empowered the public to directly express their views about social issues and hence contribute to social change. As a new type of voice behavior, public voice on social media has aroused wide concern among scholars. However, why public voice is expressed and how it influences social development and betterment in times of public health emergencies remains unstudied. A key point is whether governments can take effective countermeasures when faced with public health emergencies. In such situation, public voice is of great significance in the formulation and implementation of coping policies. This qualitive study uses China's Health Code policy under COVID-19 to explore why the public performs voice behavior on social media and how this influences policy evolution and product innovation through cooperative governance. A stimulus-cognition-emotion-behavior model is established to explain public voice, indicating that it is influenced by cognitive processes and public emotions under policy stimulus. What is more, as a form of public participation in cooperative governance, public voice plays a significant role in promoting policy evolution and product innovation, and represents a useful form of cooperation with governments and enterprises to jointly maintain social stability under public health emergencies.","Yang, Yang; Su, Yingying",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,345

262949,Impact of COVID-19 on gastrointestinal endoscopy practice in india: A cross-sectional study,2020,"Background: The pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread and caused enormous and serious damages to many countries worldwide One of the most typical interventions is the social distancing such as lockdown that would contribute to reduce the number of contacts among undiagnosed individuals However, prolongation of the period of such a restrictive intervention could hugely affect the social and economic systems, and the outbreak will come back if the strong social distancing policy will end earlier due to the economic damage Therefore, the social distancing policy should be followed by massive testing accompanied with quarantine to eradicate the infection Methods: In this paper, we construct a mathematical model and discuss the effect of massive testing with quarantine, which would be less likely to affect the social and economic systems, and its efficacy has been proved in South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong Results: By numerical calculation, we show that the control reproduction number is monotone decreasing and convex downward with respect to the testing rate, which implies that the improvement of the testing rate would highly contribute to reduce the epidemic size if the original testing rate is small Moreover, we show that the recurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan could be possible after the lifting of the state of emergency if there is no massive testing and quarantine Conclusions: If we have entered into an explosive phase of the epidemic, the massive testing could be a strong tool to prevent the disease as long as the positively reacted individuals will be effectively quarantined, no matter whether the positive reaction is pseudo or not Since total population could be seen as a superposition of smaller communities, we could understand how testing and quarantine policy might be powerful to control the disease","Kuniya, Toshikazu; Inaba, Hisashi",Aims Public Health,,345
263146,Responses of pediatric palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic in China,2020,"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, accurate forecasting continues to play an extremely important role in informing policy decisions. In this paper, we collate a large data repository containing COVID-19 information from a range of different sources. We use this data to develop several predictors and prediction intervals for forecasting the short-term (e.g., over the next week) trajectory of COVID-19-related recorded deaths at the county-level in the United States. Specifically, using data from January 22, 2020, to May 10, 2020, we produce several different predictors and combine their forecasts using ensembling techniques, resulting in an ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our individual predictors include county-specific exponential and linear predictors, an exponential predictor that pools data together across counties, and a demographics-based exponential predictor. In addition, we use the largest prediction errors in the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our death predictions, resulting in prediction intervals that we refer to as Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction Intervals (MEPI). We show that MEPI is an effective method in practice with a 94.5\% coverage rate when averaged across counties. Our forecasts are already being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the medical supply need for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to the distribution of medical supplies across the country. We hope that our forecasts and data repository can help guide necessary county-specific decision-making and help counties prepare for their continued fight against COVID-19.

264168,Recommendations for Antimalarial Prophylaxis,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic has affected each and every country's health service and plunged refugees into the most desperate conditions. The plight of Rohingya refugees is among the harshest. It has severely affected their existing HIV/STI prevention and management services and further increased the risk of violence and onward HIV transmission within the camps. In this commentary, we discuss the context and the changing dynamics of HIV/AIDS during COVID-19 among the Rohingya refugee community in Bangladesh. What we currently observe is the worst crisis in the Rohingya refugee camps thus far. Firstly, because of being displaced, Rohingya refugees have increased vulnerability to HIV, as well as to STIs and other poor health outcomes. Secondly, for the same reason, they have inadequate access to HIV testing treatment and care. Not only because of their refugee status but also because of the poor capacity of the host country to provide services. Thirdly, a host of complex economic, socio-cultural and behavioural factors exacerbate their dire situation with access to HIV testing, treatment and care. And finally, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed priorities in all societies, including the refugee camps. In the context of the unfolding COVID-19 crisis, more emphasis is placed on COVID-19 rather than other health issues, which exacerbates the dire situation with HIV detection, management, and prevention among Rohingya refugees. Despite the common crisis experienced by most countries around the world, the international community has an obligation to work together to improve the life, livelihood, and health of those who are most vulnerable. Rohingya refugees are among them.","Hossain, Muhammad Anwar; Zablotska-Manos, Iryna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09690v1.pdf,345

270352,Not Telehealth: Which Primary Care Visits Need In-Person Care?,2021,"We present results on the mortality statistics of the COVID-19 epidemic in a number of countries. Our data analysis suggests classifying countries in five groups, (1) Western countries, (2) East Block, (3) developed Southeast Asian countries, (4) Northern Hemisphere developing countries and (5) Southern Hemisphere countries. Comparing the number of deaths per million inhabitants, a pattern emerges in which the Western countries exhibit the largest mortality rate. Furthermore, comparing the running cumulative death tolls as the same level of outbreak progress in different countries reveals several subgroups within the Western countries and further emphasises the difference between the five groups. Analysing the relationship between deaths per million and life expectancy in different countries, taken as a proxy of the preponderance of elderly people in the population, a main reason behind the relatively more severe COVID-19 epidemic in the Western countries is found to be their larger population of elderly people, with exceptions such as Norway and Japan, for which other factors seem to dominate. Our comparison between countries at the same level of outbreak progress allows us to identify and quantify a measure of efficiency of the level of stringency of confinement measures. We find that increasing the stringency from 20 to 60 decreases the death count by about 50 lives per million in a time window of 20 days. Finally, we perform logistic equation analyses of deaths as a means of tracking the dynamics of outbreaks in the ""first wave"" and estimating the associated ultimate mortality, using four different models to identify model error and robustness of results. This quantitative analysis allows us to assess the outbreak progress in different countries, differentiating between those that are at a quite advanced stage and close to the end of the epidemic from those that are still in the middle of it. This raises many questions in terms of organisation, preparedness, governance structure and so on.","Sornette, Didier; Mearns, Euan; Schatz, Michael; Wu, Ke; Darcet, Didier",Nonlinear Dyn,,345
271155,Vaccines for older adults,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS: This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva represented a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnosis and the collection method would reduce the exposure risk of frontline health workers which is one of major concerns in primary healthcare settings.

276925,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and the Developing Adolescent Brain,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The impact of social distancing on communication and psychosocial variables among individuals with hearing impairment during COVID-19 pandemic. It was our concern that patients who already found themselves socially isolated (Wie et al. 2010) as a result of their hearing loss would be perhaps more susceptible to changes in their communication habits resulting in further social isolation, anxiety, and depression. We wanted to better understand how forced social isolation (as part of COVID-19 mitigation) effected a group of individuals with hearing impairment from an auditory ecology and psychosocial perspective. We hypothesized that the listening environments would be different as a result of social isolation when comparing subject's responses regarding activities and participation before COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This change would lead to an increase in experienced and perceived social isolation, anxiety, and depression. DESIGN: A total of 48 adults with at least 12 months of cochlear implant (CI) experience reported their listening contexts and experiences pre-COVID and during-COVID using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA; methodology collecting a respondent's self-reports in their natural environments) through a smartphone-based app, and six paper and pencil questionnaires. The Smartphone app and paper-pencil questionnaires address topics related to their listening environment, social isolation, depression, anxiety, lifestyle and demand, loneliness, and satisfaction with amplification. Data from these two-time points were compared to better understand the effects of social distancing on the CI recipients' communication abilities. RESULTS: EMA demonstrated that during-COVID CI recipients were more likely to stay home or be outdoors. CI recipients reported that they were less likely to stay indoors outside of their home relative to the pre-COVID condition. Social distancing also had a significant effect on the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the environments indicating that the listening environments had better signal-to-noise ratios. CI recipients also reported better speech understanding, less listening effort, less activity limitation due to hearing loss, less social isolation due to hearing loss, and less anxiety due to hearing loss. Retrospective questionnaires indicated that social distancing had a significant effect on the social network size, participant's personal image of themselves, and overall loneliness. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, EMA provided us with a glimpse of the effect that forced social isolation has had on the listening environments and psychosocial perspectives of a select number of CI listeners. CI participants in this study reported that they were spending more time at home in a quieter environments during-COVID. Contrary to our hypothesis, CI recipients overall felt less socially isolated and reported less anxiety resulting from their hearing difficulties during-COVID in comparison to pre-COVID. This, perhaps, implies that having a more controlled environment with fewer speakers provided a more relaxing listening experience.","Dunn, Camille C; Stangl, Elizabeth; Oleson, Jacob; Smith, Michelle; Chipara, Octav; Wu, Yu-Hsiang",Ear Hear,,345

We demonstrate its utility using an SIR model augmented with air, rail, and road data between top 446 cities. Simulations show that the effective distance from outbreak location reliably predicts the time of arrival of infection in other cities. The hazard index predictions compare well with the observed spread of SARS-CoV-2. The hazard map can be useful in other outbreaks also.","Sadekar, Onkar; Budamagunta, Mansi; Sreejith, G.

277500,Factors associated with deaths due to COVID-19 versus other causes: population-based cohort analysis of UK primary care data and linked national death registrations within the OpenSAFELY platform,2021,"Healthcare workers are the group with the highest risk of COVID-19 transmission. The illness of healthcare workers poses a risk to patients admitted to the hospital, colleagues and households besides their own health. In this study, it was aimed to determine the risk assessment and the factors associated with risk status of an university hospital healthcare workers after risky COVID-19 contact. The data of the descriptive study were obtained from 773 follow-up records of 555 healthcare workers who applied with COVID-19 risky contact between 06.04-10.05.2020. Employees who were positive for RT-PCR evaluated as ""patients"" and others as ""risky contact"". Risk assessment was classified as no risk, low, medium and high risk contact according to the ""Algorithm of Assessment of Health Workers with COVID-19 Contact"" of the Ministry of Health. The relationship between the risk levels of the participants and their demographic and workplace characteristics and their usage of personal protection were evaluated. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, chi-square and ANOVA tests were used in the analysis of the data. The average age of the healthcare workers was determined as 34.4 ± 7.6 years. It was determined that 56.2% of those who had contact were female, 62.9% were married and 17.5% had an additional disease. It was determined that 45.6% of the risky contacts were nurses, 18.4% were supportive personnel and 16.9% were doctors. While 46.5% of the contacts were found as medium, 28.0% low, 17.1% high risk and 8.4% risk free. 38.2% of risky contacts occurred while working in internal/surgical clinics. While 66.0% of the employees had risky contact during patient care and treatment, 25% had risky contact with colleagues in social settings. High-risk contact was higher in social relations between employees. The source of the contact was a colleague in 73.2% of the employees. The average age of high-risk employees was smaller than those of low-risk. While 54.5% of the employees wore surgical masks during contact, 67.8% of the patients did not have a mask. Of 555 employees followed, 37 (6.7%) were diagnosed as COVID-19; 48.6% of the patients were nurses and 18.9% were doctors. It was determined that 48.6% of the healthcare workers were working in the COVID-19 service, outpatient clinic or intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. The source of the infection was thought to be a colleague in 51.6% of the patients. COVID-19 was more common in nurses and doctors. It was determined that risky contact also occurred in services other than the units where COVID-19 patients were treated and risky contact often took place while providing healthcare to the patients and during social relations between the employees. Unprotected contact of the employees with each other in the workplace was identified as an important risk source. Inadequate use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers led to an increase in medium and high risk contacts. The use of masks by patients and their relatives during the health service delivery and the proper use of personal protective equipment by healthcare professionals will reduce the risk. With the physical improvement of the rest areas of the employees and the arrangement of the breaks, the risky contact between colleagues in the social areas will be reduced.","Yapici, Gülçin; Kurt, Ahmet Öner; Solmaz, Elif Tugçe; Yeniocak Tunç, Aylin; Bozdag, Fatma; Bugdayci Yalçin, Bengü Nehir; Kaplan, Ekin; Uguz, Burcu Ecem; Dülger, Eray; Özkayalar, Hülya; Aslan, Gönül; Ersöz, Gülden",Mikrobiyol Bul,,345

In the proposed system, the segmentation task is performed in two stages. The first stage is called breast region segmentation in which adaptive noise filtering, local adaptive thresholding, connected component analysis, integral of horizontal projection, and breast region of interest detection algorithms are applied to the breast images consecutively. The second stage of segmentation is breast lesion detection that consists of 32-class Otsu thresholding and Markov random field techniques. Histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix and neighboring gray tone difference matrix based feature extraction, Fisher score based feature selection and, tenfold and leave-one-out cross-validation steps are carried out after segmentation to increase the reliability of the designed system while decreasing the computational time. Finally, support vector machines, k- nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network classifiers are performed to separate the breast lesions as benign and malignant. The average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of each classifier are calculated and the best results are compared with the existing similar studies. According to the achieved results, the proposed decision support system for breast lesion segmentation distinguishes the breast lesions with 86%, 100%, 67%, and 85% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values, respectively. These results show that the proposed system can be used to support the radiologists during a breast cancer diagnosis.","Çetinel, Gökçen; Mutlu, Fuldem; Gül, Sevda",,,345

285945,Telehealth strategy to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on type 2 diabetes: A randomized controlled trial,2021,"AIM: Postoperative drains have historically been used for the prevention and early detection of intra-abdominal collections. However, current evidence suggests that prophylactic drain placement following colorectal surgery has no significant clinical benefit. This is reflected in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines, which recommend against their routine use. The Ileus Management International study found more than one-third of participating centres across the world routinely used drains in the majority of colorectal resections. The aim of the present study is to audit international compliance with ERAS guidelines regarding the use of postoperative drains in colorectal surgery. METHOD: This prospective, multicentre audit will be conducted via the student- and trainee-led EuroSurg Collaborative network across Europe, South Africa and Australasia. Data will be collected on consecutive patients undergoing elective and emergency colorectal surgery with 30-day follow-up. This will include any colorectal resection, formation of colostomy/ileostomy and reversal of stoma. The primary end-point will be adherence to ERAS guidelines for intra-abdominal drain placement. Secondary outcomes will include the following: time to diagnosis of intra-abdominal postoperative collections; output and time to removal of drains; and 30-day postoperative complications defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification. CONCLUSION: This protocol describes the methodology for the first international audit of intra-abdominal drain placement after colorectal surgery. The study will be conducted across a large collaborative network with quality assurance and data validation strategies. This will provide a clear understanding of current practice and novel evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of intra-abdominal drain placement in colorectal surgical patients.",,Colorectal dis,,345

287226,Hydroxychloroquine prescribing habits and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Several vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are expected to be available in Australia in 2021. Initial supply is limited and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile enough for 1 million people in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE against all infection, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.","MacIntyre, C Raina; Costantino, Valentina; Trent, Mallory",Vaccine,,345
288153,Exploring nurses' experiences of psychological distress during care of patients with COVID-19: a qualitative study,2020,"Introduction: In summer term 2020, the clinical phase of the undergraduate medical curriculum at University Medical Center Göttingen was restructured since distance teaching had to be used predominantly due to contact restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper investigates the impact of restructuring the clinical curriculum on medical students' satisfaction and learning outcomes. Methods: In each cohort, the 13-week curriculum was divided into two parts: During the first 9 weeks, factual knowledge was imparted using distance teaching by means of a modified inverted classroom approach. This was followed by a 4-week period of adapted classroom teaching involving both real and virtual patients in order to train students' practical skills. The evaluation of the 21 clinical modules comprised students' satisfaction with distance teaching as well as students' learning outcome. The latter was assessed by means of comparative self-assessment (CSA) gain and the results of the module exams, respectively. Data of summer term 2020 (= distance teaching, DT) were compared with respective data of winter term 2019/20 (= classroom teaching, CT) and analysed for differences and correlations. Results: Response rates of evaluations were 51.3% in CT and 19.3% in DT. There was no significant difference between mean scores in module exams in CT and DT, respectively. However, CSA gain was significantly lower in DT (p=0.047) compared with CT. Further analyses revealed that CSA gain depended on the time point of data collection: CSA gain was lower the more time had passed since the end of a specific module. Moreover, we found positive correlations between CSA gain and students' satisfaction with various aspects of distance teaching, particularly with ""communication between teachers and students"" (rho=0.674; p=0.002). Discussion and conclusions: Although some limitations and confounding factors have to be taken into account (such as evaluation response rates, assessment time points, and proportion of familiar items in module exams), the following recommendations can be derived from our findings: A valid assessment of students' learning outcome by means of exam results requires that as few exam items as possible are familiar to the students. CSA gain seems to be valid if assessment time points are standardised and not contaminated by students' learning activities for other modules. Good communication between teachers and students may contribute to increase students' satisfaction with distance teaching.","Seifert, Theresa; Becker, Tim; Büttcher, Amelie Friederike; Herwig, Nadine; Raupach, Tobias",GMS J Med Educ,,345

We aimed to describe positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 assays employing three different measurement principles over a prolonged period. Two hundred sixty-eight samples from 180 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test followed by serological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were included. We conducted three chemiluminescence (including electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA)), four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test formats. Positivity rates, as well as positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), were calculated for each week after the first clinical presentation for COVID-19. Furthermore, combinations of tests were assessed within an orthogonal testing approach employing two independent assays and predictive values were calculated. Heat maps were constructed to graphically illustrate operational test characteristics. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, chemiluminescence assays and one ELISA IgG test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. With the exception of ECLIA, the PPVs of the other chemiluminescence assays were &#8805;95% for COVID-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA had somewhat lower PPVs. IgM exhibited insufficient predictive characteristics. An orthogonal testing approach provided PPVs &#8805; 95% for patients with a moderate pretest probability (e.g., symptomatic patients), even for tests with a low single test performance. After the second week, NPVs of all but IgM assays were &#8805;95% for patients with low to moderate pretest probability. The confirmation of negative results using an orthogonal algorithm with another assay provided lower NPVs than the single assays. When interpreting results from SARS-CoV-2 tests, the pretest probability, time of blood draw, and assay characteristics must be carefully considered. An orthogonal testing approach increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.","Risch, Martin; Weber, Myriam; Thiel, Sarah; Grossmann, Kirsten; Wohlwend, Nadia; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Ferrara, Francesca; Bigler, Susanna; Egli, Konrad; Bodmer, Thomas; Imperiali, Mauro; Salimi, Yacir; Fleisch, Felix; Cusini, Alexia; Renz, Harald; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Kahlert, Christian R; Paprotny, Matthias; Risch, Lorenz",Biomed Res Int,,345

A total of 185 WWTPs inflow samples were collected over the period consisting of both the first wave (mid-March to June) and the second wave (July to November). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N1 and N2 assays) were quantified in these wastewaters as well as those of Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), as indicators of human faecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 N gene daily loads strongly correlated with the number of cases diagnosed one week after sampling i.e. wastewater levels were a good predictor of cases to be diagnosed in the immediate future. The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV). The lowest incidence resulting in quantifiable SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater differed between WWTP sizes, being 0.11 and 0.82 cases/1000 inhabitants for the large and small sized WWTP respectively.","Rusiñol, M; Zammit, I; Itarte, M; Forés, E; Martínez-Puchol, S; Girones, R; Borrego, C; Corominas, Ll; Bofill-Mas, S",Sci Total Environ,,345

This study aims at assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychopathological conditions in health professionals working in a health institution in the Northern Italy, and to identify socio-demographic, work-related and psychological predictors of burnout. Methods: Health professionals working in the hospitals of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano were asked to participate to an online anonymous survey investigating socio-demographic data, COVID-19 emergency-related work and psychological factors, state anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms and burnout. Predictors of the three components of burnout were assessed using elastic net regression models. Results: Three hundred and thirty health professionals participated to the online survey. Two hundred and thirty-five health professionals (71.2%) had scores of state anxiety above the clinical cutoff, 88 (26.8%) had clinical levels of depression, 103 (31.3%) of anxiety, 113 (34.3%) of stress, 121 (36.7%) of post-traumatic stress. Regarding burnout, 107 (35.7%) had moderate and 105 (31.9%) severe levels of emotional exhaustion; 46 (14.0%) had moderate and 40 (12.1%) severe levels of depersonalization; 132 (40.1%) had moderate and 113 (34.3%) severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of all the three components of burnout were work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital, being in contact with COVID-19 patients. Reduced personal accomplishment was also predicted by age. Conclusions: Health professionals had high levels of burnout and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 emergency. Monitoring and timely treatment of these conditions is needed.","Giusti, Emanuele Maria; Pedroli, Elisa; D039,; Aniello, Guido E.; Stramba Badiale, Chiara; Pietrabissa, Giada; Manna, Chiara; Stramba Badiale, Marco; Riva, Giuseppe; Castelnuovo, Gianluca; Molinari, Enrico",Front.

The Asociación Española de Gastroenterología (AEG) and the Sociedad Española de Endoscopia Digestiva (SEED) have proposed the EPAGE guidelines for managing postponed colonoscopies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the EPAGE guidelines as a management tool compared to the immunologic faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) and compared to risk score (RS) that combines age, sex and the iFOBT for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and significant bowel disease (SBD). METHODS: A prospective, single-centre study enrolling 743 symptomatic patients referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy. Each order was classified according to the EPAGE guidelines as appropriate, indeterminate or inappropriate. Patients underwent an iFOBT and had their RS calculated. RESULTS: The iFOBT (p<0.001), but not the EPAGE guidelines (p = 0.742), was an independent predictive factor of risk of CRC. The ROC AUCs for the EPAGE guidelines, the iFOBT and the RS were 0.61 (95% CI 0.49-0.75), 0.95 (0.93-0.97) and 0.90 (0.87-0.93) for CRC, and 0.55 (0.49-0.61), 0.75 (0.69-0.813) and 0.78 (0.73-0.83) for SBD, respectively. The numbers of colonoscopies needed to detect a case of CRC and a case of SBD were 38 and seven for the EPAGE guidelines, seven and two for the iFOBT, and 19 and four for a RS &#8805;5 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: The EPAGE guidelines, unlike the iFOBT, is not suitable for screening candidate patients for a diagnostic colonoscopy to detect CRC. The iFOBT, in combination with age and sex, is the most suitable strategy for managing demand for endoscopy in a restricted-access situation.","Rodríguez-Alonso, Lorena; Rodríguez-Moranta, Francisco; Maisterra, Sandra; Botargues, Josep M; Berrozpe, Ana; Ruíz-Cerulla, Alexandra; Suris, Gerard; Camps, Blau; Gornals, Joan B; Guardiola, Jordi",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

Nevertheless, the disease course and predictors of mortality in critically ill patients are poorly understood. Methods: Following the critical developments in ICUs in regions experiencing early inception of the pandemic, the European-based, international RIsk Stratification in COVID-19 patients in the Intensive Care Unit (RISC-19-ICU) registry was created to provide near real-time assessment of patients developing critical illness due to COVID-19. Findings: As of April 22, 2020, 639 critically ill patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the RISC-19-ICU registry. Of these, 398 had deceased or been discharged from the ICU. ICU-mortality was 24%, median length of stay 12 (IQR, 5-21) days. ARDS was diagnosed in 74%, with a minimum P/F-ratio of 110 (IQR, 80-148). Prone positioning, ECCO2R, or ECMO were applied in 57%. Off-label therapies were prescribed in 265 (67%) patients, and 89% of all bloodstream infections were observed in this subgroup (n = 66; RR=3·2, 95% CI [1·7-6·0]). While PCT and IL-6 levels remained similar in ICU survivors and non-survivors throughout the ICU stay (p = 0·35, 0·34), CRP, creatinine, troponin, d-dimer, lactate, neutrophil count, P/F-ratio diverged within the first seven days (p<0·01). On a multivariable Cox proportional-hazard regression model at admission, creatinine, d-dimer, lactate, potassium, P/F-ratio, alveolar-arterial gradient, and ischemic heart disease were independently associated with ICU-mortality. Interpretation: The European RISC-19-ICU cohort demonstrates a moderate mortality of 24% in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Despite high ARDS severity, mechanical ventilation incidence was low and associated with more rescue therapies. In contrast to risk factors in hospitalized patients reported in other studies, the main mortality predictors in these critically ill patients were markers of oxygenation deficit, renal and microvascular dysfunction, and coagulatory activation. Elevated risk of bloodstream infections underscores the need to exercise caution with off-label therapies.","Wendel Garcia, Pedro David; Fumeaux, Thierry; Guerci, Philippe; Heuberger, Dorothea Monika; Montomoli, Jonathan; Roche-Campo, Ferran; Schuepbach, Reto Andreas; Hilty, Matthias Peter",EClinicalMedicine,,345

This study aims to understand the distribution of IgM and IgG antibodies in the Dominican Republic. We surveyed a total of 12,897 participants between April and June 2020 in 10 provinces of the Dominican Republic. Survey efforts in emerging hotspots yielded a positivity for all participants of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM of 3.8% and IgG of 5.4%, indicating that the pathogen was in circulation before the identification of those particular communities as hotspots. We found important age differences between participants who participated in the serological study where a higher mean age is associated IgM positivity and a lower age with IgG positivity. Our results highlight the need for strategies that involve community-based seroprevalence monitoring. These should preclude syndromic case identification. Also, the higher mean age of IgM-positive participants suggests that strategies based on syndromic surveillance could identify hotspots at later phases, based on the number of cases detected at the healthcare center, as such community-based seroprevalence monitoring may be an effective intervention for future outbreaks.","Paulino-Ramirez, Robert; Báez, Amado Alejandro; Vallejo Degaudenzi, Alejandro; Tapia, Leandro",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,345

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs &#8804;4 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown.

Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of &#8805;0.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (>28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], ±1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, ±3.70%).IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds. This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds. These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations. Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.","Mora-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Magtoto, Ronaldo; Houston, Elizabeth; Baum, David; Carrillo-Ávila, José Antonio; Temeeyasen, Gun; Zimmerman, Jeff; Piñeyro, Pablo; Giménez-Lirola, Luis",MSphere,,345
295471,Availability of drugs for severe covid-19 in sub-Saharan Africa,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is a global pandemic with higher mortality and morbidity than any other virus in the last 100 years. Without public health surveillance, policy makers cannot know where and how the disease is accelerating, decelerating, and shifting. Unfortunately, existing models of COVID-19 contagion rely on parameters such as the basic reproduction number and use static statistical methods that do not capture all the relevant dynamics needed for surveillance. Existing surveillance methods use data that are subject to significant measurement error and other contaminants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a proof of concept of the creation of surveillance metrics that correct for measurement error and data contamination to determine when it is safe to ease pandemic restrictions. We applied state-of-the-art statistical modeling to existing internet data to derive the best available estimates of the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 infection in the United States. METHODS: Dynamic panel data (DPD) models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique enables control of various deficiencies in a data set. The validity of the model and statistical technique was tested. RESULTS: A Wald chi-square test of the explanatory power of the statistical approach indicated that it is valid (&#967;210=1489.84, P<.001), and a Sargan chi-square test indicated that the model identification is valid (&#967;2946=935.52, P=.59). The 7-day persistence rate for the week of June 27 to July 3 was 0.5188 (P<.001), meaning that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 5188 cases 7 days later. For the week of July 4 to 10, the 7-day persistence rate increased by 0.2691 (P=.003), indicating that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 7879 new cases 7 days later. Applied to the reported number of cases, these results indicate an increase of almost 100 additional new cases per day per state for the week of July 4-10. This signifies an increase in the reproduction parameter in the contagion models and corroborates the hypothesis that economic reopening without applying best public health practices is associated with a resurgence of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: DPD models successfully correct for measurement error and data contamination and are useful to derive surveillance metrics. The opening of America involves two certainties: the country will be COVID-19-free only when there is an effective vaccine, and the ""social"" end of the pandemic will occur before the ""medical"" end. Therefore, improved surveillance metrics are needed to inform leaders of how to open sections of the United States more safely. DPD models can inform this reopening in combination with the extraction of COVID-19 data from existing websites.","Oehmke, James Francis; Oehmke, Theresa B; Singh, Lauren Nadya; Post, Lori Ann",J Med Internet Res,,345
296068,The adverse health effects of punitive immigrant policies in the United States: A systematic review,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has rapidly become a global public health concern. As the new type of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can spread across species and between populations and has a greater risk of transmission than other coronaviruses. To control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is vital to have a rapid and effective means of diagnosing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals and patients with COVID-19, an early isolation protocol for infected individuals, and effective treatments for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this review, we will summarize the novel diagnostic tools that are currently available for coronavirus, including imaging examinations and laboratory medicine by next-generation sequencing (NGS), real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis, immunoassay for COVID-19, cytokine and T cell immunoassays, biochemistry and microbiology laboratory parameters in the blood of the patients with COVID-19, and a field-effect transistor-based biosensor of COVID-19. Specifically, we will discuss the effective detection rate and assay time for the rRT-PCR analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and the sensitivity and specificity of different antibody detection methods, such as colloidal gold and ELISA using specimen sources obtained from the respiratory tract, peripheral serum or plasma, and other bodily fluids. Such diagnostics will help scientists and clinicians develop appropriate strategies to combat COVID-19.","Liu, Shanshan; Li, Qiuyue; Chu, Xuntao; Zeng, Minxia; Liu, Mingbin; He, Xiaomeng; Zou, Heng; Zheng, Jianghua; Corpe, Christopher; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing; Wang, Jin",Front Public Health,,345

This PCR test can be positive even in patients who have recovered from the disease, and the duration for achieving viral clearance has not been clarified yet. METHODS: This study was conducted between April 3, 2020, and June 17, 2020, at the Toyama University Hospital and the Toyama Rehabilitation Home. We collected the data of patients with COVID-19, analyzing the duration until twice-consecutive negative qRT-PCR test. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were enrolled. The median duration of the twice-consecutive negative qRT-PCR test was 29.0 d (interquartile range: 25.75-35.25). The longest duration of viral shedding was 73 d. The duration of viral clearance was significantly longer in the older (>65 years) group than in the younger group (34.5 d vs. 25.0 d, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that viral clearance tends to be sustained in the older adults.","Ueno, Akitoshi; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Fukui, Yasutaka; Sakamaki, Ippei; Saito, Mayuko; Yamashiro, Seiji; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Oishi, Kazunori; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",J. infect. chemother,,345

297945,Opioid use disorder and COVID-19: Implications for policy and practice,2021,"The current ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has globally affected the lives of more than one hundred million people. RT-PCR based molecular test is recommended as the gold standard method for diagnosing current infections. However, transportation and processing of the clinical sample for detecting virus require an expert operator and long processing time. Testing device enables on-site virus detection could reduce the sample-to-answer time, which plays a central role in containing the pandemic. In this work, we proposed an intelligent face mask, where a flexible immunosensor based on high density conductive nanowire array, a miniaturized impedance circuit, and wireless communication units were embedded. The sub-100 nm size and the gap between the neighbored nanowires facilitate the locking of nanoscale virus particles by the nanowire arrays and greatly improve the detection efficiency. Such a point-of-care (POC) system was demonstrated for coronavirus 'spike' protein and whole virus aerosol detection in simulated human breath. Detection of viral concentration as low as 7 pfu/mL from the atomized sample of coronavirus aerosol mimic was achieved in only 5 min. The POC systems can be readily applied for preliminary screening of coronavirus infections on-site and may help to understand the COVID-19 progression while a patient is under prescribed therapy.","Xue, Qiannan; Kan, Xinyuan; Pan, Zhihao; Li, Zheyu; Pan, Wenwei; Zhou, Feng; Duan, Xuexin",Biosens Bioelectron,,345

300263,Rationing Limited Healthcare Resources in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond: Ethical Considerations Regarding Older Adults,2020,"The COVID pandemic has made telematic consultations a basic tool in daily practice. Aims: The main objective of the study is to assess the results of the application of telematic consultations to limit the mobility of patients.The operational objectives are; to propose a consultation plan, to know how attendance limits consultations and to define which pathologies benefit the most from this plan. Methods: A scheme is proposed with the creation of pre-scheduled clinic to assess suitability and the possibility of carrying them out in a single non face-to-face act. Results: Phone call to 5619 patients were made with a lack of response of 19%The cases of 74% of the patients that answered were resolved virtually. There is a difference between units, obtaining a higher answering rate from patients appointed to specific clinic units, ORâ¯=â¯0.60, or to general trauma ones, ORâ¯=â¯0.67. The lowest answering rate was obtained from those derived from the emergency department.Twenty per cent of the consultations were not accompanied by complementary tests that would have favored the resolution in a single act. The general trauma consultations, ORâ¯=â¯0.34, postoperative control, ORâ¯=â¯0.49, and specific unit ones, ORâ¯=â¯0.40, were the ones that better met this requirement.Out of the remaining patients, the general trauma consultations, ORâ¯=â¯0.50, and those referred to units, ORâ¯=â¯0.54, were the ones that had a higher resolution rate without in- person consultation. Conclusions: The cases of 74% of the patients who answered the phone call were resolved virtually.Cases of 20% of the patients cannot be solved in a single act because they are derived without complementary tests.Osteosynthesis and postoperative arthroscopic follow-up consultations are the ones that need to be carried out in person the most.","Zamora Navas, P",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol (Engl Ed),,345

308329,How health systems approached respiratory viral pandemics over time: a systematic review,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic forced a rapid transition of in-class residency conferences to online residency conferences; little is known about learners' perceptions of this new didactic environment. Understanding learners' perceptions of virtual classrooms can help inform current and future best practices for online, synchronous, graduate medical education. METHODS: We surveyed emergency medicine and internal medicine residency programs at a large urban academic medical center about their perceptions of synchronous online residency conferences. RESULTS: Residents reported a preference for in-class interactions with peers (85%) and lecturers (80%), with 62% reporting decreased levels of engagement with lecturers during online conferences. Residents reported performing nearly twice as many non-conference-related activities (eg, email, exercise) during online conferences vs in-class conferences. Residents felt that the following methods improved engagement during online conferences: lecturers answering chat questions; small group sessions; and gamification of lectures. CONCLUSION: Synchronous online residency conferences were associated with decreased engagement and attention by learners. Simple methods to increase interactivity may help improve the online classroom experience and cultivate novel teaching environments that better support current learning styles.","Weber, William; Ahn, James",West J Emerg Med,,345
308580,Impact of Covid 19 Pandemic Associated Lockdown on Admissions Secondary to Cardiac Ailments in a Tertiary Cardiac Centre of Pakistan,2020,"Generally, COVID-19 is an acute contagious disease caused by the SARS­CoV-2 virus. The main route of human-to-human transmission is through contact with infectious secretions from the respiratory tract. Clinical manifestations vary from mild non-specific symptoms to life-threatening conditions. Since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, it has affected many medical, legal, social and economic aspects of everyday life in countries around the world. In this article, the authors present a summary of recommendations for taking care of otorhinolaryngology patients in outpatient settings and the legal basis referring to a risk of infection in doctor's office. In the selection of articles, the authors used English- and Polish-language online medical databases, typing the following keywords: SARS­CoV-2, COVID-19, otolaryngology, endoscopy, personal protective equipment, and legal responsibility of the physician. The mucosa of the upper respiratory tract is a potential site of virus replication. The specificity of an ear, nose and throat (ENT) examination and a direct patient-doctor contact favor the transmission of the infection. The authors discussed the elements of self-protection of medical personnel and the legal aspects a risk of the patient contracting the infection in the otolaryngology office. In the case of a direct contact with the patient, the following medical personal protective equipment is required: a cap, a mask with an FFP-2 filter, goggles, an apron and gloves. If, during the visit, exposure to secretions or aerosol from the respiratory tract is expected, the personnel should additionally wear a visor and a waterproof apron. The patient's visit in the clinic should be preceded by telemedicine consultation. Patients should be screened prior to having a direct contact with a physician, using a short patient questionnaire. The questionnaire may consist of simple questions about the characteristic symptoms of the SARS­CoV-2 infection and exposure to a sick person in the past 14 days. The question of staying in the areas of a high infection risk appears of little importance in view of the whole of Poland being perceived as constituting such an area. Due to the spread of the SARS­CoV-2 virus, new procedures for providing medical services have been introduced. In the case of claims on the part of the patient, the only protection the medical personnel or facility can provide is confirmation of scrupulous compliance with medical procedures .

308863,Meeting the Care Needs of Older Adults Isolated at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) erupted in Hubei Province of China in December 2019 and has become a pandemic. Severe COVID-19 patients who suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction have high mortality. Several studies have shown that this is closely related to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), often loosely referred to as cytokine storm. IL-6 is one of the key factors and its level is positively correlated with the severity of the disease. The molecular mechanisms for CRS in COVID-19 are related to the effects of the S-protein and N-protein of the virus and its ability to trigger NF-&#954;B activation by disabling the inhibitory component I&#954;B. This leads to activation of immune cells and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-&#945;. Other mechanisms related to IL-6 include its interaction with GM-CSF and interferon responses. The pivotal role of IL-6 makes it a target for therapeutic agents and studies on tocilizumab are already ongoing. Other possible targets of treating CRS in COVID-19 include IL-1ß and TNF-&#945;. Recently, reports of a CRS like illness called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in children have surfaced, with a variable presentation which in some cases resembles Kawasaki disease. It is likely that the immunological derangement and cytokine release occurring in COVID-19 cases is variable, or on a spectrum, that can potentially be governed by genetic factors. Currently, there are no approved biological modulators for the treatment of COVID-19, but the urgency of the pandemic has led to numerous clinical trials worldwide. Ultimately, there is great promise that an anti-inflammatory modulator targeting a cytokine storm effect may prove to be very beneficial in reducing morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Que, Yifan; Hu, Chao; Wan, Kun; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Luo, Jiang; Li, Tianzhi; Ping, Rongyu; Hu, Qinyong; Sun, Yu; Wu, Xudong; Tu, Lei; Du, Yingzhen; Chang, Christopher; Xu, Guogang",Int Rev Immunol,,345

Our working hypothesis was that, even within slums, an inverse relationship existed between living density and access to shared or private WASH facilities. METHODS: In an exploratory, secondary analysis of World Bank, cross-sectional microdata from slums in Bangladesh we investigated the relationship between intra-household population density (crowding) and access to private or shared water sources and toilet facilities. RESULTS: The analysis showed that most households were single-room dwellings (80.4%). Median crowding ranged from 0.55 m2 per person up to 67.7 m2 per person. The majority of the dwellings (83.3%), shared both toilet facilities and the source of water, and there was a significant positive relationship between crowding and the use of shared facilities. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the practical constraints on implementing, in slums, the conventional COVID19 management approaches of social distancing, regular hand washing, and not sharing spaces. It has implications for the management of future respiratory epidemics.","Hasan, Shaikh Mehdi; Das, Susmita; Hanifi, Syed Manzoor Ahmed; Shafique, Sohana; Rasheed, Sabrina; Reidpath, Daniel D",BMC Public Health,,345
317435,Rapid Integration of Home Telehealth Visits Amidst COVID-19: What Do Older Adults Need to Succeed?,2020,"We aimed to analyze the interactions of both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine with SARS-CoV-2 and identify their possible role for the prevention/treatment of COVID-19 by molecular docking studies. Protein crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, the compounds hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and other ligand structures were minimized by OPLS3 force field. Glide Standard Precision and Extra Precision docking are performed and MM-GBSA values ââare calculated. Molecular docking studies showed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine do not interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, but bind to the amino acids ASP350, ASP382, ALA348, PHE40 and PHE390 on the ACE2 allosteric site rather than the ACE2 active site. Our results showed that neither hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine bind to the active site of ACE2. However, both molecules prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 by interacting with the allosteric site. This result can help ACE2 inhibitor drug development studies to prevent viruses entering the cell by attaching spike protein to ACE2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

318848,Prevalence of Psychotropic and Opioid Prescription Fills Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Dementia in the US,2020,"Background Our objective is to examine whether residential racial segregation may be constraining capacities for social distancing thus leaving African Americans potentially more exposed to contracting COVID-19. We hypothesized that residential racial segregation constrains African Americans’ spatial mobility when the whole population is locked down but increases their need for moving under reopening orders. Methods We employ a Black/White dissimilarity index as our independent variable and county-level mobility ratios as our dependent variable. Using generalized estimating equations for longitudinal data, we analyzed the effects of Black/White segregation on population mobility by counties across the United States from March 8 to August 7, 2020 under two different COVID-19 related policy conditions: lockdown and reopening. Findings While higher county-wide levels of segregation were significantly associated with decreased mobility under lockdown and stay-at-home orders, we found that this relationship between segregation and mobility dissipated under reopening orders. Interpretations Investigating the effects of health policy without considering differing effects due to structural racism will likely ignore complexities that may create unintended consequences of health policy. Our conclusions suggest African Americans may face structural limitations to effective social distancing as evidenced by higher rates of mobility after reopening policies go into effect.","White, Alexandre Hao Lingxin Yu Xiao Thorpe Roland J.",EClinicalMedicine,,345

320667,Perception and the Associated Apprehension Stemming from Novel Covid-19 among Pakistani Students,2020,"Pandemic COVID-19 gives ample reason to generally review coronavirus (CoV) containment. For establishing some preliminary views on decontamination and disinfection, surrogate CoVs have commonly been assessed. This review serves to examine the existing science in regards to CoV containment generically and then to translate these findings into timely applications for COVID-19. There is widespread dissemination of CoVs in the immediate patient environment, and CoVs can potentially be spread via respiratory secretions, urine, and stool. Interpretations of the spread however must consider whether studies examine for viral RNA, virus viability by culture, or both. Pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and post-fourteen day virus excretion from patients may complicate the epidemiology. Whereas droplet spread is accepted, there continues to be controversy over the extent of possible airborne spread and especially now for SARS-CoV-2. CoVs are stable in body secretions and sewage at reduced temperatures. In addition to temperature, dryness or relative humidity, initial viral burden, concomitant presence of bioburden, and the type of surface can all affect stability. Generalizing, CoVs can be susceptible to radiation, temperature extremes, pH extremes, peroxides, halogens, aldehydes, many solvents, and several alcohols. Whereas detergent surfactants can have some direct activity, these agents are better used as complements to a complex disinfectant solution. Disinfectants with multiple agents and adverse pH are more likely to be best active at higher water temperatures. Real-life assessments should be encouraged with working dilutions. The use of decontamination and disinfection should be balanced with considerations of patient and caregiver safety. Processes should also be balanced with considerations for other potential pathogens that must be targeted. Given some CoV differences and given that surrogate testing provides experimental correlates at best, direct assessments with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are required.

For that, in the Design of Experiments (DOE) an arbitrary interface, ""coating efficiency"" (CE) is introduced and scaled the cumulative percentage coating (CPC) to get predictable control over drug release (DR). Subsequently, the granules containing ASP are converted to spherules and then to Ethyl cellulose (EC) Coated spherules (CS) by a novel bed coating during the rolling (BCDR) process. Among spherules, one with 0.35â¯mm than 0.71â¯mm shows required properties. The CS has a low 1200 angle by Optical Microscopy (OM), smooth surface without cracks by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and better flow properties (Angle of repose 29.69â¯±â¯0.780, Carr's index 6.73â¯±â¯2.24%, Hausner's Ratio 1.07â¯±â¯0.03) than granules and spherules. Once certain structure-dependent control over release is attained (EC coated spherules shows 10% reduction in burst release (BR) than uncoated spherules showing a release of 80-91%) the predictability is achieved and Design of space (DOS) by DOE (CE-70.14%and CPC-200% and DR-61.54%) is established. The results of DOE to experimentally validated results were within 20% deviation. The aspirin is changing its crystal structure by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) from Form-I to Form-II showing polymorphism inside the drug reservoir with respect to the process. This CE and CPC approach in DOE can be used for delivery system design of other labile drugs similar to aspirin in emergency situations.","Sreejith, T; Kamalasanan, Kaladhar; Moidu, Ashna; Shyamsundar, Pooja; Nair, Shanti V; Nair, Lakshmi J; Venkatesan, P",Int. j. biol. macromol,,345

We base our study on a sample of 295 prefecture (and above) cities in 31 provinces in China. A distribution dynamics approach is employed to reveal the trend and movement of disposable income per capita in each city before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the period when the COVID-19 was under the control. The findings reveal significant negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and show that most cities will converge to a level of disposable income which is much less than the Pre-COVID level if the COVID pandemic persists. Regional income inequality has intensified in the cities that have a longer duration of stringent social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and disappeared in the cities with policies of short duration. Disposable income per capita for urban residents recovered quickly when the transmission of coronavirus was effectively contained; and yet the impact of the pandemic on rural residents remains unresolved, if not intensified. This study demonstrates a significant divergence of the trend of disposable income across cities with different durations of social distancing policies and between urban and rural residents. It also highlights the importance of stringent social distancing policies in containing the spread of virus in a short time and calls for special policy attention for rural regions in the recovery from the COVID-19.","Shen, Jianfu; Shum, Wai Yan; Cheong, Tsun Se; Wang, Lafang",Front Public Health,,345

Urinary incontinence developed after irradiation caused frequent urinary tract infection leading to kidney failure. He was listed for combined liver-intestine-kidney transplantation and received en-bloc allograft from a 35 year-old male brain-dead donor. During evisceration of native organs, frozen abdomen was encountered and subtotal enterectomy leaving 30 cm of jejunum was performed. Urinary bladder was rock hard with no augmentation, unacceptable to implant the allograft ureter. Arterial inflow was established with an aortic conduit between the native and allograft infra-renal aorta. The native jejunum was transected at 10 cm and the proximal segment was connected to allograft jejunum to establish the continuity of alimentary tracts. The distal 20 cm of native jejunum was anastomosed to allograft ureter for urinary diversion Postoperative course was unremarkable with adequate urinary output and allograft functions. The patient was well rehabilitated in hospital due to lack of safe rehabilitative facilities during COVID pandemic and discharged home on post-operative day 47. Conclusion: Combined kidney and visceral transplantation in the setting of irradiated bladder requires pre-operative planning of urinary reconstruction with several options. When native intestine is available and not damaged from original disease, urinary diversion using the native jejunum is the safest option amongst others including cystoplasty and urinary diversion using allograft ileum.","Fujiki, M.; Del Prete, L.; D039,; Amico, G.; Eltemamy, M.; Akshelyan, S.; Maklad, M.; Osman, M.; Wee, A.; Viadya, A.; Abu-Elmagd, K.",Transplantation,,345

METHOD: The Consensus Conference was entirely held online due to anti-Covid-19 restrictions and after an introductory four lectures held by national and international experts in the field, a total of nine questions were presented and a digital ""real-time"" voting system was obtained. A consensus was reached if 75% or more of all panelists agreed on a given question. RESULTS: A total of 202 physicians, from 76 different Italian Breast Centers homogeneously distributed throughout the Italian country, participated to the Conference. Most participants were surgeons (75%). Consensus was reached for seven out of the nine considered topics, including management of margins and lymph nodes at surgery, and there was good correspondence between the 32 ""Expert Panelists"" and the ""Participants"" to the Conference. Consensus was not achieved regarding the indications to NACT for high-grade luminal-like breast tumors, and the need to perform an axillary lymph node dissection in case of micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node after NACT. CONCLUSIONS: NACT is a topic of major interest among surgeons, and there is need to develop shared guidelines. While a Consensus was obtained for most issues presented at this Conference, controversies still exist regarding indications to NACT in luminal B-like tumors and management of lymph node micrometastases. There is need for clinical studies and analysis of large databases to improve our knowledge on this subject.","De Luca, Alessandro; Frusone, Federico; Buzzacchino, Federica; Amabile, Maria Ida; Taffurelli, Mario; Del Mastro, Lucia; Rutgers, Emiel J T; Sacchini, Virgilio; Caruso, Francesco; Minelli, Mauro; Fortunato, Lucio",Eur J Surg Oncol,,345
332121,COVID-19: opportunity to learn from necessity,2020,"The Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network held its 21st Annual General Meeting virtually in November 2020 given the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine manufacturing experts, leaders from local and global public health organizations and multilateral organizations, through diverse presentations, questions and answers, focused on the pandemic and the response of vaccine manufacturers where many are engaged in research and development and production agreements. The pandemic is expanding rapidly which makes the global availability and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines critical. Strategies put in place include the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) within which the COVAX facility aims to distribute 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021, with procurement mechanisms already being established. At the same time, regulatory authorities have emergency use authorizations aimed at the rapid approval of safe and effective vaccines, with a push for harmonization in regulatory approaches being advocated. The Meeting was also apprised of other innovations being developed for vaccines including multi-array patches for easier vaccine application, increased heat stability for mitigating cold chain and storage challenges, the barcoding of primary packaging for enhancing vaccine traceability, and gathering data for decision-making. Over time, these innovations will facilitate the widespread availability and equitable access of vaccines including those addressing epidemics and pandemics. In addition, a number of manufacturers described technologies they have for accelerating vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. Overall, there was agreement that manufacturers from developing countries play a critical role in the global research, development and supply of vaccines for a healthy future, with increasing collaboration and partnering between them a growing strength.","Pagliusi, Sonia; Hayman, Benoit; Jarrett, Stephen",Vaccine,,345

Additionally, it investigates gender differences in self-assessed knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms. Field research employing a nonprobability sampling method with an online questionnaire resulted in collecting 762 valid questionnaires. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, factor and reliability analysis, and the independent sample t-test. Results reveal that overall symptom knowledge was assessed higher than the self-assessed knowledge of the 13 specific symptoms. No gender differences were detected regarding self-assessed knowledge of the following COVID-19 symptoms: cough, dyspnea, anorexia, productive cough with expectoration (phlegm), headache, and diarrhea. On the other hand, for self-assessed overall knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, as well as self-assessed knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms related to fever and fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), pharyngodynia, nausea-vomitus, hemoptysis, and abdominal pain, the t-tests conducted showed that there are statistical differences in knowledge assessment between male and female subjects. Based on the outcomes, the paper provides marketing communication practices targeting this young generation cohort to raise awareness so that Gen Z'ers may react effectively if these symptoms are observed and, thus, request medical assistance.","Kamenidou, Irene Eirini; Stavrianea, Aikaterini; Mamalis, Spyridon; Mylona, Ifigeneia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,345

334116,"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic trauma workload in a London level 1 trauma center: the ""golden month""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be helpful in providing information about cellular density and also predicting the histological features of aggressive tumors. Several studies have evaluated this technique for orbital tumors. However, very few articles have focused exclusively on evaluating pediatric orbital masses and, within those, only a small number of patients were included in the study. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the use of DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values to differentiate between benign and malignant extraocular orbital lesions in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 73 patients under the age of 18 seen in our hospital between October 2016 and February 2019. The extraocular orbital lesions were evaluated clinically and radiologically using DWI. The diagnosis was confirmed by either histological examination (after biopsy or surgery) or based on clinical and radiologic evaluation. RESULTS: The malignant lesions were found to have increased diffusion restriction in comparison to the benign lesions. The ADC values of the malignant lesions were significantly lower (P<0.0001). The use of a cutoff value of 0.99×10-3 mm2/s allowed for the differentiation of the benign lesions and malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100% while the cutoff point of 1.26×10-3 mm2/s had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 73%. CONCLUSION: Measurement of ADC in extraocular orbital lesions in children may help differentiate malignant lesions from benign lesions.","Maldonado, Francisco R; Princich, Juan P; Micheletti, Lucia; Toronchik, María S; Erripa, José I; Rugilo, Carlos",Pediatr. radiol,,345

339933,Home care as a safe alternative in post-acute and long-term care during COVID-19 crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spatial and temporal lung infection distributions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their changes could reveal important patterns to better understand the disease and its time course. This paper presents a pipeline to analyze statistically these patterns by automatically segmenting the infection regions and registering them onto a common template. METHODS: A VB-Net is designed to automatically segment infection regions in CT images. After training and validating the model, we segmented all the CT images in the study. The segmentation results are then warped onto a pre-defined template CT image using deformable registration based on lung fields. Then, the spatial distributions of infection regions and those during the course of the disease are calculated at the voxel level. Visualization and quantitative comparison can be performed between different groups. We compared the distribution maps between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP), between severe and critical COVID-19, and across the time course of the disease. RESULTS: For the performance of infection segmentation, comparing the segmentation results with manually annotated ground-truth, the average Dice is 91.6% ± 10.0%, which is close to the inter-rater difference between two radiologists (the Dice is 96.1% ± 3.5%). The distribution map of infection regions shows that high probability regions are in the peripheral subpleural (up to 35.1% in probability). COVID-19 GGO lesions are more widely spread than consolidations, and the latter are located more peripherally. Onset images of severe COVID-19 (inpatients) show similar lesion distributions but with smaller areas of significant difference in the right lower lobe compared to critical COVID-19 (intensive care unit patients). About the disease course, critical COVID-19 patients showed four subsequent patterns (progression, absorption, enlargement, and further absorption) in our collected dataset, with remarkable concurrent HU patterns for GGO and consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: By segmenting the infection regions with a VB-Net and registering all the CT images and the segmentation results onto a template, spatial distribution patterns of infections can be computed automatically. The algorithm provides an effective tool to visualize and quantify the spatial patterns of lung infection diseases and their changes during the disease course. Our results demonstrate different patterns between COVID-19 and CAP, between severe and critical COVID-19, as well as four subsequent disease course patterns of the severe COVID-19 patients studied, with remarkable concurrent HU patterns for GGO and consolidations.","Gu, Dongdong; Chen, Liyun; Shan, Fei; Xia, Liming; Liu, Jun; Mo, Zhanhao; Yan, Fuhua; Song, Bin; Gao, Yaozong; Cao, Xiaohuan; Chen, Yanbo; Shao, Ying; Han, Miaofei; Wang, Bin; Liu, Guocai; Wang, Qian; Shi, Feng; Shen, Dinggang; Xue, Zhong",BMC Med Imaging,,345
340180,Interprofessional Primary Care During COVID-19: The Provider Perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic that has raised worldwide concern. This study aims to investigate the correlation between the extent of lung infection and relevant clinical laboratory testing indicators in COVID-19 and to analyse its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Chest high-resolution computer tomography (CT) images and laboratory examination data of 31 patients with COVID-19 were extracted, and the lesion areas in CT images were quantitatively segmented and calculated using a deep learning (DL) system. A cross-sectional study method was carried out to explore the differences among the proportions of lung lobe infection and to correlate the percentage of infection (POI) of the whole lung in all patients with clinical laboratory examination values. RESULTS: No significant difference in the proportion of infection was noted among various lung lobes (P > 0.05). The POI of total lung was negatively correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage (L%) (r = - 0.633, P < 0.001) and lymphocyte (LY) count (r = - 0.555, P = 0.001) but positively correlated with the neutrophil percentage (N%) (r = 0.565, P = 0.001). Otherwise, the POI was not significantly correlated with the peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) count, monocyte percentage (M%) or haemoglobin (HGB) content. In some patients, as the infection progressed, the L% and LY count decreased progressively accompanied by a continuous increase in the N%. CONCLUSIONS: Lung lesions in COVID-19 patients are significantly correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte and neutrophil levels, both of which could serve as prognostic indicators that provide warning implications, and contribute to clinical interventions in patients.","Wang, Xingrui; Che, Qinglin; Ji, Xiaoxiao; Meng, Xinyi; Zhang, Lang; Jia, Rongrong; Lyu, Hairong; Bai, Weixian; Tan, Lingjie; Gao, Yanjun",BMC Infect Dis,,345
340509,Changes in Emergency Department Patient Volume and Acuity Associated with Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Unique Environment,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered fear and distress among the public, thus potentiating the incidence rate of anxiety and depression. This study aims to investigate the psychological effect of quarantine on persons living in Morocco when the first COVID-19 cases were identified. The associations between anxiety, depression symptoms, and their predictors (sociodemographics, fatigue, and religious coping) were examined. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey, with a total of 1435 participants (&#8805;18 years) recruited anonymously, was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (from 3 to 30 April 2020). A structured questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, and religious coping. Religious coping, fatigue, and depression, and anxiety were measured by Brief Religious Coping Scale (Brief RCOPE), Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. A generalized linear model (logistic regression) was used to determine the predictive factors of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 43.0% (n = 621) and 53.0% (n = 766), respectively. Both were associated with female gender, household income decline, tracking COVID-19 news, and fear to contract COVID-19 (aOR = 1.36 to 2.85). Additionally, 32.0% (n = 453) and 26.0% (n = 372) reported severe physical fatigue, and mental fatigue, respectively. Both latter factors were significantly and positively associated with depression as well as with anxiety. Depressive and anxious patients used more negative religious coping, while positive religious coping was slightly associated with depression. CONCLUSION: In this online survey of the general population in Morocco, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic and psychosocial factors, such as female gender, income decline, infection fears, massive COVID-19 news exposure, negative religious coping, and fatigue were associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms.

Feminist scholars have theorized these interlocking systems of domination as 'the continuum of violence.' Building on this scholarship, we conceptualize the US response to and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as reflective of the continuum of violence. We argue that crises like pandemics expose the anti-democratic and exclusionary practices inherent to this continuum, which is especially racialized and gendered. To support our argument, we provide empirical evidence of the continuum of violence in relation to COVID-19 vis-Ã-vis the interrelated issues of militarization and what feminists call ""everyday security,"" such as public health and gender-based violence. The continuum of violence contributes theoretically and practically to our understanding of how violence that the pandemic illuminates is embedded in broader systems of domination and exclusion.","Forester, Summer; O039,; Brien, Cheryl",Polit.

Within the United Kingdom, simulationbased education (SBE) is primarily used for treatment skills and updates for cardiorespiratory on-call physiotherapists (Gough et al, 2013). The availability and accessibility of high-fidelity resources and specialist education is variable. A collaboration between Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, was established with the aim of providing a comprehensive SBE course to paediatric physiotherapists nationally. There are currently no other paediatric SBE programmes within the region. METHODS: During May 2018, 2 courses were run with a combination of pre-simulation lectures, simulation scenarios and peer group discussion. Following an international peer review from Queensland Children's Hospital and anonymised candidate feedback (N=23), the course content was divided into 2 separate study days (October 2018 and May 2019). This allowed targeted, specific SBE to both a critical care group and a high dependency care group of paediatric physiotherapists. RESULTS: 15 candidates attended the SBE paediatric critical care (N=8) and high dependency care (N=7) courses. Of the 14 anonymised electronic feedback responses, 96.5% rated the 4 simulation scenarios as extremely useful or very useful. Feedback themes were collated to guide future course content. CONCLUSIONS: The targeted SBE programme for paediatric critical care physiotherapists demonstrated improved confidence in managing highly complex scenarios alongside an opportunity for shared peer learning and reflective practice. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the course is being modified for teaching via a virtual platform.","Balls, J.; Mercer, H.; Griffin, S.; Broughton, E.",Pediatric Critical Care Medicine,,345

METHODS: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who came to our attention for fever, neck pain radiated to the jaw, and palpitations occurring 15 days after a SARS-CoV-2-positive oropharyngeal swab. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been mild and the patient had completely recovered in a few days. RESULTS: At physical examination the patient presented with a slightly increased heart rate and a painful and enlarged thyroid on palpation. At laboratory exams free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine were high, thyrotropin undetectable, and inflammatory markers and white blood cell count elevated. Bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas were detected at neck ultrasound. One month earlier, thyroid function and imaging both were normal. We diagnosed SAT and the patient started prednisone. Neck pain and fever recovered within 2 days and the remaining symptoms within 1 week. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers normalized in 40 days. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of SAT after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We alert clinicians to additional and unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.","Brancatella, Alessandro; Ricci, Debora; Viola, Nicola; Sgrò, Daniele; Santini, Ferruccio; Latrofa, Francesco",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,345

There is limited knowledge regarding the dynamic changes in coagulation factors among COVID-19 patients on nafamostat mesylate, a potential therapeutic anticoagulant for COVID-19. First, we retrospectively conducted a cluster analysis based on clinical characteristics on admission to identify latent subgroups among fifteen patients with COVID-19 on nafamostat mesylate at the University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan, between April 6 and May 31, 2020. Next, we delineated the characteristics of all patients as well as COVID-19-patient subgroups and compared dynamic changes in coagulation factors among each subgroup. The subsequent dynamic changes in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were presented graphically. All COVID-19 patientsãwere classified into three subgroups: clusters A, B, and C, representing low, intermediate, and high risk of poor outcomes, respectively. All patients were alive 30 days from symptom onset. No patient in cluster A required mechanical ventilation; however, all patients in cluster C required mechanical ventilation, and half of them were treated with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All patients in cluster A maintained low D-dimer levels, but some critical patients in clusters B and C showed dynamic changes in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels. Although the potential of nafamostat mesylate needs to be evaluated in randomized clinical trials, admission characteristics of patients with COVID-19 could predict subsequent coagulopathy.","Osawa, Itsuki; Okamoto, Koh; Ikeda, Mahoko; Otani, Amato; Wakimoto, Yuji; Yamashita, Marie; Shinohara, Takayuki; Kanno, Yoshiaki; Jubishi, Daisuke; Kurano, Makoto; Harada, Sohei; Okugawa, Shu; Yatomi, Yutaka; Moriya, Kyoji",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,345

362452,Comorbidities predict 30-day hospital mortality of older adults with COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Dyspnea is common and distressing in patients with acute critical illness who require mechanical ventilation (MV), and is often a presenting symptom for COVID-19. However, little is known about the long-term persistence of dyspnea or its impact on patients recovering from mechanical ventilation. This study sought to evaluate early and persistent dyspnea, and its emotional impact, among survivors of respiratory failure due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We identified ICU survivors who underwent at least 48 hours of MV for COVID-19. We contacted eligible patients via telephone at 6 months post-hospital discharge. We assessed the presence and severity of dyspnea throughout their illness (ICU, hospital floor, hospital discharge, 6 months post-discharge) using components of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP), a validated instrument. Additionally, we asked patients with persistent dyspnea at the time of follow up whether dyspnea triggered specific emotional responses, using the MDP. Data are means + standard deviation or number (percent). RESULTS: Forty of 43 patients contacted by telephone completed interviews and 3 declined. Twenty-three patients (58%) were male, 7 (18%) had COPD, 9 (22%) had obstructive sleep apnea, and 11 (28%) had active tobacco use. The duration of invasive MV was 14+7.1 days and hospital length of stay was 24.7+9.6 days. Six-month post-discharge data revealed 25 patients (62.5%) with any dyspnea, and 10 (25%) with moderate to severe dyspnea (10-point severity scale score &gt; 4). Among patients with persistent dyspnea at 6 months, the majority reported fear (60%), anxiety (57.5%), or frustration (52.5%). Depression was the most common severe emotional response accompanying dyspnea (10-point severity scale score of 7-10), reported by 9 patients (22.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Six months after COVID-19-associated respiratory failure, dyspnea was persistent in the majority of patients and commonly associated with negative emotions. Fear and anxiety were most commonly reported. Prior to COVID-19, long-term dyspnea had been described in up to 40% of patients after respiratory failure, though data are limited. Thus dyspnea appears as, or more, common after COVID-19. In addition to the typical components of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), dyspnea and the negative emotional states it evokes may impair quality-of-life for COVID-19 survivors and should be specifically assessed during post-hospital care visits.","Trainor, A.; Bass, G.

Resource reallocation will have consequences on the routine management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). We consider how to mitigate potential adverse effects. RECENT FINDINGS: Combination therapy is well established in hypertension. Many guidelines recommend dual antihypertensive therapy as the initial treatment step as this results in faster blood pressure control, albeit with limited evidence of improved outcomes. Control of CVD risk factors through multiclass combination therapy (the polypill) was proposed many years ago. This approach has not been adopted by Western healthcare systems despite improving surrogate outcomes. Recently, the PolyIran trials have demonstrated improved CVD outcomes without increased adverse events, in both primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic allows models of chronic healthcare to be rethought. Current practices are resource-intensive and there is a need to simplify titration and monitoring protocols in CVD. Moving toward the use of polypill combinations allied with telehealth consultations may be one solution.","Floyd, Christopher N; Wierzbicki, Anthony S",Curr Opin Cardiol,,345

Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of infection because the virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted by a variety of routes. Health care workers are required to use a variety of personal protective equipment (PPE) for prolonged hours and, as a result, they face varying degrees of cutaneous complications. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey to investigate skin problems caused by the use of PPE and personal hygiene measures. We developed a survey with 32 questions using Google forms and distributed it via WhatsApp and Facebook groups. RESULTS: A total of 1142 responses were obtained. Among the respondents, 88.1% reported adverse skin reactions due to PPE and personal hygiene measures. Female sex, working as a nurse, wearing PPE more than 6 hours per day, and working more than 3 days per week increase the risk of PPE-related skin problems. CONCLUSION: In this study, we highlighted skin problems related to personal protective equipment and found out risk factors for PPE-related skin problems.","Etgu, Fatma; Onder, Sevda",Cutan Ocul Toxicol,,345

For this end, a search was performed on PubMed and Lilacs database using key-words and free terms referring to drug administration via feeding tubes, and, specifically chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Also, a search on Micromedex® database and on the Handbook of Drug Administration via Enteral Feeding Tubes were performed. A total of 1.784 articles were retrieved. However, 4 articles fitted in the inclusion criteria. Two articles exploring the administration of chloroquine via feeding tubes on children with malaria found no difference on clinical results or tolerability when comparing it with oral or intramuscular administration. Other article showed full dispersion of hydroxychloroquine on water after crushing with mortar and pestle.

364487,"Simple and effective primary assessment of emergency patients in a COVID-19 outbreak area: A retrospective, observational study",2020,"Background: Epidemic outbreaks caused by SARS-CoV-2 are worsening around the world, and there are no target drugs to treat COVID-19. IFN-&#954; inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2; and TFF2 is a small secreted polypeptide that promotes the repair of mucosal injury and reduces the inflammatory responses. We used the synergistic effect of both proteins to treat COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized, clinical trial involving patients with moderate COVID-19. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either aerosol inhalation treatment with IFN-&#954; and TFF2 every 24 h for six consecutive dosages in addition to standard care (experimental group) or standard care alone (control group). The primary endpoint was the time until a viral RNA negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 in all clinical samples. The secondary clinical endpoint was the time of CT imaging improvement. Data analysis was performed per protocol. This study was registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. Findings: Between March 23 and May 23 of 2020, 86 COVID-19 patients with symptoms of moderate illness were recruited, and 6 patients were excluded due to not matching the inclusion criteria (patients with pneumonia through chest radiography). Among the remaining 80 patients, 40 patients were assigned to experimental group, and the others were assigned to control group to only receive standard care. Efficacy and safety were evaluated for both groups. The time of viral RNA negative conversion in experimental group (Mean, 3·80 days, 95% CI 2·07-5·53), was significantly shorter than that in control group (7·40 days, 95% CI 4·57 to 10·23) (p = 0.031), and difference between means was 3·60 days. The percentage of patients in experimental group with reversion to negative viral RNA was significantly increased compared with control group on all sampling days (every day during the 12-day observation period) (p = 0·037). For the secondary endpoint, the experimental group had a significantly shorter time until improvement was seen by CT (Mean 6·21 days, N = 38/40, 95% CI 5·11-7·31) than that in control group (8·76 days, N = 34/40, 95% CI 7·57-9·96) (p = 0.002), and difference between means was 2·55 days. No discomfort or complications during aerosol inhalation were reported to the nurses by any experimental patients. Interpretation: In conclusion, we found that aerosol inhalation of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 in combination with standard care is safe and superior to standard care alone in shortening the time up to viral RNA negative conversion in all clinical samples. In addition, the patients in experimental group had a significantly shortened CT imaging improvement time than those in control group. This study suggested that this combination treatment is able to facilitate clinical improvement (negative for virus, improvement by CT, reduced hospitalization stay) and thereby result in an early release from the hospital. These data support the need for exploration with a large-scale trial of IFN-&#954; plus TFF2 to treat COVID-19.

372204,Opinions of patients related to radiology department during the covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Our recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of easy-to-use, quick, cheap, sensitive and selective detection of virus pathogens for the efficient monitoring and treatment of virus diseases. Early detection of viruses provides essential information about possible efficient and targeted treatments, prolongs the therapeutic window and hence reduces morbidity. Graphene is a lightweight, chemically stable and conductive material that can be successfully utilized for the detection of various virus strains. The sensitivity and selectivity of graphene can be enhanced by its functionalization or combination with other materials. Introducing suitable functional groups and/or counterparts in the hybrid structure enables tuning of the optical and electrical properties, which is particularly attractive for rapid and easy-to-use virus detection. In this review, we cover all the different types of graphene-based sensors available for virus detection, including, e.g., photoluminescence and colorimetric sensors, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors. Various strategies of electrochemical detection of viruses based on, e.g., DNA hybridization or antigen-antibody interactions, are also discussed. We summarize the current state-of-the-art applications of graphene-based systems for sensing a variety of viruses, e.g., SARS-CoV-2, influenza, dengue fever, hepatitis C virus, HIV, rotavirus and Zika virus. General principles, mechanisms of action, advantages and drawbacks are presented to provide useful information for the further development and construction of advanced virus biosensors. We highlight that the unique and tunable physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials make them ideal candidates for engineering and miniaturization of biosensors.","Vermisoglou, Eleni; Panácek, David; Jayaramulu, Kolleboyina; Pykal, Martin; Frébort, Ivo; Kolár, Milan; Hajdúch, Marián; Zboril, Radek; Otyepka, Michal",Biosens Bioelectron,,345

A cross-sectional survey study",2020,"AIMS: Remote or tele-consultation has become an emerging modality of consultation in many specialities, including ENT. Advantages include increasing accessibility, potential to reduce costs and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced risk of infection transmission. Here, we systematically collate and synthesise the evidence base on outcomes from remote consultation in adult and paediatric ENT services. METHODS: We performed a review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We searched Medline and Embase for relevant articles. Outcomes include specific patient pathway efficiency measures (including number of healthcare visits, lead time, touch time and handoff), patient/clinician satisfaction, cost analysis and safety implications. RESULTS: From 6325 articles screened, 53 met inclusion criteria. Publications included studies on remote consultation for initial, preoperative and follow-up assessment (including postoperative). In most instances, remote consultation reduced costs and time from referral to assessment and was associated with high patient satisfaction. However, a face-to-face follow-up appointment was required in 13%-72% of initial consultations, suggesting that remote consultation is only appropriate in selected cases. CONCLUSION: Remote consultation is appropriate and preferable for ENT consultation in specific conditions and circumstances. Future research should look to better define those conditions and circumstances, and report using recognised quality standards and outcome measures.","Gupta, Tanya; Gkiousias, Vasileios; Bhutta, Mahmood F",Clin. otolaryngol,,345
372613,Management of individuals with multiple chronic conditions: a continuing challenge,2021,"Although SARS-CoV-2 may primarily enter the cells of the lungs, the small bowel may also be an important entry or interaction site, as the enterocytes are rich in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors. The initial gastrointestinal symptoms that appear early during the course of Covid-19 support this hypothesis. Furthermore, SARS-CoV virions are preferentially released apically and not at the basement of the airway cells. Thus, in the setting of a productive infection of conducting airway epithelia, the apically released SARS-CoV may be removed by mucociliary clearance and gain access to the GI tract via a luminal exposure. In addition, post-mortem studies of mice infected by SARS-CoV have demonstrated diffuse damage to the GI tract, with the small bowel showing signs of enterocyte desquamation, edema, small vessel dilation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mesenteric nodes with severe hemorrhage and necrosis. Finally, the small bowel is rich in furin, a serine protease which can separate the S-spike of the coronavirus into two ""pinchers"" (S1 and 2). The separation of the S-spike into S1 and S2 is essential for the attachment of the virion to both the ACE receptor and the cell membrane. In this special review, we describe the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the cell and enterocyte and its potential clinical implications.","Mönkemüller, Klaus; Fry, Lucia; Rickes, Steffen",Rev Esp Enferm Dig,,345
372731,COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers,2020,"Objective: To analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Method: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients admitted from January 31st to February 5th at isolation ward of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were divided into non-survival group and survival group according to the clinical outcomes 5 weeks after admission. Data including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results were obtained. Cardiac injury was defined as serum concentration of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) above 0.04 µg/L. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze the prognostic value of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to plotted survival curve and analyze the impact of myocardial injury on the survival outcome of COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 202 patients were included, the age was 63 (51, 70) years old, 88 (43.6%) of them were male, 85 (42.1%) of them had comorbidities, 125 (61.9%) of them were severely to critically ill. Till March 11, 33 patients died, all of them were critically ill patients. The age, proportion of males, comorbidities, respire rate, serum levels of hs-cTnI and incidence of heart failure in the non-survival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group (all P<0.05). The hospitalization time of non-survival group was significantly shorter than that of survival group (6(4, 9) vs. 32(23, 36), P<0.001). Myocardial injury was an important prognostic factor of COVID-19 (HR=5.382, 95%CI 2.404-12.05, P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the presence of myocardial injury was significantly associated with the reduced survival rate among COVID-19 patients (P<0.001). Conclusion: Myocardial injury is an important prognostic factor of COVID-19, COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury face a significantly higher risk of death.","Wang, L; He, W B; Yu, X M; Liu, H F; Zhou, W J; Jiang, H",Zhonghua Yan Ke Za Zhi,,345
372732,COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic Characteristics and Hospital Support Measures Associated with the Immediate Psychological Impact on Healthcare Workers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality in allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. In this population, influenza virus can replicate for prolonged periods, despite neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, leading to resistance and treatment failure. Baloxavir targets the influenza polymerase and may be an effective treatment option in these patients. METHODS: We used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. RESULTS: Two patients were infected with influenza A/H1pdm09 carrying a neuraminidase variant (H275Y) linked to oseltamivir resistance. Both these two patients were successfully treated with baloxavir. Of the three patients infected with wild-type influenza virus, two cleared the virus after baloxavir treatment, while the third patient developed the polymerase I38T variant linked to baloxavir resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that baloxavir treatment can be effective in treating neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza in profoundly immunocompromised patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of baloxavir alone and combined with oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in SCT recipients and other immunocompromised populations.","Salvatore, Mirella; Laplante, Jennifer M; Soave, Rosemary; Orfali, Nina; Plate, Markus; van Besien, Koen; St George, Kirsten",Transpl Infect Dis,,345
373224,The COVID-19 pandemic: A tipping point for advance care planning? Experiences of general practitioners,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal and fast-spreading viral infection. To date, the number of COVID-19 patients worldwide has crossed over six million with over three hundred and seventy thousand deaths (according to the data from World Health Organization; updated on 2 June 2020). Although COVID-19 can be rapidly diagnosed, efficient clinical treatment of COVID-19 remains unavailable, resulting in high fatality. Some clinical trials have identified vitamin C (VC) as a potent compound pneumonia management. In addition, glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is clinically as an anti-inflammatory medicine against pneumonia-induced inflammatory stress. We hypothesized that the combination of VC and GA is a potential option for treating COVID-19. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine pharmacological targets and molecular mechanisms of VC + GA treatment for COVID-19, using bioinformational network pharmacology. RESULTS: We uncovered optimal targets, biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of VC + GA against COVID-19. Our findings suggested that combinatorial VC and GA treatment for COVID-19 was associated with elevation of immunity and suppression of inflammatory stress, including activation of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, regulation of Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, ErbB signaling pathway and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway. We also identified 17 core targets of VC + GA, which suggest as antimicrobial function. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study uncovered the pharmacological mechanism underlying combined VC and GA treatment for COVID-19. These results should benefit efforts to address the most pressing problem currently facing the world.","Li, Rong; Wu, Ka; Li, Yu; Liang, Xiao; Lai, Keng Po; Chen, Jian",Brief. bioinform,,345

In this study, we aimed to assess patients' confidence in this triage concept and patients' satisfaction regarding the received treatment during the outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with a diagnosed retinal disease, triaged into three priority groups based on their condition's urgency during lockdown. After restrictions were eased, a subset of previously triaged patients was interviewed to assess their confidence in the triage and their satisfaction regarding the received treatment during the pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 743 patients were triaged during the lockdown. Over 80% received an urgent appointment (priority 1). Among all priority 1 patients, over 84% attended their appointment and 77% received an intravitreal injection (IVI), while 7% cancelled their appointment due to COVID-19. In post-lockdown interviews of 254 patients, 90% trusted the emergency regimen and received treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our triage seemed to be useful in optimizing access to treatment for patients with retinal diseases. An excellent rating of patients' confidence in the triage and satisfaction regarding the received treatment during the first COVID-19 outbreak could be achieved.","Bajka, Anahita; Wiest, Maximilian Robert Justus; Hamann, Timothy; Toro, Mario Damiano; Zweifel, Sandrine Anne",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,345

375389,Cognitive decline following acute viral infections: literature review and projections for post-COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are a class of important small noncoding RNAs, which have been reported to be involved in the processes of tumorigenesis and development by targeting a few genes. Existing studies show that the imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis is closely related to the initiation and development of cancers. However, the impact of miRNAs on this imbalance has not been studied systematically. RESULTS: In this study, we first construct a cell fate miRNA-gene regulatory network. Then, we propose a systematical method for calculating the global impact of miRNAs on cell fate genes based on the shortest path. Results on breast cancer and liver cancer datasets show that most of the cell fate genes are perturbed by the differentially expressed miRNAs. Most of the top-identified miRNAs are verified in the Human MicroRNA Disease Database (HMDD) and are related to breast and liver cancers. Function analysis shows that the top 20 miRNAs regulate multiple cell fate related function modules and interact tightly based on their functional similarity. Furthermore, more than half of them can promote sensitivity or induce resistance to some anti-cancer drugs. Besides, survival analysis demonstrates that the top-ranked miRNAs are significantly related to the overall survival time in the breast and liver cancers group. CONCLUSION: In sum, this study can help to systematically study the important role of miRNAs on proliferation and apoptosis and thereby uncover the key miRNAs during the process of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the results of this study will contribute to the development of clinical therapy based miRNAs for cancers.","Xu, Peng; Wu, Qian; Lu, Deyang; Yu, Jian; Rao, Yongsheng; Kou, Zheng; Fang, Gang; Liu, Wenbin; Han, Henry",BMC Bioinformatics,,345

A systematic review,2021,"Postoperative dressing protocols after clean surgery without implant vary widely. The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether early postoperative dressing removal is a valid option, as compared to untouched dressing or twice-weekly dressing change approach. A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients who underwent carpal tunnel release (CTR) or trigger finger release (TFR) between January and November 2020. Patients were randomly distributed into 3 groups: surgical dressing untouched until first follow up (SDU); surgical dressing changed twice a week in a health maintenance organization (HMO); and surgical dressing removed at first postoperative day (SDR). Data collected included patient characteristics, pre-and post-operative functional (QuickDASH) and autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living performance (IADL)) scores, Vancouver scar scale (VSS) and potential complications. Eighty-four patients were included: 28 (33.3%), 29 (34.5%) and 27 (32.1%) in the SDU, HMO and SDR groups, respectively. Deterioration in mean IADL score at 2-week follow-up was statistically significant in the HMO group (mean delta 3.35, p = 0.008). Quick DASH score improved significantly between preoperative and 2-week follow-up values only in the SDU group (mean delta 9.12, p = 0.012). Other parameters, including wound complications, did not differ significantly between groups. Early removal of postoperative dressing and immediate wound exposure was a safe option after CTR and TFR. An untouched bulky dressing correlated with early functional improvement. Finally, iterative dressing change in HMO showed no benefit and led to significant deterioration in early postoperative autonomy. IRB APPROVAL: 0548-18-TLV.

In total, 88% of the patients experienced symptoms of high fever, 68% suffered from dry cough and 7.1% patients were asymptomatic. In total, 66.8% patients were males, 73% were in the age group of 20-59 years and over 83% recovered in 11-25 days. Approximately 3.4 million people were tested between 1 April and 25 May 2020, out of which 4% were detected COVID-19-positive. Given the current doubling time of infections, several states may face a major shortage of public beds and healthcare facilities soon. Weather has minimal effect on the infection spread in most Indian states. The study results will help policymakers to predict the trends of the disease spread in the upcoming months and devise better control measures.","Chanda, Arnab",Epidemiol Infect,,345

379976,Telemedicine and support groups could be used to improve adherence to treatment and health-related quality of life in patients affected by inflammatory skin conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Plants have evolved an innate immune system to protect themselves from pathogen invasion with the help of intracellular NB-LRR (NLR) receptors though the mechanisms remain largely undefined. RIN13 (RPM1-interacting protein 13) was previously reported to enhance disease resistance, and suppress RPM1 (a CNL type NLR)-mediated hypersensitive response in Arabidopsis via a yet unknown mechanism. Here, we show that RIN13 is a nucleus-localized protein, and functions in the nucleus. Overexpression of RIN13 leads to autoimmunity with high accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), constitutive expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, enhanced resistance to virulent pathogen, and dwarfism. In addition, genetic and transcriptome analysis show that SA-dependent and SA-independent pathways are both required for RIN13-mediated disease resistance with EDS1/PAD4 complex as an integration point. RIN13-induced dwarfism was rescued completely by either mutant pad4-1 or eds1-2 but partially by snc1-r1, a mutant of the TNL gene SNC1, suggesting the involvement of EDS1/PAD4 and SNC1 in RIN13 functioning. Furthermore, transient expression assays indicated that RIN13 promotes the nuclear accumulation of PAD4. Collectively, our study uncovered a signalling pathway whereby SNC1 and EDS1/PAD4 act together to modulate RIN13-triggered plant defense responses.","Liu, Xiaoxiao; Liu, Hui; He, Jingjing; Zhang, Siyuan; Han, Hui; Wang, Zhangying; Liu, Wen-Cheng; Liang, Yun-Kuan; Gao, Zhiyong",,,345

382423,Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric syndromes and COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For medical image segmentation, deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, the powerful spectral representation in the field of image processing is rarely considered in these models. METHODS: In this work, we propose to introduce frequency representation into convolution neural networks (CNNs) and design a novel model, tKFC-Net, to combine powerful feature representation in both frequency and spatial domains. Through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation, frequency representation is employed on pooling, upsampling, and convolution without any adjustments to the network architecture. Furthermore, we replace original convolution with twin-Kernel Fourier Convolution (t-KFC), a new designed convolution layer, to specify the convolution kernels for particular functions and extract features from different frequency components. RESULTS: We experimentally show that our method has an edge over other models in the task of medical image segmentation. Evaluated on four datasets-skin lesion segmentation (ISIC 2018), retinal blood vessel segmentation (DRIVE), lung segmentation (COVID-19-CT-Seg), and brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019), the proposed model achieves outstanding results: the metric F1-Score is 0.878 for ISIC 2018, 0.8185 for DRIVE, 0.9830 for COVID-19-CT-Seg, and 0.8457 for BraTS 2019. CONCLUSION: The introduction of spectral representation retains spectral features which result in more accurate segmentation. The proposed method is orthogonal to other topology improvement methods and very convenient to be combined.","Tang, Xianlun; Peng, Jiangping; Zhong, Bing; Li, Jie; Yan, Zhenfu",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,345

This survey study involved rural arable crop farmers. Data were collected from households and community survey of 517 families through structured interview schedule (questionnaire administered by face to face interview). It was found that 41% and 30% of the present and second generations respectively, in receiving communities were immigrants. In receiving communities, 68% of the households were of the largest ethnic group compared to 95% fraction in sending communities. Households in sending communities had smaller farm sizes than those in receiving communities. In sending communities, 41% and 65% of the migrant and indigenous populations, respectively, contacted the disease, while there was no recorded case in receiving communities. The mean yield in receiving communities was higher than that in the sending communities. COVID-19 incidents and other factors influenced immigration to receiving communities. The soil and land factors in receiving communities also contributed to decision on migration. Migration increased agricultural productivity in receiving communities, while productivity was reduced in sending communities. However, other factors such as distance to farm, farm size, age of household head and assets also affected yields in sending and receiving communities. The policy implications are that government ought to have considered the fact that, naturally, farm families work while giving distances to themselves in farms. Communities need to participate in decisions on issues like this in the future to collectively, fathom a way out especially in rural communities.","Ofuoku, A. U.; Opia, B. O. P.; Ikpoza, E.

AutoDock Vina is used for molecular docking. Through our research, the binding affinity of saquinavir and raltegravir to the protein is higher than other candidate drugs in molecular docking; they are -9.1 kcal/mol and -9 kcal/mol, respectively. Among them remdesivir performance was mediocre, only -7.9 kcal/mol. In our study, ultimately, these systems are also basically stable. The overall contraction of the protein structure is most obvious after the combination of remdesivir. In the remdesivir-protein system, the structure of the terminal end has undergone relatively large changes. And the total number of hydrogen bonds formed in the remdesivir-protein system is larger. The hydrogen bonds can be maintained for a longer time, and the final interaction energy is stronger than other systems. These amino acid sequence fragments have high affinity with the remdesivir molecule. Remdesivir can change the structure of the protein to make it stronger in binding with itself through the interaction with the protein. The simulation study of drug screening for new coronaviruses can provide further support for new coronavirus effective drugs and provide powerful support to defeat the virus.","Zhao, Xiaomeng; Liu, Ruixia; Miao, Zhi; Ye, Nan; Lu, Wenyu",J. comput. biol,,345

According to the time from the disease onset to the cure or from the onset to each CT scan, the total of 30 chest CT scans were divided into 4 stages, namely stage 1 (0-4 days), stage 2 (5-9 days), stage 3 (10-14 days), and stage 4 (over 14 days). A semi-quantitative scoring system was used to quantitatively assess the pulmonary involvement on the basis of the involved area. The differences in chest CT signs and the lung injury scores based on CT findings were compared among the 4 stages.ResultsIn stage 1, ground-glass opacities (GGO) was found frequently in the subpleura, and the CT score was the lowest at 4.00±0.40. Stage 2 was characterized by an increased and mixed density (crazy-paving pattern) with mild consolidation of the lungs, and the CT score reached its peak level of 7.38±3.34 (P < 0.05). In stage 3, an expanded range of consolidation and linear lesions were found in the lungs, and the total CT score averaged 6.86±2.91. In stage 4, a gradual resolution of the consolidation occurred with more linear lesions in the lungs, and the total CT score was 6.21±1.56. The CT scores of the lower lobes were significantly higher compared with those of the middle/upper lobes (P < 0.05) in stage 3 and stage 4.ConclusionChest CT scans allows dynamic monitoring of the changes in the distribution, density and extent of the pulmonary lesions in the 4 stages, which are closely correlated with the evolution of the disease course of COVID-19.","Xiang, Ying; Yang, Quanxin; Sun, Honghong; Qin, Xingru; Li, Xiaohui; Zhang, Qiujuan",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,345

Since its discovery in December 2019, there have been countless cases of mortality and morbidity due to this virus. Several compounds such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and remdesivir have been tested as potential therapies;however, no effective treatment is currently recommended by regulatory agencies. Some studies on respiratory non-enveloped viruses such as adenoviruses and rhinovirus and some respiratory enveloped viruses including human respiratory syncytial viruses, influenza A, parainfluenza, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have shown the antiviral activity of cardiac glycosides, correlating their effect with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (NKA) modulation. Cardiac glycosides are secondary metabolites used to treat patients with cardiac insufficiency because they are the most potent inotropic agents. The effects of cardiac glycosides on NKA are dependent on cell type, exposure time, and drug concentration. They may also cause blockage of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ionic transport or trigger signaling pathways. The antiviral activity of cardiac glycosides is related to cell signaling activation through NKA inhibition. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) seems to be an essential transcription factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. NFkappaB inhibition by cardiac glycosides interferes directly with SARS-CoV-2 yield and inflammatory cytokine production. Interestingly, the antiviral effect of cardiac glycosides is associated with tyrosine kinase (Src) activation, and NFkappaB appears to be regulated by Src. Src is one of the main signaling targets of the NKA alpha-subunit, modulating other signaling factors that may also impair viral infection. These data suggest that Src-NFkappaB signaling modulated by NKA plays a crucial role in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we discuss the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides on different respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 pathology, cell signaling pathways, and NKA as a possible molecular target for the treatment of COVID-19.","Souza, E.

RESULTS: Most studies report a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among HPs that can be associated with: a) COVID-19 exposure; b) epidemiological issues; c) material resources; d) human resources; and e) personal factors. The role of certain variables, before, during and after the pandemic, remains unexplored. Longitudinal studies will help elucidate which factors are associated with a higher risk of developing long-lasting negative effects.

399633,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpression in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients seen at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine allocation is a national concern especially for countries such as the Philippines that have limited resources in acquiring COVID-19 vaccines. As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine an optimal and equitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines that will minimize the projected number of additional COVID-19 deaths while satisfying the priority groups for immediate vaccination. METHODS: In this study, a linear programming model is formulated to determine an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are minimized while the prioritization framework set by the government is satisfied. Data used were collected up to November 2020. Total vaccine supply, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine cost, and projected deaths are analyzed. Results of the model are also compared to other allocation approaches. RESULTS: Results of the model show that a vaccine coverage of around 60-70% of the population can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in vaccine supply is beneficial if the initial coverage is less than the specified target range. Additionally, among the vaccines considered in the study, the one with 89.9% effectiveness and a 183 Philippine peso price per dose projected the lowest number of deaths. Compared with other model variations and common allocation approaches, the model has achieved both an optimal and equitable allocation. CONCLUSIONS: Having a 100% coverage for vaccination with a 100% effectiveness rate of vaccine is ideal for all countries. However, some countries have limited resources. Therefore, the results of our study can be used by policymakers to determine an optimal and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines for a country/community.","Buhat, Christian Alvin H; Lutero, Destiny S M; Olave, Yancee H; Quindala, Kemuel M; Recreo, Mary Grace P; Talabis, Dylan Antonio S J; Torres, Monica C; Tubay, Jerrold M; Rabajante, Jomar F",Appl Health Econ Health Policy,,345

A fast and accurate diagnosis in this outbreak is critical to isolate and treat patients. Radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of the patients. Among various imaging modalities, chest CT has received attention with its higher sensitivity and specificity rates. Shortcomings of the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, including inappropriate sample collection and analysis methods, initial false negative results, and limited availability has led to widespread use of chest CT in the diagnostic algorithm. This review summarizes the role of radiology in COVID-19 pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy of imaging, and chest CT findings of the disease.","Güneyli, Serkan; Atçeken, Zeynep; Dogan, Hakan; Altinmakas, Emre; Atasoy, Kayhan Çetin",Diagn Interv Radiol,,345

404420,Help-Seeking Behavior of Returning to Work in Healthcare Workers and its Influencing Factors During COVID-19 Subsiding,2020,"In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual's behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India.","Rai, Rajanish Kumar; Khajanchi, Subhas; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Venturino, Ezio; Misra, Arvind Kumar",J Appl Math Comput,,345
406313,Post-traumatic stress disorder in Australia: 2020,2020,"The current study aimed to develop a simplified version of the Korean Workaholism Scale (KOWS) by determining the reliability and validity of the Workaholism Analysis Questionnaire (WAQ) initially created by Aziz et al. The original scale of the WAQ was translated into Korean and then administered to 4,242 working people from a broad range of economic sectors. The nation-wide sample was a representative one from the 17th wave Korean Labor and Income Panel Study in 2014. The main body comprises two steps. First, through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as a reliability analysis, along with content validity examination among experts, thirteen items from the original WAQ were eliminated. The EFA yielded a four-factor solution with four items established in compulsive dependency (CD), four in illusion of control (IC), four in endurance of conflicts (EC), and four in withdrawal symptoms (WS). This process provided a succinct and convenient measure of workaholism, the KOWS with 16 items. The reliability coefficient (&#945;) of the new scale was .90, and the split-half reliability coefficient was .72. Secondly, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed by way of structural equation modeling to validate the new construct. This KOWS showed adequate convergent validity (AVE > .5), construct reliability (CR > .7), as well as discriminant validity (AVE > &#961;2). Between four subscales of the KOWS and affective commitment (AC) to organizations there proved meager correlation. In conclusion, the KOWS with 16-item psychometric properties is a valid and reliable tool to measure workaholism in South Korea.","Kang, Sudol",Psychol Rep,,345

408619,Managing Vascular Surgery Emergencies and Referrals During the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Tertiary Centre in Oman,2021,"BACKGROUND: Enrollment in time-sensitive endovascular stroke trials can be challenging because of an inability to consent a debilitated patient. Often the legally authorized representative is not on site. Remote consent procedures in the US are inconsistent with the majority of sites shunning these approaches. The current pandemic with visitor restrictions highlights the need for enhancing these options. METHODS: Remote electronic and phone consent procedures specifically for endovascular stroke trials from two comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) are presented. An overview of the genesis of informed consent procedures in the US is also included. RESULTS: The two CSCs identified as Institution-1 and Institution-2 are large tertiary systems. Institution-1 is a non-profit university-affiliated academic medical center in rural geography. Institution-2 is an HCA hospital in an urban environment. Both serve patients through a spoke-and-hub network, have participated in multiple randomized endovascular stroke trials, and have successfully used these remote options for enrollment. A tiered approach is employed at both institutions with an emphasis on obtaining informed consent in person and resorting to alternatives methods when efforts to that are unsuccessful. A rationale for electronic and phone consent is included, followed by step-by-step illustration of the process at each institution. CONCLUSION: Two examples of remote electronic or phone consent procedures from institutions in different geographic environments and organization structures demonstrate that these options can be successfully used for enrollment in stroke trials. The current pandemic highlights the need to enhance these approaches while maintaining appropriate adherence to ethical and legal frameworks.","Rai, Ansaar T; Frei, Donald",J Neurointerv Surg,,345

A fast and label-free detection method for the novel coronavirus needs to be developed along with the existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods. AREAS COVERED: In this report, biophysical aspects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein are outlined based on its recent reported electron microscopy structure. Protein binding sites are analyzed theoretically, which consisted of hydrophobic and positive charged amino acid residues. Different strategies to form mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of hydrophobic (CH3) and negatively charged (COOH) groups are discussed to be used for the specific and strong interactions with spike protein. Bio-interfacial interactions between the spike protein and device (sensor) surface and its implications toward designing suitable engineered surfaces are summarized. EXPERT OPINION: Implementation of the engineered surfaces in quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)-based detection techniques for the diagnosis of the novel coronavirus from oral swab samples is highlighted. The proposed strategy can be explored for the label-free and real-time detection with sensitivity up to ng level.

413069,Psychological symptoms among frontline healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originally emerged from Hubei province, Wuhan, China, and has caused a worldwide pandemic with millions affected since December 2019. Since the first case of SARS-CoV-2 reported on 27th Jan 2020 in India, over 11 million people have been affected by the virus in the country in the past one year. To understand its demographic distribution, in this study we carried out the early distribution of clades and subclades state-wise based on the analysis of shared mutations in Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected during the period 27th Jan - 27th May 2020. A total of 1279 mutations have been identified in 685 Indian isolates during this period. Principal component analysis on the mutational profile of Indian isolates revealed clusters corresponding to Nextstrains clades and some state-specific clusters. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates indicates multiple independent sources of introduction of the virus in the country. It is observed that clade 20A defining mutations C241T (ORF1ab: 5'UTR), C3037T (ORF1ab: F924F), C14408T (ORF1ab: P4715L), and A23403G (S: D614G) are the predominant mutation set in Indian isolates during this period. Higher number of coronavirus cases were observed in certain states, viz., Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. Genetic analysis of isolates from these states revealed a cluster with shared mutations, C6312A (ORF1ab: T2016K), C13730T (ORF1ab: A4489V), C23929T, and C28311T (N: P13L). Contact tracing led the spread of this cluster to a super spreader event, the Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation, and the efficacy of lockdown in containing it. Analysis of region-specific shared mutations carried out to understand the large number of deaths in Gujarat and Maharashtra identified shared mutations defining subclade, I/GJ-20A (C18877T, C22444T, G25563T (ORF3a: H57Q), C26735T, C28854T (N: S194L), C2836T) in Gujarat and two sets of co-occurring mutations C313T, C5700A (ORF1ab: A1812D) and A29827T, G29830T in Maharashtra.

We aimed to assess the psychological impact during the COVID-19 outbreak period(OP) and remission period(RP) among medical students. Methods: We surveyed the medical students in Shantou University Medical College twice-during the OP and the RP, surveying psychological burden of COVID-19 lockdowns and its associated factors. 1069 respondents were recruited in OP and 1511 participants were recruited in RP. We constructed nomograms to predict the risk of psychological burden using risk factors that were screened through univariate analysis of the surveyed data set. Results: There was a statistically significant longitudinal increment in psychological burden from OP to RP, and stress as well as cognition in psychological distress were the most dominant ones. Common impact factors of the depression, anxiety and stress included frequency of outdoor activities, mask-wearing adherence, self-perceived unhealthy status and exposure to COVID-19. In addition, the high frequency of handwashing was a protective factor for depression and anxiety. The C-index was 0.67, 0.74 and 0.72 for depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Conclusion: The psychological impact of COVID-19 was worse during the RP than during the OP. Thus, it's necessary to continue to emphasize the importance of mental health in medical students during the pandemic and our proposed nomograms can be useful tools for screening high-risk groups for psychological burden risk in medical students.","Zhang, Kaiting; Lin, Zeting; Peng, Yixiang; Li, Liping",European journal of psychiatry,,345
414150,COVID-19 had little financial impact on publicly traded nursing home companies,2021,"Unauthorised posters stuck on public walls and street furniture contribute to a sense of place in ways that transcend their usual characterisation as unwanted graffiti and visual pollution. They are a common sight in Newtown-Enmore, a destination precinct of Sydney, Australia. In September-October 2020, at a time when COVID-19 restrictions were easing, I found that many of the fly-posters in this district related to COVID-19 either directly or indirectly. While some advertised entertainment venues, most were political, their messages ranging through leftist, anarchist and conspiracy theorist propaganda. This visual essay documents not only the posters themselves but also evidence of public engagement with them. It captures a two-way battle that was being waged, with people ripping some posters down or writing over them, and in return, bill posters pasting up new notices condemning the defacers. The effect of this heightened flyposter activity was to bring about change to the local streetscape in a remarkable but subtle way.

416836,Prognostic accuracy of emergency department triage tools for adults with suspected COVID-19: the PRIEST observational cohort study,2021,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous innovative engineering design solutions, several of which leverage the rapid prototyping and manufacturing capabilities of additive manufacturing. This paper aims to study a subset of these solutions for their utilization of design for AM (DfAM) techniques and investigate the effects of DfAM utilization on the creativity and manufacturing efficiency of these solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This study compiled 26 COVID-19-related solutions designed for AM spanning three categories: (1) face shields (N = 6), (2) face masks (N = 12) and (3) hands-free door openers (N = 8). These solutions were assessed for (1) DfAM utilization, (2) manufacturing efficiency and (3) creativity. The relationships between these assessments were then computed using generalized linear models to investigate the influence of DfAM utilization on manufacturing efficiency and creativity. Findings: It is observed that (1) unique and original designs scored lower in their AM suitability, (2) solutions with higher complexity scored higher on usefulness and overall creativity and (3) solutions with higher complexity had higher build cost, build time and material usage. These findings highlight the need to account for both opportunistic and restrictive DfAM when evaluating solutions designed for AM. Balancing the two DfAM perspectives can support the development of solutions that are creative and consume fewer build resources. Originality/value: DfAM evaluation tools primarily focus on AM limitations to help designers avoid build failures. This paper proposes the need to assess designs for both, their opportunistic and restrictive DfAM utilization to appropriately assess the manufacturing efficiency of designs and to realize the creative potential of adopting AM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Prabhu, R.; Masia, J.

The methodology combines labor market data with simulation of an agent-based model. We apply our methodology to the Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile. We recover the model parameters from observed data, taking into account the recurring policy adjustments that characterized the study window. The model is used to build counterfactual scenarios. We estimate an 8 percent output loss in the first 5 months of the pandemic from the policy that was put in place, achieving a 56 percent reduction in the total number of infections. During this period, with an output loss to 10.5 percent of GDP, the infection rate would have decreased 92 percent, significantly delaying the spread of COVID and spike in infections. Our methodology applied to real data provided results that could be valuable in guiding policies in other lockdown situations in times of disaster, pandemics or social upheaval.","Fosco, Constanza; Zurita, Felipe",PLoS One,,345

The SICE CLOUD19 Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) play a transdiagnostic role in emotional disorders, but the role of these strategies in coping with emotions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains poorly understood. AIMS: To assess the presence of emotional disorders in Spain and the association to sociodemographic characteristics and CERS during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: Cross-sectional survey administered through an online platform. Sociodemographic variables and CERS (CERQ-Short) were collected and possible diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, GAD-7), major depression disorder (MDD; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), panic attacks (PA; PHQ-PD), and panic disorders (PD; PHQ-PD) were assessed. Sociodemographic risk factors and CERS association to the possible diagnosis of emotional disorders were reported with hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1,753 respondents completed the questionnaire in Spain. Of these, most (76.8%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 years (12.9). A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD, 12.2% for MDD, 17.2% for PD, and 25.7% had experienced a PA. The contribution of sociodemographic variables to diagnoses of emotional disorders was modest, explaining from 3.1% to 5.7% of the variance; however, when CERS were added, the combination of sociodemographic and CERS explained from 15% to 29% of the variance. Rumination and catastrophizing were the most transdiagnostic maladaptive strategies and positive refocusing was another adaptive strategy. DISCUSSION: Although results from convenience samples should be handled with caution, the high prevalence of emotional disorders in this study suggests that the demand of mental health interventions will probably increase in Spain. Also, CERS play a clear role in the presence of these disorders. CONCLUSION: Intervention programs should focus on training CERS in populations at high risk, focusing on the reduction of maladaptive CERS and the reinforce of other more adaptive CERS.","Muñoz-Navarro, Roger; Cano Vindel, Antonio; Schmitz, Florian; Cabello, Rosario; Fernández-Berrocal, Pablo",Health Educ Behav,,345

The SICE CLOUD19 Study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world for more than a year, with multiple waves of infections resulting in morbidity, mortality and disruption to the economy and society. Response measures employed to control it have generally been effective but are unlikely to be sustainable over the long term. METHODS: We examined the evidence for a vaccine-driven COVID-19 exit strategy including academic papers, governmental reports and epidemiological data, and discuss the shift from the current pandemic footing to an endemic approach similar to influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases. RESULTS: A desired endemic state is characterised by a baseline prevalence of infections with a generally mild disease profile that can be sustainably managed by the healthcare system, together with the resumption of near normalcy in human activities. Such an endemic state is attainable for COVID-19 given the promising data around vaccine efficacy, although uncertainty remains around vaccine immunity escape in emergent variants of concern. Maintenance of non-pharmaceutical interventions remains crucial until high vaccination coverage is attained to avoid runaway outbreaks. It may also be worthwhile to de-escalate measures in phases, before standing down most measures for an endemic state. If a variant that substantially evades immunity emerges, it will need to be managed akin to a new disease threat, with pandemic preparedness and response plans. CONCLUSION: An endemic state for COVID-19, characterised by sustainable disease control measures, is likely attainable through vaccination.","Wei, W. E.; Tan, W. K.; Cook, A. R.; Hsu, L. Y.; Teo, Y.

422524,Full PPE in the nursing home,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Ecuador is among the worst-hit countries in the world by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In terms of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants, as of October 22, Ecuador ranks fourth in the Americas and ninth worldwide according to data from the World Health Organization. In this report, we estimate excess deaths due to any cause in Ecuador since the start of the lockdown measures on March 17, 2020 until October 22, 2020. METHODS: Estimates of excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes and estimates of expected deaths from all causes. Expected deaths were estimated for the period March 17-October 22, 2020 from forecasts of an ARIMA model of order (3,0,1) with drift which was applied to daily mortality data for the period from January 1, 2014 to March 16, 2020. RESULTS: The number of all-cause excess deaths in Ecuador was estimated to be 36,922 (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 32,314-42,696) during the study period. The peak in all-cause excess mortality in Ecuador may have occurred on April 4, 2020, with 909 excess deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the real impact of the pandemic in Ecuador was much worse than that indicated by reports from national institutions. Estimates of excess mortality might provide a better approximation of the true COVID-19 death toll. These estimates might capture not only deaths directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic but also deaths from other diseases that resulted from indirect effects of the pandemic.","Cevallos-Valdiviezo, Holger; Vergara-Montesdeoca, Allan; Zambrano-Zambrano, Gema",Int J Infect Dis,,345

424579,The Association Between BMI and Inpatient Mortality Outcomes in Older Adults With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often continue to test positive for the causative virus by PCR even after clinical recovery, thereby complicating return-to-work plans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time. METHODS: Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycle (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. Association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of 0.05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve. RESULTS: Over six weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-severe COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by two or three days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. The vast majority of the viral load-time AUC lies within 10 days of symptom onset.","Shrestha, Nabin K; Marco Canosa, Francisco; Nowacki, Amy S; Procop, Gary W; Vogel, Sherilynn; Fraser, Thomas G; Erzurum, Serpil C; Terpeluk, Paul; Gordon, Steven M",Clin. infect. dis,,345
424583,Clinical Informatics Training During Emergency Medicine Residency: The University of Michigan Experience,2020,"Objective: Clinical and laboratory biomarkers to predict the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are essential in this pandemic situation of which resource allocation must be urgently prepared especially in the context of respiratory support readiness. Lymphocyte count has been a marker of interest since the first COVID-19 publication. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the association of lymphocyte count on admission and the severity of COVID-19. We would also like to analyze whether patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities affect the relationship between lymphocyte count and COVID-19. Methods: Comprehensive and systematic literature search was performed from PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC, ProQuest, Cochrane Central Databases, and Google Scholar. Research articles in adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with information on lymphocyte count and several outcomes of interest, including mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) care, and severe COVID-19, were included in the analysis. Inverse variance method was used to obtain mean differences and its standard deviations. Maentel-Haenszel formula was used to calculate dichotomous variables to obtain odds ratios (ORs) along with its 95% confidence intervals. Random-effect models were used for meta-analysis regardless of heterogeneity. Restricted-maximum likelihood random-effects meta-regression was performed for age, gender, cardiac comorbidity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and smoking. Results: There were a total of 3099 patients from 24 studies. Meta-analysis showed that patients with poor outcome have a lower lymphocyte count (mean difference - 361.06 μL [- 439.18, - 282.95], p &lt; 0.001; I 284%) compared to those with good outcome. Subgroup analysis showed lower lymphocyte count in patients who died (mean difference - 395.35 μL [- 165.64, - 625.07], p &lt; 0.001; I 287%), experienced ARDS (mean difference - 377.56 μL [- 271.89, - 483.22], p &lt; 0.001; I 20%), received ICU care (mean difference - 376.53 μL [- 682.84, - 70.22], p = 0.02; I 289%), and have severe COVID-19 (mean difference - 353.34 μL [- 250.94, - 455.73], p &lt; 0.001; I 285%). Lymphopenia was associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 3.70 [2.44, 5.63], p &lt; 0.001; I 240%). Meta-regression showed that the association between lymphocyte count and composite poor outcome was affected by age (p = 0.034). Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed that lymphopenia on admission was associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Ian; Pranata, Raymond",J. Intensive Care,,345

Asian respondents were especially likely to have talked about the pandemic with friends, whereas one-fourth of respondents globally had talked about the pandemic with their family. Our data on the correlation indicates that these conversations may increase existing rates of anxiety. Practitioners need to be mindful that rumors spread rapidly during periods of pandemic danger, with significant risks of both emotional and physical ‘contagion’ amongst individuals. Any rise in anxiety may lead to sudden changes in behavior, which can quickly lead to shortages and can enhance the need for treatment at home.","Singh, D.; Prusty, S. K.; Sarangi, S.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in 304 inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2DM) subjects with two oral antidiabetic drugs (glimepiride 4 mg and metformin 500 mg) were randomised to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg once daily (OD) or placebo. Dose of hydroxychloroquine was selected as per body weight of the subject. Primary end point was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change at week 12 from baseline. Secondary endpoint was change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post prandial plasma glucose (PPG), body weight and any adverse reaction including no of hypoglycemic events, as well as a change in the percentage of subjects with A1C < 7.0% and > 6.5% after 12 weeks of treatment.. In follow-up of 400 mg once daily was once again divided to 200 mg twice daily (BD) to study the effect on tolerability profile for further 12 weeks. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine was associated with significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (7-8.5%) in 12 weeks -0.78%, -0.91% and 1.2% for hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg OD, respectively, versus 0.13% with placebo (P < 0.005). FPG and PPG were reduced by -25 to -38 mg/dl and 34-53 mg/dl, respectively. Body weight also reduced in each group of HCQ. Hypoglycemia was reported only with 300 mg (1.2%) and 400 mg (2.1%) group of HCQ. It was observed that patients who complains with mild GI disturbance with HCQ 400 mg glycemic efficacy was maintained with 200 mg BD with significant relief of the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Hydroxychloroquine added to sulphonylurea and metformin, improves glycemic control significantly in T2DM patients. Glycemic effect of different dose of hydroxychloroquine is dose dependent. The safety/tolerability profile of hydroxychloroquine was favourable except GI disturbance which is more frequent with 400 mg. This can be avoided with 200 mg BD without compromise on efficacy.","Chakravarti, H N; Nag, A",J. endocrinol. invest,,345

432189,Three months of informational trends in COVID-19 across New York City,2020,"AIMS: Natriuretic peptides are extensively studied biomarkers for atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF). Their role in the pathogenesis of both diseases is not entirely understood and previous studies several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the NPPA-NPPB locus associated with natriuretic peptides have been identified. We investigated the causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and AF as well as HF using a Mendelian randomization approach. METHODS AND RESULTS: N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (N = 6669), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (N = 6674), and mid-regional pro atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) (N = 6813) were measured in the FINRISK 1997 cohort. N = 30 common SNPs related to NT-proBNP, BNP, and MR-proANP were selected from studies. We performed six Mendelian randomizations for all three natriuretic peptide biomarkers and for both outcomes, AF and HF, separately. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on multiple SNPs were used as genetic instrumental variable in Mendelian randomizations. Polygenic risk scores were significantly associated with the three natriuretic peptides. Polygenic risk scores were not significantly associated with incident AF nor HF. Most cardiovascular risk factors showed significant confounding percentages, but no association with PRS. A causal relation except for small causal betas is unlikely. CONCLUSION: In our Mendelian randomization approach, we confirmed an association between common genetic variation at the NPPA-NPPB locus and natriuretic peptides. A strong causal relationship between natriuretic peptides and incidence of AF as well as HF at the community-level was ruled out. Therapeutic approaches targeting natriuretic peptides will therefore very likely work through indirect mechanisms.","Geelhoed, Bastiaan; Börschel, Christin S; Niiranen, Teemu; Palosaari, Tarja; Havulinna, Aki S; Fouodo, Césaire J K; Scheinhardt, Markus O; Blankenberg, Stefan; Jousilahti, Pekka; Kuulasmaa, Kari; Zeller, Tanja; Salomaa, Veikko; Schnabel, Renate B",Europace,,345

The G614 strain and its recent variants are now the dominant circulating forms. Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of a full-length G614 S trimer, which adopts three distinct prefusion conformations that differ primarily by the position of one receptor-binding domain. A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer-effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity-and to modulate structural rearrangements for membrane fusion.

433396,Measuring Patient Trust in Public versus Private Physicians in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA),2021,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 began in December 2019 and rapidly became a pandemic. The present study investigated the significance of lymphopenia on disease severity. A total of 115 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a tertiary hospital in Changsha, China, were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data were gathered and compared between patients with and without lymphopenia. The median age was 42 years (1-75). Fifty-four patients (47.0%) of the 115 patients had lymphopenia on admission. More patients in the lymphopenia group had hypertension (30.8% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.006) and coronary heart disease (3.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.029) than in the nonlymphopenia group, and more patients with leukopenia (48.1% vs 14.8%, P<0.001) and eosinopenia (92.6% vs 54.1%, P<0.001) were observed. Lymphopenia was also correlated with severity grades of pneumonia (P<0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P = 0.0014). Lymphopenia was associated with a prolonged duration of hospitalization (17.0 days vs. 14.0 days, P = 0.002). Lymphocyte recovery appeared the earliest, prior to CRP and chest radiographs, in severe cases, which suggests its predictive value for disease improvement. Our results demonstrated the clinical significance of lymphopenia for predicting the severity of and recovery from COVID-19, which emphasizes the need to dynamically monitor lymphocyte count.","Liu, Jiheng; Li, Heng; Luo, Ming; Liu, Jiyang; Wu, Lingzhen; Lin, Xianfeng; Li, Ruijuan; Wang, Zhihua; Zhong, Haiying; Zheng, Wenli; Zhou, Yan; Jiang, Dixuan; Tan, Xin; Zhou, Zhiguo; Peng, Hongling; Zhang, Guangsen",PLoS One,,345
433531,Implementing testing approaches for SARS-CoV-2 to address health disparities: lessons learned from sexually transmitted infections,2020,"The Public-Private-People partnership (4P) is a significant element in disaster response. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic has been the worst disaster in the last decades in Iran in terms of exposure and magnitude. In order to respond effectively, the Iranian Government needs an extra capacity, which may be provided by the private sector and people. This study aims to collect evidences of 4P pertaining to the COVID-19 response in Iran from February to April 2020. Partnership case studies are classified into 3 categories: (1) Public-private partnerships; (2) public-people partnerships; and (3) private-people partnerships. It was found that the Iranian Government has removed or diminished some of the barriers to cooperation. There was also more cooperation between the people, the private sector, and the public sector than during normal times (vs disasters). People participated in the response procedure through some associations or groups, such as religious and ethnic communities, as well as through non-governmental organizations. It has been shown that 4P is vital in disaster response and, in particular, to epidemics. The government can be more active in partnerships with the private sector and people in emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Enhancing social capital, institutionalization, and developing required infrastructures by the government will improve public-private partnerships.","Seddighi, Hamed; Seddighi, Sadegh; Salmani, Ibrahim; Sharifi Sedeh, Mehrab",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,345

In this article, we assessed tests as a policy instrument and policy enactment to contain COVID-19 and potentially reduce mortalities. STUDY DESIGN: A model was devised to estimate the factors that influenced the death rate across 121 nations and by income group. RESULTS: Nations with a higher proportion of people aged 65+ years had a higher fatality rate (P = 0.00014). Delaying policy enactment led to a higher case fatality rate (P = 0.0013). A 10% delay time to act resulted in a 3.7% higher case fatality rate. This study found that delaying policies for international travel restrictions, public information campaigns, and testing policies increased the fatality rate. Tests also impacted the case fatality rate, and nations with 10% more cumulative tests per million people showed a 2.8% lower mortality rate. Citizens of nations who can access more destinations without the need to have a prior visa have a significant higher mortality rate than those who need a visa to travel abroad (P = 0.0040). CONCLUSION: Tests, as a surrogate of policy action and earlier policy enactment, matter for saving lives from pandemics as such policies reduce the transmission rate of the pandemic.","Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A; Tsigaris, Panagiotis",Public Health,,345

444306,Recommendations for the management of COVID-19 pandemic in long-term care facilities,2021,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the world health organization. In Turkey, the first cases began to appear on March 11, 2020. After the cases in China, the appearance of ground glass with or without consolidation in the posterior and periphery of the bilateral lung is determined as the main finding of COVID-19. In this article, we wanted to share the tomography findings of eight patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in our emergency department and who had lung involvement.","Ozkan, Seda; Tutar, Onur; Akdeniz, Yonca Senem; Cakmak, Fatih; Ipekci, Afsin; Biberoglu, Serap",Acta Biomed,,345
444307,[Recommendations for the management of COVID-19 pandemic in long term care facilities],2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people's health and wellbeing globally. In the pandemic, parks, gardens and other local green spaces have been recognised as vital to people's physical and mental health. Emerging global evidence shows increased access to local parks and recreational activities and a new appreciation of the natural surroundings. Various movements and organisations globally have called for actions to embrace recent trends and changes in relation to the planning of public spaces and urban built environments to enable better access to parks and nature. The crisis, however, has exposed the inequities around access to green space where vulnerable populations such as older people and those in low socioeconomic areas are particularly affected. The crisis presents an opportunity to positively impact on society, and an opportunity to consolidate new emerging trends to better integrate nature into the architecture, infrastructure, and public spaces of urban areas.","Levinger, Pazit; Cerin, Ester; Milner, Colin; Hill, Keith D",Int J Environ Health Res,,345
444309,Recommendations for the management of COVID-19 pandemic in long-term care facilities,2021,"BACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients, undetected co-infections may have severe clinical implications associated with increased hospitalization, varied treatment approaches and mortality. Therefore, we investigated the implications of viral and bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal samples were obtained from 48 COVID-19 patients (29% ICU and 71% non-ICU) and screened for the presence of 24 respiratory pathogens using six multiplex PCR panels. RESULTS: We found evidence of co-infection in 34 COVID-19 patients (71%). Influenza A H1N1 (n = 17), Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 13) and human adenovirus (n = 10) were the most commonly detected pathogens. Viral co-infection was associated with increased ICU admission (r = 0.1) and higher mortality (OR 1.78, CI = 0.38-8.28) compared to bacterial co-infections (OR 0.44, CI = 0.08-2.45). Two thirds of COVID-19 critically ill patients who died, had a co-infection; and Influenza A H1N1 was the only pathogen for which a direct relationship with mortality was seen (r = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the importance of screening for co-infecting viruses in COVID-19 patients, that could be the leading cause of disease severity and death. Given the high prevalence of Influenza co-infection in our study, increased coverage of flu vaccination is encouraged to mitigate the transmission of influenza virus during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and reduce the risk of severe outcome and mortality.","Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Hamed, Maaweya E; Alkadi, Haitham S; Alanazi, Thamer; Al Rehily, Sanaa Saad; Almutairi, Abdullah Z; Zafar, Adnan",Virol J,,345

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed English and US-based tweets containing ""coronavirus"" between January 23-March 24, 2020 using the Twitter API. Tweets containing keywords were grouped into six social distancing facets: implementation, purpose, social disruption, adaptation, positive emotions, and negative emotions. RESULTS: A total of 259,529 unique tweets were included in the analyses. Social distancing tweets became more prevalent from late January to March but were not geographically uniform. Early facets of social distancing appeared in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle: the first cities impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Tweets related to the ""implementation"" and ""negative emotions"" facets largely dominated in combination with topics of ""social disruption"" and ""adaptation"", albeit to lesser degree. Social disruptiveness tweets were most retweeted, and implementation tweets were most favorited. DISCUSSION: Social distancing can be defined by facets that respond to and represent certain events in a pandemic, including travel restrictions and rising case counts. For example, Miami had a low volume of social distancing tweets but grew in March corresponding with the rise of COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: The evolution of social distancing facets on Twitter reflects actual events and may signal potential disease hotspots. Our facets can also be used to understand public discourse on social distancing which may inform future public health measures.","Kwon, Jiye; Grady, Connor; Feliciano, Josemari T; Fodeh, Samah J",J Biomed Inform,,345

METHODS: Ecological study conducted from 01/01 to 06/30 of 2019 and 2020. Population and mortality data were obtained from DATASUS. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) by age was calculated by comparing the standardized mortality rate in 2020 to that of 2019, for overall and specific mortality. The ratio between the standardized mortality rate due to COVID-19 in men as compared to women was calculated for 2020. Crude mortality rates were standardized using the direct method. RESULTS: COVID-19 was responsible for 94.4% of the excess deaths in São Paulo. In 2020 there was an increase in overall mortality observed among both men (SMR 1.3, 95% CI 1.17-1.42) and women (SMR 1.2, 95% CI 1.06-1.36) as well as a towards reduced mortality for all cancers. Mortality due to COVID-19 was twice as high for men as for women (SMR 2.1, 95% CI 1.67-2.59). There was an excess of deaths observed in men above 45 years of age, and in women from the age group of 60 to 79 years. CONCLUSION: There was an increase in overall mortality during the first six months of 2020 in São Paulo, which seems to be related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the associations between demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and systemic factors, with COVID-19 awareness, knowledge, preparedness, well-being and digital health service acceptance. The average perception score on the seriousness of COVID-19 was 7.6 ± 2.4 (out of 10). 75.5% of participants were aware that COVID-19 carriers can be asymptomatic. Nearly all (&#8805; 90%) were aware of major prevention methods for COVID-19 (i.e. wearing of mask, social distancing). 66.2% felt prepared for the pandemic, and 86.8% felt confident with government's handling and measures. 78.4% felt their daily routine was impacted. 98.1% reported no prior experience in using digital health services, but 52.2% felt these services would be helpful to reduce non-essential contact. 77.8% were uncomfortable with artificial intelligence software interpreting their medical results. In multivariable analyses, Chinese participants felt less prepared, and more likely felt impacted by COVID-19. Older and lower income participants were less likely to use digital health services. In conclusion, we observed a high level of awareness and knowledge on COVID-19. However, acceptance towards digital health service was low. These findings are valuable for examining the effectiveness of COVID-19 communication in Singapore, and the remaining gaps in digital health adoption among elderly.","Teo, Cong Ling; Chee, Miao Li; Koh, Kai Hui; Tseng, Rachel Marjorie Wei Wen; Majithia, Shivani; Thakur, Sahil; Gunasekeran, Dinesh Visva; Nusinovici, Simon; Sabanayagam, Charumathi; Wong, Tien Yin; Tham, Yih-Chung; Cheng, Ching-Yu",Sci Rep,,345

This article provides recommendations on the management of different stages of localized or metastatic prostate cancer (PC) amid this pandemic. METHODS: The Hong Kong Urological Association and Hong Kong Society of Uro-oncology formed a joint discussion panel, which consisted of six urologists and six clinical oncologists with extensive experience in the public and private sectors. Following an evidence-based approach, the latest relevant publications were searched and reviewed, before proceeding to a structured discussion of relevant clinical issues. RESULTS: The joint panel provided recommendations for PC management during the pandemic, in terms of general considerations, diagnostic procedures, different disease stages, treatment modules, patient support, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The overall goal was to minimize the risk of infection while avoiding unnecessary delays and compromises in management outcomes. Practical issues during the pandemic were addressed such as the use of invasive diagnostic procedures, robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, hypofractionated radiotherapy, and prolonged androgen deprivation therapy. The recommendations were explicated in the context of Hong Kong, a highly populated international city, in relation to the latest international guidelines and evidence.

448354,Refining Telemedicine: A Plea From Healthcare Workers During a Pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Studies suggest a significant reduction in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Few studies have examined AIS hospitalizations, treatments, and outcomes during the pandemic period. The present study compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients hospitalized with AIS before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (weeks 11-24 in 2019 vs. 2020). Method: We identified 42,371 admissions with a clinical diagnosis of AIS, from 370 participating hospitals who contributed data during weeks 11-24 in both 2019 and 2020 to the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program (PCNASP). Results: During weeks 11-24 of the COVID-19 period, AIS hospitalizations declined by 24.5% compared to the same period in 2019 (18,233 in 2020 vs. 24,138 in 2019). In 2020, the percentage of individuals aged &lt;65 years who were hospitalized with AIS was higher compared with the same period in 2019 (34.6% vs. 32.7%, p&lt;0.001);arriving by EMS were higher in 2020 compared with 2019 (47.7% vs. 44.8%, p&lt;0.001). Individuals admitted with AIS in 2020 had a higher mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score compared with 2019 (6.7 vs. 6.3, p&lt;0.001). In 2020, the in-hospital death rates increased by 16% compared to 2019 (5.0% vs. 4.3%, p&lt;0.001). However, there were no differences in rates of alteplase use, achievement of door to needle in 60 minutes, or complications from reperfusion therapy between the two time periods. Conclusion: A higher percentage of younger (&lt;65 years) individuals and more severe AIS cases were admitted to the participating hospitals during weeks 11 to 24 of the COVID-19 pandemic in2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The AIS in-hospital death rate increased 16% during the pandemic weeks as compared to the same weeks in 2019.

The widespread use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed telemedicine beyond diabetes care and into clinical areas with a paucity of published data. The evaluation and treatment of thyrotoxicosis heavily relies on laboratory assessment and imaging with physical exam playing a role to help differentiate the etiology and assess the severity of thyrotoxicosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a patient presenting for evaluation of new thyrotoxicosis via telemedicine, and describe modifications to consider for thorough, safe evaluation via telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine may be an ideal way to assess and treat patients with thyrotoxicosis who are not able to physically attend a visit with an endocrinologist but still have access to a laboratory for blood draws. Potential challenges include access to imaging and high-volume surgeons if needed. Clinical and economic outcomes of telemedicine care of thyrotoxicosis should be studied so that standards of care for endocrine telemedicine can be established.","Griffith, Michelle L; Bischoff, Lindsay A; Baum, Howard B A",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,345

Patients with COVID-19 who have been treated in the intensive care unit and have survived may be at higher risk of developing post intensive care syndrome due to factors such as limited social support, prolonged mechanical support time, high doses of sedatives, and limited physical therapy by health professionals with the patient during and after hospitalization due to the risk of disease transmission [5-6]. [...]due to the pandemic, several measures have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus, which on the one hand act beneficially, and on the other hand the way of providing health care has changed, especially to patients with chronic diseases and those who need rehabilitation after their hospitalization in the intensive care unit because many health centers have limited personal protective equipment and high risk of transmission to caregivers, with patients having limited access in health care resulting in exacerbation of post-intensive care syndrome with consequences for patients and their families [7]. Release from the ventilator becomes difficult resulting in the formation of tracheostomies causing feeding and speech problems.

However, no study has specifically evaluated the relationship between obesity and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). RESEARCH QUESTION: Is obesity associated with an increased incidence of VAP? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a post hoc analysis of the Impact of Early Enteral vs. Parenteral Nutrition on Mortality in Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation and Catecholamines (NUTRIREA2) open-label, randomized controlled trial performed in 44 French ICUs. Adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support for shock and parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition were included. Obesity was defined as BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 at ICU admission. VAP diagnosis was adjudicated by an independent blinded committee, based on all available clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data. Only first VAP episodes were taken into account. Incidence of VAP was analyzed by using the Fine and Gray model, with extubation and death as competing risks. RESULTS: A total of 699 (30%) of the 2,325 included patients had obesity; 224 first VAP episodes were diagnosed (60 and 164 in obese and nonobese groups, respectively). The incidence of VAP at day 28 was 8.6% vs 10.1% in the two groups (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI 0.63-1.14; P = .26). After adjustment on sex, McCabe score, age, antiulcer treatment, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment at randomization, the incidence of VAP remained nonsignificant between obese and nonobese patients (hazard ratio, 0.893; 95% CI, 0.66-1.2; P = .46). Although no significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, 90-day mortality was significantly lower in obese than in nonobese patients (272 of 692 [39.3%] patients vs 718 of 1,605 [44.7%]; P = .02). In a subgroup of patients (n = 123) with available pepsin and alpha-amylase measurements, no significant difference was found in rate of abundant microaspiration of gastric contents, or oropharyngeal secretions between obese and nonobese patients.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved after statin reinitiation are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine LDL-C levels after statin reinitiation. METHODS: We analyzed data from 5498 participants in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study who reported ever taking a statin. We categorized participants according to their pattern of statin use including those taking a statin who did not experience statin-associated symptoms and continued treatment, and those who discontinued statins because of statin-associated symptoms and were not reinitiated, reinitiated and remained on treatment, and discontinued treatment after being reinitiated. Mortality and vascular event reduction with statin reinitiation was estimated using data from the Cholesterol-Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, LDL-C was 14.1 (95% CI: 9.9-18.3) mg/dL higher among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those without statin-associated symptoms who continued statin therapy. Mean LDL-C was 18.1 mg/dL (95% CI: 13.0-23.1) and 27.5 mg/dL (95% CI: 20.7-34.4) lower among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those who discontinued statin therapy and were not reinitiated and those who discontinued statins after being reinitiated, respectively. An LDL-C reduction of 18.1 mg/dL with statin reinitiation was projected to reduce all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality by 5.6% and 8.9%, respectively, and myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death and major vascular events by 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively, over 5 years. CONCLUSION: Reinitiating individuals who discontinue statin therapy may reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular risk.","Tanner, Rikki M; Colantonio, Lisandro D; Kilgore, Meredith L; Mefford, Matthew T; Chachappan, Dayl T; Mues, Katherine E; Safford, Monika M; Rosenson, Robert S; Muntner, Paul",J. clin. lipidol,,345

458462,Early Success of COVID-19 Vaccines in Nursing Homes - Will it Stick?,2021,"From the beginning of this century, three coronaviruses (CoVs) have caused severe human respiratory diseases, including severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which outbroke in 2002-2003, 2012 and 2019-2020, respectively. These viruses are three different species belonging to Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus. Discovery of closely-related CoVs in bats indicates that bats are natural reservoirs of these viruses. How and when the bat CoVs cross-species barriers to infect humans are largely understudied. This article provides an overview of the distribution, genetic evolution and interspecies transmission of bat coronaviruses in China, particularly focusing on bat SARS-related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs). Our studies showed that SARS-related CoVs are highly prevalent in horseshoe bats and some of them use the same receptor as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and have wide cell tissue tropism. However, these bat viruses seem to be low pathogenic in human ACE2 transgenic mice compared with the SARS-CoV-2. These results imply that these bat CoVs have potential interspecies transmission to other animals and humans. Our work highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emerging infectious diseases caused by these CoVs.","Brugère-Picoux, Jeanne; Shi, Zhengli",Bull. acad. natl. med,,345
458594,"Corrigendum to ""Memorialisation during Covid-19: implications for the bereaved, service providers and policy makers""",2021,"Background: Mathematical modeling constitutes an important tool for planning robust responses to epidemics. This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the epidemic's time-course, forecasted health care needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions. Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12 750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak. Conclusions: Use of modeling and forecasting to guide the national response proved to be a successful strategy, reducing the toll of the epidemic to a manageable level for the health care system.","Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Seedat, Shaheen; Makhoul, Monia; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Butt, Adeel A; Coyle, Peter; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Shaik, Riyazuddin Mohammad; Rahim, Hanan Abdul; Yassine, Hadi M; Al Kuwari, Mohamed G; Al Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Al-Thani, Mohamed H; Bertollini, Roberto; Abu Raddad, Laith J",J Glob Health,,345

This study aims to summarize the immune-related factors and their association with pneumonia in children with COVID-19. METHODS: Children with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital from 28 January to 12 March 2020 were enrolled. Pneumonia due to causes other than COVID-19 were excluded. The clinical and laboratory information including routine blood tests, blood biochemistry, lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and inflammatory factors were analyzed retrospectively in 127 patients. Normal ranges and mean values of laboratory markers were applied as parameters for logistic regression analyses of their association with pneumonia. RESULTS: In nonintensive care unit patients, 48.8% and 22.4% of patients had increased levels of procalcitonin and hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) respectively. A total 12.6% and 18.1% of patients had decreased levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), respectively. Approximately 65.8% of patients had pneumonia. These patients had decreased levels of globulin (odds ratio [OR], 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-6.93; P = .005), IgA (OR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.13-14.18; P = .032), and increased levels of hs-CRP (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.34-7.36; P = .008), procalcitonin (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 2.03-7.24; P < .001), IL-10 (OR, 7.0; 95% CI, 1.59-30.80; P = .010), and CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte less than 5.0% (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.04-3.61; P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Decreased IgA and CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte percentage, and increased hs-CRP, procalcitonin, and IL-10 were associated with pneumonia, suggesting that the immune-related factors may participate in the pathogenesis of pneumonia in children with COVID-19.","Li, Yi; Deng, Wenyue; Xiong, Hao; Li, Hui; Chen, Zhi; Nie, Yingming; Wang, Zhuo; Li, Kaili; Li, Jianxin",Pediatr Pulmonol,,345

The aim of this study was to investigate the disease features of Covid-19 in Turkish children. METHODS: Children diagnosed by the method of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for Covid-19 at the Dicle University Department of Pediatric, between April and June 2020, were evaluated. Hospital records were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients children with the mean age of 108.64 ± 65.61 months were enrolled in this study. The most common cause of transmission in pediatric patients was in contact with a family member diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 91, 86.7%). The most common admission complaints were dry cough (n = 17, 16.2%), fever (n = 16, 15.2%), lassitude and fatigue (n = 14, 13.3%) respectively. More than 95% of all children with Covid-19 were asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases. CRP was identified only independent factor associated with long duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show the effect of Covid-19 on Turkish children. A clear understanding of the local epidemiology of corona virus infections and identification of risk factors are critical for the successful implementation of the prevention and control program.","Yilmaz, Kamil; Gozupirinççioglu, Ayfer; Aktar, Fesih; Akin, Alper; Karabel, Müsemma; Yolbas, Ilyas; Uzel, Veysiye Hulya; Sen, Velat",Pediatr Pulmonol,,345

Background: This paper focuses on the case study of a patient in the UK who showed - as far as we know today - all typical symptoms of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 but without dyspnoea. The diagnose was made on the basis of the symptoms, which were described by the patient, and confirmed by an antibody test in August 2020. Aim: Due to the public interest in knowing more about the cluster of symptoms and their implications for nursing, the patient and the author of this paper decided to present this case study to the professional audience. Methods: For the anamnesis, the patient's COVID-19 diary and an essay by her about her experiences with the National Health Service (NHS) were analysed and completed by information collected during a structured interview. Results: It became apparent that the nursing diagnoses ""Acute pain"" and ""Chronic pain"" stand at the forefront. These nursing diagnoses have not been discussed in the context of COVID-19 yet. Conclusions: This leads to the conclusion that nursing diagnoses, which are orientated towards an alleged lung disease, might not be complete when it comes to the complex disease process of COVID-19.

463258,COVID Positive,2021,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been employed to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), yet these measures are already having similar effects on other directly transmitted, endemic diseases. Disruptions to the seasonal transmission patterns of these diseases may have consequences for the timing and severity of future outbreaks. Here we consider the implications of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs for two endemic infections circulating in the United States of America: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza. Using laboratory surveillance data from 2020, we estimate that RSV transmission declined by at least 20% in the United States at the start of the NPI period. We simulate future trajectories of both RSV and influenza, using an epidemic model. As susceptibility increases over the NPI period, we find that substantial outbreaks of RSV may occur in future years, with peak outbreaks likely occurring in the winter of 2021-2022. Longer NPIs, in general, lead to larger future outbreaks although they may display complex interactions with baseline seasonality. Results for influenza broadly echo this picture, but are more uncertain; future outbreaks are likely dependent on the transmissibility and evolutionary dynamics of circulating strains.","Baker, Rachel E; Park, Sang Woo; Yang, Wenchang; Vecchi, Gabriel A; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,345

METHODS: This was a retrospective study at 2 affiliated New York City hospitals located in the Upper East Side and Lower Manhattan neighborhoods. We performed case reviews using the Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network framework to determine potentially preventable readmissions among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 3, 2020 (date of first case) and April 27, 2020, and readmitted to either of the 2 hospitals within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS: Among 53 readmissions after hospitalization for COVID-19, 44 (83%) were deemed not preventable and 9 (17%) were potentially preventable. Nonpreventable readmissions were mostly due to disease progression or complications of COVID-19 (37/44, 84%). Main factors contributing to potentially preventable readmissions were issues with initial disposition (5/9, 56%), premature discharge (3/9, 33%), and inappropriate readmission (1/9, 11%) for someone who likely did not require rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Most readmissions after a COVID-19 hospitalization were not preventable and a consequence of the natural progression of the disease, specifically worsening dyspnea or hypoxemia. Some readmissions were potentially preventable, mostly because of issues with disposition that were directly related to challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

467822,The performance of balance exercises during daily tooth brushing is not sufficient to improve balance and muscle strength in healthy older adults,2021,"To observe the effect of Prunella vulgaris polysaccharides (PVP) on cultured orbit fibroblasts in vitro from patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). PVP at different concentrations were used to treat different groups of fibroblasts from TAO patients and normal persons. Dexamethasone (Dex) was used as a positive control drug, and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) was used as a positive stimulant. The effects of PVP on the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts, the secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA), the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54) and apoptosis in orbital fibroblasts were determined. The experimental results showed when the concentration of PVP was greater than 400 µg/mL, it could significantly inhibit the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO (P < 0.05). However, no definite inhibitory effect was observed in the orbital fibroblasts from the normal people. Dex could significantly inhibit the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO and the normal people (P < 0.05). In contrast, every concentration of IFN-Î³ could promote the orbital fibroblasts from patients with TAO and the normal people proliferation. No groups had statistically significant stimulatory effect on HA secretion by orbital fibroblasts from normal people (P > 0.05). But the Dex group, IFN-Î³+PVP-1600 group and IFN-Î³+Dex group could significantly inhibit the secretion of HA from orbital fibroblasts of TAO patients. And there were no groups had statistically significant stimulatory effect on the expression of ICAM-1/CD54 in orbital fibroblasts from TAO patients (P > 0.05). PVP and Dex at all concentrations could significantly promote orbital fibroblast co-cultured with IFN-Î³ apoptosis (P < 0.05). But without IFN-Î³, PVP and Dex at all concentrations could only significantly promote orbital fibroblast from TAO patients apoptosis (P < 0.05). These results suggest that PVP exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting the proliferation of orbital fibroblasts and promoting the apoptosis of orbital fibroblasts in TAO patients. In addition, in this process, HA secretion is suppressed. But the participation of IFN-Î³ is required. This effect is similar to that of Dex. And in the MTT experiment, the efficacy of PVP showed selectivity for TAO patients. This is different from Dex. This may be a feature of PVP that deserves attention.","Li, Bei; Guo, Jinlin; Wang, Fang; Cheng, Shuanghua; Zeng, Liuzhi",Exp Eye Res,,345

Research QuestionAre the outcomes in patients presenting with silent hypoxia different from those presenting with dyspneic hypoxia? Study design and MethodsThis was a retrospective study of a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were hypoxic at presentation. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment parameters in patients with silent hypoxia and dyspneic hypoxia were compared. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the factors predicting mortality. ResultsAmong 2080 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, 811 patients were hypoxic with SpO2<94% at the time of presentation. 174 (21.45%) did not have dyspnea since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. 5.2% of patients were completely asymptomatic for COVID-19 and were found to be hypoxic only on pulse oximetry. The case fatality rate in patients with silent hypoxia was 45.4% as compared to 40.03% in dyspneic hypoxic patients (P=0.202). The odds ratio of death was 1.1 (95% CI 0.41-2.97) in the patients with silent hypoxia after adjusting for baseline characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment, and in-hospital complications, which did not reach statistical significance (P=0.851). InterpretationSilent hypoxia may be the only presenting feature of COVID-19. Since the case fatality rate is comparable between silent and dyspneic hypoxia, it should be recognized early and treated as aggressively. Since home isolation is recommended in patients with COVID-19, it is essential to use pulse oximetry at the home setting to identify these patients.","Sirohiya, Prashant; Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Sagiraju, Hari Krishna Raju; Baruah, Madhusmita; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Kumar, Rohit; Paul, Saurav Sekhar; Ratre, Brajesh Kumar; Singh, Ram; Kumar, Balbir; Vig, Saurabh; Pandit, Anuja; Kumar, Abhishek; Garg, Rakesh; Meena, Ved Prakash; Mittal, Saurabh; Pahuja, Saurabh; Das, Nupur; Dwivedi, Tanima; Gupta, Ritu; Kumar, Sunil; Pandey, Manisha; Mishra, Abhinav; Matharoo, Karanvir Singh; Mohan, Anant; Guleria, Randeep; Bhatnagar, Sushma",,,345
469095,Anxiety and obsession following the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a lifesaving strategy for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim to report the case series of critical patients receiving IMV in Wuhan and to discuss the timing of IMV in these patients. METHODS: Data of 657 patients admitted to emergency intensive care unit of Zhongnan Hospital and isolated isolation wards of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All medical records of 40 COVID-19 patients who required IMV were collected at different time points, including baseline (at admission), before receiving IMV, and before death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among 40 COVID-19 patients with IMV, 31 died, and 9 survived and was discharged. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62-76 years), and nonsurvivors were older than survivors. The median period from the noninvasive mechanic ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) to intubation was 7 hours (IQR, 2-42 hours) in IMV survivors and 54 hours (IQR, 28-143 hours) in IMV nonsurvivors. We observed that, when the time interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation was less than 50 hours (about 2 calendar days), together with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of less than 10 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) score of less than 100, mortality can be reduced to 60% or less. Prolonged interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation and high levels of APACHE II and PSI before intubation were associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Multiple organ damage was common among these nonsurvivors in the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early initial intubation after NIV/HFNC might have a beneficial effect in reducing mortality for critically ill patients meeting IMV indication. Considering APACHE II and PSI scores might help physicians in decision making about timing of intubation for curbing subsequent mortality.

Little is known about how outpatient caregivers perceive their working conditions during the pandemic in Germany and about the difficulties they face. The aims of this study were (1) to examine specific job demands of outpatient caregivers in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) to illuminate their job resources they can rely on and (3) to identify potential strain reactions they experience. Fifteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with outpatient caregivers working in Northern Germany in the period May-June 2020. Interviews were analyzed by using qualitative content analysis. Outpatient caregivers experienced daily mask obligation, lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) and stricter hygiene regulations as demanding during the pandemic. They also described a higher workload and emotional demands such as fear of infection or infecting others. They perceived team spirit and communication as important work-related resources. Depressive symptoms and feelings of stress were described as strain reactions. Outpatient care services need to be better prepared for sudden pandemic situations and provide their employees with sufficient PPE and education to reduce pandemic-related job demands leading to negative strain reactions.","Mojtahedzadeh, N.; Wirth, T.; Nienhaus, A.; Harth, V.; Mache, S.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,345

481202,The impact of social networks on the quality of life for youth. Experimental verification,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic continues, with a late hyperinflammatory phase. The immunosuppressive therapy used in heart transplant patients, in theory, could reduce inflammation thus benefitting patients with COVID-19. So far, however, there is still very little literature on this subject. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study. We described laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes from 11 heart transplant patients with COVID-19 assisted at Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology between March and July 2020. RESULTS: Patients with ages between 35 to 79 years, and heart transplantation occurred from 3 to 264 months. The main comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (9/11; 81.8%), hypertension (10/11; 90.9%), and chronic renal disease (6/11; 54.5%). Cyclosporine A was used in 10 (90.9%) patients, mycophenolate mofetil in 9 (81.8%), and mTOR inhibitor in 5 (45.5%). Fever and cough were observed in 8 (72.7%) patients, and dyspnea and gastrointestinal symptoms in 5 (45.5%). Lymphopenia was observed in 10 (90.9%) and thrombocytopenia in 5 (45.5%). The higher level of troponin associated with chest tomography above 50% infiltrates of ground-glass opacity (GGO) was observed in those with the worst outcomes. Nine patients needed intensive care, and hospital stay ranged from 4 to 21 days, with 2 (18.2%) patients requiring vasopressor drugs and mechanical ventilation, and three patients (27.3%) dying due to COVID-19 complications. CONCLUSION: Heart transplant patients had the similar symptoms and outcomes as general population; immunosuppressive therapy seems not to have protected them. Patients who presented higher levels of troponin and D-dimer, associated to greater GGO pulmonary infiltrates had worse outcomes. More studies with larger cohorts may clarify immunosuppressive effects on COVID-19 outcomes.","de Miranda Soriano, Rafaela Vale; Rossi Neto, Joao Manoel; Finger, Marco Aurelio; Dos Santos, Carolina Casadei; Lin-Wang, Hui Tzu",Clin Transplant,,345

481777,Lower detection rates of SARS-COV2 antibodies in cancer patients versus health care workers after symptomatic COVID-19,2020,"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Although a number of vaccines have been deployed, the continual evolution of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the virus has challenged their efficacy. In particular, the emerging variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (first detected in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, respectively) have compromised the efficacy of sera from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and immunotherapies that have received emergency use authorization1-3. One potential alternative to avert viral escape is the use of camelid VHHs (variable heavy chain domains of heavy chain antibody (also known as nanobodies)), which can recognize epitopes that are often inaccessible to conventional antibodies4. Here, we isolate anti-RBD nanobodies from llamas and from mice that we engineered to produce VHHs cloned from alpacas, dromedaries and Bactrian camels. We identified two groups of highly neutralizing nanobodies. Group 1 circumvents antigenic drift by recognizing an RBD region that is highly conserved in coronaviruses but rarely targeted by human antibodies. Group 2 is almost exclusively focused to the RBD-ACE2 interface and does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants that carry E484K or N501Y substitutions. However, nanobodies in group 2 retain full neutralization activity against these variants when expressed as homotrimers, and-to our knowledge-rival the most potent antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 that have been produced to date. These findings suggest that multivalent nanobodies overcome SARS-CoV-2 mutations through two separate mechanisms: enhanced avidity for the ACE2-binding domain and recognition of conserved epitopes that are largely inaccessible to human antibodies. Therefore, although new SARS-CoV-2 mutants will continue to emerge, nanobodies represent promising tools to prevent COVID-19 mortality when vaccines are compromised.","Xu, Jianliang; Xu, Kai; Jung, Seolkyoung; Conte, Andrea; Lieberman, Jenna; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio Cesar Cetrulo; Park, Solji; Schmidt, Fabian; Wang, Zijun; Huang, Yaoxing; Luo, Yang; Nair, Manoj S; Wang, Pengfei; Schulz, Jonathan E; Tessarollo, Lino; Bylund, Tatsiana; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Olia, Adam S; Stephens, Tyler; Teng, I-Ting; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Zhou, Tongqing; Munster, Vincent; Ho, David D; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Kwong, Peter D; Casellas, Rafael",Nature,,345

484540,[The role of advance care planning and palliative care in new york city during COVID-19 pandemic],2021,"Canadians produce a lot of food, but harvesting that food has increasingly meant relying on a growing force of temporary foreign workers (TFWs) In 2020, however, border restrictions imposed by Canadian governments to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, and perhaps the reluctance of TFWs to travel to Canada during the pandemic, have significantly impeded the use of TFWs in Canada's food-production system That has revealed the vulnerabilities of the Canadian food supply chain to globally disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the risk to a system that has, historically, provided Canadians with a stable, affordable supply of food for their local grocery stores By the end of 2019, Canada had seen a record number of TFWs employed in the agriculture sector, as the number of Canadian citizens and permanent residents employed in the industry has remained relatively stagnant and even declined However, travel restrictions imposed by Canadian governments due to the COVID-19 pandemic have coincided with a significant reduction in TFWs working in Canada in 2020 In total, there has been a 14-per-cent drop in the arrival of TFWs working in Canadian agriculture this year Producers in the secondary agricultural sector, such as meat-processing and seafood-processing facilities, had been experiencing the fastest growth in the use of TFWs until now, and have seen the greatest relative reduction in TFW arrivals in comparison to 2019 Farms, which are primary producers, have experienced the largest reduction in TFW arrivals in absolute terms Although the economic effects of the pandemic-related lockdown have put many Canadians out of work, replacing TFWs with Canadian workers may not be practicable Producers may not be able to hire Canadians willing to work on farms, ranches or in food-processing plants in sufficient numbers to make up for the shortfall in TFWs When the government of New Brunswick completely banned the entry of TFWs due to the pandemic, it did not result in a significant increase in local hiring In addition, TFWs often come with experience gained from previous years working in Canada's food sector;training Canadians to replace them requires time and resources that can jeopardize the precious time that producers have to complete seasonal seeding, harvesting, and fishing activities Policy-makers will need to consider ways to ensure that TFWs, which have become critical to Canada's food supply chain, are able to come to Canada safely and work in safe environments, in the face of the pandemic health risk This year will already be a more difficult one for producers, and future years could face similar challenges Canadians have come to rely on the use of TFWs to ensure fully stocked grocery stores carrying affordable food products If producers are increasingly unable to source international labour to produce that food, Canada's reliable and affordable food supply may be at risk [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of School of Public Policy Publications is the property of University of Calgary, School of Public Policy and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Falconer, Robert",School of Public Policy Publications,,345
485199,Older People Living in Long-Term Care Facilities and Mortality Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Preliminary Epidemiological Data and Lessons to Learn,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems, highlighting the need to better understand predictors of mortality and the impact of medical interventions. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined data from every patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to White Plains Hospital between March 9, 2020, and June 3, 2020. We used binomial logistic regression to analyze data for all patients, and propensity score matching for those treated with hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). The primary outcome of interest was inpatient mortality. RESULTS: 1,108 admitted patients with COVID-19 were available for analysis, of which 124 (11.2%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Of the 984 patients included, 225 (22.9%) died. Risk for death decreased for each day later a patient was admitted [OR 0.970, CI 0.955 to 0.985; p < 0.001]. Elevated initial C-reactive protein (CRP) value was associated with a higher risk for death at 96 hours [OR 1.007, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.006]. Hydroxychloroquine and CP administration were each associated with increased mortality [OR 3.4, CI 1.614 to 7.396; p = 0.002, OR 2.8560, CI 1.361 to 6.160; p = 0.006 respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP carried significant odds of early death. Hydroxychloroquine and CP were each associated with higher risk for death, although CP was without titers and was administered at a median of five days from admission. Randomized or controlled studies will better describe the impact of CP. Mortality decreased as the pandemic progressed, suggesting that institutional capacity for dynamic evaluation of process and outcome measures may benefit COVID-19 survival.","Sammartino, Daniel; Jafri, Farrukh; Cook, Brennan; La, Lisa; Kim, Hyemin; Cardasis, John; Raff, Joshua",PLoS One,,345

It is foreseen that the post China 6 legislation will have more stringent primary and secondary emission requirements including further reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and likely to include limits on ammonia (NH3) emissions. This study investigated the secondary emissions (i.e. N2O and NH3) of a variety of China 6 production gasoline vehicles operating under the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC) and random test standardized aggressive (RTS 95) cycle. It was found that N2O emissions were less than 5 mg/km on all these vehicles, far below the current China 6 limit (20 mg/km), however NH3 emissions varied from 2 to 48 mg/km among the production vehicles. The mechanisms of N2O and NH3 formation and their correlation with primary emissions were also investigated. Methods to reduce N2O and NH3 emissions were discussed from the perspective of catalyst system design, including substrate volume, platinum group metals (PGM), and washcoat loading. Finally, a gasoline ammonia slip catalyst (gASC) was proposed and tested on selected vehicles as an add-on device on targeting the reduction of NH3 emissions. NH3 emissions were reduced significantly reduced below 5 mg/km on the WLTC. © 2021 SAE International. All rights reserved.","Lei, Z.; Zhang, J.; Zhou, M.; Braun, C.; Schmidt, M.; Richter, J.

These variants have in common a higher transmissibility, becoming dominant within populations in a short time, and an accumulation of a high number of mutations in the spike (S) protein, especially within the amino terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations have direct implications on virus infection rates through higher affinity of S RBD for the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor. There are also signs of enhanced virulence, re-infection frequency, and increased resistance to the action of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from convalescence sera and in vaccinated individuals in regions where the variants spread dominantly. In this review, we describe the different SARS-CoV-2 variants that have thus far been identified in various parts of the world with mutational changes and biological properties as well as their impact in medical countermeasures and human health.","Gómez, Carmen Elena; Perdiguero, Beatriz; Esteban, Mariano",,,345

489284,Wellbeing of ICU patients with COVID-19,2021,"Segmenting lesion regions of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) from computed tomography (CT) images is a challenge owing to COVID-19 lesions characterized by high variation, low contrast between infection lesions and around normal tissues, and blurred boundaries of infections. Moreover, a shortage of available CT dataset hinders deep learning techniques applying to tackling COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning-based approach known as PPM-Unet to segmenting COVID-19 lesions from CT images. Our method improves an Unet by adopting pyramid pooling modules instead of the conventional skip connection and then enhances the representation of the neural network by aiding the global attention mechanism. We first pre-train PPM-Unet on COVID-19 dataset of pseudo labels containing1600 samples producing a coarse model. Then we fine-tune the coarse PPM-Unet on the standard COVID-19 dataset consisting of 100 pairs of samples to achieve a fine PPM-Unet. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method can accurately segment COVID-19 infection regions from CT images, and achieve higher performance than other state-of-the-art segmentation models in this study. It offers a promising tool to lay a foundation for quantitatively detecting COVID-19 lesions.","Ma, Yinjin; Feng, Peng; He, Peng; Ren, Yong; Guo, Xiaodong; Yu, Xiaoliu; Wei, Biao",,,345

However, the optimal duration of ECMO support and time to lung recovery remain unknown. Description: A 48-year-old Hispanic male without significant past medical history was transferred to a tertiary care high-volume ECMO center on mechanical ventilation after 11 days of progressive shortness of breath due to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was transferred heavily sedated, paralyzed, in the prone position, and with lung protective mechanical ventilation settings of 6cc/kg of ideal body weight, tidal volume of 350cc, positive end-expiratory pressure of 14 cm H2O, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 100%. His driving and plateau pressures were 13 and 27 cm H2O, respectively. Three days after intubation, his PO2/FiO2 ratio repeatedly dropped below 80 and he was placed on Vf -Vj ECMO for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During his ICU course, the patient received adjunctive therapies, including Remdesivir and Dexamethasone. He was extremely encephalopathic, resulting in a failed trial of extubation and requiring tracheostomy placement 14 days after intubation. His ECMO run was complicated by oxygenator failure and emergent exchange of ECMO circuit despite anticoagulation with bivalirudin. His course was complicated by superimposed Enterobacter pneumonia and he was treated with antibiotics. After 38 days of VV ECMO support, he showed improvement in compliance and gas exchange, indicating lung recovery. The patient was weaned successfully from ECMO and remained on mechanical ventilation for almost 30 days after decannulation. The ICU team carried out aggressive physical therapy, the patient was weaned off mechanical ventilation, his tracheostomy was decannulated, and he was discharged on 2L O2. CT at the time of discharge showed “improved aeration of both lungs” with residual lung fibrosis and bronchiectasis (Figure 1). Discussion: ARDS remains the most common indication for long-term ECMO support, which is frequently complicated by severe deconditioning, secondary infection, and vascular complications. In a stratified analysis of 127 patients who received ECMO support for respiratory failure, patient survival was 52% after being on ECMO for more than 20 days.1 Despite multiple complications, including superimposed infection and oxygenator failure, our patient showed recovery from his ARDS. He was eventually extubated and discharged from the hospital, indicating ECMO as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. VV ECMO support for COVID-19 pneumonia should be considered for all eligible patients as infection rates and continue to rise.","Merley, C. F.; Galloway, L. S.; Zaaqoq, A.

In fact, there is some evidence these medications may inhibit the cytokine storm that is theorized to cause a rapid decline seen in COVID-19. In addition, the digestive symptoms of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from the activation of IBD. We present an interesting case of a Crohn's patient inadvertently administering anti-cytokine therapy during the pre-symptomatic period of COVID-19 infection. Immune suppression during early infection with SARS-COV2 risks a poor immune response to the virus and could theoretically result in a more severe course of infection.","Okeke, Francis; Mone, Anjali; Swaminath, Arun",,,345

Catchy headlines and emotionally charged articles increase the number of readers which in turn increases ad revenue for websites. When a user consumes a large quantity of negative content, it adversely impacts the user's happiness and has a significant impact on his/her mood and state of mind.

490959,Physicians' Opinions of COVID-19 Ambulatory Care Constraints: A Survey of Sickle Cell Clinicians,2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency of major international concern. In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia known as COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients are often in need for intensive chemotherapy to induce remission that will be complicated with prolonged period of cytopenias. They are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. These patients may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anti-cancer therapy. ALL patients are at higher risk of developing life-threatening infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection and the presence of multiple risk factors in the same patient is common. Cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such pandemic on ALL patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the optimal management of ALL patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, we will address the potential challenges associated with managing ALL patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic with suggestions of some practical approaches, focusing on screening asymptomatic ALL patients, diagnostic and response evaluation and choice of chemotherapy in different scenarios and setting and use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).","Alhuraiji, Ahmad; Eldadah, Saleem; Alfraih, Feras; Pandita, Ramesh; Absi, Ahmad; Hanbali, Amr; Aljurf, Mahmoud; El Fakih, Riad",Gulf J Oncolog,,345

492213,Reply from Sun et al,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unpreceded changes to medical education. Medical students interested in urology and neurosurgery have reported concerns regarding COVID-19's effects on clinical experience and the residency application process;however, the impact amongst students interested in plastic surgery is unknown. We hypothesized that students applying into plastic surgery may experience much distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An electronic survey was developed by 3 plastic surgery residents and 2 academic plastic surgeons and later refined by 4 fourth-year medical students. Questions focused on medical education curricular changes, perceived impact on medical education, and demographics. From April-May 2020 the survey was distributed to medical students who were interested in plastic surgery. Participants were identified through plastic surgery residency program personnel and social media platforms. Results: In total, 130 of the 140 respondents reported interest in plastic surgery careers. An estimated 67% were in their clinical years or completing research year(s) before residency applications. Of the respondents, 80% believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on their medical education. Clinical-level students compared with preclinical-level students, and students applying to residency during the 2020-2021 match cycle compared with students not applying during the 2020-2021 match cycle were significantly more likely to perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as having a negative impact on their medical education (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). Conclusion: Medical students interested in plastic surgery perceive the COVID-19 pandemic as having a negative impact on their education, likely due to a reduction in clinical exposure. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

492374,Psychological resilience in frontline health care workers during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York city,2021,"BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of MG via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the largest MG data set analysed to date. METHODS: We performed GWAS meta-analysis integrating three different data sets (total of 1401 cases and 3508 controls). We carried out human leucocyte antigen (HLA) fine-mapping, gene-based and tissue enrichment analyses and investigated genetic correlation with 13 other autoimmune disorders as well as pleiotropy across MG and correlated disorders. RESULTS: We confirmed the previously reported MG association with TNFRSF11A (rs4369774; p=1.09×10-13, OR=1.4). Furthermore, gene-based analysis revealed AGRN as a novel MG susceptibility gene. HLA fine-mapping pointed to two independent MG loci: HLA-DRB1 and HLA-B. MG onset-specific analysis reveals differences in the genetic architecture of early-onset MG (EOMG) versus late-onset MG (LOMG). Furthermore, we find MG to be genetically correlated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), late-onset vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD). Cross-disorder meta-analysis reveals multiple risk loci that appear pleiotropic across MG and correlated disorders. DISCUSSION: Our gene-based analysis identifies AGRN as a novel MG susceptibility gene, implicating for the first time a locus encoding a protein (agrin) that is directly relevant to NMJ activation. Mutations in AGRN have been found to underlie congenital myasthenic syndrome. Our results are also consistent with previous studies highlighting the role of HLA and TNFRSF11A in MG aetiology and the different risk genes in EOMG versus LOMG. Finally, we uncover the genetic correlation of MG with T1D, RA, ATD and late-onset vitiligo, pointing to shared underlying genetic mechanisms.","Topaloudi, Apostolia; Zagoriti, Zoi; Flint, Alyssa Camille; Martinez, Melanie Belle; Yang, Zhiyu; Tsetsos, Fotis; Christou, Yiolanda-Panayiota; Lagoumintzis, George; Yannaki, Evangelia; Zamba-Papanicolaou, Eleni; Tzartos, John; Tsekmekidou, Xanthippi; Kotsa, Kalliopi; Maltezos, Efstratios; Papanas, Nikolaos; Papazoglou, Dimitrios; Passadakis, Ploumis; Roumeliotis, Athanasios; Roumeliotis, Stefanos; Theodoridis, Marios; Thodis, Elias; Panagoutsos, Stylianos; Yovos, John; Stamatoyannopoulos, John; Poulas, Konstantinos; Kleopa, Kleopas; Tzartos, Socrates; Georgitsi, Marianthi; Paschou, Peristera",J. medical. genet,,345

Materials and methods: This retrospective study consisted of 1874 persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 between February 7, 2020, and May 27, 2020 at Stony Brook University Hospital, New York. Two primary outcomes were ICU admission and mortality compared to COVID-19 positive patients in general hospital admission. Demographic, vitals, symptoms, imaging findings, comorbidities, and laboratory tests at presentation were collected. Predictions of mortality and ICU admission were made using machine learning with 80% training and 20% testing. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Results: A total of 635 patients were included in the analysis (age 60±11, 40.2% female). The top 6 mortality predictors were age, procalcitonin, C-creative protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer and lymphocytes. The top 6 ICU admission predictors are procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-creative protein, pulse oxygen saturation, temperature and ferritin. The best machine learning algorithms predicted mortality with 89% AUC and ICU admission with 79% AUC. Conclusion: This study identifies key independent clinical parameters that predict ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The predictive model is practical, readily enhanced and retrained using additional data. This approach has immediate translation and may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.","Hou, Wei; Zhao, Zirun; Chen, Anne; Li, Haifang; Duong, Tim Q",Int J Med Sci,,345

499786,'Reluctant pioneer': A qualitative study of doctors' experiences as patients with long COVID,2021,"CONTEXT: In the early months of the response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM) (Baltimore, Maryland) leadership reached out to faculty to develop and implement virtual clinical clerkships after all in-person medical student clinical experiences were suspended. OBJECTIVE: To develop and implement a digital slide-based virtual surgical pathology clinical elective to meet the demand for meaningful and robust virtual clinical electives in response to the temporary suspension of in-person clinical rotations at JHUSOM. DESIGN: The Virtual Surgical Pathology (VSP) elective was modeled after the in-person surgical pathology elective, to include virtual previewing and sign-out with standardized cases supplemented by synchronous and asynchronous pathology educational content. RESULTS: Validation of existing web communications technology and slide scanning systems was performed by feasibility testing. Curriculum development included drafting of course objectives and syllabus, Blackboard course site design, electronic-lecture creation, communications with JHUSOM leadership, scheduling, and slide curation. Subjectively, the weekly schedule averaged 35-40 hours to asynchronous, synchronous, and independent content, approximately 10-11 hours of which were synchronous. As of February 2021, VSP has hosted 35 JHUSOM and eight non-JHUSOM students, who have provided positive subjective and objective course feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The Johns Hopkins VSP elective provided meaningful clinical experience to 43 students in a time of immense online education need. Added benefits of implementing VSP included increased medical student exposure to pathology as a medical specialty and demonstration of how digital slides have the potential to improve standardization of the pathology clerkship curriculum.","White, Marissa J; Birkness, Jacqueline E; Salimian, Kevan J; Meiss, Alice E; Butcher, Monica; Davis, Katelynn; Ware, Alisha D; Zarella, Mark D; Lecksell, Kristen; Rooper, Lisa M; Cimino-Mathews, Ashley; VandenBussche, Christopher J; Halushka, Marc K; Thompson, Elizabeth D",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

501423,Characteristics and quality of nursing homes reporting COVID-19 admissions from hospitals,2021,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, is frequently shed in faeces during infection, and viral RNA has recently been detected in sewage in some countries. We have investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples from South-East England between 14th January and 12th May 2020. A novel nested RT-PCR approach targeting five different regions of the viral genome improved the sensitivity of RT-qPCR assays and generated nucleotide sequences at sites with known sequence polymorphisms among SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We were able to detect co-circulating virus variants, some specifically prevalent in England, and to identify changes in viral RNA sequences with time consistent with the recently reported increasing global dominance of Spike protein G614 pandemic variant. Low levels of viral RNA were detected in a sample from 11th February, 3 days before the first case was reported in the sewage plant catchment area. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration increased in March and April, and a sharp reduction was observed in May, showing the effects of lockdown measures. We conclude that viral RNA sequences found in sewage closely resemble those from clinical samples and that environmental surveillance can be used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission, tracing virus variants and detecting virus importations.","Martin, Javier; Klapsa, Dimitra; Wilton, Thomas; Zambon, Maria; Bentley, Emma; Bujaki, Erika; Fritzsche, Martin; Mate, Ryan; Majumdar, Manasi",Viruses,,345
503436,Trends in US Alcohol Consumption Frequency During the First Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the strategic changes implemented in the departmental mission to continue safe delivery of otolaryngology care and to support the broader institutional mission during the COVID-19 pandemic response. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective assessment was performed to the response and management strategy developed to transform the clinical and academic enterprise. SETTING: Large urban tertiary care referral center. RESULTS: The departmental structure was reorganized along new clinical teams to effectively meet the system directives for provision of otolaryngology care and support for inpatient cases of COVID-19. A surge deployment schedule was developed to assist frontline colleagues with clinical support as needed. Outpatient otolaryngology was consolidated across the system with conversion of the majority of visits to telehealth. Operative procedures were prioritized to ensure throughput for emergent and time-critical urgent procedures. A tracheostomy protocol was developed to guide management of emergent and elective airways. Educational and research efforts were redirected to focus on otolaryngology care in the clinical context of the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSION: Emergence of the COVID-19 global health crisis has challenged delivery of otolaryngology care in an unparalleled manner. The concerns for preserving health of the workforce while ethically addressing patient career needs in a timely manner has created significant dilemmas. A proactive, thoughtful approach that reorganizes the overall departmental effort through provider and staff engagement can facilitate the ability to meet the needs of otolaryngology patients and to support the greater institutional mission to combat the pandemic.","Batra, Pete S; LoSavio, Phillip S; Michaelides, Elias; Revenaugh, Peter C; Tajudeen, Bobby A; Al-Khudari, Samer; Husain, Inna; Papagiannopoulos, Peter; Smith, Ryan; Stenson, Kerstin M; Wiet, R Mark",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,345

Design/methodology/approach: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. The data collected conveniently from 101 health-care workers in Jordan directly managing care of individuals with COVID-19. Findings: Health-care workers have moderate-to-high level of knowledge and management skills of psychological distress related to COVID-19; means ranged from 50%–70% agreement and confidence. In general, health-care workers were able to identify mental and psychosocial health needs and priorities at a moderate level. Health-care workers knowledge had a positive and significant correlation with age (r = 0.24, p = 0.012) and years of experience (r = 0.28, p = 0.004), and a significant difference was found in their management between those who are trained on psychological first aids and those who are not (t = −3.11, p = 0.003). Practical implications: There is a need to train health-care workers to integrate psychosocial and mental health care to manage care psychological distress related to COVID-19. Originality/value: This study is emphasizing the need for mental health psychosocial support training and in integration. Health-care workers providing care to individuals with COVID-19 are not aware of mental health priorities and needs of their patients. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge adding more understanding about competencies of health-care workers providing care and their preparedness to manage care individuals with COVID-19.","Hamdan Mansour, Ayman; Al Shibi, Ahmad N.; Khalifeh, Anas H.; Hamdan Mansour, Laith A.",Ment.

513493,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the activity of the Radiological Emergency Department: the experience of the Maggiore della Carità Hospital in Novara,2021,"BACKGROUND: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. METHOD: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 risk factors, mental health risk factors, protective factors, parental perceived stress, and child abuse potential. RESULTS: Greater COVID-19 related stressors and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher parental perceived stress. Receipt of financial assistance and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic are associated with lower perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related stressors, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.","Brown, Samantha M; Doom, Jenalee R; Lechuga-Peña, Stephanie; Watamura, Sarah Enos; Koppels, Tiffany",Child Abuse Negl,,345

514430,Connecting the dots,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Analysis of the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection caused SARS-CoV-2 indicates a significant impact of hemorheological disorders on its course and outcomes. It is known that chronic cardiovascular diseases are associated with the risk of severe course and lethal outcomes both in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, in each case it is necessary to study the interaction and mutual influence of different components of the treatment program prescribed to such patients.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of coagulation activity on the course of a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and to justify the management of comorbid patients having been received novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in previously selected doses according to indications in concomitant somatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total 76 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection in patients who had been received initial therapy on an outpatient basis were analyzed. 26 patients who received NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) made up the main group and 50 - the comparison (control) group in which patients had not been administered any drugs that affect blood clotting until the episode of COVID-19. All patients have been prescribed therapy following the Provisional guidelines «Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID-19)¼ (https://static-0.minzdrav.gov.ru/system/attachments/attaches/). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The number of hospitalizations was significantly fewer in the group of patients who had been received NOACs (19 vs. 66% in the control group). No deaths or cases of severe respiratory and/or renal failure were observed in the main group, while adverse outcomes were noted in 14% of patients who had not been administered these drugs. CONCLUSION: Taking NOACs reduces the probability of severe course and adverse outcomes in the development of coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, which indicates a significant contribution of coagulation mechanisms to the pathogenesis in COVID-19. There were no indications for drug replacement and correction of anticoagulant therapy regimens in patients who received adequate therapy with oral anticoagulants for treating a non-severe form of coronavirus infection in ambulatory patient settings.","Ruzhentsova, T A; Khavkina, D A; Chukhliaev, P V; Garbuzov, A A; Ploskireva, A A",Vopr Virusol,,345

517241,A Commentary on Opium Dependence and COVID-19 in the North of Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) refers to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogen, and has spread to pandemic levels since its inception in December 2019. While several risk factors for severe presentation have been identified, the clinical course for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on maintenance hemodialysis with COVID-19 has been unclear. Previous studies have revealed that some antiviral agents may be effective against COVID-19 in the general population, but the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these agents in ESRD patients remain under investigation. Favipiravir, an antiviral agent developed for treatment of influenza, is one candidate treatment for COVID-19, but suitable dosages for patients with renal insufficiency are unknown. Here we provide a first report on the efficacy of favipiravir in a patient with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis. CASE PRESENTATION: The case involved a 52-year-old woman with COVID-19 who had been undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times a week for 3 years due to diabetic nephropathy. She had initially been treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and ciclesonide for 5 days, but developed severe pneumonia requiring invasive positive-pressure ventilation. Those antiviral agents were subsequently switched to favipiravir. She recovered gradually, and after 2 weeks was extubated once the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 fell below the limit of detection. Although concentrations of several biliary enzymes were elevated, no major adverse events were observed. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir may be an effective option for the treatment of COVID-19-infected patients with ESRD.","Koshi, Eri; Saito, Shoji; Okazaki, Masaki; Toyama, Yuki; Ishimoto, Takuji; Kosugi, Tomoki; Hiraiwa, Hiroaki; Jingushi, Naruhiro; Yamamoto, Takanori; Ozaki, Masayuki; Goto, Yukari; Numaguchi, Atsushi; Miyagawa, Yasuhiro; Kato, Io; Tetsuka, Nobuyuki; Yagi, Tetsuya; Maruyama, Shoichi",CEN case reports,,345

519151,Inspired by COVID-19: primary care of chronic diseases must also innovate,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Potentially avoidable hospitalizations are disproportionately experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and expose these groups to unnecessary iatrogenic harm (including the risk of nosocomial COVID-19) and undue financial burden. In working toward an overarching goal of eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities, it is important to understand whether and to what extent potentially avoidable hospitalizations have changed by race and ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This single-center pre-post study included patients admitted to any UCLA Health hospital for an ambulatory care-sensitive condition between March-August 2019 (prepandemic period) and March-August 2020 (postpandemic period). Investigators measured the change in the number of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (defined per the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guidelines) stratified by race and ethnicity and calculated the 95% CIs for these hospitalizations using a cluster bootstrap procedure. RESULTS: Between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020, 347 of 4,838 hospitalizations (7.2%) were potentially avoidable, compared with 557 of 6,248 (8.9%) during the same 6-month period in 2019. Potentially avoidable hospitalizations decreased by 50.3% (95% CI=41.2, 60.9) among non-Hispanic Whites but only by 8.0% (95% CI= -16.2, 39.9) among African Americans (50.3% vs 8.0%, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Racial disparities in potentially avoidable hospitalizations increased during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large urban health system. Given that the prepandemic rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations were already higher among racial and ethnic minorities, especially among African Americans, this finding should cause alarm and lead to further exploration of the complex factors contributing to these disparities.","Leuchter, Richard K; Villaflores, Chad Wes A; Norris, Keith C; Sorensen, Andrea; Vangala, Sitaram; Sarkisian, Catherine A",Am. j. prev. med,,345

522757,The Association of Nursing Home Quality Ratings and Spread of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to coronavirus pandemic, governments have ordered a nationwide isolation. In this situation, we hypothesised that people holding conspiracy beliefs are less willing to adhere to medical guidelines. Furthermore, we explored what possible factors may modify relationships between conspiracy, paranoia-like beliefs, and adherence to epidemiological guidelines. Also, we examined the prevalence of different coronavirus conspiracy beliefs. METHODS: Two independent internet studies. Study 1 used a proportional quota sample that was representative of the population of Poles in terms of gender and settlement size (n=507). Study 2 employed a convenience sample (n=840). RESULTS: Coronavirus conspiracy beliefs are negatively related to safety guidelines. Mixed results suggest that paranoia-like beliefs are related negatively to safety guidelines. Prevalence of firmly held coronavirus conspiracy beliefs is rare. Nevertheless, certain percentage of participants agree with conspiracy beliefs at least partially. Coronavirus related anxiety, trust in media, and internal motivation to isolation moderate the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and adherence to safety guidelines. Paranoia-like beliefs partially mediate between boredom and conspiracy beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Conspiracy beliefs concerning coronavirus are present in the population and are negatively related to adherence to safety guidelines. Conspiracy beliefs originate partially from boredom and paranoia proneness. Certain factors - trust in media and internal motivation to isolation - are potentially worthwhile to address to enhance adherence to safety guidelines. Non-probabilistic sampling suggests caution in interpretation of the present findings.","Kowalski, Joachim; Marchlewska, Marta; Molenda, Zuzanna; Górska, Paulina; Gaweda, Lukasz",Psychiatry Res,,345

To better understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals.","Han, Zhiyong; Battaglia, Fortunato; Terlecky, Stanley R",J. med. virol,,345

(Special Issue: Immunopsychiatry of COVID-19 pandemic.),2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics is facing material shortages and long turnaround times due to exponential increase of testing demand. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the analytic performance and handling of four rapid Antigen Point of Care Tests (AgPOCTs) I-IV (Distributors: (I) Roche, (II) Abbott, (III) MEDsan and (IV) Siemens). METHODS: 100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs. Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2-12 days). The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9-59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3-55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5-56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %-100 %). Specificity was 100 % for tests I, II (CI95 %: 96.3-100 for both tests) and IV (CI95 %: 96.3-100) and 97 % (CI95 %: 91.5-98.9) for test III. Regarding handling, test I obtained the overall highest scores, while test II was considered to have the most convenient components. Of note, users considered all assays, with the exception of test I, to pose a significant risk for contamination by drips or spills. DISCUSSION: Besides some differences in sensitivity and handling, all four AgPOCTs showed acceptable performance in high viral load samples. However, due to the significantly lower sensitivity compared to RT-qPCR, a careful consideration of pro and cons of AgPOCT has to be taken into account before clinical implementation.","Olearo, Flaminia; Nörz, Dominik; Heinrich, Fabian; Sutter, Jan Peter; Roedl, Kevin; Schultze, Alexander; Wiesch, Julian Schulze Zur; Braun, Platon; Oestereich, Lisa; Kreuels, Benno; Wichmann, Dominic; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,,345

It associates with cellular receptors to mediate infection of their target cells. Inspired by such a mechanism, an in-depth investigation into the genome sequences of S protein of SARS-CoV and its receptor are conducted thru a mathematical transformation and graphic approach. As an outcome, a novel method for visualizing the characteristic of SARS-CoV is suggested. An extensive comparison among a large number of genome sequences has proved that the characteristic thus revealed is unique for SARS-CoV. As such, the characteristic can be regarded as the fingerprint map of SARS-CoV for diagnostic usage. Moreover, the conclusion has been further supported in a real case in Guangdong province of China. The fingerprint map proposed here has the merits of clear visibility and reliability that can serve as a complementary clinical tool for detecting SARS-CoV, particularly for the cases where the results obtained by the conventional methods are uncertain or conflicted with each other.","Gao, Lei; Ding, Yong-Sheng; Dai, Hua; Shao, Shi-Huang; Huang, Zhen-De; Chou, Kuo-Chen",J Pharm Biomed Anal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0731708505006588; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0731708505006588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16289934/,345

The model is composed of the social force, purchasing strategy and infection transmission models. Specifically, we quantified the infection risk for customers while in a supermarket that depended on the number of customers, the purchase strategies and the physical layout of the supermarket. The ratio of new infections compared to sales efficiency (earned profit for customer purchases) was computed as a factor of customer density and social distance. Our results indicate that the social distance between customers is the primary factor influencing infection rate. Supermarket layout and purchasing strategy do not impact social distance and hence the spread of infection. Moreover, we found only a weak dependence of sales efficiency and customer density. We believe that our study will help to establish scientifically-based safety rules that will reduce the social price of supermarket business.","Tsukanov, Alexey A.; Senjkevich, Alexandra M.; Fedorov, Maxim V.; Brilliantov, Nikolai V.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197504/,345

These interventions impact residents’ lives, including an increase in depressive symptoms and other negative concomitants. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the experiences and perspectives of nursing home residents with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: In this study nine guideline-based interviews were conducted with residents. These were analyzed using the content-structured content analysis according to Kuckartz. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: perceptions and emotions related to the pandemic, changes and limitations due to the interventions and wishes in terms of the pandemic. The residents reported both emotional distress and not being afraid of infection and its consequences. In addition, some respondents reported unpleasant restrictions, such as wearing masks. In some cases their usefulness was critically questioned. Furthermore, various wishes of the residents in relation to the pandemic, such as leaving the nursing home, were identified. CONCLUSION: The study showed complex perceptions, changes, and wishes due to the pandemic and its interventions. Therefore, an individual approach to residents with depressive symptoms is necessary to avoid an increase in mental health problems. Against this background, there is a need for participatory implementation of health protection measures for the particularly vulnerable group of nursing home residents.","Schweighart, Roxana; Klemmt, Malte; Neuderth, Silke; Teti, Andrea",Z Gerontol Geriatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081187/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00391-021-01926-3,345
591974,Fewer presentations to metropolitan emergency departments during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-09-18,"During 2019, approximately 34,800 new HIV infections occurred in the United States (1), and it is estimated that approximately 80% of HIV transmission occurs from persons who either do not know they have HIV infection or are not receiving regular care (2). Since 2006, CDC has recommended that persons who are disproportionately affected by HIV (including men who have sex with men [MSM]) should test for HIV at least annually (3,4). However, data from multiple sources indicate that these recommendations are not being fully implemented (5,6). TakeMeHome, a novel public-private partnership to deliver HIV self-testing kits to persons seeking HIV testing in the United States, was launched during March 2020 as home care options for testing became increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiation of the program coincided with the national COVID-19 Public Health Emergency declaration, issuance of stay-at-home orders, and other restrictions that led to disruption of traditional HIV testing services. During March 31, 2020-March 30, 2021, 17 state and local health departments participating in the program allowed residents of their jurisdictions to order test kits. Marketing for TakeMeHome focused on reaching gay, bisexual, and MSM through messages and embedded links in gay dating applications. Most participants in the program reported that they had either never tested for HIV (36%) or that they had last tested >1 year before receiving their self-test kit (56%). After receiving the self-test kit, >10% of respondents reported accessing additional prevention services. Health departments can increase options for HIV testing by distributing publicly funded self-test kits to persons without proximate access to clinic-based testing or who prefer to test at home. Increased and regular HIV testing among MSM will help meet annual testing goals.","Hecht, Jen; Sanchez, Travis; Sullivan, Patrick S.; DiNenno, Elizabeth A.; Cramer, Natalie; Delaney, Kevin P.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7038a2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555001/,345

Hence, the aim of this study was to explore the challenges faced by female out-of-school adolescents in accessing sexual and reproductive health service in Bench-Sheko zone. METHODS: A community-based qualitative exploratory study was carried out from November 01/2020 to December 01/2020 among selected out-of-school adolescents residing in rural and urban districts of Bench-Sheko Zone, and healthcare professionals working in the local health centers. FGD participants and healthcare providers were purposely selected for this study. Eight focus group discussions and 8 in-depth interviews were conducted among female out-of-school adolescents, and health care professionals, respectively. RESULT: The study revealed that out-of-school adolescents encounter several challenges in accessing sexual reproductive health service which includes socio-cultural barriers, health system barriers, perceived legal barrier, inadequate information regarding sexual reproductive health service, and low parent-adolescent communication. CONCLUSION: The finding suggests the need to engage community influencers (religious leaders, community leaders, and elders) in overcoming the socio-cultural barriers. Program planners and policy makers have better make an effort to create adolescent friendly environments in SRH service areas. Furthermore, implementing community-based awareness raising programs, parental involvement in sexual reproductive health programs, and encouraging parent-adolescent communication on sexual reproductive health issues could improve sexual reproductive health service utilization by out-of-school adolescents in the study area.","Hailemariam, Shewangizaw; Gutema, Lidiya; Agegnehu, Wubetu; Derese, Msganaw",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032169/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211018936,345

About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.","Fu, Binqing; Xu, Xiaoling; Wei, Haiming",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290839/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3,345

This covers the first and the second waves in Jordan. The data were obtained from both the Jordanian Ministry of health and the Jordan Metrological Department. In this work, the Spearman correlation test was used for data analysis, since the normality assumption was not fulfilled. It was found that the most effective weather parameters on the active cases of COVID-19 in the initial wave transmission was the average daily solar radiation (r = − 0.503; p = 0.000), while all other tests for other parameters failed. In the second wave of COVID-19 transmission, it was found that the most effective weather parameter on the active cases of COVID-19 was the maximum temperature (r = 0.394; p = 0.028). This was followed by wind speed (r = 0.477; p = 0.007), pressure (r = − 0.429; p = 0.016), and average daily solar radiation (r = − 0.757; p = 0.000). Furthermore, the independent variable importance of multilayer perceptron showed that wind speed has a direct relationship with active cases. Conversely, areas characterized by low values of pressure and daily solar radiation exposure have a high rate of infection. Finally, a global sensitivity analysis using Sobol analysis showed that daily solar radiation has a high rate of active cases that support the virus’ survival in both wave transmissions.","Abdelhafez, Eman; Dabbour, Loai; Hamdan, Mohammad",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12338-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420694/,345

While there is clear demand for the sharing economy, less is known about heterogeneity of consumer preferences and the varying demand that exists for sharing experiences across different categories of consumption. In order to help brands better understand who shares, this research takes a step forward in the profiling of users of the sharing economy. Drawing on social psychology, this research investigates how social norms can be employed as a form of social influence and nudge consumers to engage in higher levels of shared consumption. We find three clear segments of sharing consumers, representing 86% of all consumers: the mobility-focused sharer, the diverse-platform sharer, and the power-platform sharer. The last segment (accounting for 14%) comprises consumers who do not engage with sharing platforms. Moreover, social norms influenced the future behaviours of only one segment of consumers: the diverse-platform sharer. We discuss how sharing platform providers can better understand, target, and convert consumers to engage in sharing.","Sands, Sean; Ferraro, Carla; Campbell, Colin; Kietzmann, Jan; Andonopoulos, Vasiliki Vicki",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1441358220300495; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1441358220300495,345
593758,Effects of universal masking on Massachusetts healthcare workers' COVID-19 incidence,2020-08-13,"Ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI) was used with success in the 1930s and 1940s for a variety of diseases. Despite the success, the lack of understanding of the detailed mechanisms of actions, and the achievements of antibiotics, phased off the use of UBI from the 1950s. The emergence of novel viral infections, from HIV/AIDS to Ebola, from SARS and MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, bring back the attention to this therapeutical opportunity. UBI has a complex virucidal activity, mostly acting on the immune system response. It has effects on lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells), macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipids. The Knott technique was applied for bacterial infections such as tuberculosis to viral infections such as hepatitis or influenza. The more complex extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is also being applied to hematological cancers such as T-cell lymphomas. Further studies of UBI may help to create a useful device that may find applications for novel viruses that are resistant to known antivirals or vaccines, or also bacteria that are resistant to known antibiotics.","Boretti, Alberto; Banik, Bimal; Castelletto, Stefania",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-020-08811-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026601/,345

DESIGN: Perspective METHODS: Review of studies focused on digital device usage, near work, and outdoor time in relation to myopia onset and progression. Public health policies on myopia control, recommendations on screen time and information pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on increased digital device use were presented. Recommendations to minimize the impact of the pandemic on myopia onset and progression in children were made. RESULTS: Increased digital screen time, near work and limited outdoor activities were found to be associated with the onset and progression of myopia, and could potentially be aggravated during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak period. While school closures may be short-lived, increased access, adoption and dependence on digital devices could have a long term negative impact on childhood development. Raising awareness among parents, children and government agencies is key to mitigating myopigenic behaviours that may become entrenched during this period. CONCLUSIONS: While it is important to adopt critical measures to slow or halt the spread of COVID-19, close collaboration between parents, schools and ministries is necessary to assess and mitigate the long term collateral impact of COVID-19 on myopia control policies.","Wai WONG, Chee; TSAI, Andrew; Jonas, Jost B.; Ohno-Matsui, Kyoko; CHEN, James; ANG, Marcus; Wei TING, Daniel Shu",Am J Ophthalmol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002939420303925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738229/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002939420303925?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.07.034,345

Lymphopenia was prominent amongst the laboratory abnormalities reported in acute SARS. METHODS: The effect of SARS on peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subsets was examined in 271 SARS coronavirus-infected individuals. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD16+/56+ cell counts over the five weeks of the SARS illness although CD4+/CD8+ ratios did not change significantly. The lymphopenia was prolonged, reaching a nadir during days 7–9 in the second week of illness before returning towards normal after five weeks, with the lowest mean CD4+ cell count of 317 cells × 10(6)/L at day 7, and CD8+ cell count of 239 cells × 10(6)/L at day 8. Patients with more severe clinical illness, or patients who died, had significantly more profound CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia. DISCUSSION: Lymphopenia is a prominent part of SARS-CoV infection and lymphocyte counts may be useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes. Possible reasons for the SARS-associated lymphopenia may be direct infection of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV, lymphocyte sequestration in the lung or cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking. There may also be immune-mediated lymphocyte destruction, bone marrow or thymus suppression, or apoptosis.","He, Zhongping; Zhao, Chunhui; Dong, Qingming; Zhuang, Hui; Song, Shujing; Peng, Guoai; Dwyer, Dominic E.",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197120500072X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197120500072X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16095942/,345

This line of work ended abruptly in the 1920s but, over the last decades, has come back into the discipline somewhat piecemeal with the reintroduction of more sophisticated stage models of societal evolution, functional analysis, human ecological analysis, and other new lines of evolutionary inquiry outlined in this paper. Our goal is to demonstrate that revitalized paradigms of the past can still be useful with modest reconceptualization, while at the same time new intellectual movements in the other social sciences, especially economics and psychology, incorporating evolutionary ideas from biology provide sociology with an opportunity to develop its own approach to evolutionary analysis that avoids the problems that let to the demise of this line of inquiry in the 1920s, as well as the problems of other social sciences applying their more narrowly focus models to sociological problems. Indeed, sociology can become a leader in the social sciences in developing more sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches to incorporating biology and evolutionary analysis into the social sciences. When presented in a new, more sophisticated guise, old approaches like functionalism, stage models of societal evolution, and ecological models can be seen as still having a great deal of explanatory power, while revealing a progressive and future orientation that should appeal to all contemporary sociologists. It is time, then, for sociology to remember its past in order to move into the future.","Turner, Jonathan H.; Schutt, Russell K.; Keshavan, Matcheri S.",Am Sociol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-020-09448-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836293/,345

Whereas most proteins induced significant changes in endothelial permeability, nsp2, nsp5_c145a (catalytic dead mutant of nsp5) and nsp7 also reduced CD31, and increased von Willebrand factor expression and IL-6, suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Using propagation-based analysis of a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, we predicted the endothelial proteins affected by the viral proteins that potentially mediate these effects. We further applied our PPI model to identify the role of each SARS-CoV-2 protein in other tissues affected by COVID-19. Overall, this work identifies the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that might be most detrimental in terms of endothelial dysfunction, thereby shedding light on vascular aspects of COVID-19.","Rauti, Rossana; Shahoha, Meishar; Leichtmann-Bardoogo, Yael; Nasser, Rami; Tamir, Rina; Miller, Victoria; Babich, Tal; Shaked, Kfir; Ehrlich, Avner; Ioannidis, Konstantinos; Nahmias, Yaakov; Sharan, Roded; Ashery, Uri; Maoz, Ben M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.27.433186,345
596788,Overcoming Challenges Resulting From COVID-19: New York State’s Creating Healthy Schools and Communities Initiative,2020-07-09,"The rollout of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is underway, and millions have already been vaccinated. At least 25 reports of “immune thrombocytopenia” (ITP) or “thrombocytopenia” following the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine have been added to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US. ITP is a rare but known complication of several vaccinations. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is new, with a novel mechanism of action, and understanding the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, treatment success and natural history of post-vaccination thrombocytopenia is evolving. We report a 74-year-old man who developed refractory thrombocytopenia within one day of receiving the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Several hours after vaccination, he developed significant epistaxis and cutaneous purpura. Severe thrombocytopenia was documented the following day, and he developed extremity weakness and encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness. Over a 14-day period, thrombocytopenia was treated first with high dose dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulin, platelet transfusions, rituximab, plasma exchange (for presumed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)), and four daily doses of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) eltrombopag (Promacta™), without a platelet response. Three days later, he received the TPO-RA romiplostim (Nplate™). Five days later, his platelet count began to rise and by post-vaccination day 25, his platelet count was in the normal range. Thrombocytopenia was refractory to frontline and second-line treatment. The eventual rise in his platelet count suggests that one or both TPO-RAs may have impacted platelet recovery. Possibly, but less likely given the temporality, the drug-induced thrombocytopenia was subsiding. The aggressive use of immunosuppressive treatment may jeopardize the intended purpose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and earlier use of non-immunosuppressive second-line treatment for vaccine-related severe thrombocytopenia, such as with TPO-RAs, should be considered. While it is imperative to continue the global vaccination program, vigilance to the occurrence of post-vaccination severe thrombocytopenia is warranted.","Helms, Jackie M; Ansteatt, Kristin T; Roberts, Jonathan C; Kamatam, Sravani; Foong, Kap Sum; Labayog, Jo-mel S; Tarantino, Michael D",J Blood Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33854395/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jbm.s307047,345
596857,709 Healthy Sleep as an important resource and buffer for intersectional discrimination: Results from Covid 19 study,2021-05-03,"Onconase is a ribonuclease that presents both antitumor and antiviral properties linked to its ribonucleolytic activity and represents a new class of RNA-damaging drugs. It has reached clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers and human papilloma virus warts. Onconase targets different RNAs in the cell cytosol but Onconase-treated cells present features that are different from a simple arrest of protein synthesis. We have used microarray-derived transcriptional profiling to identify Onconase-regulated genes in two ovarian cancer cell lines (NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8). RT-qPCR analyses have confirmed the microarray findings. We have identified a network of up-regulated genes implicated in different signaling pathways that may explain the cytotoxic effects exerted by Onconase. Among these genes, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) plays a central role in the key events triggered by Onconase in treated cancer cells that finally lead to apoptosis. This mechanism, mediated by ATF3, is cell-type independent. Up-regulation of ATF3 may also explain the antiviral properties of this ribonuclease because this factor is involved in halting viral genome replication, keeping virus latency or preventing viral oncogenesis. Finally, Onconase-regulated genes are different from those affected by nuclear-directed ribonucleases.","Vert, Anna; Castro, Jessica; Ribó, Marc; Benito, Antoni; Vilanova, Maria",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.14302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035074/,345

The discussion of the ability of this disease to cause significant illness in patients with various risk factors such as myasthenia gravis is important to help guide physicians on recognition and treatment options as the pandemic matures. CASE REPORT: Here we discuss a single case of isolated COVID-19 infection that precipitated a myasthenic crisis with no other clinical sequelae in a patient who presented to the emergency department (ED). This report highlights some of the initial difficulties and delay in diagnosis encountered earlier in the pandemic with limited testing supplies and processing labs; however, prompt ED recognition and treatment still led to a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: The patient recovered during this initial presentation and was successfully treated with plasma exchange and steroids only. It is important to recognize that myasthenia gravis patients may represent a uniquely vulnerable population that requires enhanced surveillance and screening to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. This case describes how even a mild infection with no significant clinical sequelae or significant signs on imaging studied can precipitate a crisis event.","Moschella, Phillip; Roth, Prerana",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/cpcem.2020.9.49049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217262/,345

The aim of the study was to examine alcohol intake, sleep disorders, and depressive symptoms of HCPs during the pandemic in comparison with the pre-pandemic period. Another goal was to indicate risk factors for mental state deterioration and an increase in alcohol use. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from 1 April to 15 May 2020. HCPs (n = 158) completed questionnaires that probed for symptoms during and prior to the pandemic, including the Beck depression inventory (BDI), Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS), Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB) calendar of alcohol consumption. Gender, age, education, marital status, work situation, income, participants’ and relatives’ COVID-19 diagnosis as correlates were analyzed. Depressive symptoms and insomnia became more severe during the pandemic among HCPs, while social support increased. The increase in depressive symptoms was even higher among women (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.05–7.36; p = 0.04) and was also positively correlated with work reduction (p = 0.02); the presence of sleep disorders was correlated with female gender. Alcohol consumption increased during the pandemic, and was correlated with both more time spent at work and income increase. HCPs involved in the treatment of COVID-19 need support and attention due to the excessive stress load during pandemics, resulting in depression, insomnia, and increased alcohol intake.","Klimkiewicz, Anna; Schmalenberg, Adrianna; Klimkiewicz, Jakub; Jasińska, Agata; Jasionowska, Joanna; Machura, Weronika; Wojnar, Marcin",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10061280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808828/,345

With use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a centrifugation-enhanced viral culture method, we characterized the viruses causing acute respiratory infection in adults during an influenza season. Methods. During January-March 2002, nasopharyngeal wash specimens from previously healthy adults presenting with respiratory symptoms were evaluated for viral pathogens with centrifugation-enhanced viral culture and PCR. Results The diagnoses in 266 cases included unspecified upper respiratory infection (in 142 [54%] of the cases), acute bronchitis (42 [16%]), sinusitis (23 [9%]), pharyngitis (22 [8%]), and pneumonia (17 [6%]). The use of a shell vial assay and PCR identified a pathogen in 103 (39%) of the patients, including influenza A or B in 54, picornavirus in 28 (including rhinovirus in 24), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 12, human metapneumovirus in 4, human coronavirus OC43 in 2, adenovirus in 2, parainfluenza virus type 1 in 1, and coinfection with influenza and parainfluenza virus type 1 in 2. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that, even during the influenza season, rhinovirus and RSV are prevalent and must be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult acute respiratory infection before prescribing antiviral medication. Human coronavirus and human metapneumovirus did not play a substantial role. PCR was an especially useful tool in the identification of influenza and other viral pathogens not easily detected by traditional testing methods.","Louie, Janice K.; Hacker, Jill K.; Gonzales, Ralph; Mark, Jennifer; Maselli, Judy H.; Yagi, Shigeo; Drew, W.

Nutrition, especially micronutrients, plays an important role in reducing mortality and complications from COVID-19 because micronutrients strengthen our immune system and nutritional status is an important factor that affects the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Among micronutrients, selenium has an important effect on both intrinsic and acquired immunity. Host selenium deficiency affects the viral genome and increases the virulence of viruses. We have investigated the serum selenium levels in COVID-19 patients and healthy control individuals. METHODS: A total of 50 patients with COVID-19 infection were included in this study. During hospitalization, 13 patients died (non-survivor group) and 37 patients recovered (survivor group). We assessed the serum selenium levels in 50 COVID-19 patients and 50 healthy individuals by Agilent SpectrAA-240 Z atomic absorption spectrometer. RESULTS: The serum selenium level was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients (77. 8 ± 13.9 μg/L) as compared to healthy control individuals (91.7 ± 16.7 μg/L), but there was no significant difference between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Also, there was no significant relationship between serum selenium levels and laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients.

It is an expert data set resulting from selection and analysis of the crystal structures gathered in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Clearly, such a manual approach cannot be applied to the vast and ever‐growing number of chemical compounds. Therefore, a database, named PURY, of geometric parameters of chemical compounds has been developed, together with a server that accesses it. PURY is a compilation of the whole CSD.

The study uses the publicly available data sets from the John Hopkins University of Medicine in conjunction with the mobility rates obtained from Google’s Mobility Reports and climate variables acquired from the Weather Online API. The results suggest that the logistic growth model fits best the pandemic’s behavior, that there is enough correlation of climate and mobility variables with the disease numbers, and that the Long short-term memory network can be exploited for predicting daily cases.

We developed a stacking ensemble machine learning model including the backscattered signal features (optical fingerprint), patient comorbidities, and age (AUROC = 0.80), which significantly outperformed the predictive value of clinical and laboratory variables available at hospital admission (AUROC = 0.71). The information derived from patient optical fingerprints was not strongly correlated with any clinical/laboratory variable, suggesting that optical fingerprinting brings unique information for COVID-19 severity risk assessment. Optical fingerprinting is a label-free, real-time, and low-cost technology that can be easily integrated as a front-line tool to facilitate the triage and clinical management of COVID-19 patients.","Faria, Simão P.; Carpinteiro, Cristiana; Pinto, Vanessa; Rodrigues, Sandra M.; Alves, José; Marques, Filipe; Lourenço, Marta; Santos, Paulo H.; Ramos, Angélica; Cardoso, Maria J.; Guimarães, João T.; Rocha, Sara; Sampaio, Paula; Clifton, David A.; Mumtaz, Mehak; Paiva, Joana S.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441244/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081309,345

Methods The Task Force for Mass Critical Care (TFMCC) adopted a modified version of established rapid guideline methodologies from the World Health Organization2 and the Guidelines International Network-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist.3 With a consensus development process incorporating expert opinion to define important questions and extract evidence, TFMCC developed relevant pandemic surge suggestions in a structured manner, incorporating peer-reviewed literature, “gray” evidence from lay media sources, and anecdotal experiential evidence. Results Ten suggestions were identified regarding staffing, load-balancing, communication, and technology. Staffing models are suggested with resilience strategies to support critical care staff. Intensive care unit (ICU) surge strategies and strain indicators are suggested to enhance ICU prioritization tactics to maintain contingency level care and avoid crisis triage, with early transfer strategies to further load-balance care. We suggest intensivists and hospitalists be engaged with the incident command structure to ensure two-way communication, situational awareness, and the use of technology to support critical care delivery and families of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Conclusions A subcommittee from the Task Force for Mass Critical Care offers interim evidence-informed operational strategies to assist hospitals and communities to plan for and respond to surge capacity demands from COVID-19.","Dichter, Jeffrey R.; Devereaux, Asha V.; Sprung, Charles L.; Mukherjee, Vikramjit; Persoff, Jason; Baum, Karyn D.; Ornoff, Douglas; Uppal, Amit; Hossain, Tanzib; Henry, Kiersten N.; Ghazipura, Marya; Bowden, Kasey R.; Feldman, Henry J.; Hamele, Mitchell T.; Burry, Lisa D.; Martland, Anne Marie O.; Huffines, Meredith; Tosh, Pritish K.; Downar, James; Hick, John L.; Christian, Michael D.; Maves, Ryan C.",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221038459; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221038459?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.08.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499878/,345

609805,Management and Treatment of Concussions via Tele-Concussion in a Pediatric Setting: Methodological Approach and Descriptive Analysis,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer–BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford–AstraZeneca) COVID-19 vaccines have shown high efficacy against disease in phase 3 clinical trials and are now being used in national vaccination programmes in the UK and several other countries. Studying the real-world effects of these vaccines is an urgent requirement. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the mass roll-out of the first doses of these COVID-19 vaccines and hospital admissions for COVID-19. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19—EAVE II—database comprising linked vaccination, primary care, real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing, and hospital admission patient records for 5·4 million people in Scotland (about 99% of the population) registered at 940 general practices. Individuals who had previously tested positive were excluded from the analysis. A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models with inverse propensity weights were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 hospital admission (defined as 1–adjusted rate ratio) following the first dose of vaccine. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1 331 993 people were vaccinated over the study period. The mean age of those vaccinated was 65·0 years (SD 16·2). The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85–94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28–34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75–94). Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72–89 at 28–34 days post-vaccination). INTERPRETATION: Mass roll-out of the first doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantial reductions in the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 in Scotland. There remains the possibility that some of the observed effects might have been due to residual confounding.

Methods: This prospective cohort analysis took place at a London NHS Trust. 5076 secondary care healthcare staff participated in LFD testing from 18 November 2020 - 21 January 2021. Staff members submitted results and symptoms via an online portal twice weekly. Individuals with positive LFD results were invited for confirmatory SARS CoV-2 PCR testing. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the LFD was measured. Secondary outcome measures included time from LFD result to PCR test and staff symptom profiles. Results: 284/5076 individuals reported a valid positive LFD result, and a paired PCR result was obtained in 259/284 (91•2%). 244 were PCR positive yielding a PPV of 94•21% (244/259, 95% CI 90•73% to 96•43%). 204/259 (78•8%) staff members had the PCR within 36 hours of the LFD test. Symptom profiles were confirmed for 132/244 staff members (54•1%) with positive PCR results (true positives) and 13/15 (86•6%) with negative PCR results (false positives). 91/132 true positives (68•9%) were symptomatic at the time of LFD testing: 65/91 (71•4%) had symptoms meeting the PHE case definition of COVID-19, whilst 26/91 (28•6%) had atypical symptoms. 18/41 (43•9%) staff members who were asymptomatic at the time of positive LFD developed symptoms in the subsequent four days. 9/13 (76•9%) false positives were asymptomatic, 1/13 (7•7%) had atypical symptoms and 3/13 (23•1%) had symptoms matching the PHE case definition. Conclusions: The PPV of the Innova LFD is high when used amongst hospital staff during periods of high prevalence of COVID-19, yet we find frequent use by symptomatic staff rather than as a purely asymptomatic screening tool. LFD testing does allow earlier isolation of infected workers and facilitates detection of individuals whose symptoms do not qualify for PCR testing.","Lamb, Georgia; Heskin, Joseph; Randell, Paul; Mughal, Nabeela; Moore, Luke SP; Jones, Rachael; Davies, Gary W; Rayment, Michael",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445321003832?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34364950/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.07.038; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445321003832,345

To address this issue, we propose a flexible transoral robot with a teleoperated configuration for swab sampling. The robot comprises a flexible manipulator, an endoscope with a monitor, and a master device. A 3-prismatic-universal (3-PU) flexible parallel mechanism with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF) is used to realize the manipulator’s movements. The flexibility of the manipulator improves the safety of testees. Besides, the master device is similar to the manipulator in structure. It is easy to use for operators. Under the guidance of the vision from the endoscope, the surgeon can operate the master device to control the swab’s motion attached to the manipulator for sampling. In this paper, the robotic system, the workspace, and the operation procedure are described in detail. The tongue depressor, which is used to prevent the tongue’s interference during the sampling, is also tested. The accuracy of the manipulator under visual guidance is validated intuitively. Finally, the experiment on a human phantom is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the robot preliminarily.","Li, Changsheng; Gu, Xiaoyi; Xiao, Xiao; Lim, Chwee Ming; Duan, Xingguang; Ren, Hongliang",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912594/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.612167,345

In the present study, we analysed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influent wastewater samples (n = 43) from four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Gandhinagar, India, during August 7th to September 30th, 2020. A total of 40 samples out of 43 were found positive i.e. having at least two genes of SARS-CoV-2. The average Ct values for S, N, and ORF 1ab genes were 32.66, 33.03, and 33.95, respectively. Monthly variation depicted a substantial rise in the average copies of N (~120%) and ORF 1ab (~38%) genes in the month of September as compared to August, while S-gene copies declined by 58% in September 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 genome concentration was higher in the month of September (~924.5 copies/ L) than August (~897.5 copies/ L), corresponding to a ~ 2.2-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases during the study period. Further, the percentage change in genome concentration level on a particular date was found in the lead of 1-2 weeks of time with respect to the official confirmed cases registered based on clinical tests on a temporal scale. The results profoundly unravel the potential of WBE surveillance to predict the fluctuation of COVID-19 cases to provide an early warning. Our study explicitly suggests that it is the need of hour that the wastewater surveillance must be included as an integral part of COVID-19 pandemic monitoring which can not only help the water authorities to identify the hotspots within a city but can provide up to 2 weeks of time lead for better tuning the management interventions.","Kumar, M.; Joshi, M.; Patel, A.

N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators (N95-FFRs) provide respiratory protection against respiratory pathogens including SARS-COV-2. There is scant literature on reprocessing methods which can enable reuse of N95-FFRs. Aim: We conducted this study to evaluate research done, prior to COVID-19 pandemic, on various decontamination methods for reprocessing of N95-FFRs. Methods: We searched 5 electronic databases (Pubmed, Google Scholar, Crossref, Ovid, ScienceDirect) and 1 Grey literature database (OpenGrey). We included original studies, published prior to year 2020, which had evaluated any decontamination method on FFRs. Studies had evaluated a reprocessing method against parameters namely physical changes, user acceptability, respirator fit, filter efficiency, microbicidal efficacy and presence of chemical residues post-reprocessing. Findings and Conclusions: Overall, we found 7887 records amongst which 17 original research articles were finally included for qualitative analysis. Overall, 21 different types of decontamination or reprocessing methods for N95-FFRs were evaluated. Most commonly evaluated method for reprocessing of FFRs was Ultraviolet (Type-C) irradiation (UVGI) which was evaluated in 13/17 (76%) studies. We found published literature is scant on this topic despite warning signs of pandemic of a respiratory illness over the years. Promising technologies requiring expeditious evaluation are UVGI, Microwave generated steam (MGS) and Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV). Global presence of technologies, which have been given Emergency use authorisation for N95-FFR reprocessing, is extremely limited. Reprocessing of N95-FFRs by MGS should be considered for emergency implementation in resource limited settings to tackle shortage of N95-FFRs.","Paul, D.; Gupta, A.; Maurya, A.

613241,"Trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and staffing shortages in US nursing homes by rural and urban status",2021-08-30,"A growing number of vaccines are administered at the same time or in close succession, increasing the complexity of assessing vaccine safety. Individual vaccines are assumed to have no other effect than protection against the targeted pathogen, but vaccines also have nonspecific and interactive effects, the outcomes of which can be beneficial or harmful. To date, no controlled trials and very few observational studies have determined the impact of vaccination schedules on overall health. The balance of the risks and benefits from mass vaccination therefore remains uncertain. Recent studies worryingly suggest links between multiple vaccinations and increased risks of diverse multisystem health problems, including allergies, infections, and neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we propose that, in susceptible persons, multiple vaccinations activate the retinoid cascade and trigger apoptotic hepatitis, leading to cholestatic liver dysfunction, in which stored vitamin A compounds (retinyl esters and retinoic acid) enter the circulation in toxic concentrations; this induces endogenous forms of hypervitaminosis A, with the severity of adverse outcomes being directly proportional to the concentration of circulating retinoids. In very low concentrations, vitamin A and its major metabolite retinoic acid contribute to immune function and to the process of immunization, whereas excess vitamin A increases the risk of adverse events, including common “side-effects” as well as chronic adverse outcomes. The increasing rates of allergy, ear infections, and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in countries with high rates of vaccination could be related to mass vaccination and to its impact on liver function and vitamin A metabolism, collectively representing endogenous manifestations of hypervitaminosis A. Further studies of health outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated groups are urgently needed, to increase understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of vaccine injury, to identify the risk factors and screen for vaccine injury, to inform public health policy on potential hazards related to vaccination schedules, and to optimize the safety and benefits of vaccines.","Mawson, Anthony R.; Croft, Ashley M.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198395/,345

In this study, we present a molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)) nanosheet-modified dendrimer droplet microarray (DMA) for rapid and sensitive detection of retroviral nucleic acids of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) simultaneously. The DMA platform was fabricated by omniphobic–omniphilic patterning on a surface-grafted dendrimer substrate. Functionalized MoS(2) nanosheets modified with fluorescent dye-labeled oligomer probes were prepatterned on positively charged amino-modified omniphilic spots to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing microarray. With the formation of separated microdroplets of sample on the hydrophobic–hydrophilic micropattern, prepatterned oligomer probes specifically hybridized with the target HIV genes and detached from the MoS(2) nanosheet surface due to weakening of the adsorption force, leading to fluorescence signal recovery. As a proof of concept, we used this microarray with a small sample size (<150 nL) for simultaneous detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 nucleic acids with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 pM. The multiplex detection capability was further demonstrated for simultaneous detection of five viral genes (HIV-1, HIV-2, ORFlab, and N genes of SARS-COV-2 and M gene of Influenza A). This work demonstrated the potential of this novel MoS(2)-DMA FRET sensing platform for high-throughput multiplexed viral nucleic acid screening.","Oudeng, Gerile; Benz, Maximilian; Popova, Anna A.; Zhang, Yu; Yi, Changqing; Levkin, Pavel A.; Yang, Mo",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c16146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269927/,345

During large outbreaks of the viral disease, serological testing of serum samples could be a useful diagnostic tool, which could provide information on not only the diagnosis of NiV disease but also the history of an individual with previous exposure to the virus, thereby supporting disease control. Therefore, an efficient method for the inactivation of NiV in serum samples is required for serological diagnosis. METHODS: We determined the optimal conditions for the inactivation of NiV infectivity in human serum using heating and UV treatment. The inactivation method comprised UV irradiation with a cover of aluminum foil for 30 min and heating at 56 °C for 30 min. RESULTS: With an optimized protocol for virus inactivation, NiV infectivity in serum samples (containing 6.0 × 10(5) TCID(50)) was completely inactivated. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a recommended protocol for the effective inactivation of NiV. This protocol would enable a regional or local laboratory to safely transport or process samples, including NiV, for serological testing in its biosafety level-2 facility.","Watanabe, Shumpei; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Harada, Toshihiko; Shimojima, Masayuki; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Kurosu, Takeshi; Kaku, Yoshihiro; Morikawa, Shigeru; Saijo, Masayuki",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036623/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01425-8,345

Our aim was to profile the transcriptome in leukocytes from critically ill patients positive for COVID19 compared to those negative for COVID19 to better understand the COVID19-associated host response. For these studies, all patients admitted to our tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected at the time of admission to the ICU. Transcriptome profiling of leukocytes via ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) was then performed and differentially expressed genes as well as significantly enriched gene sets were identified. RESULTS: We enrolled seven COVID19 + (PCR positive, 2 SARS-CoV-2 genes) and seven age- and sex-matched COVID19- (PCR negative) control ICU patients. Cohorts were well-balanced with the exception that COVID19− patients had significantly higher total white blood cell counts and circulating neutrophils and COVID19 + patients were more likely to suffer bilateral pneumonia. The mortality rate for this cohort of COVID19 + ICU patients was 29%. As indicated by both single-gene based and gene set (GSEA) approaches, the major disease-specific transcriptional responses of leukocytes in critically ill COVID19 + ICU patients were: (i) a robust overrepresentation of interferon-related gene expression; (ii) a marked decrease in the transcriptional level of genes contributing to general protein synthesis and bioenergy metabolism; and (iii) the dysregulated expression of genes associated with coagulation, platelet function, complement activation, and tumour necrosis factor/interleukin 6 signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that critically ill COVID19 + patients on day 1 of admission to the ICU display a unique leukocyte transcriptional profile that distinguishes them from COVID19− patients, providing guidance for future targeted studies exploring novel prognostic and therapeutic aspects of COVID19.","Gill, Sean E.; dos Santos, Claudia C.; O’Gorman, David B.; Carter, David E.; Patterson, Eric K.; Slessarev, Marat; Martin, Claudio; Daley, Mark; Miller, Michael R.; Cepinskas, Gediminas; Fraser, Douglas D.",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306162/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-020-00361-9,345

We sought to validate self-reported PD diagnosis in the Fox Insight cohort, assess the validity of other self-reported health information, and evaluate the willingness of participants to participate in video-based research studies. METHODS: Individuals with and without self-reported PD enrolled in Fox Insight were invited to participate in this virtual research study. Participants completed online questionnaires and two virtual visits, during which we conducted standard cognitive and motor assessments. A movement disorder expert determined the most likely diagnosis, which was compared to self-reported diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 203 participants from 40 U.S. states, 159 with remote clinician-determined PD and 44 without, completed the study (59% male, mean (SD) age 65.7 (9.8)). Level of agreement between self-reported PD diagnosis in Fox Insight and clinician-determined diagnosis was very good ((kappa = 0.85, 95% CI 0.76–0.94). Overall, 97.9% of participants were satisfied with the study, 98.5% were willing to participate in a future observational study with virtual visits, and 76.1% were willing to participate in an interventional trial with virtual visits. CONCLUSION: Among the Fox Insight cohort, self-reported diagnosis is accurate and interest in virtual research studies is high.","Myers, Taylor L.; Tarolli, Christopher G.; Adams, Jamie L.; Barbano, Richard; Cristina Gil-Díaz, María; Spear, Kelsey L.; Lowell, Jill; Daeschler, Margaret; Riley, Lindsey; Amondikar, Ninad; Auinger, Peggy; Marras, Connie; Tanner, Caroline M.; Ray Dorsey, E.; Schneider, Ruth B.",Clin Park Relat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prdoa.2021.100094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316671/,345
616664,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department visits: reference center,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Intervention during the first years of life for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have the strongest impact on long-term brain development and functioning. Yet, barriers such as a shortage of trained professionals contribute to significant delays in service. The goal of this proof-of-concept study was to explore strategies that support timely and equitable deployment of ASD-specific interventions. METHODS: This 15-week, randomized proof-of-concept study explored the acceptability of a digital parent mediated intervention online reciprocal imitation training (RIT; a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention) and compared it to a treatment as usual (TAU) control on parent and child outcomes. Eligible children were between 18 and 60 months, met the cutoff for ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition and demonstrate significant social imitation deficits. Primary outcomes include the acceptability of RIT (Scale of Treatment Perceptions) and the feasibility of the Online RIT digital intervention (online RIT attributes). Secondary outcomes included parent fidelity (RIT parent fidelity form) and parental self-efficacy (Early Intervention Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale). Exploratory outcome measures included child social communication (Social Communication Checklist), child imitation skills (Unstructured Imitation Assessment), and family quality of life (Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale). RESULTS: Twenty participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The acceptability and feasibility of RIT and the Online RIT digital intervention were rated highly. Among the secondary outcomes, there were significant group differences in parent fidelity (p < .001) and self-efficacy (p = .029). On exploratory outcomes, there were group differences in child social communication (p = .048). There were no significant group differences in imitation ability (p = .05) or family quality of life (p = .22). LIMITATIONS: There are several limitations with this study, including the small sample size as well as lack of data on enactment and website engagement. This study was not able to address questions related to which variables predict program engagement and treatment response, which will be critical for determining which families may benefit from such a stepped-care delivery model. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the Online RIT program delivered in a stepped-care format shows strong acceptability and holds promise as an innovative delivery model.

617887,Results Availability and Timeliness of Registered COVID-19 Clinical Trials: A Cross-Sectional Study,2021-04-09,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile systemic childhood vasculitis, which is suspected to be triggered by respiratory viral infections. We aimed to examine whether the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with an increase in the incidence of Kawasaki disease. METHODS: We did a quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis over the past 15 years in a tertiary paediatric centre in the Paris region, a French epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcome was the number of Kawasaki disease cases over time, estimated by quasi-Poisson regression. In the same centre, we recorded the number of hospital admissions from the emergency department (2005–2020) and the results of nasopharyngeal multiplex PCR to identify respiratory pathogens (2017–2020). These data were compared with daily hospital admissions due to confirmed COVID-19 in the same region, recorded by Public Health France. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2005, and May 20, 2020, we included 230 patients with Kawasaki disease. The median number of Kawasaki disease hospitalisations estimated by the quasi-Poisson model was 1·2 per month (IQR 1·1–1·3). In April, 2020, we identified a rapid increase of Kawasaki disease that was related to SARS-CoV-2 (six cases per month; 497% increase [95% CI 72–1082]; p=0·0011), starting 2 weeks after the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 was the only virus circulating intensely during this period, and was found in eight (80%) of ten patients with Kawasaki disease since April 15 (SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR or serology). A second peak of hospital admissions due to Kawasaki disease was observed in December, 2009 (six cases per month; 365% increase ([31–719]; p=0.0053), concomitant with the influenza A H1N1 pandemic. INTERPRETATION: Our study further suggests that viral respiratory infections, including SAR-CoV-2, could be triggers for Kawasaki disease and indicates the potential timing of an increase in incidence of the disease in COVID-19 epidemics. Health-care providers should be prepared to manage an influx of patients with severe Kawasaki disease, particularly in countries where the peak of COVID-19 has recently been reached.

618340,Online and Recovery-Oriented Support Groups Facilitated by Peer Support Workers in Times of COVID-19: Protocol for a Feasibility Pre-Post Study,2020-12-18,"Among the four genera of influenza viruses (IVs) and the four genera of coronaviruses (CoVs), zoonotic αIV and βCoV have occasionally caused airborne epidemic outbreaks in humans, who are immunologically naïve, and the outbreaks have resulted in high fatality rates as well as social and economic disruption and losses. The most devasting influenza A virus (IAV) in αIV, pandemic H1N1 in 1918, which caused at least 40 million deaths from about 500 million cases of infection, was the first recorded emergence of IAVs in humans. Usually, a novel human-adapted virus replaces the preexisting human-adapted virus. Interestingly, two IAV subtypes, A/H3N2/1968 and A/H1N1/2009 variants, and two lineages of influenza B viruses (IBV) in βIV, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage-like viruses, remain seasonally detectable in humans. Both influenza C viruses (ICVs) in γIV and four human CoVs, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in αCoV and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in βCoV, usually cause mild respiratory infections. Much attention has been given to CoVs since the global epidemic outbreaks of βSARS-CoV in 2002–2004 and βMERS-CoV from 2012 to present. βSARS-CoV-2, which is causing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has resulted in 890,392 deaths from about 27 million cases of infection as of 8 September 2020, has provoked worldwide investigations of CoVs. With the aim of developing efficient strategies for controlling virus outbreaks and recurrences of seasonal virus variants, here we overview the structures, diversities, host ranges and host receptors of all IVs and CoVs and critically review current knowledge of receptor binding specificity of spike glycoproteins, which mediates infection, of IVs and of zoonotic, pandemic and seasonal CoVs.","Sriwilaijaroen, Nongluk; Suzuki, Yasuo",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33036202/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040587,345

In a recent study, the authors had mapped the associations among CHPV proteins and shown that N protein interacts with four of the viral proteins: N, phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), and glycoprotein (G). The present study aimed to distinguish the regions of CHPV N protein responsible for its interactions with other viral proteins. In this direction, we have generated the structure of CHPV N protein by homology modeling using SWISS-MODEL workspace and Accelrys Discovery Studio client 2.55 and mapped the domains of N protein using PiSQRD. The interactions of N protein fragments with other proteins were determined by ZDOCK rigid-body docking method and validated by yeast two-hybrid and ELISA. The study revealed a unique binding site, comprising of amino acids 1–30 at the N terminus of the nucleocapsid protein (N1) that is instrumental in its interactions with N, P, M, and G proteins. It was also observed that N2 associates with N and G proteins while N3 interacts with N, P, and M proteins.","Kumar, Kapila; Rajasekharan, Sreejith; Gulati, Sahil; Rana, Jyoti; Gabrani, Reema; Jain, Chakresh K.; Gupta, Amita; Chaudhary, Vijay K.; Gupta, Sanjay",Adv Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24288532/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/594319,345
618810,Surveillance and care for confirmed and suspected patients with COVID-19 in general practice (CovidCare): study protocol for an observational trial,2021-09-02,"During the spring of 2019, distinct virus-like symptoms were observed in the Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate in Egypt in naturally infected eggplants. Leaves of affected plants showed interveinal leaf chlorosis, net yellow, chlorotic sectors, mottling, blisters, vein enation, necrotic intervention, and narrowing symptoms. The Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) was suspected of to be involved in this disease. Forty plant samples from symptomatic eggplants and 10 leaf samples with no symptoms were collected. The samples were tested by double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) using AMV-IgG. Six of the 40 symptomatic leaf samples tested positive for AMV, while, DAS-ELISA found no AMV in the 10 leaf samples without symptoms. The AMV Egyptian isolate (AMV-Eggplant-EG) was biologically isolated from the six positive samples tested by DAS-ELISA and from the similar local lesions induced on Chenopodium amaranticolor and then re-inoculated in healthy Solanum melongena as a source of AMV-Eggplant-EG and confirmed by DAS-ELISA. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with a pair of primers specific for coat protein (CP) encoding RNA 3 of AMV yielded an amplicon of 666 bp from infected plants of Solanum melongena with AMV-Eggplant-EG. The amplified PCR product was cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the AMV-Eggplant-EG sequence revealed 666 nucleotides (nt) of the complete CP gene (translating 221 amino acid (aa) residues). Analysis of phylogeny for nt and deduced aa sequences of the CP gene using the maximum parsimony method clustered AMV-Eggplant-EG in the lineage of Egyptian isolates (shark-EG, mans-EG, CP2-EG, and FRE-EG) with a high bootstrap value of 88% and 92%, respectively. In addition to molecular studies, melatonin (MTL) and salicylic acid (SA) (100 μM) were used to increase the resistance of eggplant to AMV- infection. Foliar spray with MLT and SA caused a significant increase in the morphological criteria (shoot, root length, number of leaves, leaf area, and leaf biomass), chlorophyll and carotenoid content, antioxidant enzymes, and gene expression of some enzymes compared to the infected plants. On the other hand, treatment with MLT and SA reduced the oxidative damage caused by AMV through the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and malondialdehyde. In conclusion, MLT and SA are eco-friendly compounds and can be used as antiviral compounds.","Sofy, Ahmed R.; Sofy, Mahmoud R.; Hmed, Ahmed A.; Dawoud, Rehab A.; Refaey, Ehab E.; Mohamed, Heba I.; El-Dougdoug, Noha K.",Plants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670990/; https://doi.org/10.3390/plants10030459,345
620329,Interpreting COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents in the US: The changing role of facility quality over time,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Although strict adherence to infection control strategies is recognised as the simplest and most cost effective method to prevent the spread of healthcare associated infections (HAIs), measurement of the direct impact that such adherence may have on the risk of developing such infections has always been a challenge. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the risk of HAIs before and during the SARS outbreak. Such comparison is intended to provide a surrogate measure of the influence that strict enforcement of infection control strategies during the SARS outbreak may have had on the risk of HAIs. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on the medical records of 400 intensive care patients who were admitted to the ICU three months before and during the 2003 SARS outbreak. RESULTS: The rate of HAIs was higher in the pre-SARS period than the SARS period. Specifically, 61.7% of all reported infections were diagnosed in the pre-SARS period. The rate of HAIs in the pre-SARS period was 14.5% as opposed to 9% during the SARS period. Adjusted logistic regression analysis suggested that the odds of HAIs were 2.2 times higher in the pre-SARS period as compared to the SARS period (OR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.08–4.49). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that strict enforcement of infection control strategies may have a positive impact on the efforts to minimise the risk of HAIs. These findings carry a clinical significance that shall not be ignored with regard to our overall efforts to minimise the risk of developing HAIs in the ICU.","El-Masri, Maher M.; Oldfield, Margaret (Peggy)",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2011.10.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0964339711000966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22055396/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0964339711000966,345
620751,Integrating research and clinical care must include primary care,2021-05-10,"We propose a novel data-driven framework for assessing the a-priori epidemic risk of a geographical area and for identifying high-risk areas within a country. Our risk index is evaluated as a function of three different components: the hazard of the disease, the exposure of the area and the vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows correlations with the available official data on the number of infected individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19 outbreak started in both North (Lombardia) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the beginning of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences in regions with higher epidemic risk. Our framework can be extended and tested on other epidemic data, such as those on seasonal flu, and applied to other countries. We also present a policy model connected with our methodology, which might help policy-makers to take informed decisions.","Pluchino, A.; Biondo, A.

620799,Signal of Increased Opioid Overdose during COVID-19 from Emergency Medical Services Data,2020-07-10,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities of antibody. Since experimentation is far easier in vitro, researchers have been sought to develop in vitro assays that are expected to predict activity in vivo. This could be important in both vaccine design and in passive antibody administration. The proposed mechanisms of in vitro neutralization range from those requiring binding of a single antibody molecule to virus to those requiring substantially complete antibody coating of virus. In vitro, antiviral activity can be separated into activity against virions and activity against infected cells. The activity against virions most often considered is neutralization that can be defined as the loss of infectivity, which ensues when antibody molecule(s) bind to a virus particle, and occurs without the involvement of any other agency. In vivo, it is conventional to distinguish phenomenologically between two types of antibody antiviral activity. One of them is the ability of antibody to protect against infection when it is present before or immediately following infection. Evidence for a number of viruses in vitro indicates that lower antibody concentrations are required to inhibit infection propagated by free virus than are required to inhibit infection propagated by cell-to-cell spread.","Parren, Paul W.H.I.; Burton, Dennis R.",Advances in Immunology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065277601770186; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065277601770186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11293117/,345
622278,Covid-19: statutory means of scrutinizing workers’ deaths and disease,2020-09-21,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) is an emerging zoonotic disease. Exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) has been consistently considered the main source of primary human infection. Although Saudi Arabia reports the highest rate of human MERS‐CoV infection and has one of the largest populations of dromedary camels worldwide, their spatial association has not yet been investigated. Thus, this study aimed to examine the correlation between the spatial distribution of primary MERS‐CoV cases with or without a history of camel exposure reported between 2012 and 2019 and dromedary camels at the provincial level in Saudi Arabia. In most provinces, a high proportion of older men develop infections after exposure to camels. Primary human infections during spring and winter were highest in provinces characterized by seasonal breeding and calving, increased camel mobilization and camel–human interactions. A strong and significant association was found between the total number of dromedary camels and the numbers of primary camel‐exposed and non‐exposed MERS‐CoV cases. Furthermore, spatial correlations between MERS‐CoV cases and camel sex, age and dairy status were significant. Via a cluster analysis, we identified Riyadh, Makkah and Eastern provinces as having the most primary MERS‐CoV cases and the highest number of camels. Transmission of MERS‐CoV from camels to humans occurs in most primary cases, but there is still a high proportion of primary infections with an ambiguous link to camels. The results from this study include significant correlations between primary MERS‐CoV cases and camel populations in all provinces, regardless of camel exposure history. This supports the hypothesis of the role of an asymptomatic human carrier or, less likely, an unknown animal host that has direct contact with both infected camels and humans. In this study, we performed a preliminary risk assessment of prioritization measures to control the transmission of infection from camels to humans.","Al‐Ahmadi, Khalid; Alahmadi, Mohammed; Al‐Zahrani, Ali",Zoonoses Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32112508/,345
623595,The voice of frontline healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 surge,2021-03-23,"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had growing environmental consequences related to plastic use and follow-up waste, but more urgent health issues have far overshadowed the potential impacts. This paper gives a prospective outlook on how the disruption caused by COVID-19 can act as a catalyst for short-term and long-term changes in plastic waste management practices throughout the world. The impact of the pandemic and epidemic following through the life cycles of various plastic products, particularly those needed for personal protection and healthcare, is assessed. The energy and environmental footprints of these product systems have increased rapidly in response to the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, while critical hazardous waste management issues are emerging due to the need to ensure destruction of residual pathogens in household and medical waste. The concept of Plastic Waste Footprint (PWF) is proposed to capture the environmental footprint of a plastic product throughout its entire life cycle. Emerging challenges in waste management during and after the pandemic are discussed from the perspective of novel research and environmental policies. The sudden shift in waste composition and quantity highlights the need for a dynamically reponsive waste management system. Six future research directions are suggested to mitigate the potential impacts of the pandemic on waste management systems.","Klemeš, Jiří Jaromír; Van Fan, Yee; Tan, Raymond R.; Jiang, Peng",Renewable & sustainable energy reviews,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120301763?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120301763; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234614/,345

We assessed trainees’ and fellowship directors’ perceptions regarding the impact of the pandemic on gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS: A web-based survey was anonymously disseminated to all Greek gastroenterology fellows and fellowship program directors. Participants completed electronically a questionnaire comprised of 5 domains that assessed participants’ perception of: 1) overall impact on training; 2) impact on training in gastroenterology-specific fields (endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatology); 3) impact on different aspects of endoscopy training; 4) impact on academic training; and 5) training perspectives for the post-pandemic era. RESULTS: A total of 77/128 fellows (60.1%) and 18/28 fellowship program directors (64.3%) responded. More fellows reported that the COVID-19 pandemic would have an adverse impact on fellowship training compared to their fellowship program directors (81.8% vs. 55.6%, P=0.038). This concern was mainly focused on endoscopy training (83.1% vs. 27.8%, P<0.001), with no difference regarding training in gastroenterology’s other specific fields. The difference was consistent for technical skills (79.2% vs. 38.9%, P=0.001), and for the performance of basic diagnostic (70.1% vs. 22.2%, P<0.001) and emergency (48.1% vs. 11.1%, P=0.004) procedures. Fellows and fellowship program directors identified the unknown timeframe of measure implementation and the postponement of scheduled endoscopic procedures as the main factors that negatively affected training. Extension of the fellowship training program was deemed the optimal option by fellows for addressing the training decrement in the post-pandemic era, while fellowship program directors favored an increase in workload. CONCLUSION: Fellows and their fellowship program directors do not share the same concerns about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on training programs and they propose different measures to remedy its effects.","Karampekos, George; Gkolfakis, Paraskevas; Tziatzios, Georgios; Apostolopoulos, Pericles; Vlachogiannakos, Jiannis; Thomopoulos, Konstantinos; Protopapas, Andreas; Kofokotsios, Alexandros; Oikonomou, Michalis; Mela, Maria; Samonakis, Dimitrios; Christodoulou, Dimitrios; Triantafyllou, Konstantinos",Ann Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2020.0546; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162746/,345

However, studies about feline hemoplasma infections in Spain are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to evaluate the prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas and to characterize risk factors and clinical findings associated with these infections in a cat population from the Madrid area, Spain. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), “Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum” (CMhm) and “Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis” (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. RESULTS: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with “Candidatus M. haemominutum” and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with “Candidatus M. haemominutum” and “Candidatus M. turicensis” and another one (0.17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus “M. turicensis”. Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum”, Mycoplasma haemofelis and “Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis” are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, “Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum” being the most prevalent species. More studies are necessary to help understand the role of the natural infection by these species of hemoplasma in cats.","Díaz-Regañón, David; Villaescusa, Alejandra; Ayllón, Tania; Rodríguez-Franco, Fernando; García-Sancho, Mercedes; Agulla, Beatriz; Sainz, Ángel",Parasit Vectors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29554981/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2740-9,345

Methods: Available studies from PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and gray literature including reference list and conference abstracts were searched from December 1, 2019, through April 12, 2021. We included cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies that reported risk factors of contracting COVID-19 or its outcome in patients with MS on univariate or multivariate regression analyses. Results: Out of the initial 2719 records and 1553 conference abstracts, a total of 20 studies were included. Factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility were reported in 11 studies and risk factors for infection outcomes were discussed in 10. History of contact with an infected is strongly suggested as a risk factor for COVID-19 susceptibility. Other factors that could be associated with contracting infection are younger age, relapsing course, and anti-CD20 agents. The evidence suggests that increasing age, greater MS severity, treatment with anti-CD20 agents, previous use of corticosteroids, and specific comorbidities (obesity and coronary artery disease) could be independently associated with worse infection outcomes. Male sex is likely to be a risk factor for more severe disease. The black or African American race was reported as a possible risk factor. Conclusion: Due to a paucity of research and methodological issues, no risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and outcomes neither be confirmed nor excluded.

We make a novel contribution to the literature by testing whether the COVID-19 pandemic has changed this predictability relationship. Employing an empirical model that controls for seasonal effects, return-related control variables, heteroskedasticity, persistency, and endogeneity, we demonstrate that the influence of oil prices on stock returns declined by around 89.5% due to COVID-19. This implies that when COVID-19 reduced economic activity and destabilized financial markets, the influence of oil prices on stock returns declined. This finding could have implications for trading strategies that rely on oil prices.","Zhang, Fan; Narayan, Paresh Kumar; Devpura, Neluka",Financ Innov,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-021-00277-7,345

In 2018, the World NCD Federation selected the University of Michigan from seven universities around the world to host the 2nd World NCD Congress in 2020. For the scientific program, we defined an intersecting matrix of “risk factors” and “disease‐oriented” lenses for examining NCDs to highlight the multiple risk factors that contribute to major NCDs. Through deliberation with two committees representing over 50 individuals and 11 countries, eight risk factors were selected for the scientific program: social determinants of health and demographics, climate and environment, stress, sleep, substance use, nutrition, and physical activity, and genetics. These eight risk factors served as submission categories for a call for abstracts as well as topics for the planned plenary sessions. In April 2020, we pivoted our approach when meeting in person for a conference was no longer feasible. Building upon the risk factor model, we shifted the invited talks to invited articles for publication as a special collection for FASEB BioAdvances. We are delighted to launch this collection with 13 invited articles by 32 experts from ten countries. Significant transferable lessons about key risk factors and prevention of NCDs from this collection could be leveraged in various geographic areas and in settings with varying levels of resources, as they cover a diverse range of topics from community‐level interventions to indigenous leadership structures to national policies to intergovernmental programs.","Saran, Rajiv; Randolph, Elizabeth; Omollo, Kathleen Ludewig",FASEB Bioadv,https://doi.org/10.1096/fba.2020-00131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842850/,345

Le Laboratoire national de référence (LNR) de surveillance de la grippe et des autres viroses respiratoires a été désigné pour assurer cette tâche jusqu’au 27 mars, date à laquelle le réseau des laboratoires a été élargi pour augmenter la capacité nationale du testing. La présente étude rapporte l’expérience du LNR pendant la période où il a assuré à lui seul le diagnostic de la COVID-19 (6 février au 26 mars). Matériels et méthodes Après optimisation de la technique de RT-PCR en temps réel se basant sur le protocole de Hong Kong (gènes cibles N et ORF1b), l’analyse de 1913 prélèvements nasopharyngés a été réalisée. Les résultats étaient quotidiennement adressés à l’Observatoire national des maladies nouvelles et émergentes (ONMNE) pour assurer la surveillance, l’investigation et le contact tracing en cas de détection de cas positifs et ce afin de limiter l’extension de la maladie. Résultats Au cours de cette période, 229 (12 %) cas positifs ont été colligés. Le 2 mars, le premier cas a été diagnostiqué. Il s’agissait d’un cas importé d’Italie. Ce dernier a été placé en confinement. Le 10 mars, les deux premiers cas autochtones ont été identifiés. La capitale et les villes avoisinantes étaient les régions les plus touchées avec 113 (49,3 %) cas. Le sex-ratio était de 1,14 soit 122 hommes (53,3 %) et 107 de femmes (46,7 %). La moyenne d’âge était de 46,18 ans avec des extrêmes allant de 6 mois à 85 ans. La tranche d’âge entre 15 et 45 ans était la plus touchée avec une fréquence de 48,9 %. La transmission était autochtone chez 117 (51,1 %) patients, versus 112 (48 %) cas importés. La majorité des cas étaient symptomatiques (82,5 %). La fièvre (93 %), la toux (77 %) et l’asthénie (43 %) étaient les symptômes les plus rapportés. Les cas symptomatiques étaient significativement plus fréquents parmi les cas importés 93 % contre 72,6 % des cas autochtones avec un OR de 4,9 et un intervalle de confiance 95 %=[2,14–11,23]. Les mesures prises pour les malades asymptomatiques étaient l’auto-isolement à domicile (64,2 %) ou l’hébergement dans des centres de confinement (16,6 %).

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The atomic-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.","Wrapp, Daniel; Wang, Nianshuang; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Goldsmith, Jory A.; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Abiona, Olubukola; Graham, Barney S.; McLellan, Jason S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.944462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511295/,345

How to objectively and quantitatively differentiate pneumonia patients with and without COVID-19 virus remains clinical challenge. OBJECTIVE: To formulate standardized scoring criteria and an objective quantization standard to guide decision making in detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 virus induced pneumonia in clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective dataset includes computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 43 pneumonia patients with COVID-19 virus detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and 49 pneumonia patients without COVID-19 virus. All patients were treated during the same time period in two hospitals. Key indicators of differential diagnosis were identified in relevant literature and the scores were quantified namely, patients with more than 8 points were identified as high risk, those with 6–8 points as moderate risk, and those with fewer than 6 points as low risk for COVID-19 virus. In the study, 3 radiologists determined the scores for all patients. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were subsequently calculated. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients were determined as high risk, among which 42 were COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR tests. Next, 9 were identified as moderate risk, one of whom was COVID-19 positive. Last, 22 were classified into the low-risk group, all of them are COVID-19 negative. Based on these results, the sensitivity of detection COVID-19 positive cases between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was 0.98 with 95% confidence interval [0.88, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.61 [0.46, 0.75]. The detection sensitivity between the moderate-/high-risk group and the low-risk group was 1.00 [0.92, 1.00], and the specificity was 0.45 [0.31, 0.60]. CONCLUSION: The proposed quantitative scoring criteria showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity in detecting COVID-19 using CT images, which indicates that these criteria may be beneficial for screening in real-world practice and helpful for long-term disease control.","Li, Zicong; Zeng, Bingliang; Lei, Pinggui; Liu, Jiaqi; Fan, Bing; Shen, Qinglin; Pang, Peipei; Xu, Rongchun",Journal of X-ray science and technology,https://doi.org/10.3233/xst-200689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568167/,345

This study aims at exploring the occurrence of SP and or SM, risk factors, and outcomes in COVID‐19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with COVID‐19, which complicated into SP and/or SM at Hamad Medical Corporation (the principal public healthcare provider in Qatar) from March to September 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by CXR and CT. Between‐group comparisons were performed by using Chi‐square and t‐test. Differences were considered statistically significant at P ≤ .05. RESULTS: A total of 1100 patients were admitted, and 43 patients developed SP, SP + SM, or SM. Most patients were males (42/97.9%), and the most common comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (13/30.2%). All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most patients had low lung compliance at the time of developing SP or SM. Twenty‐two of the patients developed SP (51.2%), 11 patients had both SP and SM (25.6%), and 10 patients had SM only (23.3%). There was no significant difference in the development of SP or SM and patients' gender or blood group or whether patients were on invasive or noninvasive ventilation or even the mortality (P > .05). Lung compliance was significantly (P < .05) lower in patients complicated with SP and or SM. Patients with SP required significantly higher (P < .001) chest drain insertion. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia can complicate into SP and SM. These complications are more common in male diabetic patients. Patients with ARDS and having low lung compliance are at a higher risk of developing SP, SP + SM, or SM.","Shaikh, Nissar; Al Ameri, Gamal; Shaheen, Muhsen; Abdaljawad, Wael I.; Al Wraidat, Mohammad; Al Alawi, Abdul Aziz S.; Ali, Husain S.; Mohamed, Ahmed S.; Daeri, Hazem; Khatib, Mohamad Y.; Elshafei, Moustafa S.; Nashwan, Abdulqadir J.",Health Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355063/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.339,345
634411,Alternative screening protocols may miss most cases of gestational diabetes mellitus during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND: Hospital emergency departments play a crucial role in the initial assessment and management of suspected COVID-19 infection. This needs to be guided by studies of people presenting with suspected COVID-19, including those admitted and discharged, and those who do not ultimately have COVID-19 confirmed. We aimed to characterise patients attending emergency departments with suspected COVID-19, including subgroups based on sex, ethnicity and COVID-19 test results. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. Outcomes were admission to hospital, COVID-19 result, organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular or renal), and death, by record review at 30 days. Mean age was 58.4 years, 11200 (50.4%) were female and 11034 (49.6%) male. Adults (age >16 years) were acutely unwell (median NEWS2 score of 4), frequently had limited performance status (46.9%) and had high rates of admission (67.1%), COVID-19 positivity (31.2%), organ support (9.8%) and death (15.5%). Children had much lower rates of admission (27.4%), COVID-19 positivity (1.2%), organ support (1.4%) and death (0.3%). Similar numbers of men and women presented to the ED, but men were more likely to be admitted (72.9% v 61.4%), require organ support (12.2% v 7.7%) and die (18.2% v 13.0%). Black or Asian adults tended to be younger than White adults (median age 54, 50 and 67 years), were less likely to have impaired performance status (43.1%, 26.8% and 51.6%), be admitted to hospital (60.8%, 57.3%, 69.6%) or die (11.6%, 11.2%, 16.4%), but were more likely to require organ support (15.9%, 14.3%, 8.9%) or have a positive COVID-19 test (40.8%, 42.1%, 30.0%). Adults admitted with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 had similar age, performance status and comorbidities (except chronic lung disease) to those who did not have COVID-19 confirmed, but were much more likely to need organ support (22.2% v 8.9%) or die (32.1% v 15.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Important differences exist between patient groups presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19. Adults and children differ markedly and require different approaches to emergency triage. Admission and adverse outcome rates among adults suggest that policies to avoid unnecessary ED attendance achieved their aim. Subsequent COVID-19 confirmation confers a worse prognosis and greater need for organ support.

635082,Guiding Principles for Prioritization of Limited In-person Dermatology Appointments During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-07-16,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) focus primarily on ambulant patients. Results cannot be extrapolated to later disease stages due to a decline in targeted muscle tissue. In non‐ambulant DMD patients, hand function is relatively preserved and crucial for daily‐life activities. We used quantitative MRI (qMRI) to establish whether the thenar muscles could be valuable to monitor treatment effects in non‐ambulant DMD patients. METHODS: Seventeen non‐ambulant DMD patients (range 10.2–24.1 years) and 13 healthy controls (range 9.5–25.4 years) underwent qMRI of the right hand at 3 T at baseline. Thenar fat fraction (FF), total volume (TV), and contractile volume (CV) were determined using 4‐point Dixon, and T2(water) was determined using multiecho spin‐echo. Clinical assessments at baseline (n = 17) and 12 months (n = 13) included pinch strength (kg), performance of the upper limb (PUL) 2.0, DMD upper limb patient reported outcome measure (PROM), and playing a video game for 10 min using a game controller. Group differences and correlations were assessed with non‐parametric tests. RESULTS: Total volume was lower in patients compared with healthy controls (6.9 cm(3), 5.3–9.0 cm(3) vs. 13.0 cm(3), 7.6–15.8 cm(3), P = 0.010). CV was also lower in patients (6.3 cm(3), 4.6–8.3 cm(3) vs. 11.9 cm(3), 6.9–14.6 cm(3), P = 0.010). FF was slightly elevated (9.7%, 7.3–11.4% vs. 7.7%, 6.6–8.4%, P = 0.043), while T2(water) was higher (31.5 ms, 30.0–32.6 ms vs. 28.1 ms, 27.8–29.4 ms, P < 0.001). Pinch strength and PUL decreased over 12 months (2.857 kg, 2.137–4.010 to 2.243 kg, 1.930–3.339 kg, and 29 points, 20–36 to 23 points, 17–30, both P < 0.001), while PROM did not (49 points, 36–57 to 44 points, 30–54, P = 0.041). All patients were able to play for 10 min at baseline or follow‐up, but some did not comply with the study procedures regarding this endpoint. Pinch strength correlated with TV and CV in patients (rho = 0.72 and rho = 0.68) and controls (both rho = 0.89). PUL correlated with TV, CV, and T2(water) (rho = 0.57, rho = 0.51, and rho = −0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Low thenar FF, increased T2(water), correlation of muscle size with strength and function, and the decrease in strength and function over 1 year indicate that the thenar muscles are a valuable and quantifiable target for therapy in later stages of DMD. Further studies are needed to relate these data to the loss of a clinically meaningful milestone.","Naarding, Karin J.; Keene, Kevin R.; Sardjoe Mishre, Aashley S.D.; Veeger, Thom T.J.; van de Velde, Nienke M.; Prins, Arina J.; Burakiewicz, Jedrzej; Verschuuren, Jan J.G.M.; van der Holst, Menno; Niks, Erik H.; Kan, Hermien E.",J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963807/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12711,345

DESIGN: We conducted a rapid review of systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and risk of bias evaluation. A standardised extraction form was used. Data are reported narratively. INTERVENTIONS: We included systematic reviews of digital health interventions aiming to prevent, detect or manage mental health problems in individuals with a pre-existing chronic disease, including chronic mental health illnesses, published in 2010 or after. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reports on mental health outcomes (eg, anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms). RESULTS: We included 35 reviews, totalling 702 primary studies with a total sample of 50 692 participants. We structured the results in four population clusters: (1) chronic diseases, (2) cancer, (3) mental health and (4) children and youth. For populations presenting a chronic disease or cancer, health provider directed digital interventions (eg, web-based consultation, internet cognitive–behavioural therapy) are effective and safe. Further analyses are required in order to provide stronger recommendations regarding relevance for specific population (such as children and youth). Web-based interventions and email were the modes of administration that had the most reports of improvement.

METHODS: Fifty-six patients, who were admitted to the emergency clinic and diagnosed with COVID–19 infection, were included in the study. Data on clinical characteristics, inflammatory parameters and vitamin D status were recorded for each patient. All the participants had data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D status within the last 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The patients were stratified as those with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL and higher than 20 ng/mL. A group with vitamin D status less than 20 ng/mL had lower lymphocyte counts and lower haemoglobin levels that was statistically significant (respectively; p = 0.021, p = 0.035). Higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were seen in the vitamin D–deficient group (p = 0.013). It was observed that vitamin D status of the patients who required oxygen therapy were lower than those who did not require oxygen therapy, not statistically significant (p = 0.05). Patients who did not use vitamin D supplementation within 6 months prior to COVID-19 infection had more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Cases with lower vitamin D status had increased inflammatory markers and worse clinical outcomes than patients with higher vitamin D status.

The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish an exhaustive high-resolution map of blood antigen-presenting cells (APC) in 7 COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe pneumonia, at day-1 and day-4 post-admission, and two healthy donors. We generated a unique dataset of 31,513 high quality APC, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multiprocess and previously unrecognized defects in anti-viral immune defense in specific APC compartments from severe patients: i) increase of pro-apoptotic genes exclusively in pDC, which are key effectors of antiviral immunity, ii) sharp decrease of innate sensing receptors, TLR7 and DHX9, in pDC and cDC1, respectively, iii) down-regulation of antiviral effector molecules, including Interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in all monocyte subsets, and iv) decrease of MHC class II-related genes, and MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) activity in cDC2, suggesting a viral inhibition of antigen presentation. These novel mechanisms may explain patient aggravation and suggest strategies to restore defective immune defense.","Saichi, Melissa; Ladjemi, Maha Zohra; Korniotis, Sarantis; Rousseau, Christophe; Ait-Hamou, Zakaria; Massenet, Lucile; Amblard, Elise; Noel, Floriane; Marie, Yannick; Bouteiller, Delphine; Medvedovic, Jasna; Pène, Frédéric; Soumelis, Vassili",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.212837,345
636775,Stigma Towards Mental Illness at an Academic Tertiary Care Center in Lebanon,2021-07-20,"Background Electrolyte abnormalities are not uncommon in Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The data of several studies suggest that various electrolyte imbalances seem to be having impact on disease prognosis. However, no study in literature primarily focused on baseline electrolyte abnormalities’ effect on disease outcome. In this study, we assessed the validity of the hypothesis: “The baseline electrolyte imbalances may be related to unfavourable outcomes in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients”. Material-Methods Design of the study was retrospective and observational. We included 408 hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years old. Baseline levels of sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride were assessed. We evaluated the effect of those electrolytes’ abnormalities on intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation requirement, hospitalization duration and treatment outcome. Also, we clustered the patients based upon electrolyte levels. Thereafter, we compared the clusters according to outcome variables and then, we compared the frequency of other severe disease indices between the clusters. Lastly, we evaluated the independent factors related to COVID -19 associated deaths with multivariate analyse. Results 228 (55.8%) of the patients had at least one electrolyte imbalances at baseline. Hyponatremia was the most frequent electrolyte abnormality. Patients with hyponatremia, hypochloride or hypocalcemia respectively would have more frequent requirement of intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation; higher mortality rate and longer hospitalization. Moreover, the cluster associated with electrolyte abnormalities had unfavourable outcome. Also, clinical and laboratory features associated with severe disease were detected more often in those cluster. Furthermore, hyponatremia was found as one of the independent factors related to death from COVID-19 (OR 10.33; CI %95 1.62-65.62; p=0.01) Conclusion Baseline electrolyte imbalances, primarily hyponatremia would be related to poor prognosis in COVID-19 and baseline electrolyte assessment would be beneficial for evaluating the risk of severe COVID-19.","Tezcan, Mehmet Engin; Dogan gokce, Gizem; Sen, Nesrin; Zorlutuna kaymak, Nilufer; Ozer, Rasit Serdar",New Microbes New Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520301050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520301050?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904987/,345

Face shields are useful in stopping respiratory droplets from speading from the wearer to others. The droplets, which come into contact with the shield, are quickly spread over a large area, both transversely and vertically, over the shield, but with a shrinking concentration of droplets, as opposed to face masks, which appear to slide under the nose of the wearer or, worse, collapse entirely off the shield. Hence, a face- shield can be considered as personal protective equipment (PPE), which is a first line of resistance, utilized by the clinicians and forefront health workers for protection against the infectious body fluid and aerosols. Face-shields are mainly fabricated using polycarbonate material, because of their excellent optical transparency in UVA-visible-IR spectrum and mechanical properties.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients with HTN and COVID-19 with respect to different chronic antihypertensive drug intake. We performed a retrospective, observational study from a large cohort of patients with HTN and with a laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection admitted to the Emergency Rooms (ER) of the Piacenza Hospital network from February 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020. There were 1050 patients admitted to the ERs of the Piacenza Hospital network with COVID-19. HTN was present in 590 patients [median age, 76.2 years (IQR 68.2–82.6)]; 399 (66.1%) patients were male. Of them, 248 patients were chronically treated with ACEi, 181 with ARBs, and 161 with other drugs (O-drugs) including beta blockers, diuretics and calcium-channel inhibitors. With respect to the antihypertensive use, there was no difference between comorbid conditions. During a follow-up of 38 days (IQR 7.0–46.0), 256 patients (43.4%) died, without any difference stratifying for antihypertensive drugs. Of them, 107 (43.1%) were in ACEi group vs 67 (37%) in ARBs group vs 82 (50.7%) in O-drugs group, (log-rank test: p = 0.066). In patients with HTN and COVID-19, neither ACEi nor ARBs were independently associated with mortality. After adjusting for potential confounders in risk prediction, the rate of death was similar. Our data confirm Specialty Societal recommendations, suggesting that treatment with ACEIs or ARBs should not be discontinued because of COVID-19.","Rossi, Luca; Malagoli, Alessandro; Biagi, Andrea; Zanni, Alessia; Sticozzi, Concetta; Comastri, Greta; Pannone, Luigi; Gandolfi, Stefano; Vergara, Pasquale; Villani, Giovanni Quinto",Infection,https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-020-01550-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222020/,345

Conjunctivitis is also reported in a small number of cases. We evaluated ocular symptoms and ocular tropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 in a group of patients with COVID‐19. METHOD: Fifty‐six patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 were recruited as subjects. Relevant medical histories were obtained from the electronic medical record system. Ocular history and ocular symptoms data were obtained by communicating directly with the subjects. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Salisbury Eye Evaluation Questionnaire (SEEQ) were used to assess the anterior ocular surface condition before and after the onset of disease. RESULTS: Patients classified as severe COVID‐19 cases were more likely to have hypertension compared to mild cases (p = 0.035). Of the 56 subjects, thirteen patients (23%) were infected in Wuhan, 32 patients (57%) were community‐infected, 10 patients (18%) were unknown origin, 1 (2%) was a physician likely infected by a confirmed patient. Three patients wore face mask with precaution when contacting the confirmed patients. Fifteen (27%) had aggravated ocular symptoms, of which 6 (11%) had prodromal ocular symptoms before disease onset. The differences in mean scores of OSDI questionnaire and SEEQ between before and after onset of COVID‐19 were all significant (p < 0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Ocular symptoms are relatively common in COVID‐19 disease and may appear just before the onset of respiratory symptoms.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of continuous activity monitoring using an electronic activity tracker (AT) on exercise performance and fatigue of sarcoidosis patients, compared to controls (cohort study), and the effect of additional personal coaching (randomized trial) over a period of 3 months. Fifty-four sarcoidosis patients received an AT (Group Ia: 27 with coaching and Group Ib: 27 without). A historical group of sarcoidosis patients (Group II; n = 41) who did not follow a physical activity program served as controls. Exercise performance of patients wearing an AT (Group I) improved compared with controls (Group II), including the 6MWD, % predicted (∆4.4 ± 9.1 versus ∆0.7 ± 5.0, respectively), and fatigue levels decreased (∆−3.9 ± 5.7 versus ∆−1.8 ± 5.3). Patients with coaching (Group Ia) showed greater improvement of exercise capacity over time than patients without coaching (Group Ib) as shown by the Steep Ramp Test results (watts: ∆20.2 ± 33.8 versus ∆5.7 ± 26.4; and SRT, VO(2)max, % predicted: ∆1.6 ± 2.6 versus ∆0.7 ± 2.3). Sarcoidosis patients wearing an AT achieved improvement of exercise performance and reduction of fatigue. We therefore recommend encouraging sarcoidosis patients to wear an AT to stimulate physical activity and reduce fatigue. The additional benefit of coaching needs to be explored in future studies.","Drent, Marjolein; Elfferich, Marjon; Breedveld, Ellen; Vries, Jolanda De; Strookappe, Bert",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm10030097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842583/,345

Pathogen identification fails in approximately 20% of children but is critical for optimal treatment and prevention of hospital-acquired infections. We used two broad-spectrum detection strategies to identify pathogens in test-negative children with CAP and asymptomatic controls. METHODS. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs from 70 children <5 years with CAP of unknown etiology and 90 asymptomatic controls were tested by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and pan viral group (PVG) PCR for 19 viral families. Association of viruses with CAP was assessed by adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for season and age group. RESULTS. RNA-seq/PVG PCR detected previously missed, putative pathogens in 34% of patients. Putative viral pathogens included human parainfluenza virus 4 (aOR 9.3, P = .12), human bocavirus (aOR 9.1, P < .01), Coxsackieviruses (aOR 5.1, P = .09), rhinovirus A (aOR 3.5, P = .34), and rhinovirus C (aOR 2.9, P = .57). RNA-seq was more sensitive for RNA viruses whereas PVG PCR detected more DNA viruses. CONCLUSIONS. RNA-seq and PVG PCR identified additional viruses, some known to be pathogenic, in NP/OP specimens from one-third of children hospitalized with CAP without a previously identified etiology.

Assigning blame to a virus takes attention away from the structural contradictions and instabilities of capitalism that would have led to a crash in any case. This narrative also helps justify non-evidence-based public health policies, including lockdowns, travel bans, closed schools and factories, and forced quarantines of large populations rather than individuals and clustered groups who harbor the infection. Advantages of such drastic measures happen primarily in countries that did not prepare adequately, that did not respond quickly enough with more focused measures to test and isolate people infected with the virus, and that have health care systems either organized by capitalist principles or suffering cutbacks and privatization as a result of capitalist economic ideologies, such as austerity. Authoritarian tactics purportedly intended to protect public health pave the way to antidemocratic rule, militarism, and fascism. These harsh policies also exert their most adverse effects on poor, minority, incarcerated, immigrant, and otherwise marginalized populations, who already suffer from the worsening economic inequality that global, financialized capitalism has fostered.","Waitzkin, Howard",Int J Health Serv,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420977711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33297807/,345

However, the role of such agents as prophylactic tools is still not clear. METHODS: This is a retrospective study based on a large healthcare computerized database including all patients that were screened for the “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2” (SARS-CoV-2) in the study period from February 23rd 2020 to March 31st 2020. A comparison was conducted between subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those found negative in terms of rate of administration of hydroxychloroquine/colchicine therapy. RESULTS: An overall sample of 14,520 subjects were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 1317 resulted positive. No significant difference was found in terms of rates of usage of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine between those who were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who were found negative (0.23% versus 0.25% for hydroxychloroquine, and 0.53% versus 0.48% for colchicine, respectively).

643109,"Assessment of adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Benin Republic, West Africa",2021-03-22,"Background Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases such as the novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19 and Ebola pose a significant threat to global society and test the public health community’s preparedness to rapidly respond to an outbreak with effective diagnostics and therapeutics. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies enable rapid generation of pathogen genome sequence data, within 24 hours of obtaining a sample in some instances. With these data, one can quickly evaluate the effectiveness of existing diagnostics and therapeutics using in silico approaches. The propensity of some viruses to rapidly accumulate mutations can lead to the failure of molecular detection assays creating the need for redesigned or newly designed assays. Results Here we describe a bioinformatics system named BioLaboro to identify signature regions in a given pathogen genome, design PCR assays targeting those regions, and then test the PCR assays in silico to determine their sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate BioLaboro with two use cases: Bombali Ebolavirus (BOMV) and the novel Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). For the BOMV, we analyzed 30 currently available real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays against the three available complete genome sequences of BOMV. Only two met our in silico criteria for successful detection and neither had perfect matches to the primer/probe sequences. We designed five new primer sets against BOMV signatures and all had true positive hits to the three BOMV genomes and no false positive hits to any other sequence. Four assays are closely clustered in the nucleoprotein gene and one is located in the glycoprotein gene. Similarly, for the SARS-CoV-2, we designed five highly specific primer sets that hit all 145 whole genomes (available as of February 28, 2020) and none of the near neighbors. Conclusions Here we applied BioLaboro in two real-world use cases to demonstrate its capability; 1) to identify signature regions, 2) to assess the efficacy of existing PCR assays to detect pathogens as they evolve over time, and 3) to design new assays with perfect in silico detection accuracy, all within hours, for further development and deployment. BioLaboro is designed with a user-friendly graphical user interface for biologists with limited bioinformatics experience.","Holland, Mitchell; Negrón, Daniel; Mitchell, Shane; Dellinger, Nate; Ivancich, Mychal; Barrus, Tyler; Thomas, Sterling; Jennings, Katharine W.; Goodwin, Bruce; Sozhamannan, Shanmuga",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.031963,345

In this sub-study of the ODIN-study, the objectives were to determine whether the Danish lockdown and home confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic affected changes in emotional-behavioral functioning of pre-school-aged children using the validated Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) answered by parents shortly before lockdown and 3 weeks into lockdown, and moreover, to examine whether baseline family and social characteristics could predict change in child emotional-behavioral functioning during lockdown. Parents of 40 (82%) children with a mean(SD) age of 5.0(0.7) completed the baseline questionnaire and the lockdown follow-up questionnaire. The SDQ-Total difficulties score (SDQ-TD) and Prosocial Behavioral score (PSB) changed significantly from pre- to lockdown [SDQ-TD mean(SD): 6.0(3.8) and 7.9(5.2); P = 0.02, respectively and PSB mean(SD): 8.5(1.4) and 7.9(1.5); P = 0.03, respectively].

In conclusion, the study showed a modest decrease in child-emotional behavioral functioning during the COVID-19 lockdown, potentially due to parental stress. Although these results might not be generalizable due to small sample size and selected population, the results point to a need of a greater awareness of child mental wellbeing during a lockdown situation.","Specht, Ina Olmer; Rohde, Jeanett Friis; Nielsen, Ann-Kristine; Larsen, Sofus Christian; Heitmann, Berit Lilienthal",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135810/,345

Using an interpretive description methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with five coaches, six players, and six parents from an English elite academy soccer club. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings highlighted (a) the importance of support and the different means of communication used between members of the athletic triangle to facilitate such support; (b) the increased understanding of each member of the athletic triangle, leading to enhanced relationships, and; (c) how members of the athletic triangle adapted practice to facilitate relationship development during the pandemic and beyond. The identification of these considerations has implications for coach and parent education initiatives to allow for optimal functioning of the athletic triangle as elite academy soccer clubs return from lockdown.

Care has been transformed by the crisis, but enduring lessons have been learned. In this article, we review how COVID-19 will impact cirrhosis care. We describe how this impact unfolds over 3 waves; i) an intense period with prioritized high-acuity care with delayed elective procedures and routine care during physical distancing, ii) a challenging ‘return to normal’ following the end of physical distancing, with increased emergent decompensations, morbidity, and systems of care overwhelmed by the backlog of deferred care, and iii) a protracted period of suboptimal outcomes characterized by missed diagnoses, progressive disease and loss to follow-up. We outline the concrete steps required to preserve the quality of care provided to patients with cirrhosis. This includes an intensification of the preventative care provided to patients with compensated cirrhosis, proactive chronic disease management, robust telehealth programs, and a reorganization of care delivery to provide a full service of care with flexible clinical staffing. Managing the pandemic of a serious chronic disease in the midst of a global infectious pandemic is challenging.

We have developed a novel, group-based, CBT-program for NREM parasomnias (CBT-NREMP), with the primary aim of reducing NREM parasomnia severity with relatively few treatment sessions. Methods: We investigated the effectiveness of CBT-NREMP in 46 retrospectively-identified patients, who completed five outpatient therapy sessions. The outcomes pre- and post- CBT-NREMP treatment on clinical measures of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), NREM parasomnias (Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale) and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), were retrospectively collected and analyzed. In order to investigate the temporal stability of CBT-NREMP, we also assessed a subgroup of 8 patients during the 3 to 6 months follow-up period. Results: CBT-NREMP led to a reduction in clinical measures of NREM parasomnia, insomnia, and anxiety and depression severities [pre- vs. post-CBT-NREMP scores: P (Insomnia Severity Index) = 0.000054; P (Paris Arousal Disorders Severity Scale) = 0.00032; P (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) = 0.037]. Improvements in clinical measures of NREM parasomnia and insomnia severities were similarly recorded for a subgroup of eight patients at follow-up, demonstrating that patients continued to improve post CBT-NREMP. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that group CBT-NREMP intervention is a safe, effective and promising treatment for NREM parasomnia, especially when precipitating and perpetuating factors are behaviorally and psychologically driven. Future randomized controlled trials are now required to robustly confirm these findings.","O'Regan, David; Nesbitt, Alexander; Biabani, Nazanin; Drakatos, Panagis; Selsick, Hugh; Leschziner, Guy D.; Steier, Joerg; Birdseye, Adam; Duncan, Iain; Higgins, Seán; Kumari, Veena; Stokes, Paul R.; Young, Allan H.; Rosenzweig, Ivana",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276446/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.679272,345
645570,Justifying quarantine in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare,2021-08-29,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the need for rapid implementation of diagnostic assays for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in respiratory specimens. While multiple molecular methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, supply chain constraints and need for easier and safer specimen collection warrant alternative specimen types, particularly saliva. Although saliva has been found to be a comparable clinical matrix for detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of diagnostic and analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we compared two methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva: the Roche cobas(R) 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test and the Agena Biosciences MassARRAY(R) SARS-CoV-2 Panel/MassARRAY(R) System. Overall, both systems had high agreement with one another, and both demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of each platform and determined the limit of detection of the Roche assay was four times lower than that of Agena for saliva specimens (390.6 v. 1,562.5 copies/mL). Furthermore, across individual target components of each assay, T2 and N2 targets had the lowest limits of detection for each platform, respectively. Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection in two technologies that have high agreement and differ in analytical sensitivities overall and across individual component targets. The addition of saliva as an acceptable specimen and understanding the sensitivity for testing on these platforms can further inform public health measures for screening and detection to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hernandez, M.

646124,Experiences of critical care nurses fighting against COVID‐19: A qualitative phenomenological study,2021-04-24,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, and it was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students’ awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps. METHODS: A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants’ awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status. CONCLUSIONS: Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them. Improving the digital health literacy of university students in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental health care apps and the treatment methods and benefits of the apps, as well as involving students in the app creation process, may encourage students to use these tools for mental health care.","Drissi, Nidal; Alhmoudi, Ayat; Al Nuaimi, Hana; Alkhyeli, Mahra; Alsalami, Shaikha; Ouhbi, Sofia",JMIR Form Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32969340/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19876,345

In this study, the ACE was purified and characterized from sheep lung. The kinetic properties of the ACE were designated. The inhibition effect of captopril, a specific ACE inhibitor, was determined. ACE was purified from sheep lung using the affinity chromatography method in one step. NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow as column filler and lisinopril as a ligand in this method used. The molecular weight and purity of ACE were designated using the SDS-PAGE method. Optimum temperature and optimum pH were found for purified ACE. K(M) and V(max) values from Lineweaver–Burk charts determined. The inhibition type, IC(50), and K(i) values of captopril on purified ACE were identified. ACE was 6405-fold purified from sheep lung by affinity chromatography in one step and specific activity was 16871 EU/mg protein. The purity and molecular weight of ACE were found with SDS-PAGE and observed two bands at around 60 kDa and 70 kDa on the gel. Optimum temperature and optimum pH were designated for purified ACE. Optimum temperature and pH were found as 40 °C and pH 7.4, respectively. V(max) and K(M) values were calculated to be 35.59 (µmol/min).mL(−1) and 0.18 mM, respectively. IC(50) value of captopril was found as 0.51 nM. The inhibition type of captopril was determined as non-competitive from the Lineweaver–Burk graph and the K(i) value was 0.39 nM. As a result, it was observed in this study that the ACE enzyme can be successfully purified from sheep lungs in one step.

To evaluate if combination of chest CT with RT-PCR can supplement the shortage of RT-PCR in diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted a prospective study on 103 male patients. The study population were divided into two groups; early COVID-19 stage (number = 50 patients, with positive RT-PCR but mild symptoms) and progressive COVID-19 stage (number = 53, positive RT-PCR and sever symptoms including fever > 37.5 °C, cough, and shortness of breath). All patients underwent CT imaging. The early stage included typical category; 34% (17 out of 50 cases), 6% indeterminate category (3 cases), 10% atypical category (5 cases) and 50% (25 cases) were normal CT imaging. The progressive stage included typical category that was further divided to five subgroups; (i) peripheral bilateral lower lobe ground-glass opacity (GGO) in (37.7%), (ii) peripheral bilateral lower lobes GGO with peribronchovascular consolidation and bronchiolar dilatation in (18.8%), (iii) peripheral bilateral lower lobes GGO with crazy paving appearance in (15%), (iv) bilateral diffuse GGO in (18.8%), and (v) peripheral bilateral GGO with mediastinal lymph node enlargement (9.4%).

However, to realize this bio-medical potential, a high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map is required in order to accomplish disease and phenotype association discovery. DESCRIPTION: To remedy this, we generated 3,178,297 paired fosmid-end Sanger sequence reads from seven cats, and combined these data with the publicly available 2X cat whole genome sequence. All sequence reads were assembled together to form a 3X whole genome assembly allowing the discovery of over three million SNPs. To reduce potential false positive SNPs due to the low coverage assembly, a low upper-limit was placed on sequence coverage and a high lower-limit on the quality of the discrepant bases at a potential variant site. In all domestic cats of different breeds: female Abyssinian, female American shorthair, male Cornish Rex, female European Burmese, female Persian, female Siamese, a male Ragdoll and a female African wildcat were sequenced lightly. We report a total of 964 k common SNPs suitable for a domestic cat SNP genotyping array and an additional 900 k SNPs detected between African wildcat and domestic cats breeds. An empirical sampling of 94 discovered SNPs were tested in the sequenced cats resulting in a SNP validation rate of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a large collection of mapped feline SNPs across the cat genome that will allow for the development of SNP genotyping platforms for mapping feline diseases.","Mullikin, James C; Hansen, Nancy F; Shen, Lei; Ebling, Heather; Donahue, William F; Tao, Wei; Saranga, David J; Brand, Adrianne; Rubenfield, Marc J; Young, Alice C; Cruz, Pedro; Driscoll, Carlos; David, Victor; Al-Murrani, Samer WK; Locniskar, Mary F; Abrahamsen, Mitchell S; O'Brien, Stephen J; Smith, Douglas R; Brockman, Jeffrey A",BMC Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-11-406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20576142/,345

648123,Threats of COVID-19 to Achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in Africa,2020-12-15,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread globally. Therapeutic options including antivirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, and vaccines are still under study. Convalescent plasma(CP) immunotherapy was an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. In the epidemic of COVID-19, a large number of literatures reported the application of CP. However, there is controversy over the efficacy of CP therapy for COVID-19. This systematic review was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to CP immunotherapy for COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Clinical Key, Wanfang Database; China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) were used to search for the proper keywords such as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, plasma, serum, immunoglobulins, blood transfusion, convalescent, novel coronavirus, immune and the related words for publications published until 15.10.2020. Other available resources were also used to identify relevant articles. The present systematic review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 45 articles were included in the final review. First, meta-analysis results of RCTs showed that, there were no statistically significant differences between CP transfusion and the control group in terms of reducing mortality(OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52–1.19, I(2) = 28%) and improving clinical symptoms(OR 1.21, 95%CI 0.68–2.16; I(2) = 0%). The results of controlled NRSIs showed that CP therapy may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients(RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.53–0.66, I(2) = 0%). Second, limited safety data suggested that CP is a well-tolerated therapy with a low incidence of adverse events. But, due to lack of safety data for the control group, it is really not easy to determine whether CP transfusion has an impact on moderate to serious AEs. Thirdly, for children, pregnant, elderly, tumor and immunocompromised patients, CP may be a well-tolerated therapy, if the disease cannot be controlled and continues to progress. Studies were commonly of low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with COVID-19 within ten days of illness. We speculate that CP may be a possible treatment option. High-quality studies are needed for establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and provide close pharmaceutical care.","Wang, Ying; Huo, Pengfei; Dai, Rulin; Lv, Xin; Yuan, Shaofei; Zhang, Yang; Guo, Yiming; Li, Rui; Yu, Qian; Zhu, Kun",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920337292; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338863/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920337292,345

649021,Assistive Technologies in Dementia Care: An Updated Analysis of the Literature,2021-03-24,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-induced murine neuroinflammation serves as a model to study acute meningoencephalomyelitis, hepatitis, and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination; which mimics certain pathologies of the human neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation occurs due to direct glial cell dystrophy instigated by central nervous system (CNS)-resident microglia and astrocytes, in contrast to peripheral CD4+T cell-mediated myelin damage prevalent in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Viral envelope Spike glycoprotein-mediated cell-to-cell fusion is an essential mechanistic step for MHV-induced CNS pathogenicity. Although Azadirachta indica (Neem), a traditional phytomedicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and spermicidal activities, not much is known about anti-neuroinflammatory properties of its bark (NBE) in MHV-induced acute neuroinflammation and chronic demyelination. Recombinant demyelinating MHV strain (RSA59) was preincubated with NBE to arrest the infection-initiation event, and its effect on viral replication, viral transcription, cytokine expression, and successive pathogenicity were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Virus-free Luciferase assay explained NBE’s anti-virus-to-cell fusion activity in vitro. Intracranial inoculation of RSA59 preincubated with NBE into the mouse brain significantly reduces acute hepatitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, and chronic progressive demyelination. Additionally, NBE effectively restricts viral entry, dissemination in CNS, viral replication, viral transcription, and expression of the viral nucleocapsid and inflammatory cytokines. From mechanistic standpoints, RSA59 preincubated with NBE reduced viral entry, viral replication and cell-to-cell fusion, as a mode of viral dissemination. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection with NBE (25 mg/kg B.W.) into mice revealed a significant reduction in viral Nucleocapsid protein expression in vivo. Conclusively, A. indica bark extract may directly bind to the virus-host attachment Spike glycoprotein and suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication. Further studies will focus on combining bioanalytical assays to isolate potential NBE bioactive compound(s) that contribute towards the anti-viral activity of NBE.","Sarkar, Lucky; Putchala, Ravi Kiran; Safiriyu, Abass Alao; Das Sarma, Jayasri",Front Cell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32477069/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00116,345

This is the aim of the current study. We analyzed data corresponding to the period from February 1 to May 31, 2020 for the City of Madrid. As meteorological variables, maximum daily temperature (Tmax) in ºC and mean daily absolute humidity (AH) in g/m(3) were used corresponding to the mean values recorded by all Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) observatories in the Madrid region. Atmospheric pollutant data for PM(10) and NO(2) in µg/m(3) for the Madrid region were provided by the Spanish Environmental Ministry (MITECO). Daily incidence, daily hospital admissions per 100.000 inhabitants, daily ICU admissions and daily death rates per million inhabitants were used as dependent variables. These data were provided by the ISCIII Spanish National Epidemiology Center. Generalized linear models with Poisson link were performed between the dependent and independent variables, controlling for seasonality, trend and the autoregressive nature of the series. RESULTS: The results of the single-variable models showed a negative association between Tmax and all of the dependent variables considered, except in the case of deaths, in which lower temperatures were associated with higher rates. AH also showed the same behavior with the COVID-19 variables analyzed and with the lags, similar to those obtained with Tmax. In terms of atmospheric pollutants PM(10) and NO(2,) both showed a positive association with the dependent variables. Only PM(10) was associated with the death rate. Associations were established between lags 12 and 21 for PM(10) and between 0 and 28 for NO(2), indicating a short-term association of NO(2) with the disease. In the two-variable models, the role of NO(2) was predominant compared to PM(10). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the environmental variables analyzed are related to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in the Community of Madrid. In general, low temperatures and low humidity in the atmosphere affect the spread of the virus. Air pollution, especially NO(2,) is associated with a higher incidence and severity of the disease. The impact that these environmental factors are small (in terms of relative risk) and by themselves cannot explain the behavior of the incidence and severity of COVID-19.","Linares, Cristina; Belda, Fernando; López-Bueno, José Antonio; Luna, M.

This is a retrospective study based in Sabah, Malaysia, examining the prevalence of COVID-19 infection following musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection from 1 December 2019 until 30 June 2020 in the sports medicine clinic and the orthopedic clinic. Patients who received musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection were called by telephone and asked about visits to the emergency department or government health clinic for influenza-like illness symptoms or severe acute respiratory infection that would require screening of COVID-19. Thirty-five patients who responded to the call were included, with mean ages of 47.9 years ± 15.1. 52% were male respondents, while 48% were female. 25% of them were diabetics, and 2.9% of them had a history of lymphoproliferative disorders. The mean pain score before injection was 6.74 ± 1.03 and after injection pain was 2.27 ± 1.63. In this study, there were 11.4% (n = 4) with minor complications of steroid injection, that is, skin discoloration. Nonetheless, there were no severe complications due to corticosteroids reported. There were no reported cases of COVID-19 among the respondents following corticosteroid injection. Musculoskeletal pain would affect a person's well-being and activities; thus, its management requires that careful consideration with risk-benefit analysis be made before administering musculoskeletal corticosteroid injection during COVID-19 pandemic.","Azwan Aziz, Mohamad; Abu Hanifah, Redzal; Mohd Nahar, Azmi Mohamed",Adv Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824767/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8863210,345

METHOD: A total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in this open uncontrolled prospective cohort study. Rapid lateral flow tests, detecting a combination of IgM and IgM against SARS-CoV-2), two different types of CLIA (Diasorin, Roche), RT-PCR tests and serum neutralization tests (SNTs) were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4 ± 7.7 (Min = 30, Max = 64) days. Positive participants were re-tested with CLIA/SNT at a third time point after 188.0 ± 12.8 days. RESULTS: Only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.82%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among positively tested participants in either test, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding 6 weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%). Based on the neutralization test as the true condition, the rapid antibody test performed better on serum than whole blood as 84.6% instead of 65.4% could be detected correctly. Concerning both CLIA tests overall the Roche test detected 24 (sensitivity = 88.9%) and the Diasorin test 22 positive participants (sensitivity = 81.5%). In participants with a positive SNT result, a significant drop in neutralizing antibody titre from 31.8 ± 22.9 (Md = 32.0) at T1 to 26.1 ± 17.6 (Md = 21.3) at T2 to 21.4 ± 13.4 (Md = 16.0) at T3 (χ(2) = 23.848, df = 2, p < 0.001) was observed (χ(2) = 23.848, df = 2, p < 0.001)—with an average time of 42.4 ± 7.7 days between T1 and T2 and 146.9 ± 13.8 days between T2 and T3. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period (May 11th–August 3rd) only 0.82% were tested positive for antibodies in our study cohort.

The objective of the study was to identify if hypothermia in a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a higher than expected mortality. Methods We reviewed 331 charts from patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 between March 9 to April 20, 2020. Results The probability of death was 2.06 times higher for those with hypothermia than those without [95% C.I. (1.25, 3.38)]. In ventilated patients, there were 32 deaths. Of those, 75% had been hypothermic. In a prior review of 10,000 non-SARS-CoV-2 patients with sepsis, the mortality rate in patients with hypothermia was 47%. Reviewed studies demonstrated a range of expected mortality rates in patients with ventilator dependent respiratory failure and sepsis. In comparison, our study shows that within a group of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 and hypothermia, the mortality rate exceeded those rates. Conclusion Our review showed a significant association between hypothermia and death (p = 0.0033). Predictors of mortality in SARS-CoV-2 disease can expedite earlier aggressive care. Additionally, in areas with limited resources or overburdened healthcare systems, there may be a need for resource allocation management and information about mortality risk may be helpful.","Fatteh, Naaz; Sutherland, Glen E.; Santos, Radleigh G.; Zeidan, Rita; Gastesi, Alexandra P.; Naranjo, Christopher D.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221004331; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.05.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004328/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221004331?v=s5,345

Methods: Autopsy tissues from two COVID-19 patients, one of whom died after a month-long hospitalization with multi-organ involvement while the other died after a few days of respiratory symptoms, were evaluated using multi-scale RNASeq methods (bulk, single-nuclei, and spatial RNASeq next-generation sequencing) to provide unprecedented molecular resolution of COVID-19 induced damage. Findings: Comparison of infected/uninfected tissues revealed four major regulatory pathways. Effectors within these pathways could constitute novel therapeutic targets, including the complement receptor C3AR1, calcitonin-like receptor or decorin. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing of olfactory bulb and prefrontal cortex highlighted remarkable diversity of coronavirus receptors. Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 was rarely expressed, while Basignin showed diffuse expression, and alanyl aminopeptidase was associated with vascular/mesenchymal cell types. Comparison of lung and lymph node tissues from patients with different symptomatology with Digital Spatial Profiling resulted in distinct molecular phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 is a far more complex and heterogeneous disease than initially anticipated. Evaluation of COVID-19 rapid autopsy tissues with advanced molecular techniques can identify pathways and effectors at play in individual patients, measure the staggering diversity of receptors in specific brain areas and other well-defined tissue compartments at the single-cell level, and help dissect differences driving diverging clinical courses among patients. Extension of this approach to larger datasets will substantially advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind COVID-19 pathophysiology.

Secondary analysis was undertaken of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to women’s needs; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions. Safeguarding and other risk assessment procedures must remain robust in spite of modifications made to service delivery during pandemics.","Wilson, C.

659225,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on community services for homebound older adults in New York City,2021,"Abstract We investigated changes in traffic-related air pollutant concentrations in an urban area during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study area was in a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Somerville (MA, USA), where traffic is the dominant source of air pollution. Measurements were conducted between March 27 and May 14, 2020, coinciding with a dramatic reduction in traffic (71% drop in car and 46% drop in truck traffic) due to business shutdowns and a statewide stay-at-home advisory. Indicators of fresh vehicular emissions (ultrafine particle number concentration [PNC] and black carbon [BC]) were measured with a mobile monitoring platform on an interstate highway and major and minor roadways. Depending on road class, median PNC and BC contributions from traffic were 60–68% and 22–46% lower, respectively, during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic conditions. A higher BC:PNC concentration ratio was observed during the lockdown period perhaps indicative of the higher fraction of diesel vehicles in the fleet during the lockdown. Overall, the scale of reductions in ultrafine particle and BC concentrations was commensurate with the reductions in traffic. This natural experiment allowed us to quantify the direct impacts of reductions in traffic emissions on neighborhood-scale air quality, which are not captured by the regional regulatory-monitoring network. Results underscore the importance of measurements of appropriate proxies for traffic emissions at relevant spatial scales. Our results are also useful for exposure analysts, and city, and regional planners evaluating traffic-related air pollution impact mitigation strategies.","Hudda, Neelakshi; Simon, Matthew C.; Patton, Allison P.; Durant, John L.",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720344600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747009/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720344600?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140931,345

This study aims to identify the characteristics of patients in whom imaging progression occurred while clinical symptoms were relieved and to guide radiological reexamination. METHODS: This retrospective study included 73 patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. All patients received CT reexaminations within 24 h after symptomatic remission. We divided patients into two groups according to the matching degree between clinical and imaging outcomes. RESULTS: 21 patients displayed imaging progression while symptoms relieved. Patients with imaging progression were prone to be advanced in age [years: 60 (46–65) v 47 (37–60.75), P = 0.030]; lymphopenia (66.7% v 40.4%, P = 0.042) and low level of C-reactive protein [mg/L: 5.7 (1.9–20.2) v 18.9 (6.7–38.9), P = 0.038]. An age over 50 was an independent risk factor for imaging progression (OR = 3.41, 95%CI 1.14–10.20, P = 0.028). In CT images, they were inclined to present lesions with clear border (94.7% v 64.7%, P = 0.012), pure peripheral distribution (89.5% v 39.2%, P < 0.001), without bilateral lungs involved (57.9% v 29.4%, P = 0.028) especially with left lung involved only (42.1% v 17.6%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: In order to improve the therapeutic effect, the interval before radiological follow-up should be shortened appropriately especially in patients over the age of 50.

Limited epidemiological data on the infections exists in key populations (KPs) in South Africa. We investigated the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV and selected risk factors among these KPs to inform effective responses. METHODS: We used convenience sampling to recruit a targeted 3500 KPs accessing HIV-related health services across Cape Town (SWs, MSM, PWUD/ID), Durban (SWs, PWUD/ID), Pietermaritzburg (SWs), Mthatha (SWs), Port Elizabeth (SWs), Johannesburg (MSM) and Pretoria (MSM and PWUD/ID) into a cross-sectional survey. An interviewer questionnaire to assess socio-demographic characteristics, drug use and sexual risk practices, was administered. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg); HCV antibody, viral load and genotype, and HIV antibody, was tested. RESULTS: Among the 3439 people included in the study (1528 SWs, 746 MSM, 1165 PWUD/ID) the median age was 29 years, most participants were black African (60%), and 24% reported homelessness. 82% reported substance use in the last month, including alcohol (46%) and heroin (33%). 75% were sexually active in the previous month, with condom use at last sex at 74%. HIV prevalence was 37% (highest among SWs at 47%), HBsAg prevalence 4% (similar across KPs) and HCV prevalence was 16% (highest among PWUD/ID at 46%). CONCLUSIONS: HBV, HCV and HIV pose a health burden for KPs in South Africa. While HIV is key for all included KPs, HCV is of particular importance to PWUD/ID. For KPs, HBV vaccination and behavioural change interventions that support consistent condom and lubricant access and use are needed. Coverage of opioid substitution therapy and needle and syringe services, and access to HCV treatment for PWUD/ID need to be expanded.","Scheibe, Andrew; Young, Katherine; Versfeld, Anna; Spearman, C.

Remotely delivered therapy could be of particular benefit for people with social anxiety disorder (SAD), who tend to avoid or delay seeking face-to-face therapy, often due to anxiety about travelling to appointments and meeting mental health professionals in person. Individual cognitive therapy for SAD (CT-SAD), based on the Clark and Wells (1995) model, is a highly effective treatment that is recommended as a first-line intervention in NICE guidance (NICE, 2013). All of the key features of face-to-face CT-SAD (including video feedback, attention training, behavioural experiments and memory-focused techniques) can be adapted for remote delivery. In this paper, we provide guidance for clinicians on how to deliver CT-SAD remotely, and suggest novel ways for therapists and patients to overcome the challenges of carrying out a range of behavioural experiments during remote treatment delivery.

The commonest symptoms of COVID‐19 disease are fever, cough, anosmia, and lymphocytopenia. However, other apparently less common clinical symptoms have been described, including skin lesions. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate skin involvement in COVID‐19. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review of literature, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA). The search was reiterated until May 06, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 1593 patients (M/F ratio: 1 : 9) with suspect of COVID‐19 were examined. The mean age was 37.8 (range 0–91) years. Among the analyzed patients, 84 (5.3%) were pediatrics (<18 years). Chilblains are very common among skin lesions and represent almost half of all skin lesions reported (46%); in 75% of patients with cutaneous manifestation, the latter presented before other typical clinical manifestation of COVID‐19. Vasculitis or thrombosis was identified in almost 70% of patients who suffered from skin manifestations. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the importance of skin involvement in COVID‐19. Limbs should be examined to eventually foresee the onset of further typical symptoms. Chilblains can be considered typical features. Studies with higher scientific evidence are required.","Perna, Andrea; Passiatore, Marco; Massaro, Antonio; Terrinoni, Alessandro; Bianchi, Luca; Cilli, Vitale; D’Orio, Marco; Proietti, Luca; Taccardo, Giuseppe; De Vitis, Rocco",Int J Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijd.15414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533036/,345

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of these CTA findings and their relation to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter institutional review board-approved study, assessment was made of CTA findings of code patients who had a stroke between March 16 and April 5, 2020 at six hospitals across New York City. Demographic data, comorbidities, COVID-19 status, and neurological findings were collected. Assessment of COVID-19 related lung findings on CTA was made blinded to COVID-19 status. Incidence rates of COVID-19 related apical findings were assessed in all code patients who had a stroke and in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of a total of 118 patients with mean±SD age of 64.9±15.7 years and 57.6% (68/118) were male. Among all code patients who had a stroke, 28% (33/118) had COVID-19 related lung findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in 93.9% (31/33) of these patients with apical CTA findings. Among patients who had a stroke confirmed by imaging, 37.5% (18/48) had COVID-19 related apical findings. RT-PCR was positive for COVID-19 in all (18/18) of these patients with apical findings. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 related lung findings in stroke CTA scans was 28% in all code patients who had a stroke and 37.5% in patients with a stroke confirmed by imaging. Stroke teams should closely assess the lung apices during this COVID-19 pandemic as CTA findings may be the first indicator of COVID-19 infection.","Kihira, Shingo; Schefflein, Javin; Chung, Michael; Mahmoudi, Keon; Rigney, Brian; Delman, Bradley N; Mocco, J; Doshi, Amish; Belani, Puneet",J Neurointerv Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430481/; https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016188,345
665424,Silver-lining in the Time of Mayhem: The Role of Local Governments of Nepal During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-30,"Background: Current UK National Health Service (NHS) guidelines recommend appendicectomy as gold standard treatment for acute uncomplicated appendicitis. However, an alternative non-surgical management involves administrating antibiotic-only therapy with significantly lower costs. Therefore, a UK-based cost-utility analysis (CUA) was performed to compare appendicectomy with an antibiotic-only treatment from an NHS perspective. Methods: This economic evaluation modelled health-outcome data using the ACTUAA (2021) prospective multicentre trial. The non-randomised control trial followed 318 patients given either antibiotic therapy or appendicectomy, with quality of life (QOL) assessed using the SF-12 questionnaires administered 1-year post-treatment. A CUA was conducted over a 1-year time horizon, measuring benefits in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in pound sterling using a propensity score-matched approach to control for selection based on observable factors. Results: The CUA produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of −GBP 23,278.51 (−EUR 27,227.80) per QALY. Therefore, for each QALY gained using antibiotic-only treatment instead of appendicectomy, an extra GBP 23,278.51 was saved. Additionally, two sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for post-operative or post-treatment complications. The antibiotic-only option remained dominant in both scenarios. Conclusion: While the results do not rely on a randomized sample, the analysis based on a 1-year follow-up suggested that antibiotics were largely more cost-effective than appendicectomy and led to improved QOL outcomes for patients. The ICER value of −GBP 23,278.51 demonstrates that the NHS must give further consideration to the current gold standard treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis.","Ali, Ayesha; Mobarak, Zina; Al-Jumaily, Mariam; Anwar, Mehreen; Moti, Zaeem; Zaman, Nadia; Akbari, Amir Reza; de Preux, Laure",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444222/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168473,345
665565,Experience of 16 years and its associated challenges in the Field Epidemiology Training Program in Korea,2017-12-25,"The rapid ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread among humans, along with the clinical complications of coronavirus disease 2019—COVID-19, have represented a significant challenge to the health management systems worldwide. The acute inflammation and coagulation abnormalities appear as the main causes for thousands of deaths worldwide. The intense inflammatory response could be involved with the formation of thrombi. For instance, the presence of uncleaved large multimers of von Willebrand (vWF), due to low ADAMTS13 activity in plasma could be explained by the inhibitory action of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1β and C reactive protein. In addition, the damage to endothelial cells after viral infection and/or activation of endothelium by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and TNF-α induces platelets and monocyte aggregation in the vascular wall and expression of tissue factor (TF). The TF expression may culminate in the formation of thrombi, and activation of cascade by the extrinsic pathway by association with factor VII. In this scenario, the phosphatidylserine—PtdSer exposure on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane as consequence of viral infection emerges as another possible underlying mechanism to acute immune inflammatory response and activation of coagulation cascade. The PtdSer exposure may be an important mechanism related to ADAM17—mediated ACE2, TNF-α, EGFR and IL-6R shedding, and the activation of TF on the surface of infected endothelial cells. In this review, we address the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. Moreover, we introduce key biochemical and pathophysiological concepts that support the possible participation of PtdSer exposure on the outer side of the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells membrane, in the pathophysiology of COVID-19.","Argañaraz, Gustavo A.; Palmeira, Julys da Fonseca; Argañaraz, Enrique R.",Cell Commun Signal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357215/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-020-00687-7,345

The public health crisis raised some urgent questions: “how can fish and other aquatic foods and supply chains be prioritized as health-related interventions to avert both a malnutrition crisis and gender inequality?” Furthermore, “what are the integrated responses, investment opportunities, and governance mechanisms to effectively address the pandemic?” As “super foods,” diets of fish and aquatic foods provide animal-source protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and micronutrients, including both vitamins and minerals, necessary for both the ill and the healthy. The affordability and accessibility of fish could address food and nutrition security needs under lockdown and border closures, boost immune systems, and increase commodity trade. This analytical piece focuses on the continent of Africa, where malnutrition is pervasive, but also where local aquatic food supplies can be utilised during lockdowns and border closures. The paper provides governance insights on national budget support programs and portfolio restructuring to strengthen local aquatic foods production systems to meet dietary needs. Furthermore, the authors advocate for a coordinated multi-sectoral intervention across several well-being domains in the immediate and medium-term involving various partnerships. These integrated responses will mutually limit the contagion while providing support to functional fish value chains for healthy diets, livelihoods, cross-border trade, and long-term macroeconomic recovery.","Khan, Ahmed; Ahmed, Siham Mohamed; Sarr, Cheikh; Kabore, Youssouf; Kahasha, Gracia; Bangwe, Lewis; Odhiambo, Walter; Gahunga, Nathalie; Mclean, Bernice; Diop, Hamady; Moepi, Hellen; Seisay, Mohamed; Tall, Amadou; Dejen, Eshete; Hlatshwayo, Motseki; Lartey, Anna; Sanginga, Pascal; Gueye, Ndiaga; Amousso, Alison; Bamba, Abou; Hambayi, Mutinta; Kamal-Deen, Ali; Karisa, Harrison; Fregene, Bernadette; Siamudaala, Victor; Thilsteld, Shakuntala Haraksingh",Maritime Studies,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40152-021-00236-z,345

In this retrospective, descriptive ecological study, we utilized Google Trends (GT) to characterize the second COVID-19 wave and its association with official case counts based on search terms related to symptoms, testing, disease complications, medications, preventive behaviors, and healthcare utilization. Methods: GT is a publicly available, online tracking system of Google searches. Searches are presented as relative search volumes (RSV) from 0 (least) to 100 (most number of searches). We performed pre-defined Web searches in India from 2/12/2021 to 5/09/2021. We characterized the peak RSV, RSV doubling rates, and Spearman rank correlation of selected search terms with official case counts. We also used date-adjusted linear regression to estimate the association between highly correlated search terms and official case counts. We then qualitatively classified public search queries into thematic groups to better understand public awareness and needs related to COVID-19. Results: We observed that searches for symptoms (most searched terms in order: fever, cough, headache, fatigue, chest pain), disease states (infection, pneumonia), COVID-19-related medications (remdesivir, ivermectin, azithromycin, Fabiflu, dexamethasone), testing modalities (PCR, CT Scan, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation), healthcare utilization (oxygen cylinders, hospital, physician), and preventive behaviors (lockdown, mask, pulse oximetry, hand sanitizer, quarantine) all demonstrated increases, in line with increases in official case counts. Symptoms, PCR testing, outpatient medications, and preventive behaviors peaked around April 24th, approximately two weeks prior to the peak RSV in official case counts. Contrarily, healthcare utilization factors, including searches for hospital, physicians, beds, disease states, and inpatient medications did not peak until the first week of May. There were highly significant correlations between ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (r=0.959), ""fever"" (r=0.935), ""pulse oximetry"" (r=0.952), ""oxygen saturation"" (r=0.944), ""C-reactive protein"" (r=0.955), ""D-Dimer"" (r=0.945), & ""Fabiflu"" (r=0.943) and official case counts. Conclusion: GT search terms related to symptoms, testing, and medications are highly correlated with official case counts in India, suggesting need for further studies examining GT's potential use as a disease surveillance and public informant tool for public health officials.","Visaria, A.; Polamarasetti, P.; Reddy, S.; Ali, A.; Hameed, F.

We will review the current concept of what are DC, compare the differences in the epidemiology and economic burden of this disease between developed and DC, and finally, analyze the barriers and possible solutions that DC should implement to achieve better results. RECENT FINDINGS: DC is a frequently misunderstood name. The way we use to measure human development is changing, and multidimension metrics better define what are DC. With this in mind, we show the differences in the AML epidemiology and the impact of economic burden in DC. We analyze the barriers to access therapy from a clinician point of view, to show that most DC shared similar challenges but with a diverse healthcare structure. Finally, we provide several possible solutions for a more integrated and timely treatment that allows better results not only in terms of survival but with a better quality of life. SUMMARY: The economic burden of AML treatment in DC is high, and the results are poor. It is crucial to face this challenge and propose new treatment approaches to achieve better results.","Meillon-Garcia, Luis Antonio; Demichelis-Gómez, Roberta",Curr Oncol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33025161/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11912-020-00987-8,345

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the mediating roles of self‐efficacy and resilience between stress and both physical and mental quality‐of‐life components in intensive care nurses during the COVID‐19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional survey design. METHODS: The stress subscale (depression, anxiety, and stress scale in Spanish Scale, DASS‐21), the summary components (physical and mental) of health‐related quality of life (SF‐36), the general self‐efficacy scale (GSES), and the resilience scale (RS‐14) were administered in 308 intensive care nurses. Serial multiple mediator models were used. RESULTS: There was a significant indirect effect of levels of perceived stress on both physical and mental health components through self‐efficacy and resilience. Specifically, greater perception of self‐efficacy was associated with a lower perception of stress and greater resilience, while higher resilience was associated with greater physical and mental health (B = −0.03; SE = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = [−0.07, −0.01]; B = −0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI = [−0.07, −0.01], respectively). It was observed that self‐efficacy alone also mediates the relationship of the perception of stress on the components of physical and mental health (B = −0.07; SE = 0.05; 95% CI = [−0.18, −0.03]; B = −0.09; SE = 0.04; 95% CI = [−0.17, −0.24], respectively). However, resilience alone was not a significant mediator of these associations. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that stress is linked to the physical and mental health components related to quality of life through self‐efficacy and resilience. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: These psychological resources would allow the nursing staff to maintain a good quality of life despite high levels of stress. These findings have implications for future research in terms of both model testing and clinical application.","Peñacoba, Cecilia; Catala, Patricia; Velasco, Lilian; Carmona‐Monge, Francisco Javier; Garcia‐Hedrera, Fernando J.; Gil‐Almagro, Fernanda",Nurs Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1111/nicc.12690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387905/,345

Over the last years, yeast genetic screens have considerably increased our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, and a number of genes involved in fundamental steps of the autophagic pathway have been identified. Most of these autophagy genes are present in higher eukaryotes indicating that this process has been evolutionarily conserved. In yeast, autophagy is mainly involved in adaptation to starvation, but in multicellular organisms this route has emerged as a multifunctional pathway involved in a variety of additional processes such as programmed cell death, removal of damaged organelles and development of different tissue-specific functions. Furthermore, autophagy is associated with a growing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, myopathies and neurodegenerative disorders. The physiological and pathological roles of autophagy, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this multifunctional pathway, are discussed in this review.","Mariño, G.; López-Otín, C.",Cell Mol Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15197469/,345

For this reason, eye tracking recordings are suitable as input data for attentional state classifiers. In current state-of-the-art studies, the extracted eye tracking feature set usually consists of descriptive statistics about specific eye movement characteristics (i.e., fixations, saccades, blinks, vergence, and pupil dilation). We suggest an Imaging Time Series approach for eye tracking data followed by classification using a convolutional neural net to improve the classification accuracy. We compared multiple algorithms that used the one-dimensional statistical summary feature set as input with two different implementations of the newly suggested method for three different data sets that target different aspects of attention. The results show that our two-dimensional image features with the convolutional neural net outperform the classical classifiers for most analyses, especially regarding generalization over participants and tasks. We conclude that current attentional state classifiers that are based on eye tracking can be optimized by adjusting the feature set while requiring less feature engineering and our future work will focus on a more detailed and suited investigation of this approach for other scenarios and data sets.","Vortmann, Lisa-Marie; Knychalla, Jannes; Annerer-Walcher, Sonja; Benedek, Mathias; Putze, Felix",Front Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.664490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121994/,345

Identifying the factors influencing their alumni’s intentions to invest in their alma mater can be of significant importance when establishing a sustainable revenue stream. Within this context, empirical research on the potential role of trust is scarce. This paper aims to deepen the analysis of the relationship between alumni trust and engagement as well as three outcomes, namely support, commitment, and attitude toward donation. A structural equation model was tested on two samples of US (n = 318) and Italian (n = 314) alumni. Although both countries are affluent and developed countries, the USA has an established tradition of alumni donations, which is not such a developed practice in Italy. For both countries, results confirm that engagement is an antecedent of trust, which in turn leads to the three investigated outcomes (support, commitment, and attitude toward donations). In contrast, the effect of commitment on attitude toward donations is significant only for the USA universities. The paper has interesting theoretical and managerial implications. From a theoretical point of view, the study aims to address a gap concerning the role of trust in the HE context.

Even the most knowledgeable users face difficulties in deciding about the value and appropriateness of the so-called educational apps because of many factors that should be considered. Their importance for children’s attitudes is affected by the perceived positive and negative aspects, which vary across a multiplicity of criteria. Filling the gap in the relevant literature, a new instrument, named PEAU-p (Perceptions about Educational Apps Use–parents), was developed and validated in the present study designed to measure parents’ perception of educational apps for kindergarten pupils. Data (N = 435) were collected via online procedures, and the psychometric properties of PEAU-p were studied via exploratory and confirmatory methods. Principal Components Analysis extracted six factors, namely Usability, Enjoyment, Involvement, Learning, Worries, and Values, which explained 72.42% of the total variance. Subsequently, by implementing Latent Class Analysis based on the above factors, four Clusters (i.e., parents’ Profiles) were extracted corresponding to their perceptions and attitudes towards the educational apps used for kindergarten pupils. Those were named as ‘mild attitude’, ‘negative attitude’, ‘positive attitude’, and ‘indifferent attitude’. This categorization, besides the statistical support, is fully interpretable, and the profiles were associated with certain covariates, such as age, the number of children, knowledge on new technologies, or distal outcomes, e.g., the frequency of using apps, the general position towards apps or their intention to recommend apps use.

Four leafy green types (35 ± 1 g) were spiked with 100 Giardia cysts and we compared washing by shaking with 1 M glycine (n = 20) or 0.1% Alconox (n = 20). DNA was extracted from washes, tested by LAMP and melt curve analysis, and time to positive (TTP) values compared. The detection limit was determined by spiking 10 (n = 40) Giardia cysts onto these same types of leafy greens and processing as above with 0.1% Alconox. Method robustness was assessed by subjecting spring mix (n = 45 total) to aging (1, 3 or 7 days) and washes to aging and freezing conditions prior to testing. Assay repeatability and specificity were evaluated, and an artificial positive control (APC) distinguishable by melt temperature (Tm) from DNA of Giardia spiked on leafy greens was designed to rule out cross-contamination from the control. Giardia detection rates were higher and TTP was lower (P < 0.05) for 0.1% Alconox (19/20, 8.85 ± 0.3 min) compared with 1 M glycine (15/20, 14.53 ± 7.2 min). The LAMP assay detected 10 Giardia cysts spiked on leafy greens in 13–34 min in 14/40 samples tested. Robustness assessment showed that TTP was higher (P < 0.0001) when spiked produce was stored for 7 days (13.09 ± 1.14 min) compared to fresh (9.72 ± 0.43 min). No unspiked samples were positive by LAMP, and the Tm for DNA of Giardia spiked on leafy greens was higher (P < 0.0001, 87.43 ± 0.05 °C) than the APC (86.43 ± 0.12 °C). Within-assay repeatability co-efficient of variation (CV) for TTP was 5.4% and no cross-contamination occurred when spiked and un-spiked samples were processed in alternate order. The optimized sample processing procedure combined with the EF1α LAMP assay is a sensitive, specific, labour-saving, and rapid method for the detection of Giardia cysts in leafy greens.","Lalonde, Laura F.; Xie, Vincent; Oakley, Jenna R.; Lobanov, Vladislav A.",Food Waterborne Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169158/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fawpar.2021.e00123,345

Le centre hospitalier François-Dunan (CHFD) assure la couverture sanitaire de la population (6000 hab) et des missions de médecins spécialistes interviennent plusieurs fois chaque année de façon programmée. La crise sanitaire SARS-Cov-2 a bouleversé cette organisation après l’arrêt complet du trafic aérien fin février 2020. Description La mission semestrielle habituelle de néphrologie consiste à voir en consultation la file active des patients suivis pour une maladie rénale chronique (MRC) et ceux adressés pour avis par les médecins généralistes de l’Archipel. Après l’annulation de la mission prévue en mai 2020, une sélection des patients connus et des demandes nouvelles a été effectuée avec les IDE de télédialyse (NB, AB) et le secrétariat (AL) pour organiser des consultations par vidéo-conférence. Les examens biologiques et d’imagerie nécessaires avaient été programmés en amont. Méthodes Une installation de vidéo-conférence sécurisée a été mise en place à partir de la plateforme régionale de Bretagne. Un accès au système d’archivage et de partage des images (PACS) du service de radiologie a été installé. La consultation des résultats biologiques est possible en permanence avec un serveur dédié. Résultats Les 15 consultations prévues ont été organisées sur deux journées en tenant compte du décalage horaire (H−4). Les patients étaient reçus par les IDE (NB, AB) qui recueillaient les données cliniques (poids, PA, œdèmes…).

Thirty mice were allocated into the Control, LPS, and LPS + Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) group (n = 10/group). Mouse alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12) and macrophage cells (RAW264.7) were divided into the same groups. Pathological variation, inflammation-related factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), ATP levels, and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were analyzed. Pathologic features of ARDS were observed in the LPS group and were significantly alleviated by BMSCs. The trend in inflammation-related factors among the three groups was the LPS group > LPS + BMSC group > Control group. In the MLE-12 co-culture system, IL-6 was increased in the LPS group but not significantly reduced in the LPS + BMSC group. In the RAW264.7 co-culture system, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 levels were all increased in the LPS group, IL-1β and TNF-α levels were reduced by BMSCs, while IL-10 level kept increasing. ROS and ATP levels were increased and decreased respectively in both MLE-12 and RAW264.7 cells in the LPS groups but reversed by BMSCs. Basal OCR, ATP-linked OCR, and maximal OCR were lower in the LPS groups. Impaired basal OCR and ATP-linked OCR in MLE-12 cells were partially restored by BMSCs, while impaired basal OCR and maximal OCR in RAW264.7 cells were restored by BMSCs. BMSCs improved the mitochondrial respiration dysfunction of macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells induced by LPS, alleviated lung tissue injury, and inflammatory response in a mouse model of ARDS.","Zhang, Keji; Gao, Yuan; Deng, Yuxiao; Zhou, Xiao; Zhu, Changqing; He, Zhengyu; Lv, Dan",Mol Cell Biochem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845436/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-020-03888-3,345

672147,"Using a ""Big Events"" framework to understand emergency department use among women experiencing homelessness or housing instability in San Francisco during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-08-03,"RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: COVID‐19 has caused an ongoing public health crisis. Many systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have been performed to synthesize evidence for better understanding this new disease. However, some concerns have been raised about rapid COVID‐19 research. This meta‐epidemiological study aims to methodologically assess the current systematic reviews and meta‐analyses on COVID‐19. METHODS: We searched in various databases for systematic reviews with meta‐analyses published between 1 January 2020 and 31 October 2020. We extracted their basic characteristics, data analyses, evidence appraisal, and assessment of publication bias and heterogeneity. RESULTS: We identified 295 systematic reviews on COVID‐19. The median time from submission to acceptance was 33 days. Among these systematic reviews, 73.9% evaluated clinical manifestations or comorbidities of COVID‐19. Stata was the most used software programme (43.39%). The odds ratio was the most used effect measure (34.24%). Moreover, 28.14% of the systematic reviews did not present evidence appraisal. Among those reporting the risk of bias results, 14.64% of studies had a high risk of bias. Egger's test was the most used method for assessing publication bias (38.31%), while 38.66% of the systematic reviews did not assess publication bias. The I(2) statistic was widely used for assessing heterogeneity (92.20%); many meta‐analyses had high values of I(2). Among the meta‐analyses using the random‐effects model, 75.82% did not report the methods for model implementation; among those meta‐analyses reporting implementation methods, the DerSimonian‐Laird method was the most used one. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic reviews and meta‐analyses on COVID‐19 might suffer from low transparency, high heterogeneity, and suboptimal statistical methods. It is recommended that future systematic reviews on COVID‐19 strictly follow well‐developed guidelines. Sensitivity analyses may be performed to examine how the synthesized evidence might depend on different methods for appraising evidence, assessing publication bias, and implementing meta‐analysis models.","Rosenberger, Kristine J.; Xu, Chang; Lin, Lifeng",J Eval Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955120/,345
673040,668 Utilizing Risk Score Assessment to Maximize Sleep Research Participant Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-03,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for redetectable positivity (RP), and to provide a basis for prevention and control of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) in children. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on all pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID‐19. RP was defined as the positive result of real‐time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) after symptom resolution and discharge. Children were defined as being less than 18 years old. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 38 (36.8%) pediatric patients exhibited RP. Compared with the non‐RP group (n = 24), the RP group (n = 14) had more family cluster infections, relatively higher white blood cell (WBC) count and longer plasma prothrombin time (PT), while age and gender were insignificant. T lymphocyte subclassification was observed at five‐time points: the first test after admission, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, and 3 months after discharge. The RP group had a higher percentage and count of CD8+ T lymphocytes and lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio at 2 weeks, while a lower percentage and count of CD4+ T lymphocytes and lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio at 2 months. The positive rate of nasopharyngeal swabs by RT‐PCR was higher during the onset, while that of anal swabs was higher during the recovery of COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Family cluster infection, higher WBC count, and longer PT are the early risk factors for RP in recovered COVID‐19 children. The dynamic changes in number and ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes may be involved in prolonged SARS‐CoV‐2 clearance. Nasopharyngeal swabs sampling during the onset and anal swabs sampling during the recovery may improve the positivity rate of RT‐PCR.","Peng, Denggao; Zhang, Jing; Ji, Yiling; Pan, Dongming",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33049115/,345
673188,Development of a School-Based Physical Activity Intervention Using an Integrated Approach: Project SMART,2021-08-13,"Silver and its nanoparticles (AgNPs) have different faces, providing different applications. In recent years, the number of positive nanosilver applications has increased substantially. It has been proven that AgNPs inhibit the growth and survival of bacteria, including human and animal pathogens, as well as fungi, protozoa and arthropods. Silver nanoparticles are known from their antiviral and anti-cancer properties; however, they are also very popular in medical and pharmaceutical nanoengineering as carriers for precise delivery of therapeutic compounds, in the diagnostics of different diseases and in optics and chemistry, where they act as sensors, conductors and substrates for various syntheses. The activity of AgNPs has not been fully discovered; therefore, we need interdisciplinary research to fulfil this knowledge. New forms of products with silver will certainly find application in the future treatment of many complicated and difficult to treat diseases. There is still a lack of appropriate and precise legal condition regarding the circulation of nanomaterials and the rules governing their safety use. The relatively low toxicity, relative biocompatibility and selectivity of nanoparticle interaction combined with the unusual biological properties allow their use in animal production as well as in bioengineering and medicine. Despite a quite big knowledge on this topic, there is still a need to organize the data on AgNPs in relation to specific microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses or fungi. We decided to put this knowledge together and try to show positive and negative effects on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.","Kowalczyk, Paweł; Szymczak, Mateusz; Maciejewska, Magdalena; Laskowski, Łukasz; Laskowska, Magdalena; Ostaszewski, Ryszard; Skiba, Grzegorz; Franiak-Pietryga, Ida",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467032/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020854,345

BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic in Spain has pushed boundaries in health systems and, especially, for health professionals. Analysis of resilience as an individual resource and it is essential to understand the mechanisms that make staff react unfavourably to stressors caused by the pandemic. DESIGN: A descriptive cross‐sectional study was designed. PARTICIPANTS: Health professionals supervised by the nursing department, including registered nurses, health care assistants, health technicians, final year nurse student nurses, foreign nurses, and other nurse‐related health workers. METHODS: The study complies with the STROBE checklist for cross‐sectional studies. An online survey was administered to all health professionals supervised by the nursing department between 6 and 27 May 2020. The survey included the ER‐14 Resilience Scale, the widely‐used PHQ‐9 depression scale, the Spanish version of the Nursing Stress Scale, and an ad‐hoc questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic and occupational variables. RESULTS: A total of 686 participants answered the survey. Resilience was high or very high in health professionals, with an inverse correlation with stress and depression scores. Personal on fixed shifts showed better resilience. The most stressed health professionals were full‐time registered nurses, followed by health care assistants. Up to 25% of nursing professionals had depression. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high degree of resilience among nurse professionals despite the overwhelming nature of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Relevant signs of depression and stress were detected among participants. Occupational factors heavily influenced nurses’ resilience, stress and depression. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING & HEALTH POLICY: Government policy shifts are needed in Spain to improve nurses’ workforce conditions, enhance the ratio of nurses to patient numbers, and avoid workforce losses. Maintaining the resilience of health professionals would assist in improving their health and their capacity to possible future emergency situations.","Manzanares, Isabel; Sevilla Guerra, Sonia; Lombraña Mencía, María; Acar‐Denizli, Nihan; Miranda Salmerón, Josep; Martinez Estalella, Gemma",Int Nurs Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097305/; https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12693,345

We assumed that the epidemic crisis, social isolation, and restrictions in hospitals which affect pregnant and postpartum women - lack of family labors, lack of the possibility to be with the newborn when he/she is hospitalized, may increase fear and reduce psychosocial resources of women, hinder their normal process of transition to motherhood and thus contribute to the intensified severity of depressive symptoms. METHODS: The study participants were women seeking support at the on-line platform of the project ‘Next Stop: Mum’, which is a part of the postpartum depression prevention’s program implemented by the Ministry of Health in Poland, and enables remote self-screening for the severity of the postpartum depression symptoms with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale developed by Cox and collaborators. The analyzed data in this study were obtained from 139 women: 61 filled forms from October 1 - November 10, 2019 (non-epidemic period), and 78 filled forms from February 20–March 30 (beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic), 2020. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in the severity of postpartum depression symptoms were observed among women making a self-assessment with EPDS scale at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland (M = 15.71; SD = 6.23), compared to the pre-epidemic neutral period (M = 13.56; SD = 6.46). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the epidemic crisis may be associated with an increased need for additional caution and support of women’s mental health in the postpartum period. We believe that recommendations for medical staff, policy, and families of women struggling with postpartum depression symptoms during crisis should be widespread as the second wave of COVID-19 disease may develop in the autumn-winter 2020 and spring 2021.

Two radiologists reviewed radiographs with respect to laterality, craniocaudal, mediolateral distribution, shape, density, unifocality/multifocality and number of lung zones. Sensitivity of radiography was calculated with RT-PCR as gold standard. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: IBM SPSS Statistics Subscription software (IBM, New York, USA). RESULTS: Many patients 67.2% (78/116) were asymptomatic. Cough (21.5%, 25/116) and fever (17.6%, 20/116) were the most frequent symptoms. 36.2% (42/116) patients revealed COVID-19 pneumonia-like abnormalities on CXR. Sensitivity of CXR with RT-PCR as gold standard was 36.2% (CI: Confidence interval = 27.46% - 44.95%).

We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, where super-saturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%.

The number and the findings of stress SPECT-MPI studies acquired in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 were also evaluated for direct comparison. RESULTS: The number of stress SPECT-MPI studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 123) was significantly lower (P < 0.0001) compared with the mean yearly number of procedures performed in the corresponding months of the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 (n = 413).

We utilized a discreet, continuously wearable electrocardiogram device, the Lief Smart Patch, which measures and records heart rate and HRV in real time, and guides HRVB exercises using vibrations and visual cues. During the 8-week study, participants (N = 14) wore the Lief Smart Patch, participated in HRVB with the device, utilized the mobile app, and communicated with a remote stress management coach. We collected self-report survey responses to measure symptoms of anxiety (GAD-2) and depression (PHQ-2) every 2 weeks, as well as HRV data throughout the study. Participants’ mean GAD-2 score began at 4.6 out of 6. By the trial’s completion, the group’s mean GAD-2 score dropped to 1.7 (t((13)) = 11.0, p < .001) with only 2 of the 14 subjects remaining over the clinical threshold of high anxiety. Similarly, the group’s mean PHQ-2 score dropped from 2.93 to 1.29 (t((13)) = 3.54, p < .01). In addition, participants increased their HRV (RMSSD) by an average of + 11.4 ms after participating in a low dose biofeedback exercise. These findings suggest that engaging in HRVB through a discreet wearable device in conjunction with a remote stress management program may be effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Chung, Adrienne H.; Gevirtz, Richard N.; Gharbo, Raouf S.; Thiam, Melinda A.; Ginsberg, J.P.

676292,Social Isolation Among Older Adults in Long-Term Care: A Scoping Review,2021-03-27,"Autophagy is a cellular response to starvation that generates autophagosomes to carry long-lived proteins and cellular organelles to lysosomes for degradation. Activation of autophagy by viruses can provide an innate defense against infection, and for (+) strand RNA viruses autophagosomes can facilitate assembly of replicase proteins. We demonstrated that nonstructural protein (NSP) 6 of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), generates autophagosomes from the ER. A statistical analysis of MAP1LC3B puncta showed that NSP6 induced greater numbers of autophagosomes per cell compared with starvation, but the autophagosomes induced by NSP6 had smaller diameters compared with starvation controls. Small diameter autophagosomes were also induced by infection of cells with IBV, and by NSP6 proteins of MHV and SARS and NSP5, NSP6, and NSP7 of arterivirus PRRSV. Analysis of WIPI2 puncta induced by NSP6 suggests that NSP6 limits autophagosome diameter at the point of omegasome formation. IBV NSP6 also limited autophagosome and omegasome expansion in response to starvation and Torin1 and could therefore limit the size of autophagosomes induced following inhibition of MTOR signaling, as well as those induced independently by the NSP6 protein itself. MAP1LC3B-puncta induced by NSP6 contained SQSTM1, which suggests they can incorporate autophagy cargos. However, NSP6 inhibited the autophagosome/lysosome expansion normally seen following starvation. Taken together the results show that coronavirus NSP6 proteins limit autophagosome expansion, whether they are induced directly by the NSP6 protein, or indirectly by starvation or chemical inhibition of MTOR signaling. This may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation.","Cottam, Eleanor M; Whelband, Matthew C; Wileman, Thomas",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.4161/auto.29309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991833/,345
676642,Case fatality of SARS in mainland China and associated risk factors,2009-06-05,"COVID-19 is a severe global problem that has crippled many industries and killed many people around the world. One of the primary ways to decrease the casualties is the infected person's identification at the proper time. AI can play a significant role in these cases by monitoring and detecting infected persons in early-stage so that it can help many organizations. In this paper, we aim to propose a fully-automated method to detect COVID-19 from the patient's CT scan without needing a clinical technician. We introduce a new dataset that contains 48260 CT scan images from 282 normal persons and 15589 images from 95 patients with COVID-19 infection. Our proposed network takes all the CT scan image sequences of a patient as the input and determines if the patient is infected with COVID-19. At the first stage, this network runs an image processing algorithm to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This helps to reduce the number of images that shall be identified as normal or COVID-19, so it reduces the processing time. Also, running this algorithm makes the deep network at the next stage to analyze only the proper images and thus reduces false detections. At the next stage, we propose a modified version of ResNet50V2 that is enhanced by a feature pyramid network for classifying the selected CT images into COVID-19 or normal. If enough number of chosen CT scan images of a patient be identified as COVID-19, the network considers that patient, infected to this disease. The ResNet50V2 with feature pyramid network achieved 98.49% accuracy on more than 7996 validation images and correctly identified almost 237 patients from 245 patients.","Rahimzadeh, M.; Attar, A.; Sakhaei, S.

An International Survey,2021-03-17,"The craft chocolate and specialty cacao industry has been driving the global chocolate industry towards more sustainable farming and ethical and transparent sourcing practices by prioritizing farmer welfare, environmental resource conservation, and consumer education. However, the craft chocolate and specialty cacao industries are also uniquely vulnerable to the immediate and long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many cacao producers are expected to be disproportionately affected. Craft chocolate businesses have been especially hard hit by losses in revenue and specialty cacao producers are facing unique challenges compared to their industrial counterparts. Factors that influence the future of these businesses include: labor intensity, regional politics, risk tolerance, and accessibility. Immediate impacts include loss of revenue and access to markets, which are directly influenced by travel restrictions, access to petrol, global trade networks, and operational limitations. Long term impacts include changes in business strategies, including the use of e-commerce, elevating consumer education to sustain sales and providing access to transparent pricing. The global crisis reveals that there is an ethical imperative to provide investments in the specialty cacao and craft chocolate industry to deliver farmer relief, improve access to technology for business needs, and support farmer empowerment in negotiations to mitigate risks.","Cadby, Jeana",Food Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937518/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41055-021-00087-8,345

In particular, identifying high risk population subgroups aids policymakers and health officials in combatting the epidemic. This has been challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, because governmental agencies typically release aggregate COVID-19 data as marginal summary statistics of patient demographics. These data may identify disparities in COVID-19 outcomes between broad population subgroups, but do not provide comparisons between more granular population subgroups defined by combinations of multiple demographics. We introduce a method that overcomes the limitations of aggregated summary statistics and yields estimates of COVID-19 infection and case fatality rates --- key quantities for guiding public policy related to the control and prevention of COVID-19 --- for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. Our approach uses pseudo-likelihood based logistic regression to combine aggregate COVID-19 case and fatality data with population-level demographic survey data to estimate infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups across combinations of demographic characteristics. We illustrate our method on California COVID-19 data to estimate test-based infection and case fatality rates for population subgroups defined by gender, age, and race and ethnicity. Our analysis indicates that in California, males have higher test-based infection rates and test-based case fatality rates across age and race/ethnicity groups, with the gender gap widening with increasing age. Although elderly infected with COVID-19 are at an elevated risk of mortality, the test-based infection rates do not increase monotonically with age. LatinX and African Americans have higher test-based infection rates than other race/ethnicity groups. The subgroups with the highest 5 test-based case fatality rates are African American male, Multi-race male, Asian male, African American female, and American Indian or Alaska Native male, indicating that African Americans are an especially vulnerable California subpopulation.","Xiong, D.; Zhang, L.; Watson, G.

The data were collected from a series of press conference contents by Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC). Results: During this period, there were six family infections in Taiwan, including two couple infections, one imported family cluster infection, and three domestic family cluster infections. Compared to the former two, the starters (cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed longer symptom-onset to diagnosis (p = 0.02); longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation (p = 0.01); higher first-generation reproduction number (p = 0.03); and more critical presentation (endotracheal tube insertion and intensive care unit (ICU) care) (p < 0.01). In addition, compared to the former two, the starters of the latter were older, had no history of travel, and had more underlying diseases and more mortality. There are more contacts of domestic family cluster infections, making epidemiological investigations more difficult and expensive.

In response, new oxygenation strategies and therapeutics have been developed, but their large-scale effects on outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to examine the trends in mortality, mechanical ventilation, and cost over the first six months of the pandemic for adult COVID-19 patients in the US who developed ARDS or ARF. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Vizient Clinical Data Base, a national database comprised of administrative, clinical, and financial data from academic medical centers, was queried for patients ≥ 18-years-old with COVID-19 and either ARDS or ARF admitted between 3/2020-8/2020. Demographics, mechanical ventilation, length of stay, total cost, mortality, and discharge status were collected. Mann-Kendall tests were used to assess for significant monotonic trends in total cost, mechanical ventilation, and mortality over time. Chi-square tests were used to compare mortality rates between March-May and June-August. 110,223 adult patients with COVID-19 ARDS or ARF were identified. Mean length of stay was 12.1±13.3 days and mean total cost was $35,991±32,496. Mechanical ventilation rates were 34.1% and in-hospital mortality was 22.5%. Mean cost trended downward over time (p = 0.02) from $55,275 (March) to $18,211 (August). Mechanical ventilation rates trended down (p<0.01) from 53.8% (March) to 20.3% (August). Overall mortality rates also decreased (p<0.01) from 28.4% (March) to 13.7% (August).

Automated detection of COVID-19 infections in the lungs from Computed Tomography (CT) images offers huge potential in tackling the problem of slow detection and augments the conventional diagnostic procedures. However, segmenting COVID-19 from CT Scans is problematic, due to high variations in the types of infections and low contrast between healthy and infected tissues. While segmenting Lung CT Scans for COVID-19, fast and accurate results are required and furthermore, due to the pandemic, most of the research community has opted for various cloud based servers such as Google Colab, etc. to develop their algorithms. High accuracy can be achieved using Deep Networks but the prediction time would vary as the resources are shared amongst many thus requiring the need to compare different lightweight segmentation model. To address this issue, we aim to analyze the segmentation of COVID-19 using four Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The images in our dataset are preprocessed where the motion artifacts are removed. The four networks are UNet, Segmentation Network (Seg Net), High-Resolution Network (HR Net) and VGG UNet. Trained on our dataset of more than 3,000 images, HR Net was found to be the best performing network achieving an accuracy of 96.24% and a Dice score of 0.9127.

The structures induced by enteroviruses, which are members of the family Picornaviridae, have so far been described as either single- or double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). Aside from the number of delimiting membranes, their exact architecture has also remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional electron microscopy. In this study, we used electron tomography (ET) to solve the three-dimensional (3-D) ultrastructure of these compartments. At different time points postinfection, coxsackievirus B3-infected cells were high-pressure frozen and freeze-substituted for ET analysis. The tomograms showed that during the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis, closed smooth single-membrane tubules constituted the predominant virus-induced membrane structure, with a minor proportion of DMVs that were either closed or connected to the cytosol in a vase-like configuration. As infection progressed, the DMV number steadily increased, while the tubular single-membrane structures gradually disappeared. Late in infection, complex multilamellar structures, previously unreported, became apparent in the cytoplasm. Serial tomography disclosed that their basic unit is a DMV, which is enwrapped by one or multiple cisternae. ET also revealed striking intermediate structures that strongly support the conversion of single-membrane tubules into double-membrane and multilamellar structures by a process of membrane apposition, enwrapping, and fusion. Collectively, our work unravels the sequential appearance of distinct enterovirus-induced replication structures, elucidates their detailed 3-D architecture, and provides the basis for a model for their transformation during the course of infection.","Limpens, Ronald W.

As we live in a plural society it is even more interesting to not only understand the attitudes of Spanish students but, also, those of students coming from other countries. In the present article, we seek to identify and compare the attitudes held by nursing degree students at Hekima-Santé University (Senegal) and the University of Huelva (Spain) about end of life processes. The study identifies elements that condition attitudes and coping with death, whilst considering curricular differences with regards to specific end of life training. METHOD: A descriptive, cross-sectional and multi-center study was conducted. The overall sample (N = 142) was divided into groups: Hekima-Santé University (Dakar, Senegal) and the University of Huelva (Huelva, Spain). The measurement instruments used were an ad-hoc questionnaire and Bugen´s Coping with Death Scale. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (p = 0.005, 95%CI) were found in relation to overall Bugen Scale scores. We can confirm that specialized end of life training (University of Huelva, Spain) did not lead to better coping when compared with a population whose academic curriculum did not provide specific training and who engaged in more religious practices (Hekima-Santé University, Senegal). CONCLUSIONS: In cultures where religion not only influences the spiritual dimension of the individual, but acts in the ethical and moral system and consequently in the economic, educational and family sphere, the accompaniment at the end of life transcends the formative plane. Considering the plural society in which we live, the training that integrates the Degree in Nursing with regard to the care of the final process, must be multidimensional in which spirituality and faith are integrated, working emotional and attentional skills, as well as cultural competence strategies in this process.","García-Navarro, E.

Mechanism(s) controlling the length of these homopolymeric stretches are not well understood. Here, we show that in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and three other enteroviruses the poly(A) tract is ∼80–90 and the poly(U) tract is ∼20 nt-long. Mutagenesis analysis indicate that the length of the CVB3 3′-poly(A) is determined by the oriR, a cis-element in the 3′-noncoding region of viral RNA. In contrast, while mutations of the oriR inhibit initiation of (−) RNA synthesis, they do not affect the 5′-poly(U) length. Poly(A)-lacking genomes are able to acquire genetically unstable AU-rich poly(A)-terminated 3′-tails, which may be generated by a mechanism distinct from the cognate viral RNA polyadenylation. The aberrant tails ensure only inefficient replication. The possibility of RNA replication independent of oriR and poly(A) demonstrate that highly debilitated viruses are able to survive by utilizing ‘emergence’, perhaps atavistic, mechanisms.","van Ooij, Mark J.

686560,Experiences of Australian primary healthcare nurses in using telehealth during COVID-19: a qualitative study,2021-08-06,"Background: A novel coronavirus (CoV) was recently identified as the agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We compared the abilities of conventional and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect SARS CoV in clinical specimens. Methods: RNA samples isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA; n = 170) and stool (n = 44) were reverse-transcribed and tested by our in-house conventional RT-PCR assay. We selected 98 NPA and 37 stool samples collected at different times after the onset of disease and tested them in a real-time quantitative RT-PCR specific for the open reading frame (ORF) 1b region of SARS CoV. Detection rates for the conventional and real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were compared. To investigate the nature of viral RNA molecules in these clinical samples, we determined copy numbers of ORF 1b and nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences of SARS CoV. Results: The quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay for detecting SARS CoV in samples collected early in the course of the disease. Real-time assays targeted at the ORF 1b region and the N gene revealed that copy numbers of ORF 1b and N gene sequences in clinical samples were similar. Conclusions: NPA and stool samples can be used for early diagnosis of SARS. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay for SARS CoV is potentially useful for early detection of SARS CoV. Our results suggest that genomic RNA is the predominant viral RNA species in clinical samples.","Poon, Leo L M; Chan, Kwok Hung; Wong, On Kei; Cheung, Timothy K W; Ng, Iris; Zheng, Bojian; Seto, Wing Hong; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Guan, Yi; Peiris, Joseph S M",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14709637/,345

We present here the mitigation efforts Turkey has undertaken so far, and also review the lessons learned for future proactive strategies. High number of intensive care unit beds and ventilators, national treatment algorithms, governmental support for free testing and medications, tedious contact-tracing with early detection and isolation of cases together with early shelter-in-place for the elderly and youngsters, and subsequent weekend curfews in selected cities have so far prevented the surge pressure on the health care system. At this phase, Turkey needs to adopt an evidence-based, proactive control system for an effective transition process to normalize the situation. Here, we underline the urgent need for detailed analysis of the national COVID-19 data and propose an epidemiologic investigation framework for better understanding, efficient control, and reliable forecasting of COVID-19 pandemic.","Cakir, Banu",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200520.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538025/,345

Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (M=39.29 days, SD=11.26), 1,035 adults (79% female, M=37.5 years, SD=12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pakenham, Kenneth I.; Landi, Giulia; Boccolini, Giada; Furlani, Annalisa; Grandi, Silvana; Tossani, Eliana",J Contextual Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834969/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212144720301587; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301587?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003,345

Identifying predictors of robust antibody responses is important to evaluate the risk of re-infection / vaccine failure and may be translatable to vaccine effectiveness. Objective: To 1) determine the durability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in subjects who experienced mild and moderate to severe COVID-19, and 2) to evaluate the correlation of age and IgG responses to both endemic human seasonal coronaviruses (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2 according to infection outcome. Design: Longitudinal serum samples were collected from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive participants (U.S. active duty service members, dependents and military retirees, including a range of ages and demographics) who sought medical treatment at seven U.S. military hospitals from March 2020 to March 2021 and enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study. Results: We observed SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in 100% of inpatients followed for six months (58/58) to one year (8/8), while we observed seroreversion in 5% (9/192) of outpatients six to ten months after symptom onset, and 18% (2/11) of outpatients followed for one year. Both outpatient and inpatient anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding-IgG responses had a half-life (T1/2) of >1000 days post-symptom onset. The magnitude of neutralizing antibodies (geometric mean titer, inpatients: 378 [246-580, 95% CI] versus outpatients: 83 [59-116, 95% CI]) and durability (inpatients: 65 [43-98, 95% CI] versus outpatients: 33 [26-40, 95% CI]) were associated with COVID-19 severity. Older age was a positive correlate with both higher IgG binding and neutralizing antibody levels when controlling for COVID-19 hospitalization status. We found no significant relationships between HCoV antibody responses and COVID-19 clinical outcomes, or the development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrates that humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are robust on longer time-scales, including those arising from milder infections.","Laing, E.; Epsi, N.

690253,COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers and Serving Safe Healthcare During the Pandemic,2021-03-15,"Computer-aided diagnosis has been extensively investigated for more rapid and accurate screening during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. However, the challenge remains to distinguish COVID-19 in the complex scenario of multi-type pneumonia classification and improve the overall diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose a novel periphery-aware COVID-19 diagnosis approach with contrastive representation enhancement to identify COVID-19 from influenza-A (H1N1) viral pneumonia, community acquired pneumonia (CAP), and healthy subjects using chest CT images. Our key contributions include: 1) an unsupervised Periphery-aware Spatial Prediction (PSP) task which is designed to introduce important spatial patterns into deep networks; 2) an adaptive Contrastive Repre-sentation Enhancement (CRE) mechanism which can effectively capture the intra-class similarity and inter-class difference of various types of pneumonia. We integrate PSP and CRE to obtain the representations which are highly discriminative in COVID-19 screening. We evaluate our approach comprehensively on our constructed large-scale dataset and two public datasets. Extensive experiments on both volume-level and slice-level CT images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with PSP and CRE for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Hou, Junlin; Xu, Jilan; Jiang, Longquan; Du, Shanshan; Feng, Rui; Zhang, Yuejie; Shan, Fei; Xue, Xiangyang",Pattern Recognit,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321001928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972808/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321001928?v=s5,345
