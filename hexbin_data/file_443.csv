4457,Targeting cancer stem cell pathways for cancer therapy,2020-02-07,"OBJECTIVES: According to the World Health Organization, there have been frequent reports of Ebola virus disease (EVD) since the 2014 EVD pandemic in West Africa. We aim to estimate the outbreak scale when an EVD infected person arrives in Korea. METHODS: Western Africa EVD epidemic mathematical model SEIJR or SEIJQR was modified to create a Korean EVD outbreak model. The expected number of EVD patients and outbreak duration were calculated by stochastic simulation under the scenarios of Best case, Diagnosis delay, and Case missing. RESULTS: The 2,000 trials of stochastic simulation for each scenario demonstrated the following results: The possible median number of patients is 2 and the estimated maximum number is 11 when the government intervention is proceeded immediately right after the first EVD case is confirmed. With a 6-day delay in diagnosis of the first case, the median number of patients becomes 7, and the maximum, 20. If the first case is missed and the government intervention is not activated until 2 cases of secondary infection occur, the median number of patients is estimated at 15, and the maximum, at 35. CONCLUSIONS: Timely and rigorous diagnosis is important to reduce the spreading scale of infection when a new communicable disease is inflowed into Korea. Moreover, it is imperative to strengthen the local surveillance system and diagnostic protocols to avoid missing cases of secondary infection.","Ko, Youngsuk; Lee, Seok-Min; Kim, Soyoung; Ki, Moran; Jung, Eunok",Epidemiol Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7005456/,443
13108,Incidence and characteristics of heterotopic ossification after spinal cord injury: a single institution study in India,2019-08-21,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory loss along with neuropsychiatric symptoms and a decline in activities of daily life. Its main pathological features are cerebral atrophy, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of patients. There are various descriptive hypotheses regarding the causes of AD, including the cholinergic hypothesis, amyloid hypothesis, tau propagation hypothesis, mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, calcium homeostasis hypothesis, neurovascular hypothesis, inflammatory hypothesis, metal ion hypothesis, and lymphatic system hypothesis. However, the ultimate etiology of AD remains obscure. In this review, we discuss the main hypotheses of AD and related clinical trials. Wealthy puzzles and lessons have made it possible to develop explanatory theories and identify potential strategies for therapeutic interventions for AD. The combination of hypometabolism and autophagy deficiency is likely to be a causative factor for AD. We further propose that fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has the potential to treat AD.","Liu, Pei-Pei; Xie, Yi; Meng, Xiao-Yan; Kang, Jian-Sheng",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6799833/,443
14128,A Multi-Pronged Approach Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Using Ultra-Large Virtual Screening,2020-07-24,"While both the spleen and lymph nodes are called secondary lymphoid tissues, how lymphocytes enter these tissues are quite different from each other. This is because the architecture of the two types of organs and the mode of lymphocyte migration into these organs are quite distinct. In the spleen, T cells are passively released in the blood flow from the arterioles in the red pulp and marginal zone area. In contrast, T cells in the blood are actively captured on high endothelial venules in lymph nodes by the coordinated actions of CCR7 and several adhesion molecules. A recent finding indicates that T cells, released in the red pulp and marginal zone areas, actively find their way to the white zone by utilizing the migration track created by periarteriolar stromal cells. This finding adds one more piece to our understanding of lymphocyte migration for effective adaptive immune responses in the spleen.","Kim, Chang H.; Liu, Qingyang",Cell Mol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7609538/,443
15099,An online repository of solvation thermodynamic and structural maps of SARS-CoV-2 targets,2020-05-13,"The toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) is the most conserved important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) often stimulated by bacterial flagellins and plays a major role in the first-line defense against invading pathogenic bacteria and in immune homeostasis. Experimental crystallographic studies have shown that the extracellular domain (ECD) of TLR5 recognizes flagellin of bacteria and functions as a homodimer in model organism zebrafish. However, no structural information is available on TLR5 functionality in the major carp Cirrhinus mrigala (mrigala) and its interaction with bacterial flagellins. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to unravel the structural basis of TLR5-flagellin recognition in mrigala using structural homodimeric TLR5-flagellin complex of zebrafish as reference. Integrative structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore the structural and mechanistic details of TLR5 recognition. Results from structural snapshots of MD simulation revealed that TLR5 consistently formed close interactions with the three helices of the D1 domain in flagellin on its lateral side mediated by several conserved amino acids. Results from the intermolecular contact analysis perfectly substantiate with the findings of per residue-free energy decomposition analysis. The differential recognition mediated by flagellin to TLR5 in mrigala involves charged residues at the interface of binding as compared to the zebrafish complex. Overall our results shows TLR5 of mrigala involved in innate immunity specifically recognized a conserved site on flagellin which advocates the scientific community to explore host-specific differences in receptor activation.","Rout, Ajaya Kumar; Acharya, Varsha; Maharana, Diptimayee; Dehury, Budheswar; Udgata, Sheela Rani; Jena, Rajkumar; Behera, Bhaskar; Parida, Pranaya Kumar; Behera, Bijay Kumar",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7808660/,443

55089,Palmitoylation of SARS‐CoV 2 Spike glycoprotein is important for viral infectivity and pathogenicity,2021-05-14,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. BACKGROUND. Many patients with COVID-19 suffer from arterial hypertension and have marked variations in blood pressure (BP) during the acute period of infection. The reasons for such changes are poorly understood. PURPOSE. To assess the relationship between the level of BP and the severity of changes in the main clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with arterial hypertension and with a moderate course of COVID-19 at the stage of the height of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study included 86 hospitalized patients with verified coronavirus disease of moderate severity: 46 of them were male, the median age was 65 years. Patients received adequate hypertension therapy for a long time. After hospitalization, treatment was adjusted if necessary. The level of laboratory parameters in the acute period of the disease was determined, including the electrolytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, ferritin, general blood test, etc. BP measured daily. The relationship between laboratory parameters and BP level was evaluated by nonparametric correlation using the Spearman coefficient and multivariate analysis based on the ""generalized nonlinear model"". RESULTS. In 67.44% of patients with hypertension, an elevated BP level (>140/90) was observed against the background of moderate COVID-19. There was a significant negative correlation between the levels of CRP and BP throughout the stay in the hospital, the most significant is the 5th day of hospitalization. At the same time, a slightly stronger relationship is observed with diastolic BP (r = -0.4425) than with systolic BP (r = -0.3525). A similar trend is observed in all BP measurements. Besides, a negative correlation was found between potassium levels and BP values. The strongest association of potassium levels is with systolic BP on the day of hospitalization (r = -0.4850) and diastolic pressure on the 1st day of hospitalization (r = -0.3561). Multivariate analysis confirmed independent and reliable ""influence"" of CRP (p = 0.00018) and potassium (p = 0.03921) as independent predictors of diastolic pressure. CONCLUSIONS. Most patients with hypertension and moderate COVID-19 have elevated BP levels. There is a statistically significant negative relationship between the values of BP and levels of CRP and potassium. The obtained data may correspond to the existing hypothesis about the significant role of the kinin–kallikrein system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Popov, K; Novitskiy, A; Shvarts, Y",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8227351/,443

60574,Electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a charged electret fibre.,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND Few studies have been designed regarding optimal reinforcement of the crotch of a side-to-side anastomosis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the weak point of the side-to-side anastomosis and to evaluate the effect of bioabsorbable reinforcement material. METHODS Fresh pig small bowel was used for all experiments. A side-to-side anastomosis was performed using a linear stapler, and the burst pressure of the anastomosis was measured. Three separate experiments were done. In experiment 1, the weak point and the burst pressure of that point were defined. In experiment 2, the burst pressure of the side of the anastomosis was measured. In experiment 3, we evaluated the effect of Neoveil(®) to strengthen the weak point of the anastomosis. RESULTS The weak point of the side-to side anastomosis was the crotch and the burst pressure was 39.8 ± 5.7 mmHg. The burst pressure of the side of the anastomosis was 109.9 ± 7.9 mmHg. This was significantly higher than the burst pressure of the crotch (P = 0.008). The burst pressure of the crotch in the group with Neoveil(®) was 83.3 ± 14.9 mmHg. This pressure was significantly higher than the group with no Neoveil(®) reinforcement (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the use of Neoveil(®) as a buttressing material is associated with reinforced staple lines and increased crotch burst pressures compared to non-buttressed staple lines. Neoveil(®) was found to perform comparably to clinically available buttress materials in this ex vivo model. Reinforcement of the weak point of the side-to-side anastomosis with Neoveil(®)may lead to fewer anastomotic leaks.","Kimura, Masahiro; Terashita, Yukio",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2016.01.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158487/,443

Eighty-four patients (mean age 56.3 ± 11.4 years; 53 males) were divided into two groups with a HR of ≥65 and <65 bpm during cCTA, respectively. Images were assigned quality scores (graded 1-4) on coronary segments. Interpretability was defined as a grade >1. Catheter angiography was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cCTA for detecting significant stenosis (≥50 %). We compared the image quality, interpretability and diagnostic accuracy between the standard and motion-correction reconstructions in both groups. The motion-correction reconstructions showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher image quality in the proximal and middle right coronary artery (RCA) in the low HR group (57.2 ± 5.0 bpm; n = 51) and proximal-to-distal RCA, posterior descending artery, and proximal and distal left circumflex artery in the high HR group (71.1 ± 4.6 bpm; n = 33). The per-segment interpretability was significantly higher using motion-correction algorithm in the middle RCA in the low HR group and in the proximal and middle RCA in high HR group. Overall, the image quality and interpretability were improved using motion-correction reconstructions in both groups (p < 0.05). Motion-correction reconstruction demonstrated higher (p < 0.05) diagnostic accuracy in 25 patients from both groups. Use of the motion-correction algorithm improves the overall image quality and interpretability of cCTA in both groups. However, it may be more beneficial to the patients with a higher HR.","Lee, Heon; Kim, Jeong A; Lee, Ji Sung; Suh, Jon; Paik, Sang Hyun; Park, Jai Soung",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-014-0499-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038955/,443

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a therapist-guided smartphone-based aftercare intervention for inpatients with AN to support symptom stabilization. METHOD A total of 186 female patients with a DSM-5 diagnosis of AN (307.1) will be randomized either to receive a 16-week smartphone-based aftercare intervention with therapist feedback as add-on to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Data will be assessed at discharge (= baseline, T0), after 16 weeks (= end of the aftercare intervention, T1) and after 10 months (= 6-month follow-up, T2). Primary outcome will be overall eating disorder symptomatology (Eating Disorder Examination Global score). Secondary outcome measures will include body mass index, depression, motivation to change, self-efficacy, patient satisfaction with and adherence to the smartphone-based aftercare intervention as well as rehospitalization rate.

Post-processing software tools for lobar emphysema quantification are useful for patient and target lobe selection, treatment planning and post-interventional follow-up. We aimed to evaluate the inter-software variability of emphysema quantification using fully automated lobar segmentation prototypes. MATERIAL AND METHODS 66 patients with moderate to severe COPD who underwent CT for planning of BLVR were included. Emphysema quantification was performed using 2 modified versions of in-house software (without and with prototype advanced lung vessel segmentation; programs 1 [YACTA v.2.3.0.2] and 2 [YACTA v.2.4.3.1]), as well as 1 commercial program 3 [Pulmo3D VA30A_HF2] and 1 pre-commercial prototype 4 [CT COPD ISP ver7.0]). The following parameters were computed for each segmented anatomical lung lobe and the whole lung: lobar volume (LV), mean lobar density (MLD), 15th percentile of lobar density (15th), emphysema volume (EV) and emphysema index (EI). Bland-Altman analysis (limits of agreement, LoA) and linear random effects models were used for comparison between the software. RESULTS Segmentation using programs 1, 3 and 4 was unsuccessful in 1 (1%), 7 (10%) and 5 (7%) patients, respectively. Program 2 could analyze all datasets. The 53 patients with successful segmentation by all 4 programs were included for further analysis. For LV, program 1 and 4 showed the largest mean difference of 72 ml and the widest LoA of [-356, 499 ml] (p<0.05). Program 3 and 4 showed the largest mean difference of 4% and the widest LoA of [-7, 14%] for EI (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Only a single software program was able to successfully analyze all scheduled data-sets. Although mean bias of LV and EV were relatively low in lobar quantification, ranges of disagreement were substantial in both of them. For longitudinal emphysema monitoring, not only scanning protocol but also quantification software needs to be kept constant.","Lim, Hyun-ju; Weinheimer, Oliver; Wielpütz, Mark O; Dinkel, Julien; Hielscher, Thomas; Gompelmann, Daniela; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Heussel, Claus Peter",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27029047/,443

Upon evaporation, the molecules partially cleave and form metallo-organic dimers while single molecules are very scarce, as confirmed by simulations. By applying voltage pulses to the different structures under similar conditions, we observe that only one type of dimer can be controllably driven on the surface, which has the lowest dipole moment of all investigated structures. Experiments under different bias and tip height conditions reveal that the electric field is the main driving force of the directed motion. We discuss the different observed structures and their movement properties with respect to their dipole moment and charge distribution on the surface.","Kühne, Tim; Au-Yeung, Kwan Ho; Eisenhut, Frank; Aiboudi, Oumaima; Ryndyk, Dmitry A; Cuniberti, Gianaurelio; Lissel, Franziska; Moresco, Francesca",Nanoscale,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0nr06809h; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305772/,443

Laparoscopic conversion to gastric bypass has been recommended as the procedure of choice. This single-center retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of revisional gastric bypass after failed adjustable gastric banding. METHODS The study included 108 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic conversion of gastric banding to gastric bypass from 2002 to 2012. Indications for surgery, operative data, weight development, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 3.4 years (maximum, 10 years). RESULTS The most common indications for band removal were band migration, insufficient weight loss, and pouch dilation. The median interval between gastric banding and gastric bypass was 6.6 years. In 52 % of the cases, band removal and gastric bypass surgery were performed simultaneously as a single-stage laparoscopic procedure. The early postoperative morbidity rate was 10.2 %. The body mass index before gastric banding (43.3 kg/m(2)) decreased significantly to 37.9 kg/m(2) before gastric bypass and to 28.8 kg/m(2) 5 years after gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on the long-term outcome after conversion of failed adjustable gastric banding to gastric bypass. Findings have shown revisional gastric bypass to be a feasible bariatric procedure particularly for patients with insufficient weight loss that guarantees a constant and long-lasting weight loss.","Perathoner, Alexander; Zitt, Matthias; Lanthaler, Monika; Pratschke, Johann; Biebl, Matthias; Mittermair, Reinhard",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3047-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23807753/,443

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective monocentric registry was approved by our Local Institutional Review Board. Between January 2008 and January 2013, all consecutive patients who fully met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the ERC-procedure prospective registry. They were assigned to follow-up at discharge and again at 1 and 6 months. Efficacy was evaluated using a pain visual analog scale (VAS), and narcotic consumption and quality of life were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire. RESULTS Fifty-two patients were enrolled, among whom 58 lesions were treated. Technical success was obtained in all procedures. The median VAS score decreased from 7 ± 1.4 (ranges 5-10) at baseline to 3 ± 1.5 (ranges 0-6) at discharge, 2 ± 1.5 (ranges 0-5) at 1 month (p < 0.0001), and 2 ± 1.6 (ranges 0-5) at 6 months. In 28 patients (54 %), narcotic consumption was halved at discharge and halved in 40 (77 %) patients at 1 and 6 months compared with baseline. Five patients had complete pain relief at 1 month. A major improvement in quality of life, especially regarding mood and motion, was observed in all patients. CONCLUSION This specific approach to painful bone metastasis is efficient and safe and yields sustained results. The ERC procedure could be suggested for patients with RCC bone metastasis.","Pellerin, Olivier; Medioni, Jacques; Vulser, Claire; Déan, Carole; Oudard, Stéphane; Sapoval, Marc",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-013-0740-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24091753/,443

Clinical manifestations include symptoms and signs such as leg pain and heaviness, edema, redness, telangiectasia, new varicose veins, hyperpigmentation, skin thickening and in severe cases, leg ulcers. The best way to prevent PTS is to prevent DVT with pharmacologic or mechanical thromboprophylaxis used in high risk patients and settings. In patients whose DVT is treated with a vitamin K antagonist, subtherapeutic INRs should be avoided. We do not suggest routine use of elastic compression stockings (ECS) after DVT to prevent PTS, but in patients with acute DVT-related leg swelling that is bothersome, a trial of ECS is reasonable. We suggest that selecting patients for catheter-directed thrombolytic techniques be done on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on patients with extensive thrombosis, recent symptoms onset, and low bleeding risk, who are seen at experienced hospital centers. For patients with established PTS, we suggest prescribing 20-30 mm Hg knee-length ECS to be worn daily. If ineffective, a stronger pressure stocking can be tried. We suggest that intermittent compression devices or pneumatic compression sleeve units be tried in patients with moderate-to-severe PTS whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with ECS alone. We suggest that a supervised exercise training program for 6 months or more is reasonable for PTS patients who can tolerate it. We suggest that management of post-thrombotic ulcers should involve a multidisciplinary approach.

Through empirical studies of contemporary examples of health care related uncertainties and their management, our collection explores the different ways in which uncertainty may be articulated, enacted and experienced. The papers address a diverse range of healthcare contexts - Alzheimer's disease, neonatal surgery, cardiovascular disease prevention, cancer, addiction (use of alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy), mental health/disorders and medical education - and many tackle issues of contemporary relevance, such as an ageing population, and novel medical interventions and their sequelae. These empirical papers are complemented by a further theoretical contribution, which considers the role of 'implicit normativity' in masking and containing potential ethical uncertainty. By mapping themes across the collection, in this introduction we present a number of core analytical strands: (1) conceptualising uncertainty; (2) intersections of uncertainty with aspects of care; (3) managing uncertainty; and (4) structural constraints, economic austerity and uncertainty work. We reflect on the methodological and theoretical stances used to think sociologically about uncertainty in health care, and the strengths, silences and gaps we observe in the collection.

Experimental environmental manipulation, particularly when conducted in experiments where the dynamics of the purging of deleterious alleles are compared, has demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on the strength and direction of selection. However, many of these experiments are conducted with fairly simplistic environments when it is not always clear how or why particular forms of spatial heterogeneity may influence behaviour or selection. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we tested three different spatial environments designed to determine if spatial constraint of critical resources influences the efficiency of natural and sexual selection. We conducted two allele purging experiments to 1) assess the effects of these spatial treatments on the selective dynamics of six recessive mutations, and 2) determine how these dynamics changed when sexual selection was relaxed and the spatial area was reduced. We found that allele purging dynamics depended on spatial environment, however the patterns of purging rates between the environments differed across distinct deleterious mutations. We also found that for two of the mutations, the addition of sexual selection increased the purging rate.","Wilson, Audrey E; Siddiqui, Ali; Dworkin, Dr. Ian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.05.283705,443

Type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and signaling has been reported to be causal in cytokine storm-associated pathology in several respiratory viral infections, however, the mechanisms by which IFN-I promotes disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, using Usp18-deficient, USP18 enzymatic-inactive and Isg15-deficient mouse models, we report that lack of deISGylation during persistent viral infection leads to severe immune pathology characterized by hematological disruptions, cytokine amplification, lung vascular leakage and death. This pathology requires T cells but not T cell-intrinsic deletion of Usp18. However, lack of Usp18 in myeloid cells mimicked the pathological manifestations observed in Usp18-/- or Usp18C61A mice which were dependent on Isg15. We further mechanistically demonstrate that interrupting the ISGylation/deISGylation circuit increases extracellular levels of ISG15 which is accompanied by inflammatory neutrophil accumulation to the lung. Importantly, neutrophil depletion reversed morbidity and mortality in Usp18C61A mice. In summary, we reveal that the enzymatic function of Usp18 is crucial for regulating extracellular release of ISG15. This is accompanied by altered neutrophil differentiation, cytokine amplification and mortality following persistent viral infection. Moreover, our results suggest that extracellular ISG15 may drive the inflammatory pathology observed and could be both a prospective predictor of disease outcome and a therapeutic target during severe respiratory viral infections.","Shaabani, Namir; Zak, Jaroslav; Johnson, Jennifer L.; Huang, Zhe; Nguyen, Nhan; Lazar, Daniel C.; Vartabedian, Vincent F.; Honke, Nadine; Prinz, Marco; Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter; Arimoto, Kei-ichiro; Zhang, Dong-Er; Catz, Sergio D.; Teijaro, John R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.039321,443
163507,The spike protein mutations and its effect on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis,2021,"Abstract Most countries around the world including the United States took actions to control COVID-19 spread that led to an abrupt shift in human activity. On-road NOx emissions from light and heavy-duty vehicles decreased by 9% to 19% between February and March at the onset of the lockdown period in the middle of March in most of the US;between March and April, the on-road NOx emissions dropped further by 8% to 31% when lockdown measures were the most stringent. These precipitous drops in NOx emissions correlated well (r = 0.75) with tropospheric NO2 column amount observed by the Sentinel 5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P TROPOMI). Furthermore, the changes in TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 across the continental US between 2020 and 2019 correlated well with changes in on-road NOx emissions (r = 0.68) but correlated weakly with changes in emissions from the power plants (r = 0.35). At the height of lock-down related unemployment in the second quarter of 2020, the tropospheric NO2 values decreased at the rate of 0.8 µmoles/m2 per unit percentage increase in the unemployment rate. Despite the lifting of lockdown measures, parts of the US continued to have ?20% below normal on-road NOx emissions. To achieve this new normal urban air quality in the US, continuing remote work policies that do not impede economic growth may become one of the many options.","Kondragunta, S.; Wei, Z.; McDonald, B.

165429,Relative Ratios of Human Seasonal Coronavirus Antibodies Predict the Efficiency of Cross-Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Binding to ACE2,2021-07-16,"Abstract Often today’s designers are relegated to degrade their own output to realize mass production on existing manufacturing capital equipment. These considerations are typically encoded in the design process through “Design for Manufacturing” where constraints on the production processes available and limits to each manufacturing approach are ideally considered early in design. This Design for Manufacturing guise inhibits true designer creativity and the possibility to realize truly revolutionary products. In this paper, the authors formalize their previous introduction of the concept of Manufacturing for Design (MFD), a framework whereby product design creativity is used instead as a motive force of innovation to rethink manufacturing process approaches and assist in facilitating real innovation in manufacturing. This is not proposed as a replacement for DFM, but an extension that can help “question” the manufacturing-based requirements during the development process. It is clear that existing machines cannot be abandoned, but one can instead consider an intermediate augmentation step to feasibly enhance existing capital, to realize new designs in new materials, or to achieve new functional requirements and desires. The blending of MFD and DFM strategies (a proposed MFD|DFM approach) can lead to feasible evolution of manufacturing, and ultimately disruptive process innovation, defined as a rethinking of manufacturing rather than just improvement on existing solutions. Herein is reported the integration of the MFD|DFM concept to two separate education programs, one undergraduate and one graduate. These programs are independent but share resources together with those of an Advanced Manufacturing technical college program to educate students across disciplines and curricula in the dichotomy of Design and Manufacturing, and how the concepts can be properly considered together.","Mears, Laine; Summers, Joshua",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316073,443

WHO and Autism Speaks co-designed a training program titled ""WHO-Caregiver Skills Training"" (WHO-CST) which aims at providing training for caregivers whose children are with possible symptoms of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), so that they can learn better strategies on managing the daily lives of their children and foster better communication between the parent-children dyad. The WHO-CST programme is currently implemented in more than 30 regions worldwide and it started in Hong Kong from 2018. As the programme is newly developed, only a few studies tried to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in qualitative approaches, or in quantitative approach with relatively small sample (e.g. n < 10). In the present study, our team, who is responsible for the implementation and evaluation of the WHO-CST programme in Hong Kong, attempt to assess the effectiveness of the training in WHO-CST under a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with about 120 eligible caregivers who will be randomly assigned in experimental and control groups. Our measurement will include the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI) developed by experts in WHO to gauge how parents engage their children in a 10-minute video recording their dyadic interaction and behaviors in a defined play setting. A set of other measurements on the caregiver's experience of using intervention skills and their enhancement of knowledges will also be measured. We hypothesize that caregivers in treatment group will have better growth in scores of both JERI and measurements of other outcome than the wait-list control group's after the 12-week WHO-CST training, and also persistence of skill and knowledge level should also be found after a 30-day follow-up test.","Wong, W.

One of important skills to address disaster mitigation issue is Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) that can be trained using the Innovation Learning Model for Natural Science and Environmental Learning (ILMIZI) model regarding e-learning. This research aims to measure HOTS and descriptively analyse the e-learning and ILMIZI model. The research method is descriptive with survey as the data collection technique. The total sample size of this research were 176 students divided into 105 diploma students and 71 undergraduate students. The results show a very low HOTS score of students at the diploma (30.98) and undergraduate (32.02) level regarding disaster mitigation concepts. This study also considered the dominant use of Power Point file (41.38%), distractions in e-learning related to phone signals (44.83%), and the study discovered that majority of students feel more independent in learning (62.07%). The descriptive analysis indicates that the ILMIZI model is compatible for use in environmental learning concerning disaster mitigation. It is the finding of this research that student’s HOTS scores are still low;the implementation of e-learning programmes faces some obstacles;and the ILMIZI model is suitable for environmental learning as a means of disaster mitigation. © 2021, Journal of Sustainability Science and Management.

However, pharmaceutical products known as substandard and falsified that do not meet regulatory standards and quality threaten the health of the population of today and future leading to socio-economic hardship, drug resistances and put life of patients in danger. We analyzed the recall notice from 2010 to 2020 issued by the department of drug administration (DDA), government of Nepal to understand the overview of substandard and falsified pharmaceutical products in Nepal. The number of recalled pharmaceutical products has significantly increased over the past decade in Nepal (p-value< 0.05). The most recalled drugs were antimicrobials followed by gastrointestinal medicines, vitamins and supplements, pain and palliative medicines among others. Number of recalled drugs manufactured by domestic pharmaceutical producers and imported ones were not significantly different. Majority of imported recalled drugs originated from India. Sixty-two percentage of recalled drugs were substandard, 11% were falsified and remaining 27% were not registered at the DDA. Similarly, sixty percentage of recalled drugs were modern and 35% were traditional ones. The hand sanitizers used to minimize the COVID-19 transmission contributed significantly to the list of recalled pharmaceutical products in 2020. Most of these sanitizers contained significant amount of methanol instead of ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol. We also reviewed peer-reviewed research papers that reported data of substandard and falsified drugs. Only four such papers were found in literature. These papers reported issues with labeling, unregistered drugs and drugs failed in a number of laboratory testing. Since the recall data did not include number of samples tested and location of sample collected, a systematic study to understand the prevalence of substandard and falsified drugs in Nepal is recommended.","Neupane, A.; Bastakoti, M.; Tamang, S.; Giri, B.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.21255541v1?rss=1,443

Respiratory droplet transmission is a common transmission route for many airborne diseases, including novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Wearing the face mask prevents respiratory droplet transmission. Both face mask leakage and non-use of the face mask under high-speed wind conditions can increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The respiratory droplets’ behavior during sneezing or coughing (i.e., the size and the distance between droplets) depends on face mask wearing. The respiratory droplets during coughing and sneezing break apart into extremely small respiratory droplets (i.e., cloud of aerosol) upon interaction with the high-speed wind condition. The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method has been used to study the deformation and breakup of a single respiratory droplet placed in high-speed wind flow in the presence of smaller neighboring respiratory droplets. The effect of the diameter of respiratory droplets and the distance between them on the breakup mechanism has been investigated using open-source field operation and manipulation (OpenFOAM) libraries. The results are presented for the dimensionless distance and the normalized diameter of the secondary respiratory droplet in the ranges of 2 to 6 and 0.4 to 0.8, respectively. According to the results of simulations, the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 increases with a decrease in respiratory droplet breakup time. In addition, the effects of ambient relative humidity and temperature on the cloud of respiratory particles were analyzed. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Mouse aSyn contains a threonine residue at position 53 that mimics the human familial PD substitution A53T, yet in contrast to A53T patients, mice show no evidence of aSyn neuropathology even after aging. Here we studied the neurotoxicity of human A53T, mouse aSyn, and various human-mouse chimeras in cellular and in vivo models as well as their biochemical properties relevant to aSyn pathobiology. We report that mouse aSyn is less neurotoxic than the human A53T variant as a result of inhibitory effects of two C-terminal amino acid substitutions on membrane-induced aSyn aggregation and aSyn-mediated vesicle permeabilization. Our findings highlight the importance of membrane-induced self-assembly in aSyn neurotoxicity and suggest that inhibiting this process by targeting the C-terminal domain could slow neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathy disorders.","Landeck, Natalie; Strathearn, Katherine E.; Ysselstein, Daniel; Buck, Kerstin; Dutta, Sayan; Banerjee, Siddhartha; Lv, Zhengjian; Hulleman, John D.; Hindupur, Jagadish; Lin, Li-Kai; Padalkar, Sonal; McCabe, George P.; Stanciu, Lia A.; Lyubchenko, Yuri L.; Kirik, Deniz; Rochet, Jean-Christophess",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/700377,443

We aimed to provide robust estimates of incidence rates and relative risks of neurological and psychiatric diagnoses in patients in the 6 months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods For this retrospective cohort study and time-to-event analysis, we used data obtained from the TriNetX electronic health records network (with over 81 million patients). Our primary cohort comprised patients who had a COVID-19 diagnosis;one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with influenza, and the other matched control cohort included patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection including influenza in the same period. Patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 were excluded from the control cohorts. All cohorts included patients older than 10 years who had an index event on or after Jan 20, 2020, and who were still alive on Dec 13, 2020. We estimated the incidence of 14 neurological and psychiatric outcomes in the 6 months after a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage;ischaemic stroke;parkinsonism;Guillain-Barre syndrome;nerve, nerve root, and plexus disorders;myoneural junction and muscle disease;encephalitis;dementia;psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders (grouped and separately);substance use disorder;and insomnia. Using a Cox model, we compared incidences with those in propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with influenza or other respiratory tract infections. We investigated how these estimates were affected by COVID-19 severity, as proxied by hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, and encephalopathy (delirium and related disorders). We assessed the robustness of the differences in outcomes between cohorts by repeating the analysis in different scenarios. To provide benchmarking for the incidence and risk of neurological and psychiatric sequelae, we compared our primary cohort with four cohorts of patients diagnosed in the same period with additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture of a large bone, and pulmonary embolism. Findings Among 236 379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the following 6 months was 33.62% (95% CI 33.17-34.07), with 12.84% (12.36-13.33) receiving their first such diagnosis. For patients who had been admitted to an ITU, the estimated incidence of a diagnosis was 46.42% (44.78-48.09) and for a first diagnosis was 25.79% (23.50-28.25). Regarding individual diagnoses of the study outcomes, the whole COVID-19 cohort had estimated incidences of 0.56% (0.50-0.63) for intracranial haemorrhage, 2.10% (1.97-2.23) for ischaemic stroke, 0.11% (0.08-0.14) for parkinsonism, 0.67% (0.59-0.75) for dementia, 17.39% (17.04-17.74) for anxiety disorder, and 1.40% (1.30-1.51) for psychotic disorder, among others. In the group with ITU admission, estimated incidences were 2.66% (2.24-3.16) for intracranial haemorrhage, 6.92% (6.17-7.76) for ischaemic stroke, 0.26% (0.15-0.45) for parkinsonism, 1.74% (1.31-2.30) for dementia, 19.15% (17.90-20.48) for anxiety disorder, and 2.77% (2.31-3.33) for psychotic disorder.

Major pandemics were proven to be a catalyst of changes in societies and economies. The main aim of this research was to examine the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak on consumers' behaviour and draw recommendations for entrepreneurs. A survey was conducted as a method to collect data from consumers creating a representative sample of the population of the Slovak Republic. The rate of consumption has significantly increased when compared before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings show how people of different age, gender and income altered their shopping habits and how the factors influencing their consumers' behaviour changed during this situation.

This cross-sectional study assessed 284 patients recruited from a tertiary hospital. Patients completed a web-based survey on socio-demographic data, past medical/psychiatric history, and additional information relevant to the outbreak conditions. The psychiatric status was assessed using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and MINI suicidality scale. Patients completed a checklist for the acute symptom burden and protracted symptoms that were experienced after the acute infection. After a mean of 50 days following the diagnosis of COVID-19, 98 patients (34.5%) reported clinically significant PTSD, anxiety, and/or depression, with PTSD being the most common condition reported (25.4%). One hundred and eighteen patients (44.3%) reported one or more protracted symptom(s), with fatigue, muscle aches, alteration of smell/taste, headache and difficulty in concentration, being the most common symptoms reported. Predictors of PTSD symptom severity were the female gender, past traumatic events, protracted symptoms, perceived stigmatization, and a negative view on the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that PTSD symptom severity was the sole independent predictor of the presence of protracted symptoms. Our results suggest that COVID-19 patients may be prone to substantial psychological distress in the first months after the infection. The protracted symptoms were also frequent in this period, and these were related to the posttraumatic psychiatric morbidity. Both the psychiatric morbidity and the protracted symptoms were independent of the initial infection severity. Further research on the neurobiological commonalities between the protracted symptoms and PTSD in COVID-19 patients is warranted.","Poyraz, Burc Cagri; Poyraz, Cana Aksoy; Olgun, Yesim; Gurel, Ozge; Alkan, Sena; Ozdemir, Yusuf Emre; Balkan, Ilker Inanc; Karaali, Ridvan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208249,443
177415,Structural and Biochemical Rationale for Enhanced Spike Protein Fitness in Delta and Kappa SARS-CoV-2 Variants,2021-09-02,"Background: In-person interaction at school and offices offers invaluable experience to students and benefits to companies. In the midst of the pandemic, ways to safely go back to schools and offices have been argued. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends taking all precautions such as vaccination and universal indoor masking. However, even if all the precautions are implemented and transmission is perfectly prevented in the facilities, they may be infected outside of the facilities, which would be a source of transmission in the facilities. Therefore, identifying those infected outside of the facility through screening is essential to safely go back to schools or offices. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of screening are limited. Further, it is not well clarified now which screening strategy (e.g., low or high sensitivity antigen tests, intervals and the number of tests) effectively identify infected and infectious individuals to avoid transmission in facilities Methods: We assessed the effectiveness of various screening strategies in schools and offices through quantitative simulation. The effectiveness was assessed by the proportion of identified infected and infectious participants. Infection dynamics in the facility is governed by transmission dynamics of the population they belong to, and the screening is initiated at different epidemic phases: growth, peak, and declining phases. The viral load trajectory over time for each infected individual was modelled by the viral dynamics model, and the transmission process at the population level was modelled by a deterministic compartment model. The model parameters were estimated from clinical and epidemiological data. Screening strategies were varied by antigen tests with different sensitivity and schedules of screening over 10 days. Results: Under the daily screening, we found high sensitivity antigen tests (the detection limit: 63000 copies/mL) yielded 88% (95%CI 86-89) of effectiveness by the end of 10 days screening period, which is about 20% higher than that with low sensitivity antigen tests (2000000 copies/mL). Comparing screening scenarios with different schedules, we found early and frequent screening is the key to maximize the effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis revealed that less frequent tests might be an option when the number of antigen tests is limited especially when the screening is performed at the growth phase. Discussion: High sensitivity antigen tests, high frequency screening, and immediate initiation of screening are the key to safely restart educational and economic activities allowing in-person interactions. Our computational framework is useful in assessment of screening strategies by incorporating additional factors for specific situations.","Jeong, Y. D.; Ejima, K.; Kim, K.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on a group of paramedicine students at an Australian university. Methods A cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of first and second year paramedicine students was undertaken to explore their perceived experiences of COVID-19 through both qualitative and quantitative responses. Results A total of 83 paramedicine students from Griffith University in Queensland participated in the survey, demonstrating an 84.7% response rate. Of the participants, 78.3% (n=65) disagreed that online workshop sessions were as valuable as face-to-face sessions. Similarly, the majority of participants (61.5%, n=51) disagreed that online lectures and tutorials were as beneficial as in-person equivalents. A further 61.4% (n=51) of students agreed that COVID-19-associated lockdowns had negatively impacted their ability to formulate strong personal relationships that are important for university, however 78.3% of students agreed that communication platforms assisted in maintaining some form of social interaction. Conclusion The results from this study demonstrate that the educational and social impacts of COVID-19 on paramedicine students were highly diverse, and were contingent on several factors including but not limited to: year of study, learning style, previously established social connections and extenuating life circumstances. © 2021, Paramedics Australasia.

Serum clozapine levels are essential both for therapeutic dosing and to monitor adherence. Use of venepuncture and prolonged result turnaround times with standard laboratory based methods for drug monitoring together contribute to the suboptimal use of clozapine.ObjectivesA novel portable point-of-care (POC) device has been developed to measure whole blood clozapine concentrations using an automated homogenous immunoassay. It is as accurate and reliable as standard laboratory methods but only requires a drop of blood obtained by finger prick and can produce a result in minutes. We pioneered clozapine POC testing in the acute inpatient setting during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsWe report on the use of POC clozapine testing in the management of 4 acutely psychotic patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia.ResultsPOC testing offered a more practical, less invasive and quicker alternative to conventional methods for monitoring of clozapine levels. Near immediate availability of clozapine levels expedited clinical decisions and helped ensure safe clozapine prescribing to severely unwell patients in a time of crisis. By facilitating patients’ early safe discharge from hospital, clozapine point of care testing also reduced length of hospitalisation.ConclusionsPoint of care monitoring of other psychotropic medications in addition to clozapine brings about the prospect of personalised precision medicine for patients with severe mental illness, both in the acute setting and in the community.","Boland, X.; Dratcu, L.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.1216,443

182639,Molecular evolution and structural analyses of the spike glycoprotein from Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 genomes: the impact of the fixation of selected mutations,2021-07-19,"Mammalian protein N-linked glycosylation is critical for glycoprotein folding, quality control, trafficking, recognition and function. N-linked glycans are synthesized from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 precursors that are trimmed and modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus by glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. Endo-α-1,2-mannosidase (MANEA) is the sole endo-acting glycoside hydrolase involved in N-glycan trimming and unusually is located within the Golgi, where it allows ER escaped glycoproteins to bypass the classical N-glycosylation trimming pathway involving ER glucosidases I and II. There is considerable interest in the use of small molecules that disrupt N-linked glycosylation as therapeutic agents for diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Here we report the structure of the catalytic domain of human MANEA and complexes with substrate-derived inhibitors, which provide insight into dynamic loop movements that occur upon substrate binding. We reveal structural features of the human enzyme that explain its substrate preference and the mechanistic basis for catalysis. The structures inspired the development of new inhibitors that disrupted host protein N-glycan processing of viral glycans and reduced infectivity of bovine viral diarrhea and dengue viruses in cellular models. These results may contribute to efforts of developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents and bring about a more detailed view of the biology of mammalian glycosylation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The glycosylation of proteins is a major protein modification that occurs extensively in eukaryotes. Glycosidases in the secretory pathway that trim N-linked glycans play a key role in protein quality control and in the specific modifications leading to mature glycoproteins. Inhibition of glucosidases in the secretory pathway is a proven therapeutic strategy, and one with great promise in the treatment of viral disease. The enzyme endo-α-1,2-mannosidase, MANEA, provides an alternative processing pathway to evade glucosidase inhibitors. We report the 3D structure of human MANEA and complexes with enzyme inhibitors that we show act as antivirals for bovine viral diarrhea and human dengue viruses. The structure of MANEA will support inhibitor optimization and the development of more potent antivirals.","Sobala, Łukasz F.; Fernandes, Pearl Z; Hakki, Zalihe; Thompson, Andrew J; Howe, Jonathon D; Hill, Michelle; Zitzmann, Nicole; Davies, Scott; Stamataki, Zania; Butters, Terry D.; Alonzi, Dominic S.; Williams, Spencer J; Davies, Gideon J",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.179523,443

However, many factors influence recovery and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, complicating data interpretation. Specifically, these factors may differentially affect the measured virus concentration, depending on the laboratory methods used to perform the test. Many laboratories add a proxy virus to wastewater samples to determine losses associated with concentration and extraction of viral RNA. While measuring recovery of a proxy virus is an important process control, in this piece, we describe the caveats and limitations to the interpretation of this control, including that it typically does not account for losses during RNA extraction. We recommend reporting the directly measured concentration data alongside the measured recovery efficiency, rather than attempting to correct the concentration for recovery efficiency. Even though the ability to directly compare SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from different sampling locations determined using different methods is limited, concentration data (uncorrected for recovery) can be useful for public health response.","Kantor, Rose S; Nelson, Kara L; Greenwald, Hannah D; Kennedy, Lauren C",Environ Sci Technol,,443

However, information about the long-term complications affecting this population is lacking. AIMS: Investigation of long-term impact of COVID-19 in HCW. METHODS: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated for the majority of HCW in an English teaching hospital 2 months following the peak of COVID-19 first wave. A questionnaire investigating the long-term complications was sent through global e-mail to HCW 4 months following the peak of the wave enquiring about the persistent health issues still affecting them at that point. RESULTS: Out of 3759 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 932 were positive (24%). Forty-five per cent of 138 HCW responding to the questionnaire reported persistent symptoms with 32% struggling to cope 3-4 months following the peak of the wave. Moderate-to-severe fatigue stood out as the most disabling symptom (39%) but mild-to-moderate shortness of breath, anxiety and sleep disturbance were almost universal in the subjects still struggling with symptoms. Only 16% consulted their general practitioner (GP) about their symptoms with only 2% taking sick leave after recovering from the acute illness. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that about a third of HCW who responded to the survey were still struggling to cope with the symptoms of what is now known as long covid several months after the acute COVID-19 infections. The overwhelming majority of this group seem to be reluctant to neither seek medical advice nor take sick leave.","Gaber, T A-Z K; Ashish, A; Unsworth, A",Occup Med (Lond),,443

Despite some successful cases and conservation efforts, 21.4% of China's vertebrate species are threatened by human activities. The booming wildlife trade in China has posed serious threat to wildlife in China and throughout the world, while leading to a high risk of transmission of infectious zoonotic diseases. China's wildlife conservation has faced a series of challenges, two of which are an impractical, separated management of wildlife and outdated protected species lists. Although the Wildlife Protection Law of China was revised in 2016, the issues of separated management remain, and the protected species lists are still not adequately revised. These issues have led to inefficient and overlapping management, waste of administrative resources, and serious obstacles to wildlife protection. In this article, we analyze the negative effects of current separated management of wildlife species and outdated protected species lists, and provide some suggestions for amendment of the laws and reform of wildlife management system.","Gong, Shiping; Wu, Jun; Gao, Yangchun; Fong, Jonathan J; Parham, James F; Shi, Haitao",Curr Biol,,443

In patients with chronic respiratory lung diseases, SARS-CoV-2 may result in significant morbidity and increased mortality. We present a case of a 69-year-old male with stage II pulmonary sarcoidosis who had been under observation for 30 months without immunosuppressive treatment. He then developed severe SARS-CoV-2 disease with typical radiological and laboratory findings. Therapy with oxygen, antibiotics, low-molecular-weight heparin in a prophylactic dose, and dexamethasone resulted in marked clinical improvement. We will discuss the rationale for corticosteroid use in both SARS-CoV-2 disease and in SARS-CoV-2 disease that is complicating comorbid sarcoidosis.","Opoka, Lucyna Magdalena; Wyrostkiewicz, Dorota; Winek, Jolanta; Blasinska, Katarzyna; Milkowska-Dymanowska, Joanna; Szturmowicz, Monika",Adv Respir Med,,443

219514,Mutations observed in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and their effects in the interaction of virus with ACE-2 receptor,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In accordance with initial guidance from the Royal College of Surgeons and Royal College of Radiologists, we evaluated the utility of CT of the chest in the exclusion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection prior to elective cancer surgery on self-isolating patients during the pandemic. METHODS: All surgical referrals without symptoms of COVID-19 infection in April and May 2020 were included. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Screening included CT chest for major thoracic and abdominal surgery. CTs were reported according to British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidelines and correlated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and surgical outcomes. RESULTS: The prevalence of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection in our screened population was 0.7% (5/681). 240 pre-operative CTs were performed. 3.8% (9/240) of CTs were reported as abnormal, only one of which was RT-PCR positive. 2% (5/240) of cases had surgery postponed based on CT results. All nine patients with CTs reported as abnormal have had surgery, all without complication. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in our screened population was low. The pre-test probability of CT chest in asymptomatic, self-isolating patients is consequently low. CT can produce false positives in this setting, introducing unnecessary delay in surgery for a small proportion of cases. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Self-isolation, clinical assessment and RT-PCR are effective at minimising COVID-19 related surgical risk. The addition of CT chest is unhelpful. Our data have particular relevance during the second wave of infection and in the recovery phase.","Ap Dafydd, Derfel; O039,; Mahony, Michelle; Jhanji, Shaman; Devaraj, Anand; Allum, William; Nicol, David; Blunt, Dominic M; Riddell, Angela M",Br J Radiol,,443

221101,Antibody responses to BNT162b2 vaccination in Japan: Monitoring vaccine efficacy by measuring IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Background: The occurrence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have profoundly affected adult kidney disease patients. In contrast, pediatric solid organ transplant recipients, including pediatric kidney transplant (KT) recipients, do not seem to be at particularly higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe COVID-19 disease. This patient population might be protected by certain mechanisms, such as the immunosuppressive medications with their anti-inflammatory properties or simply being well-versed in self-protection techniques. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 antibody serologies could potentially help understand why this patient population is apparently spared from severe SARS-CoV-2 clinical courses. Objective: To examine SARS-CoV-2 serologic status in a cohort of pediatric KT recipients. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by three different methods in pediatric KT recipients coming for routine clinic visits immediately post-confinement in May-June of 2020. The patients were considered seroconverted if SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were positive by 2/3 methods and weak positive/indeterminate if positive by 1/3. Results: Thirty-one patients were evaluated (about 1/3 of our institution's pediatric KT population). One patient seroconverted, while three were considered weak positive/indeterminate. None were symptomatic and none had nasopharyngeal PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 disease. Conclusions: Seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 was rare in this population and likely reflects the social distancing practiced by these patients. The results will serve as a foundation for a future longitudinal study to evaluate the long-term emergence and persistence of antibodies in this population and may inform studies of response to a future vaccine.","Nailescu, Corina; Khalid, Myda; Wilson, Amy C; Amanat, Fatima; Arregui, Samuel; Canas, Jorge; Hooks, Jenaya; Krammer, Florian; Schwaderer, Andrew L; Hains, David S",Front Pediatr,,443

Like other specialties, Interventional Radiology (IR) rapidly adapted to the evolving situation. Members of BSIR were surveyed to obtain a snapshot of the experiences of UK IRs in response to COVID-19. An electronic survey was compiled using Google Forms, approved by the BSIR Council Officers and distributed to BSIR members by email on 18 th April 2020. A total of 228 responses were received. The survey was open for a 14-day period and the data analysed in Microsoft Excel 365. The response rate was 29% (228/800). RESULTS: Two thirds of respondents work in a Tertiary unit and 33% deliver IR in a District Hospital. 84% have a day-case facility. After the COVID-19 crisis, 81% of respondents were able to maintain 24-7 On-call service. 59% of respondents had been required change their day to day practice to allow the on-call service to continue. 55% of respondents were involved in providing a central line service. Of those questioned, 91% continued to offer endovascular services, 98% genitourinary and 92% hepatobiliary services, although a degree of service reduction was described. 38% have provided IR trainees with additional training material during this pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This survey has confirmed that the responses of UK IR departments to the COVID-19 crisis have ensured vital on-call and urgent services have continued, including ongoing availability of most IR sub-specialties. Availability of a day case facility has possibly influenced the positive response.","Rostampour, Sammy; Cleveland, Trevor; White, Hilary; Haslam, Philip; McCafferty, Ian; Hamady, Mo",CVIR Endovasc,,443

At the Bristol Royal Infirmary, an innercity teaching hospital that manages patients aged 16 and over, we present our response to these projected changes in ED attendances, with the initiation of the incident triage area (ITA). The ITA is a triage station situated outside the ED and staffed by a senior clinician, healthcare assistant and patient flow coordinator. It receives patients presenting as walk-in or via ambulance, and on their arrival aims to establish their risk of COVID-19 and their acuity of illness. This allows for triage of the patient to one of the four zones of the hospital, as well as providing clinical guidance on any initial interventions that patients may require. The benefits of the ITA are that it enables an early senior review of patients to establish their acuity of illness and initiate time-critical medical intervention as required. In addition, patients are immediately cohorted to zones within the hospital based on their infection risk, thereby reducing patient footfall throughout the hospital. Its aim is to reduce the spread of infection, by efficiently triaging and streaming patients who present to the hospital prior to them entering clinical areas, while maintaining patient safety and flow through the ED and initiating rapid management of acutely unwell patients.","Sainsbury, Rebecca; Brennan, Rose; Lockyer, Andy",Emerg. med. j,,443

Besides immunological aspects, AhR also plays a role in pharmacological, toxicological and many other physiological processes such as adaptive metabolism. In recent years, epigenetic mechanisms have provided new insight into gene regulation and reveal a new contribution to autoimmune disease pathogenesis. DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin alterations, microRNA and consequently non-genetic changes in phenotypes connect with environmental factors. Increasing data reveals AhR cross-roads with the most significant in immunology pathways. Although study on epigenetic modulations in autoimmune diseases is still not well understood, therefore future research will help us understand their pathophysiology and help to find new therapeutic strategies. Present literature review sheds the light on the common ground between remodeling chromatin compounds and autoimmune antibodies used in diagnostics. In the proposed review we summarize recent findings that describe epigenetic factors which regulate AhR activity and impact diverse immunological responses and pathological changes.","Wajda, Anna; Lapczuk-Romanska, Joanna; Paradowska-Gorycka, Agnieszka",,,443

However, with the lack of on-ground automated prevention measures, depending on humans to enforce face mask-wearing policies in universities and other organizational buildings, is a very costly and time-consuming measure. Without addressing this challenge, mitigating highly airborne transmittable diseases will be impractical, and the time to react will continue to increase. Considering the high personnel traffic in buildings and the effectiveness of countermeasures, that is, detecting and offering unmasked personnel with surgical masks, our aim in this paper is to develop automated detection of unmasked personnel in public spaces in order to respond by providing a surgical mask to them to promptly remedy the situation. Our approach consists of three key components. The first component utilizes a deep learning architecture that integrates deep residual learning (ResNet-50) with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to detect the existence of human subjects in the videos (or video feed). The second component utilizes Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Networks (MT-CNN) to detect and extract human faces from these videos. For the third component, we construct and train a convolutional neural network classifier to detect masked and unmasked human subjects. Our techniques were implemented in a mobile robot, Thor, and evaluated using a dataset of videos collected by the robot from public spaces of an educational institute in the U.S. Our evaluation results show that Thor is very accurate achieving an F_{1} score of 87.7% with a recall of 99.2% in a variety of situations, a reasonable accuracy given the challenging dataset and the problem domain. © 2021 IEEE.","Snyder, S.

240549,A multi-pronged approach targeting SARS-CoV-2 proteins using ultra-large virtual screening,2021,"Juvenile social experience, such as social isolation, has profound effects on communicative behavior, including signal production and reception. In the current study, we explored responsiveness to the neuromodulator serotonin as a potential mechanistic link between early life social isolation and auditory processing. The serotonergic system is sensitive to social isolation in many brain regions including the inferior colliculus (IC), an auditory midbrain nucleus. We investigated the effects of social experience on serotonergic responsiveness by measuring cFos, an immediate early gene product, in the IC of female mice. Serotonin was manipulated pharmacologically by administering fenfluramine, pCPA, or saline to mice that had undergone an extreme dichotomy in social experience after weaning: being housed in social groups versus individually. These mice were exposed to a 60-minute recording of vocalizations from an opposite-sex interaction and perfused. Using immunohistochemistry, we measured the density of cFos-positive (cFos+) nuclei in the major subdivisions of the IC. Housing condition, drug treatment, and IC subregion all had a significant effect on cFos+ density. The central IC showed the highest density of cFos+ cells and also the most pronounced effects of housing condition and drug treatment. In the central IC, cFos+ density was higher following fenfluramine treatment than saline, and lower following pCPA treatment than fenfluramine. Individually housed mice showed a higher cFos+ density than socially housed mice in both of the pharmacological treatment groups, but not in the saline group. Drug treatment but not housing condition had strong effects on the behaviors of grooming, digging, rearing, and movement. Once the effects of drug condition were controlled, there were no across-individual correlations between cFos+ densities and behaviors. These findings suggest that the responses of auditory neurons to neuromodulation by serotonin is influenced by early life experience.","Davis, Sarah E; Sansone, Jack M; Hurley, Laura M",Integr. comp. biol,,443
240550,A Multi-Pronged Approach Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Proteins Using Ultra-Large Virtual Screening,2020,"BACKGROUND: After the COVID-19 outbreak, the Italian Government stopped most regular health care activity. As a result, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) had limited access to outpatient clinics and hospitals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the perception of the COVID-19 emergency among patients with IBD during the early weeks of the lockdown. METHODS: We invited adult patients with IBD from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) by email to answer an ad hoc anonymous survey about COVID-19. We also collected data on demographic and disease characteristics. RESULTS: In total, 167 patients with IBD from Padua and 83 patients from Salerno answered the survey (age: mean 39.7 years, SD 13.9 years; female: n=116, 46.4%). We found that patients with IBD were particularly worried about the COVID-19 pandemic (enough: 77/250, 30.8%; much/very much: 140/250, 56.0%), as they felt more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to their condition (enough: 70/250, 28.0%; much/very much: 109/250, 43.6%). Patients with IBD from the red zone of Veneto were more worried than patients from Campania (P=.001), and men felt more susceptible to the virus than women (P=.05). Additionally, remote medicine was appreciated more by younger patients than older patients (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our survey demonstrate that the lockdown had a significant impact on the psychological aspects of patients with IBD and suggest the need for increasing communication with patients with IBD (eg, through telemedicine) to ensure patients receive adequate health care, correct information, and proper psychological support.","Zingone, Fabiana; Siniscalchi, Monica; Savarino, Edoardo Vincenzo; Barberio, Brigida; Cingolani, Linda; D039,; Incà, Renata; De Filippo, Francesca Romana; Camera, Silvia; Ciacci, Carolina",J Med Internet Res,,443

246463,The extent of molecular variation in novel SARS-CoV-2 after the six-month global spread,2021,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths and a social-economic crisis. A worldwide effort was made to develop efficient vaccines for this disease. A vaccine should produce immune responses with specific and neutralizing antibodies, and without harmful effects such as the antibody-dependent enhancement that may be associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Vaccine design involves the selection of platforms that includes viral, viral-vector, protein, nucleic acid, or trained immunity-based strategies. Its development initiates at a pre-clinical stage, followed by clinical trials when successful. Only if clinical trials show no significant evidence of safety concerns, vaccines can be manufactured, stored, and distributed to immunize the population. So far, regulatory authorities from many countries have approved nine vaccines with phase 3 results. In the current pandemic, a paradigm for the COVID-19 vaccine development has arisen, as many challenges must be overcome. Mass-production and cold-chain storage to immunize large human populations should be feasible and fast, and a combination of different vaccines may boost logistics and immunization. In silico trials is an emerging and innovative field that can be applied to predict and simulate immune, molecular, clinical, and epidemiological outcomes of vaccines to refine, reduce, and partially replace steps in vaccine development. Vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 might emerge, leading to the necessity of updates. A globally fair vaccine distribution system must prevail over vaccine nationalism for the world to return to its pre-pandemic status.","Carneiro, Diego C; Sousa, Jéssica D; Monteiro-Cunha, Joana P",Virus Res,,443

254173,New strategy for COVID-19 vaccination: targeting the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,2020,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes a porcine disease associated with swine epidemic diarrhea. The type I interferon (IFN-I or IFN &#945;/ß) is a key mediator of innate antiviral response during virus infection. Different antagonistic strategies have been identified and determined as to how PEDV infection inhibits the host's IFN responses to escape the host innate immune pathway, but the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV infection are not fully elucidated. Our preliminary results revealed that endogenous TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), the key components in the IFN signaling pathway were downregulated in PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells by iTRAQ analysis. In this study, we screened nsp15 as the most important viral encoded protein involved in TBK1 and IRF3 reduction. Endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity has been well determined for coronavirus nsp15. Three residues (H226, H241, and K282) of PEDV nsp15 were identified as critical amino acids for PEDV EndoU but not D265, which was not well correlated with published results of other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, PEDV nsp15 can directly degrade the RNA levels of TBK1 and IRF3 dependent on its EndoU activity to suppress IFN production and constrain the induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), by which PEDV antagonizes the host innate response to facilitate its replication. Collectively, these results have confirmed that PEDV nsp15 was capable of subverting the IFN response by the RNA degradation of TBK1 and IRF3.","Wu, Yang; Zhang, Hongling; Shi, Zhaorong; Chen, Jianfei; Li, Mingwei; Shi, Hongyan; Shi, Da; Guo, Longjun; Feng, Li",Viruses,,443

Reverse logistics is a waste management strategy whose application to public pharmaceutical care processes faces legal restrictions and incertitude. Nevertheless, reverse logistics of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines may be both a saving and an environmental strategy in developing countries that manage health under limited resources. How to overcome restrictions to reverse logistics mainly in the context of primary health level? This study aims to investigate the most relevant critical factors for implementing medicine waste management in pharmaceutical care process. The unit analysis is the primary health level process in a developing country capital. Considering the characteristics of the issue at hand, it was designed a qualitative study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were key individuals who work directly with the process-from administering medicine to patients to managing waste at the end of the medicine's lifespan or after its use. Results indicated that despite reverse logistics arising from end users is legally forbidden, another type of reverse flow emerged from process analysis. The reverse flow, named reassignment flow, consists of still useful end-of-use medicines exchanged among the 10 government-ran pharmacies and over 140 health centers, where healthcare professionals administer and offer guidance on how to use them correctly. Another result was the identification of the most critical factors in implementing reverse logistics strategies in the public management context. The factors mentioned included aspects pertaining to management, information technology, infrastructure, and government, but they differ from the private context management, in which decision-makers has more freedom. Due to the barriers named by interviewees, the political barriers and complexity of primary health system, results of this investigation point to (i) reinforcing the reassignment flows inside pharmaceutical care logistics cycle, for saving purposes, and (ii) further development of a specific management unit to perform reverse logistics of end-of-use medicines arising from consumers, for environmental purposes. In times of shortage or resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to know the critical factors is a step necessary in overcoming the current restrictions in direction of a well-succeeded medicines reverse logistics, either of reassignment or from final consumers. These results clarify the literature on end-of-use and end-of-life medicines reverse logistics. It also provides managers of 5000 municipalities in the country a perspective on the most relevant critical factors involved in their decision-making process, concerning the reuse of end-of-use medicines or the adequate disposal of end-of-life medicines in the environment.","de Campos, Elaine Aparecida Regiani; Ten Caten, Carla Schwengber; de Paula, Istefani Carísio",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of transbronchial and intravenous application of UVC and laser light irradiation on treatment of patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: The clinical outcome of six patients (age 42-69 years) with severe COVID-19 infection who were directly applied UVC (254 nm) transbronchially, and UVC plus green (630 nm) and red laser (535 nm) lights to the blood circulation in addition to standard pharmacotherapy (UVC group) were prospectively evaluated in comparison to six patients (age 50-69 years) treated only with pharmacotherapy (standard treatment group). Results: The patients in UVC group had shorter stay in intensive care unit (median length of stay 1 vs. 8.5 days;p=0.015), more negative PCR results after treatment (5/6 vs. 0/6 patients;p=0.003), higher discharge rate (5/6 vs. 3/6 patients), and lower mortality (1/6 vs. 3/6 patients), as compared to patients in standard treatment group. Serum D-dimer level, which reached up to 2500 ng/mL (six times of baseline value) seven days after treatment in standard treatment group, was much lower in UVC group (1000 ng/mL). Serum ferritin level was 1.5 to 1.9-fold higher and CRP level was up to 1.7-fold higher in standard treatment group during ten days after treatment as compared to UVC group. No adverse effects have been observed. Conclusions: Combined transbronchial and intravenous UVC and laser irradiation may improve outcome of severe COVID-19 cases.

258640,Hydrophobic Pocket of SARS-Cov-2 Spike Glycoprotein are Potential as Binding Pocket,2021,"CONTEXT: The unprecedented health care scenario caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has revolutionized urology practice worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To review the recommendations by the international and European national urological associations/societies (UASs) on prioritization strategies for both oncological and nononcological procedures released during the current emergency scenario. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Each UAS official website was searched between April 8 and 18, 2020, to retrieve any document, publication, or position paper on prioritization strategies regarding both diagnostic and therapeutic urological procedures, and any recommendations on the use of telemedicine and minimally invasive surgery. We collected detailed information on all urological procedures, stratified by disease, priority (higher vs lower), and patient setting (outpatient vs inpatient). Then, we critically discussed the implications of such recommendations for urology practice in both the forthcoming ""adaptive"" and the future ""chronic"" phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Overall, we analyzed the recommendations from 13 UASs, of which four were international (American Urological Association, Confederation Americana de Urologia, European Association of Urology, and Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand) and nine national (from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, and the UK). In the outpatient setting, the procedures that are likely to impact the future burden of urologists' workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finally, some UASs recommended special precautions to perform minimally invasive surgery, while others outlined the potential role of telemedicine to optimize resources in the current and future scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The expected changes will put significant strain on urological units worldwide regarding the overall workload of urologists, internal logistics, inflow of surgical patients, and waiting lists. In light of these predictions, urologists should strive to leverage this emergency period to reshape their role in the future. PATIENT SUMMARY: Overall, there was a large consensus among different urological associations/societies regarding the prioritization of most urological procedures, including those in the outpatient setting, urological emergencies, and many inpatient surgeries for both oncological and nononcological conditions. On the contrary, some differences were found regarding specific cancer surgeries (ie, radical cystectomy for higher-risk bladder cancer and nephrectomy for larger organ-confined renal masses), potentially due to different prioritization criteria and/or health care contexts. In the future, the outpatient procedures that are likely to impact the burden of urologists' workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.","Amparore, Daniele; Campi, Riccardo; Checcucci, Enrico; Sessa, Francesco; Pecoraro, Angela; Minervini, Andrea; Fiori, Cristian; Ficarra, Vincenzo; Novara, Giacomo; Serni, Sergio; Porpiglia, Francesco",Eur Urol Focus,,443

The aim of this study is to analyze viral dynamics and the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in KTRs with COVID-19 and study their association with clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 at our center were evaluated for clinical presentation and outcome; duration of viral shedding and viral burden by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay cycle threshold; and magnitude of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, KTRs with severe COVID-19 had prolonged viral shedding and a stronger humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. These preliminary data need to be confirmed with further studies and over a longer period of time.","Silvano, José; Ferreira, Filipa; Bustorff, Manuela; Nunes, Ana Teresa; Tavares, Isabel; Sobrinho Simões, Joana; Ramos, Angélica; Cardoso, Maria João; Sampaio, Susana; Pestana, Manuel",Transplant. proc,,443

As one of the main aims of science education is the promotion of students' scientific literacy, one of the issues focused on teaching should be aspects of nature of science (NOS) - which can be introduced from discussions in socioscientific contexts. In this paper, we analyse the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to identify and discuss aspects of NOS involved in the production and communication of knowledge about it. We analyse selected scientific publications and reports from the general media, mainly focused on three broad topics about the production and validation of knowledge: (i) the characterisation of the virus, and (ii) the treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, and (iii) the communication of knowledge produced from the characterisation of scientific literature itself in the pandemic period. The analysis was carried out from a model that presents a broad and complex view of science, as it addresses several areas of knowledge and specific aspects of each of them and proposes the generation of one's view of science from an integration of some of its distinct areas and/or aspects. The results show the current pandemic is a rich socioscientific context whose discussion of social, political, economic, and ethical aspects may support students' learning of nature of science, thus fostering scientific literacy.","Maia, Poliana; Justi, Rosária; Santos, Monique",Sci Educ (Dordr),,443

A Google search yields more than 7000 hits. Indeed, an avalanche of metaphors has already been used to describe the Covid-19 pandemic. From war and oceanic metaphors to the dreaded phrase ?ramping up?, the language and images used by politicians, journalists, scientific experts, commentators, artists, comedians, and meme-makers to understand the crisis are not neutral constructs. But far more disappointing than the use of inappropriate or politically incorrect metaphors is the fact that there is no single scholarly article that systematically studies the influence of the pandemic on cognition, especially metaphorical conceptualization. That is, how has the coronavirus pandemic changed the meaning of home, love, Halloween, social media platforms, and so on for us? Technically speaking, how has the crisis triggered, prompted, or simply facilitated the selection and employment of particular conceptual metaphors or their linguistic and non-linguistic manifestations? This article, based on a large-scale corpus of political cartoons, aims to answer that question ? how the pandemic itself becomes a metaphor. I show that various different metaphor targets (including WAR, ISRAEL, TURKEY, DONALD TRUMP, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ARAB DICTATORS, THE KUWAITI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, THE JORDANIAN CABINET, THE IRANIAN REGIME, MILITANT GROUPS, POVERTY, RACISM, CALENDAR, CORRUPTION, INJUSTICE, RUMORS, POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS, THE GLOBE, THE UNION JACK, THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE US FAR RIGHT, THE 50 STARS OF THE AMERCAN FLAG, US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, HOUSEWIVES, PERSONAL BELONGINGS, LOVE, QURBAN BAYRAM, CHRISTMAS, HALLOWEEN, ARABIC DRAMA, SCHOOL BAG, AWARENESS, and SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES such as Facebook, among many others) are all explained with reference to coronavirus-related terms or the source domain of CORONAVIRUS/VACCINATION. The sheer frequency of occurrences of CORONAVIRUS metaphors (a total of 175 out of 497 relevant multimodal cartoons, that is, more than 35%) demonstrates and makes a case for the necessity to examine the effect of context, in particular topical news and physical circumstances, in the cognitive linguistic study of creative metaphor. In short, the results provide initial evidence that new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19 have a negative and significant effect on cognition (or shape societies? worldviews).","Abdel-Raheem, Ahmed",Discourse &amp; Society,,443

As such, ACL injury prevention has been a focus of research and sports medicine practice for the past three-plus decades. Examining the current research and identifying both clinical strategies and research gaps, the aim of this review is to empower clinicians and researchers with knowledge of where the ACL injury prevention literature is currently and where it is going in the future. This paper examines the mechanism of ACL injury prevention, screening, implementation, compliance, adherence, coronavirus, and areas of future research. Clinical significance: The time lag between research and practical implementation in general healthcare settings can be as long as 17 years; however, athletes playing sports today are unable to wait that long. With effective programs already established, implementation and adherence to these programs is essential. Strategies such as coaching education, increasing awareness of free programs, identifying barriers, and overcoming implementation obstacles through creative collaboration are just a few ways that could help improve both ACL injury prevention implementation and adherence.","Arundale, Amelia J H; Silvers-Granelli, Holly J; Myklebust, Grethe",J. orthop. res,,443

Initially, the elderly were the most affected by the novel coronavirus. However, the virus spread out worldwide, affecting all age groups. The elderly are commonly affected by several chronic diseases, and as a consequence of social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the community-based exercise programs, which usually provide health and well-being to the elderly, have stopped their activities to avoid the virus to spread out; so, the elderly kept taking medicines but stopped exercising, which must impair their health and increase demand from the public health system. In this sense, the physical education professional is essential to providing safe approaches to the elderly who are not able to enroll in community-based exercise programs but need to exercise to improve their health. This article aims to discuss the consequences of not exercising in older adults' health during the social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; still, we intend to present adjunct strategies to allow the elderly to exercise even socially isolated.","Barbosa, Bruno Teixeira; Filho, Edson Meneses da Silva; Santos, Amilton da Cruz; Brasileiro-Santos, Maria do Socorro",Motriz (Online),,443

289317,Human SARS CoV-2 spike protein mutations,2021,"Integrin-ligand interaction mediates the adhesion and migration of many metazoan cells. Here, we report a unique mode of cell migration elicited by the lability of integrin ligands. We found that stationary cells spontaneously turn migratory on substrates where integrin ligands are subject to depletion by cellular force. Using TGT, a rupturable molecular linker, we quantitatively tuned the rate of ligand rupture by cellular force and tested platelets (anucleate cells), CHO-K1 cells (nucleated cells), and other cell types on TGT surfaces. These originally stationary cells readily turn motile on the uniform TGT surface, and their motility is correlated with the ligand depletion rate caused by cells. We named this new migration mode ligand-depleting (LD) migration. Through both experiments and simulations, we revealed the biophysical mechanism of LD migration. We found that the cells create and maintain a gradient of ligand surface density underneath the cell body by constantly rupturing local ligands, and the gradient in turn drives and guides cell migration. This is reminiscent of the phenomenon that some liquid droplets or solid beads can spontaneously move on homogeneous surfaces by chemically forming and maintaining a local gradient of surface energy. Here, we showed that cells, as living systems, can harness a similar mechanism to migrate. LD migration is beneficial for cells to maintain adhesion on ligand-labile surfaces, and might also play a role in the migration of cancer cells, immune cells, and platelets that deplete adhesive ligands of the matrix.","Sarkar, Anwesha; LeVine, Dana N; Kuzmina, Natalia; Zhao, Yuanchang; Wang, Xuefeng",Curr. biol,,443

This study aimed to develop and apply a flexible model to estimate the impact of delayed diagnosis and treatment on survival outcomes and healthcare costs based on a shift in the disease stage at treatment initiation. METHODS: A model was developed and made publicly available to estimate population-level health economic outcomes by extrapolating and weighing stage-specific outcomes by the distribution of stages at treatment initiation. It was applied to estimate the impact of 3- and 6-month delays based on Australian data for stage I breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer patients, and for T1 melanoma. Two approaches were explored to estimate stage shifts following a delay: (a) based on the relation between time to treatment initiation and overall survival (breast, colorectal, and lung cancer), and (b) based on the tumor growth rate (melanoma). RESULTS: Using a conservative once-off 3-month delay and considering only shifts from stage I/T1 to stage II/T2, 88 excess deaths and $12 million excess healthcare costs were predicted in Australia over 5 years for all patients diagnosed in 2020. For a 6-month delay, excess mortality and healthcare costs were 349 deaths and $46 million over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The health and economic impacts of delays in treatment initiation cause an imminent policy concern. More accurate individual patient data on shifts in stage of disease during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are critical for further analyses.","Degeling, Koen; Baxter, Nancy N; Emery, Jon; Jenkins, Mark A; Franchini, Fanny; Gibbs, Peter; Mann, G Bruce; McArthur, Grant; Solomon, Benjamin J; IJzerman, Maarten J",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,,443

There were initial indications that children are often asymptomatic and show a milder clinical course. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain information on the prevalence of SARS-CoV­2 infections in a pediatric cohort. Material and methods: Between 13 March and 18 June 2020 all children from whom a smear for SARS-CoV­2 was taken either to rule out an infection or as a suspected case were included. Data were collected on standardized patient record sheets. The analysis of data was anonymized and retrospective. Results: During the given period 2192 children were investigated and 37 patients tested positive (1.7%) for SARS-CoV­2. Of these 36/37 were suspected cases and 28/37 were symptomatic. The leading symptoms were dry cough, runny nose and fever and three children had to be hospitalized. None showed a difficult course of the disease. Among those tested 505 were patients at risk due to an underlying chronic disease, 3 of whom (0.6%) were tested positive with an asymptomatic or mild course. Conclusion: We can confirm the first data showing that children and adolescents often have an asymptomatic or mild clinical course of infection or disease. We found no evidence of a high grey area of SARS-CoV­2 infections in this regional pediatric cohort.","Meyer, M; Rübsteck, E; Lehmann, C; Klein, F; Gruell, H; Hünseler, C; Weber, L T",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,443

The diversity of clinical characteristics and progress are reported in many countries as the duration of the pandemic is prolonged. We aimed to perform a novel systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on findings about correlations between clinical characteristics and laboratory features of patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: We analyzed cases of COVID-19 in different countries by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science databases and Google Scholar, from the early stage of the outbreak to late March. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatment strategies were retrospectively reviewed for the analysis. (3) Results: Thirty-seven (n = 5196 participants) COVID-19-related studies were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. Fever, cough and fatigue/myalgia were the most common symptoms of COVID-19, followed by some gastrointestinal symptoms which are also reported frequently. Laboratory markers of inflammation and infection including C-reactive protein (CRP) (65% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56-81%)) were elevated, while lymphocyte counts were decreased (63% (95% CI 47-78%)). Meta-analysis of treatment approaches indicated that three modalities of treatment were predominantly used in the majority of patients with a similar prevalence, including antiviral agents (79%), antibiotics (78%), and oxygen therapy (77%). Age was negatively correlated with number of lymphocytes, but positively correlated with dyspnea, number of white blood cells, neutrophils, and D-dimer. Chills had been proved to be positively correlated with chest tightness, lung abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) scans, neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelets count, D-dimer and CRP, cough was positively correlated with sputum production, and pulmonary abnormalities were positively correlated with CRP. White blood cell (WBC) count was also positively correlated with platelet counts, dyspnea, and neutrophil counts with the respective correlations of 0.668, 0.728, and 0.696. (4) Conclusions: This paper is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to reveal the relationship between various variables of clinical characteristics, symptoms and laboratory results with the largest number of papers and patients until now. In elderly patients, laboratory and clinical characteristics indicate a more severe disease course. Moreover, treatments such as antiviral agents, antibiotics, and oxygen therapy which are used in over three quarters of patients are also analyzed.

Wolfgang Wodarg and Micheal Yeadon petitioned to withhold emergency use authorization of the BNT162b2 messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer, raising concern for female infertility risks but acknowledging the lack of evidence. The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration ultimately issued emergency use authorizations, but misinformation claiming that COVID-19 vaccines cause female infertility began circulating on social media, potentially influencing public perception and medical decision making among pregnant patients or those seeking to become pregnant. OBJECTIVES: To determine the potential influence misinformation may have had on public interest in infertility related topics, as analyzed through internet search statistics in the US. METHODS: The Google Trends tool was used to analyze results for the search terms ""infertility,"" ""infertility AND vaccine,"" and ""infertility AND COVID vaccine"" in the US from February 4, 2020 to February 3, 2021. We applied autoregressive integrated moving average models to forecast expected values, comparing them with actual observed values. RESULTS: At peak interest (100), the forecasted relative search volumes interest for the search terms ""infertility,"" ""infertility AND vaccine,"" and ""infertility AND COVID vaccine"" were 45.47 (95% CI, 33.27-57.66; p<0.001), 0.88 (95% CI, 2.87-4.63; p<0.001), and 0.29 (95% CI, -2.25-2.82; p<0.001). The actual relative search volumes at peak searching represented 119.9, 11,251, and 34,900% increases, respectively, when compared with forecasted values. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine misinformation corresponded with increased internet searches for topics related to infertility in the US. Dispelling misinformation and informing patients about the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination may prevent unnecessary vaccine hesitancy or refusal, contributing to successful vaccination efforts.","Sajjadi, Nicholas B; Nowlin, William; Nowlin, Ross; Wenger, David; Beal, John Martin; Vassar, Matt; Hartwell, Micah",J Osteopath Med,,443

Two self-reported internet surveys were used to determine job loss during the pandemic: one was conducted between February and March 2020, just before the COVID-19 emergency declaration by the Japanese government (April 2020), and the other was conducted between August and September 2020. For the dependent variable, we used the EQ-5D-5L utility score (QOL utility score), which was assessed between August and September 2020. The independent variables were job loss after the state of emergency was declared and two types of government financial support (either universal support or support targeting child-raising households). The Tobit regression model was applied, adjusting for covariates. Job loss during the pandemic was negatively associated with the QOL utility score in the fully adjusted model; the coefficient (95% confidence interval [CI]) for job loss during the pandemic was -0.07 (-0.11 to -0.03). For the government financial support variables, the universal financial support program was associated with a better QOL utility score of the coefficient (95% CI), 0.05 (0.03 to 0.08). Job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively associated with HRQOL, while universal financial support is positively associated with HRQOL. Our study results imply that universal financial support during the COVID-19 era has a protective influence on an individual's HRQOL.

This Special Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices, and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups.","Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Furszyfer Del Rio, Dylan; Griffiths, Steve",Energy Res.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Pubmed, and Google Scholar databases using keywords of ""coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),"" ""pleural effusion,"" ""pleural fluid,"" and ""pleura"" from January 1st, 2020 to January 31st, 2021. RESULTS: The incidence of pleural effusions was low at 7.3% among the 47 observational studies. Pleural effusions were commonly observed in critically ill patients and had Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS). COVID-19-related pleural effusions were identified 5-7 days and 11 days, after hospital admission and onset of COVD-19 symptoms. The characteristic findings of pleural fluid were exudative, lymphocytic or neutrophilic-predominant pleural fluid with markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio.

It is paramount for healthcare workers to feel satisfied with their jobs and lives during a pandemic. This study aims to examine the predictors of job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 10 and 30 April 2020, 240 healthcare workers in Bolivia completed a cross-sectional online survey, which assessed their job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The results revealed that their number of office days predicted job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention, but the relationships varied by their age. For example, healthcare workers' office days negatively predicted job satisfaction for the young (e.g., at 25 years old: b = - 0.21; 95% CI: - 0.36 to - 0.60) but positively predicted job satisfaction for the old (e.g., at 65 years old: b = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.44). These findings provide evidence to enable healthcare organizations to identify staff concerned about job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention to enable early actions so that these staffs can remain motivated to fight the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Stephen X; Chen, Jiyao; Afshar Jahanshahi, Asghar; Alvarez-Risco, Aldo; Dai, Huiyang; Li, Jizhen; Patty-Tito, Ross Mary",Int J Ment Health Addict,,443

Methods: Intraocular pressure was raised in rat eyes by injecting 2M hypertonic saline into the limbal veins. SNC-121 (1 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered to the animals for 7 days. Retinas were collected at days 7 and 42, post-injury followed by measurement of HDAC activities, mRNA, and protein expression by enzyme assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Results: The visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) were declined in ocular hypertensive animals, which were significantly improved by SNC-121 treatment. Class I and IIb HDACs activities were significantly increased at days 7 and 42 in ocular hypertensive animals. The mRNA and protein expression of HDAC 1 was increased by 1.33 ± 0.07-fold and 20.2 ± 2.7%, HDAC 2 by 1.4 ± 0.05-fold and 17.0 ± 2.4%, HDAC 3 by 1.4 ± 0.06-fold and 17.4 ± 3.4%, and HDAC 6 by 1.5 ± 0.09-fold and 15.1 ± 3.3% at day 7, post-injury. Both the mRNA and protein expression of HDACs were potentiated further at day 42 in ocular hypertensive animals.

Conclusions: Data suggests that class I and IIb HDACs are activated and upregulated during early stages of glaucoma. Early intervention with Î´-opioid receptor activation resulted in the prolonged suppression of class I and IIb HDACs activities and expression, which may, in part, play a crucial role in RGC neuroprotection.","Zaidi, Syed A H; Guzman, Wendy; Singh, Sudha; Mehrotra, Shikhar; Husain, Shahid",Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,,443
345717,"HAVoC, a bioinformatic pipeline for reference-based consensus assembly and lineage assignment for SARS-CoV-2 sequences",2021,"World Health Organization has suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through person-to-person transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces. However, rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) suggests other routes such as airborne transmission may be involved. A few research studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential transmission of this virus through air. Although some studies have found no evidence of airborne transmission, other more recent work is proving the presence of SARS-CoV-2 even in public places. Also, the past experiences and knowledge about the mechanisms of similar viruses such as SARS-CoV support this hypothesis. It seems that the best decision at the moment is to follow a conservative approach, and accept the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is able to be transmitted through air. By this, control measures could be employed to prevent further COVID-19 infection.","Hadei, Mostafa; Hopke, Philip K.; Jonidi, Ahmad; Shahsavani, Abbas",Aerosol Air Qual. Res.,,443

However, while the disclosure of information about the pandemic constitutes an important aspect of crisis management policies, the effect of the level of information disclosure on political trust has not yet been investigated. As part of a larger nationally representative survey experiment on the role of transparency on political trust, we collected data from 618 respondents in the Republic of Ireland in May 2020. The pre-registered study manipulated the level of the disclosure of government information about the status of the pandemic (high and low information conditions). We do not find any direct effects of information disclosure treatments on political trust. However, we find that the high information condition significantly increases political trust among individuals with higher levels of prior trust in government, while it leads to a backfiring effect among those with lower levels of prior trust. These findings are relevant for both public opinion and public policy researchers who are interested in the effect of openness on citizen attitudes.

This literature review investigates the vital importance of contact and touch by exploring how skin-to-skin contact (SSC) regulates stress in the mother-infant relationship. Various databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were searched for literature published between 2015 and 2020. From 1141 articles, 22 were declared eligible. The reviewed articles showed how SSC regulates child stress by biological indicators such as the autonomic nervous system (ANS), heart rate variability (HRV), cortisol, and oxytocin. This research concludes the importance of SSC for stress regulation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. With no research to date indicating a possible risk of neonatal COVID-19 transmission following SSC, SSC should continue to be practiced for all women, as recommended by the WHO.","Ionio, Chiara; Ciuffo, Giulia; Landoni, Marta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,443

However, little is known about the presentation of patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care, particularly those who used 911 emergency medical services (EMS). Objective: To describe patient characteristics and prehospital presentation of patients with COVID-19 cared for by EMS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 124 patients who required 911 EMS care for COVID-19 in King County, Washington, a large metropolitan region covering 2300 square miles with 2.2 million residents in urban, suburban, and rural areas, between February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Test results were available a median (interquartile range) of 5 (3-9) days after the EMS encounter. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of clinical characteristics, symptoms, examination signs, and EMS impression and care. Results: Of the 775 confirmed COVID-19 cases in King County, EMS responded to 124 (16.0%), with a total of 147 unique 911 encounters. The mean (SD) age was 75.7 (13.2) years, 66 patients (53.2%) were women, 47 patients (37.9%) had 3 or more chronic health conditions, and 57 patients (46.0%) resided in a long-term care facility. Based on EMS evaluation, 43 of 147 encounters (29.3%) had no symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Based on individual examination findings, fever, tachypnea, or hypoxia were only present in a limited portion of cases, as follows: 43 of 84 encounters (51.2%), 42 of 131 (32.1%), and 60 of 112 (53.6%), respectively. Advanced care was typically not required, although in 24 encounters (16.3%), patients received care associated with aerosol-generating procedures. As of June 1, 2020, mortality among the study cohort was 52.4% (65 patients). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest that screening based on conventional COVID-19 symptoms or corresponding examination findings of febrile respiratory illness may not possess the necessary sensitivity for early diagnostic suspicion, at least in the prehospital emergency setting. The findings have potential implications for early identification of COVID-19 and effective strategies to mitigate infectious risk during emergency care.","Yang, Betty Y; Barnard, Leslie M; Emert, Jamie M; Drucker, Christopher; Schwarcz, Leilani; Counts, Catherine R; Murphy, David L; Guan, Sally; Kume, Kosuke; Rodriquez, Karen; Jacinto, Tracie; May, Susanne; Sayre, Michael R; Rea, Thomas",JAMA Netw Open,,443
370286,SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Impairs Endothelial Function via Downregulation of ACE 2,2021,"Phase separation at the molecular scale affects many biological processes. The theoretical requirements for phase separation are fairly minimal, and there is growing evidence that analogous phenomena occur at other scales in biology. Here we examine colony formation in the nematode C. elegans as a possible example of phase separation by a population of organisms. The population density of worms determines whether a colony will form in a thresholded fashion, and a simple two-compartment ordinary differential equation model correctly predicts the threshold. Furthermore, small, round colonies sometimes fuse to form larger, round colonies, and a phenomenon akin to Ostwald ripening - a coarsening process seen in many systems that undergo phase separation - also occurs. These findings support the emerging view that the principles of microscopic phase separation can also apply to collective behaviors of living organisms.","Chen, Yuping; Ferrell, James E",Nat Commun,,443

371629,"1H, 15N and 13C resonance assignments of the N-terminal domain of the nucleocapsid protein from the endemic human coronavirus HKU1",2021,"Accurate modeling of lockdown effects on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic evolution is a key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency management. The compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Exploiting regularization theory, hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around 12% of people in Lombardy and 5% in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number is dangerously increasing in the last weeks due to holiday relax especially in the younger population and increased migrants arrival, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic, including Italy, and all could be subject to a second wave after the summer, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent another SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions to contain the spread.","Pillonetto, Gianluigi; Bisiacco, Mauro; Palu, Giorgio; Cobelli, Claudio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12337v1.pdf,443

Blood collectors have rapidly scaled up collection and distribution programs. METHODS: We developed a detailed simulation model of CCP donor recruitment, collection, production, and distribution processes. We ran our model using varying epidemic trajectories from 11 U.S. states and with key input parameters drawn from wide ranges of plausible values to identify key drivers of ability to scale collections capacity and meet demand for CCP. RESULTS: Utilization of available CCP collections capacity followed increases in COVID-19 hospital discharges with a lag. Utilization never exceeded 75% of available capacity in most simulations. Demand was met for most of the simulation period in most simulations, but a substantial portion of demand went unmet during early, sharp increases in hospitalizations. For epidemic trajectories that included multiple epidemic peaks, second wave demand could generally be met due to stockpiles established during the decline from an earlier peak. Apheresis machine capacity (number of machines) and probability that COVID-19 recovered individuals are willing to donate were the most important supply-side drivers of ability to meet demand. Recruitment capacity was important in states with early peaks. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemic trajectory was the most important determinant of ability to meet demand for CCP, although our simulations revealed several contributing operational drivers of CCP program success.","Russell, W Alton; Grebe, Eduard; Custer, Brian",Transfusion,,443

First year medical students enrolled at UCF College of Medicine gave informed consent to participate in the study in August 2019, prior to the start of their M1 year. Four biomedical sciences courses occurred during the timeframe of the study. Classes 1 and 2, plus the first half of Class 3, were delivered as conventional face-to-face classes. In March 2020, all lessons were moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which included the second half of Class 3 and all of Class 4. For the face-to-face encounters, attendance was recorded using the Bluetooth enabled smartphone app, SpotterEDU and the percent of total days attended during each course was correlated with the corresponding multiple-choice final examination score for each participant. To assess the impact of losing the opportunity to attend during Classes 3 and 4, a group of primarily ?attenders? was identified as those students who attended ≥ 50% of the nonmandatory sessions in Class 3, prior to the suspension of regular classes. ANOVA was used to assess whether exam scores differed between Classes 1-4 for this group. Eighty-two students participated in the study. The average face-to-face attendance rates before COVID19 were as follows;Class 1: 69% days, Class 2: 41% days, Class 3: 28% days attended. A linear regression analysis for final exam score versus percent of days attended demonstrated no significant association between attendance and performance (Class 1: R2=0.06, Class 2: R2= 0.00, Class 3:R2= 0.01;N=82). During the 3rd course, 22 of the 82 participants attended ≥ 50% of nonmandatory sessions. For 21 completed exam records, no significant difference in performance was observed post-COVID-19 (F=3.1, p=0.06).

The absence of significant correlation between face-to-face attendance and examinations scores, and the lack of impact on performance when classes were moved online, argues that classroom attendance is not an important mediator of success on knowledge-based multiple-choice examinations.","Williamson, Macy Salzman Joshua Epsina-Rey Andrea Kibble Jonathan Kauffman Christine",The FASEB Journal,,443

Adequately cleaning surfaces in patient rooms is an essential part of this fight to reduce the spread. Traditional audits, however, are insufficient. This study assesses surface cleaning practices using ultravoilet (UV) marker technology and the extent to which this technology can help improve cleaning audits and practices. METHODS: One hundred and forty-four audits (1,235 surfaces) were retrieved. UV-marker cleaning audits conducted at a major teaching hospital in 2018 after implementing a new cleaning protocol. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with cleaning staff and supervisors. RESULTS: On average, 63% of surfaces were appropriately cleaned. Toilet handles (80%) and toilet seats underside (83%) scored highest while main room sink fixtures (54%), light switch (55%), and bedrails (56%) scored lowest. Training, staffing and time constraints may play a role in low cleaning rates. DISCUSSION: The high-touch patient surfaces in the bedroom remain neglected and a potential source of infections. UV marker audits provided an objective measure of cleaning practices that managers and staff were unaware of. CONCLUSIONS: UV-markers audits can play a key role in revealing deficiencies in cleaning practices and help in raising awareness of these deficiencies and improving cleaning practices.","Meyer, Julien; Nippak, Pria; Cumming, Aisling",Am. j. infect. control,,443

Concerning the novelty of the disease, the diagnostic methods based on radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use machine-learning models to analyze radiology images. Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020 Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning, Diagnosis and Detection leading to the extraction of 168 articles that ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: This review study provides an overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19 through radiology modalities and their processing based on deep learning. According to the finding, Deep learning Based models have an extraordinary capacity to achieve an accurate and efficient system for the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19, which using of them in the processing of CT-Scan and X-Ray images, would lead to a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity values. Conclusion: The Application of Deep Learning (DL) in the field of Covid-19 radiologic image processing leads to the reduction of false-positive and negative errors in the detection and diagnosis of this disease and provides an optimal opportunity to provide fast, cheap, and safe diagnostic services to patients.","Ghaderzadeh, Mustafa; Asadi, Farkhondeh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11577v1.pdf,443
384138,Coagulapathies after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may be derived from a combination effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and adenovirus vector-triggered signaling pathways,2021-08-31,"During the new pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is short knowledge regarding the management of different disease areas, such as coagulopathy and interpretation of D-dimer levels, its association with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and controversy about the benefit of anticoagulation. Thus, a systematic review has been performed to define the role of D-dimer in the disease, the prevalence of DIC and the usefulness of anticoagulant treatment in these patients. A literature search was performed to analyze the studies of COVID-19 patients. Four recommendations were drawn based on expert opinion and scientific knowledge, according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The present review suggests the presence of higher levels of D-dimer in those with worse prognosis, there may be an overdiagnosis of DIC in the course of the disease and there is no evidence on the benefit of starting anticoagulant treatment based only on isolated laboratory data.","Moreno, G; Carbonell, R; Bodí, M; Rodríguez, A","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,443

388844,An effective approach to reduce the penetration potential of Sars-Cov-2 and other viruses by spike protein: Through surface particle electrostatic charge negotiation,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of variants with specific mutations in key epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 raises concerns pertinent to mass vaccination campaigns and use of monoclonal antibodies. We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9, 2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198 (58%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42%) had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97 [95% CI 0·72-1·31]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex, age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 1·02 [0·76-1·38]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold value (mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8]; p=0·0085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=0·0011). INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, and we found increased virus load by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data. We did not identify an association of the variant with severe disease in this hospitalised cohort.

Users choose pick and place points on the cloth and can preview a visualization of a simulated cloth before real-robot execution. Two interfaces are proposed: A 2D display-and-mouse interface where points are placed by clicking on an image of the cloth, and a 3D Augmented Reality interface where the chosen points are placed by hand gestures. We conduct a user study with 18 participants, in which each user completed two sequential folds to achieve a cloth goal shape. Results show that while both interfaces were acceptable, the 3D interface was found to be more suitable for understanding the task, and the 2D interface suitable for repetition. Results also found that fold previews improve three key metrics: task efficiency, the ability to predict the final shape of the cloth and overall user satisfaction.","Waymouth, Benjamin; Cosgun, Akansel; Newbury, Rhys; Tran, Tin; Chan, Wesley P.; Drummond, Tom; Croft, Elizabeth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02968v2.pdf,443
397980,Regulatory Cross Talk Between SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding and Replication Machinery in the Human Host,2020,"AIM: The threats of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused fears worldwide. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was recently developed to assess the fear of COVID-19. Although many studies found that the FCV-19S is psychometrically sound, it is unclear whether the FCV-19S is invariant across countries. The present study aimed to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV-19S across eleven countries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Using data collected from prior research on Bangladesh (N = 8,550), United Kingdom (N = 344), Brazil (N = 1,843), Taiwan (N = 539), Italy (N = 249), New Zealand (N = 317), Iran (N = 717), Cuba (N = 772), Pakistan (N = 937), Japan (N = 1,079) and France (N = 316), comprising a total 15,663 participants, the present study used the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch differential item functioning (DIF) to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV-19S across country, gender and age (children aged below 18 years, young to middle-aged adults aged between 18 and 60 years, and older people aged above 60 years). RESULTS: The unidimensional structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed. Multigroup CFA showed that FCV-19S was partially invariant across country and fully invariant across gender and age. DIF findings were consistent with the findings from multigroup CFA. Many DIF items were displayed for country, few DIF items were displayed for age, and no DIF items were displayed for gender. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, the FCV-19S is a good psychometric instrument to assess fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic period. Moreover, the use of FCV-19S is supported in at least ten countries with satisfactory psychometric properties.","Lin, Chung-Ying; Hou, Wen-Li; Mamun, Mohammed A; Aparecido da Silva, José; Broche-Pérez, Yunier; Ullah, Irfan; Masuyama, Akihiro; Wakashima, Koubun; Mailliez, Mélody; Carre, Arnaud; Chen, Yu-Pin; Chang, Kun-Chia; Kuo, Yi-Jie; Soraci, Paolo; Scarf, Damian; Broström, Anders; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H",Nurs Open,,443

We use a non-Markovian age-of-infection model that is capable of handling long and variable time delays without changing its model topology. Bayesian estimation of model parameters is carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This framework allows us to treat all available input information, including both the previously published parameters of the epidemic and available local data, in a uniform manner. To accurately model deaths as well as demand on the healthcare system, we calibrate our predictions to total and in-hospital deaths as well as hospital and ICU bed occupancy by COVID-19 patients. We apply this model not only to the state as a whole but also its sub-regions in order to account for the wide disparities in population size and density. Without prior information on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the model independently reproduces a mitigation trend closely matching mobility data reported by Google and Unacast. Forward predictions of the model provide robust estimates of the peak position and severity and also enable forecasting the regional-dependent results of releasing Stay-at-Home orders. The resulting highly constrained narrative of the epidemic is able to provide estimates of its unseen progression and inform scenarios for sustainable monitoring and control of the epidemic.","Wong, George N.; Weiner, Zachary J.; Tkachenko, Alexei V.; Elbanna, Ahmed; Maslov, Sergei; Goldenfeld, Nigel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02036v3.pdf,443

Multi-strain sequence alignments of coronaviruses (CoV) provide important information for interpreting the genome and its variation. We apply a comparative genomics method, ConsHMM, to the multi-strain alignments of CoV to annotate every base of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with conservation states based on sequence alignment patterns among CoV. The learned conservation states show distinct enrichment patterns for genes, protein domains, and other regions of interest. Certain states are strongly enriched or depleted of SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which can be used to predict potentially consequential mutations. We expect the conservation states to be a resource for interpreting the SARS-CoV-2 genome and mutations.","Kwon, Soo Bin; Ernst, Jason",Commun Biol,,443

Disinfection and hygiene are two integral parts of any safe indoor environment, and these factors become more critical in COVID-19-like pandemic situations. Door handles are highly sensitive contact points that are prone to be contamination. Automation of the door-handle cleaning task is not only important for ensuring safety, but also to improve efficiency. This work proposes an AI-enabled framework for automating cleaning tasks through a Human Support Robot (HSR). The overall cleaning process involves mobile base motion, door-handle detection, and control of the HSR manipulator for the completion of the cleaning tasks. The detection part exploits a deep-learning technique to classify the image space, and provides a set of coordinates for the robot. The cooperative control between the spraying and wiping is developed in the Robotic Operating System. The control module uses the information obtained from the detection module to generate a task/operational space for the robot, along with evaluating the desired position to actuate the manipulators. The complete strategy is validated through numerical simulations, and experiments on a Toyota HSR platform.","Ramalingam, Balakrishnan; Yin, Jia; Rajesh Elara, Mohan; Tamilselvam, Yokhesh Krishnasamy; Mohan Rayguru, Madan; Muthugala, M A Viraj J; Félix Gómez, Braulio",,,443

Studies have found that severe cases of COVID-19 may be associated with coagulopathies, however the potential association with AIHA is not clear. CASE REPORT: A patient with no known risk factors or underlying predisposition for developing AIHA presented to a hospital with vague symptoms and profound anemia with a complicated blood bank evaluation. She was found to have COVID-19 and AIHA, for which extensive laboratory testing was performed, including direct antiglobulin tests, elution studies, and cold agglutinin titers, to identify the causative autoantibody. She required multiple blood transfusions and therapeutic interventions prior to clinical stabilization. DISCUSSION: AIHA is a complex disease with a spectrum of presentations and clinical severity. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing AIHA, however there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID-19 and AIHA. Most of the reports involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of AIHA. The presentation, clinical findings, and therapeutic interventions in a patient with severe AIHA, without other underlying conditions, in the setting of COVID-19 are discussed. CONCLUSION: There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and AIHA, and the association is not clear. Although COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with coagulopathies, more research is required to determine whether AIHA may also be a potential complication.

When Chief Seattle said that the Earth does not belong to us, we belong to the Earth, he called for more humility and respect so as to plan for the needs of today and tomorrow, and not for the greed of a few. The doomsday scenarios of overpopulation only make sense if we continue to exploit our planet the way we do today, as if we have an infinite reservoir of resources. Already back in the 1960s, Barbara Ward, John F. C. Turner, and particularly Kenneth Boulding taught me to rethink our whole perception of Spaceship Earth. I have seen many towns and cities grow as if resources were limitless;I myself have seen and worked on efforts to focus on spatial quality, respecting nature whenever possible for a growing number of people, recognizing resources as being precious and scarce, and yet guaranteeing equitable access to a good quality of urban life. Such objectives are not evident, when models in education, schools of thought, professional planners, and greedy developers are often geared towards the contrary: the higher the skyscrapers, the better;the more egotripping by architects, the more the rich like it;the more people are stimulated to consume, the better the world will be. Such narrow visions will no longer help. At several global urban planning and developments events (1976, 1992, 1996, 2016, etc.), new ideas and agendas have been put forward. Whether the present Covid-19 crisis may induce a more rapid change in vision and practice is still too early to confirm, but luckily, several towns and cities, and a few visionary planners and decision makers are showing some promising examples.","Verschure, H.",Urban Planning,,443

Activating mutations in YY1 lead to tumorigenesis of pancreatic ß-cells, however, the physiological functions of YY1 in ß-cells are still unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of YY1 ablation on insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. METHODS: We established two models of ß-cell-specific YY1 knockout mice. The glucose metabolic phenotypes, ß-cell mass and ß-cell functions were analyzed in the mouse models. Transmission electron microscopy was used to detect the ultrastructure of ß-cells. The flow cytometry analysis, measurement of OCR and ROS were performed to investigate the mitochondrial function. Histological analysis, quantitative PCR and ChIP were performed to analyze the target genes of YY1 in ß-cells. RESULTS: Our results showed that loss of YY1 resulted in reduction of insulin production, ß-cell mass and glucose tolerance in mice. Ablation of YY1 led to defective ATP production and mitochondrial ROS accumulation in pancreatic ß-cells.

413984,Persistence and decay of human antibody responses to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute augmentation of stress and disruption of training, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact resident wellbeing. OBJECTIVES: We investigated how residents in various specialties in the United States were impacted by COVID-19 on mental wellbeing and resilience levels, and the methodology for coping with the stress incurred. METHODS: In April 2020, the authors electronically surveyed 200 residency programs of all specialties nationally. The survey utilized two validated questionnaires to assess wellbeing and resilience, while investigating demographics and coping mechanisms. The authors used student t-test and ANOVA to quantitatively analyze the data. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 1115 respondents (with an 18% response rate). Male gender & Age >39 years were associated with more favorable average well-being indices (both p<0.01). Regarding resources, institutional support (IS) appeared favorable for resident well-being (IS 2.74, SD1.96 vs NoIS 3.71, SD2.29, p<0.01) & resilience (IS 3.72, SD0.70 vs NoIS 3.53, SD0.73, p = 0.05). The effects of mindfulness practices (MP) were not statistically significant for improvement of wellness (MP 2.87, SD 1.99 vs No MP 2.76, SD 2.15, p = 0.85) or resilience (MP 3.71, SD 0.70 vs No MP 3.72, SD 0.68, p = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the critical importance of resident mental status in cases of augmented stress situations. Institutional support may contribute to promotion of resident wellbeing.","Zoorob, Dani; Shah, Shivam; La Saevig, Danielle; Murphy, Courtney; Aouthmany, Shaza; Brickman, Kris",PLoS One,,443

415547,Computational optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-motif affinity for human ACE2,2021,"Viruses are the causing agents for many relevant diseases, including influenza, Ebola, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19. Its rapid replication and high transmissibility can lead to serious consequences not only to the individual but also to collective health, causing deep economic impacts. In this scenario, diagnosis tools are of significant importance, allowing the rapid, precise, and low-cost testing of a substantial number of individuals. Currently, PCR-based techniques are the gold standard for the diagnosis of viral diseases. Although these allow the diagnosis of different illnesses with high precision, they still present significant drawbacks. Their main disadvantages include long periods for obtaining results and the need for specialized professionals and equipment, requiring the tests to be performed in research centers. In this scenario, biosensors have been presented as promising alternatives for the rapid, precise, low-cost, and on-site diagnosis of viral diseases. This critical review article describes the advancements achieved in the last five years regarding electrochemical biosensors for the diagnosis of viral infections. First, genosensors and aptasensors for the detection of virus and the diagnosis of viral diseases are presented in detail regarding probe immobilization approaches, detection methods (label-free and sandwich), and amplification strategies. Following, immunosensors are highlighted, including many different construction strategies such as label-free, sandwich, competitive, and lateral-flow assays. Then, biosensors for the detection of viral-diseases-related biomarkers are presented and discussed, as well as point of care systems and their advantages when compared to traditional techniques. Last, the difficulties of commercializing electrochemical devices are critically discussed in conjunction with future trends such as lab-on-a-chip and flexible sensors.","Brazaca, Laís Canniatti; Dos Santos, Pãmyla Layene; de Oliveira, Paulo Roberto; Rocha, Diego Pessoa; Stefano, Jéssica Santos; Kalinke, Cristiane; Abarza Muñoz, Rodrigo Alejandro; Bonacin, Juliano Alves; Janegitz, Bruno Campos; Carrilho, Emanuel",Anal Chim Acta,,443

As our paper is titled""The genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 does not rule out a laboratory origin"", points of disagreement should provide evidence that rules out a laboratory origin. However, Tyshkovskiy and Panchin provide no such evidence and instead attempt to criticize our arguments that highlight aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that could be consistent with the lab leak hypothesis. Strikingly, Tyshkovskiy and Panchin's main point of criticism is based on a false premise that we have claimed RaTG13 to be a direct progenitor of SARS-CoV-2, and their other points of criticism are either incorrect or irrelevant to our hypotheses. Thus, the genetic structure of SARS-CoV-2 remains consistent with both natural or laboratory origin, which means that both the zoonotic and the lab leak hypothesis need to be investigated equally thoroughly.","Deigin, Yuri; Segreto, Rossana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02020v2.pdf,443

On the one hand, pathogenic microorganisms in both form viral and bacterial infections that cause diseases and death in humans and animals. Industrial pollutions caused by civilization activities via the entry of harmful organic substances into the environment through industrial wastewaters, insecticides, agricultural pesticides, etc. Titania nanoparticles can enhance the elimination of organic pollutants from the environment and industrial wastewater. These compounds can generate free radicals and produce electrons via photocatalytic reactions resulted in a significant effect in killing harmful microorganisms like pathogenic bacteria and deadly viruses. Several methods are utilized to modify titania's optical characteristics, including its photocatalytic activities like deposition on the surface of compounds like graphene, doping of various metal species like copper and silver on titania, the coupling of titania with semiconductor oxides etc. The application of these improved nanoparticles helped eliminate water pollutions, clean water production by solar evaporation, and remove contamination from agricultural effluents. Surprisingly, they can be used in the annihilation process of viruses like SARS, influenza and coronavirus family, and pathogenic bacteria's deterioration. This paper has reviewed some methods of modifying titania's photocatalytic properties and its utilization to combat harmful microorganisms and organic contaminants in the environment. © 2021","Soleimani, M.; Ghasemi, J.

As pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aims at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution. Objective To understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, non-pregnant and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Methods We administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents were contacted in one of three ways: by email, advertisement flyers and distribution of QR codes at virtual townhalls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on their responses, respondents were divided into three mutually exclusive groups: (1) non-pregnant respondents (2) pregnant respondents and (3) breastfeeding respondents. The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination. Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability. Results The survey was administered from January 7, 2021 to January 29, 2021 with 1,012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as Non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as Non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2) as Non-Hispanic Asian. The median age was 36 (IQR 25-47) years. Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were non-pregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding. There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1). 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare. Non-pregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%, p&lt;0.001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%). Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%, p&lt;0.001). Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents and Spanish speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination(Table 3). Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort. Conclusions and Relevance In this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-asian races were more likely to decline vaccination compared to non-pregnant and breast-feeding respondents. Working in healthcare was not associated with vaccine acceptance.","Sutton, Desmond D039; Alton, Mary Zhang Yijia Kahe Ka Cepin Ana Goffman Dena Staniczenko Anna Yates Hope Burgansky Anna Coletta Jaclyn Williams Zev Gyamfi-Bannerman Cynthia",American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology MFM,,443

Most of these forecasts are based on epidemiology models that utilize deterministic differential equations and have resulted in widely varying predictions. We propose a new discrete-Time Markov chain model that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which parameter estimation is straightforward from available data. Using such data from China's Hubei province (for which Wuhan is the provincial capital city and which accounted for approximately 82% of the total reported COVID-19 cases in the entire country), the model is shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate. As a result, it has been adopted by the first Shanghai assistance medical team in Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which was the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients in the world. The forecast has been used for preparing medical staff, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical resources and for supporting real-Time medical management decisions.","Chen, Jian; Fu, Michael C.; Zhang, Wenhong; Zheng, Junhua",Asia Pac J Oper Res,,443

Humans have a suite of adaptations to satisfy belonging needs while avoiding diseased conspecifics. Competition between motivational systems may explain adherence and resistance to social distancing guidelines and how technologically mediated interactions further shape these decisions. This study is a preregistered analysis of data in a representative sample collected during the pandemic investigating how individual differences in affiliative and pathogen-avoidant motives predict interest in physical interactions (N = 2409). Germ aversion predicted disinterest in physical interactions and need to belong predicted interest. Additional analyses revealed technology use satisfied belonging motives that unexpectedly heightened interest in physical contact. Exploratory analyses further indicate that internet speed was similarly associated with greater interest in physical interactions. We frame these results through a competing fundamental social motives framework and discuss how to address future pandemics effectively.","Brown, Mitch Young Steven G.; Sacco, Donald F.",Computers in Human Behavior,,443

Closing this gap could facilitate messaging to promote COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors. METHODS: In July 2020, a five-question text message survey was sent to 1,087 youth aged 14-24 years. Questions assessed youths' perceptions regarding the likelihood of contracting COVID-19, the potential impact of contracting COVID-19 on their lives, the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to others, and their use of face coverings around others with whom they do not live. Coding was conducted to assign responses to discrete categories and to identify common themes. RESULTS: Of 1,087 eligible participants, 797 (73.3%) were included in analyses. Of these participants, 27.3% believed they would likely contract COVID-19 in the next few months, 90.3% believed contracting COVID-19 would have a moderate or significant impact on their lives, 86.0% were moderately or very concerned about spreading COVID-19, and 89.2% reported wearing face coverings all or most of the time. Factors affecting face covering use included the desire to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, peer influence, and policy mandates. CONCLUSIONS: Youths' perceptions regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 varied, but most believed their lives would be adversely impacted if this occurred. Most youth were concerned about spreading COVID-19 and wore face coverings, but many made exceptions to face covering use when around close contacts. Public health campaigns may be most effective if they leverage positive peer influence and appeal to youths' desire not to spread COVID-19 to others.","DeJonckheere, Melissa; Waselewski, Marika; Amaro, Xochitl; Frank, Abby; Chua, Kao-Ping",J Adolesc Health,,443
432047,Convalescent plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain and receptor-binding domain IgG correlate with virus neutralization,2020,"BACKGROUND: On 7 February 2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps. We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. METHODS: We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.","Danis, Kostas; Epaulard, Olivier; Bénet, Thomas; Gaymard, Alexandre; Campoy, Séphora; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Spaccaferri, Guillaume; Ader, Florence; Mailles, Alexandra; Boudalaa, Zoubida; Tolsma, Violaine; Berra, Julien; Vaux, Sophie; Forestier, Emmanuel; Landelle, Caroline; Fougere, Erica; Thabuis, Alexandra; Berthelot, Philippe; Veil, Raphael; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Chidiac, Christian; Lina, Bruno; Coignard, Bruno; Saura, Christine",Clin Infect Dis,,443

437537,Analysis of Emerging Variants in Structured Regions of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome,2021,"Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing public health emergency. Patients with chronic diseases are at greater risk for complications and poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to investigate the liver function abnormalities and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and chronic hepatitis C. Materials and Methods: This retrospective, single-center study was conducted on a cohort of 126 patients with a history of hepatitis C, confirmed with COVID-19 between 01 April 2020 and 30 December 2020. Several clinical outcomes were compared between patients with active and non-active HCV infection, and the risks of liver impairment and all-cause mortality in active HCV patients were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: Among 1057 patients under follow-up for chronic HCV infection, 126 (11.9%) were confirmed with COVID-19; of these, 95 (75.4%) were under treatment or achieved SVR, while in the other 31 (24.6%), we found active HCV replication. There was a significantly higher proportion of severe COVID-19 cases in the active HCV group as compared to the non-active HCV group (32.2 vs. 7.3%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and HCV viral load were significant independent risk factors for liver impairment and all-cause mortality. The length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit for COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients with active HCV infection (p-value < 0.001), and a higher proportion of these patients required mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Active HCV infection is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Cerbu, Bianca; Pantea, Stelian; Bratosin, Felix; Vidican, Iulia; Turaiche, Mirela; Frent, Stefan; Borsi, Ema; Marincu, Iosif",Medicina (Kaunas),,443
438790,Structural basis for the different states of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with ACE2,2021,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is largely the result of a dysregulated host response, followed by damage to alveolar cells and lung fibrosis. Exacerbated proinflammatory cytokines release (cytokine storm) and loss of T lymphocytes (leukopenia) characterize the most aggressive presentation. We propose that a multifaceted anti-inflammatory strategy based on pharmacological activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2) can be deployed against the virus. The strategy provides robust cytoprotection by restoring redox and protein homeostasis, promoting resolution of inflammation, and facilitating repair. NRF2 activators such as sulforaphane and bardoxolone methyl are already in clinical trials. The safety and efficacy information of these modulators in humans, together with their well-documented cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical models, highlight the potential of this armamentarium for deployment to the battlefield against COVID-19.","Cuadrado, Antonio; Pajares, Marta; Benito, Cristina; Jiménez-Villegas, José; Escoll, Maribel; Fernández-Ginés, Raquel; Garcia Yagüe, Angel J; Lastra, Diego; Manda, Gina; Rojo, Ana I; Dinkova-Kostova, Albena T",Trends Pharmacol Sci,,443

446075,In Silico Study of Mutational Stability of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins,2021,"On the global health agenda, Universal Health Coverage has been displaced by the COVID-19 pandemic while disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have exposed stark gaps in quality, access, equity, and financial risk protection. These disparities highlight the importance of the core goals of Universal Health Coverage and the need for innovative approaches to working toward them. The newly codified concept of ""Networks of Care"" offers a promising option for implementation. The articles in this special issue present the Networks of Care lexicon and framework and demonstrate the development of leadership, responsibility, intra- and inter-facility cooperation, and dynamic cycles of quality improvement. These elements are associated with better access to services and better health outcomes, the ultimate goals of Universal Health Coverage. Increases in poverty, food insecurity, and deleterious impact on the status of women secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic add urgency to Universal Health Coverage, while the economic impact of pandemic mitigation may reduce availability of resources for years to come. The need for Universal Health Coverage and efficiency and flexibility in health spending, including the ability to contract directly, has become even more important. Countries where Universal Health Coverage efforts have yet to carry through to provision of good quality, accessible and equitable service delivery could potentially benefit from concurrent Networks of Care implementation. Documentation of Networks of Care in the context of Universal Health Coverage should be prioritized to understand how Networks of Care can be used to help realize the goals of Universal Health Coverage around the world.","Brady, Eoghan; Carmone, Andy E; Das, Sarthak; Hurley, Raphael; Martinez Vergara, Maria Theresa; Malata, Address",Health Syst Reform,,443

462333,Essential Dynamics that Drive Sars-Cov-2 Spike Conformational Changes,2021,"Purpose: To present a method that automatically detects and quantifies abnormal tomographic patterns commonly present in COVID-19, namely Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) and consolidations. Given that high opacity abnormalities (i.e., consolidations) were shown to correlate with severe disease, the paper introduces two combined severity measures (Percentage of Opacity, Percentage of High Opacity) and (Lung Severity Score, Lung High Opacity Score). They quantify the extent of overall COVID-19 abnormalities and the presence of high opacity abnormalities, global and lobe-wise, respectively, being computed based on 3D segmentations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Materials and Methods: The proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted Chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in 3D. It outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung/lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure (POO, POHO) is global, while the second (LSS, LHOS) is lobe-wise. Evaluation is reported on CTs of 100 subjects (50 COVID-19 confirmed and 50 controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and US. Ground truth is established by manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Results: Pearson Correlation Coefficient between method prediction and ground truth is 0.97 (POO), 0.98 (POHO), 0.96 (LSS), 0.96 (LHOS).

METHODS: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was designed. Thirty-four women with FM were randomized into two groups: TP group and Control group. The intervention lasted 15 weeks, with 2 sessions per week. The TP based on aerobic exercise was guided by video and the intensity of each session was monitored using the Borg scale. Pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), mechanical pain sensitivity (algometer), number of tender points, FM impact (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), pain catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), physiological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), upper (Arm Curl Test) and lower-limb physical function (6-min Walk Test) were measured at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: The TP group improved pain intensity (p = 0.022), mechanical pain sensitivity (p < 0.05), and psychological distress (p = 0.005), compared to the Control group. The Control group showed no statistically significant changes in any variable (p > 0.05).

DesignNationwide, population-based cohort study. Setting: Norway from 1 March 2020 to 31 April 2021. Participants: All Norwegian residents <18 years of age. Main outcome measuresPopulation-based health care and population registries were used to study risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including socioeconomic factors, country of origin, and pre-existing chronic comorbidities. All residents were followed until age 18, emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Hazard ratios (HR) estimated by Cox regression models were adjusted for testing frequency. Further, risk factors for admission to the hospital among the infected were investigated. ResultsOf 1 182 796 residents, 22608 (1.9%) tested positive by polymerase chain reaction or lateral flow tests, of whom 107 (0.5%) were admitted to a hospital. Low family income (aHR 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.46), crowded housing (1.35, 1.30 to 1.39), household size, age, and area of living were independent risk factors for infection. A non-Nordic country of origin was the strongest risk factor (aHR 2.37, 95% CI 2.30 to 2.49), whereas chronic comorbidity was not associated with the risk of infection. Chronic comorbidity was associated with hospitalisation (aHR 4.15, 2.63 to 6.56), in addition to age, whereas socioeconomic status and country of origin did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. ConclusionsSocioeconomic factors, country of origin, and area of living were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these factors did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. Chronic comorbidity was associated with the risk of admission but not with the overall risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2. What is already known on this topicHospital admissions rates for covid-19 among children and adolescents are low compared to adults. Admission rates to hospitals and intensive care units for covid-19 have been higher in minority groups and in children and adolescents with chronic comorbidity. Whether underlying differences in susceptibility for severe disease or the incidence of infections are driving these associations have not been investigated. What this study addsLow family income, crowded housing and household size, and country of origin outside the Nordic countries were associated with increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. None of these factors, but chronic comorbidities, were associated with the risk of hospital admission among those infected.","Stordal, Ketil; Ruiz, Paz Lopez-Doriga; Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe; Suren, Pal; Knudsen, Per Kristian; Gulseth, Hanne Lovdal; Tapia, German",,,443

As of March 31, 2020, there are now nearly 800,000 cases, with truly global involvement.2 Countries that were previously unaffected are currently experiencing mounting rates of the novel coronavirus infection with associated increases in COVID-19-related deaths. At present, Canada has more than 8000 cases of COVID-19, with considerable variation in rates of infection among provinces and territories.3 Amid concerns over growing resource constraints, cardiac surgeons from across Canada have been forced to make drastic changes to their clinical practices. From prioritizing and delaying elective cases to altering therapeutic strategies in high-risk patients, cardiac surgeons, along with their heart teams, are having to reconsider how best to manage their patients. It is with this in mind that the Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgeons (CSCS) and its Board of Directors have come together to formulate a series of guiding statements.

Methods: The peer-reviewed literature published between 1 January and 30 April 2020 on COVID-19 in PubMed was searched. Estimates of the incubation period, serial interval and reproduction number for COVID-19 were obtained and compared. Results: A total of 86 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 33 estimated the mean incubation period (4-7 days) and 15 included estimates of the serial interval (mean 4-8 days;median length 4-5 days). Fifty-two studies estimated the reproduction number. Although reproduction number estimates ranged from 0.3 to 14.8, in 33 studies (63%), they fell between 2 and 3. Discussion: Studies calculating the incubation period and effective reproduction number were published from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of the study period (30 April 2020);however, most of the studies calculating the serial interval were published in April 2020. The calculated incubation period was similar over the study period and in different settings, whereas estimates of the serial interval and effective reproduction number were setting-specific. Estimates of the serial interval were shorter at the end of the study period as increasing evidence of pre-symptomatic transmission was documented and as jurisdictions enacted outbreak control measures. Estimates of the effective reproduction number varied with the setting and the underlying model assumptions. Early analysis of epidemic parameters provides vital information to inform the outbreak response.","Allen, K.; Parry, A. E.; Glass, K.",Western Pacific Surveillance and Response,,443

In particular, 5G networks need to support three typical usage scenarios, namely, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). On the one hand, UAVs can be leveraged as cost-effective aerial platforms to provide ground users with enhanced communication services by exploiting their high cruising altitude and controllable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space. On the other hand, providing such communication services simultaneously for both UAV and ground users poses new challenges due to the need for ubiquitous 3D signal coverage as well as the strong air-ground network interference. Besides the requirement of high-performance wireless communications, the ability to support effective and efficient sensing as well as network intelligence is also essential for 5G-and-beyond 3D heterogeneous wireless networks with coexisting aerial and ground users. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest research efforts on integrating UAVs into cellular networks, with an emphasis on how to exploit advanced techniques (e.g., intelligent reflecting surface, short packet transmission, energy harvesting, joint communication and radar sensing, and edge intelligence) to meet the diversified service requirements of next-generation wireless systems.

South Africa is the epicenter of the pandemic in Africa, and has issued an alcohol and cigarette ban. Historical examples suggest that responses to forced abstinence may include compliance and abstinence, but also seeking alternatives to the original addiction and substitution. Substitution of alternative activities/objects may provide similar appetitive effects to fill the void of the terminated addictive behavior, temporarily or in the long-term. While substitutes do not necessarily portend a relapse, coupled with isolation and reduced recovery support, they can potentiate relapse to the former or 'new' addictive behavior.

We tested the independent association of COVID-19 with AKI. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, observational, cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to 1 of 6 hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System between March 10, 2020, and August 31, 2020, with results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing via polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal sample. EXPOSURE: Positive test for SARS-CoV-2. OUTCOME: AKI by KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Evaluated the association of COVID-19 with AKI after controlling for time-invariant factors at admission (eg, demographic characteristics, comorbidities) and time-varying factors updated continuously during hospitalization (eg, vital signs, medications, laboratory results, respiratory failure) using time-updated Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Of the 22,122 patients hospitalized, 2,600 tested positive and 19,522 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had more AKI (30.6% vs 18.2%; absolute risk difference, 12.5% [95% CI, 10.6%-14.3%]) and dialysis-requiring AKI (8.5% vs 3.6%) and lower rates of recovery from AKI (58% vs 69.8%). Compared with patients without COVID-19, patients with COVID-19 had higher inflammatory marker levels (C-reactive protein, ferritin) and greater use of vasopressors and diuretic agents. Compared with patients without COVID-19, patients with COVID-19 had a higher rate of AKI in univariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.73-1.95]). In a fully adjusted model controlling for demographic variables, comorbidities, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results, COVID-19 remained associated with a high rate of AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.29-1.53]). LIMITATIONS: Possibility of residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of AKI not fully explained by adjustment for known risk factors. This suggests the presence of mechanisms of AKI not accounted for in this analysis, which may include a direct effect of COVID-19 on the kidney or other unmeasured mediators. Future studies should evaluate the possible unique pathways by which COVID-19 may cause AKI.","Moledina, Dennis G; Simonov, Michael; Yamamoto, Yu; Alausa, Jameel; Arora, Tanima; Biswas, Aditya; Cantley, Lloyd G; Ghazi, Lama; Greenberg, Jason H; Hinchcliff, Monique; Huang, Chenxi; Mansour, Sherry G; Martin, Melissa; Peixoto, Aldo; Schulz, Wade; Subair, Labeebah; Testani, Jeffrey M; Ugwuowo, Ugochukwu; Young, Patrick; Wilson, F Perry",Am. j. kidney dis,,443

Epidemiological surveillance of emerging agents, such as the recently recognized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, is essential to establish the risk of transmission between species. Recent studies reveal that companion animals are organisms susceptible to being infected by this pathogen due to the close contact they have with their owners. For this reason, the aim of the present work was to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs and cats in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, where there is active transmission of this microorganism in human populations. Oral and nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from dogs and cats with a history of exposure to patients with COVID-19. Total RNA was extracted and detection of viral genes N1 and N2 was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). All 130 samples of companion animals tested by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 were negative at the time they were collected. This study represents the second active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in populations of domestic dogs and cats in Latin America and the first approach in Mexico. Given that coronaviruses have shown a high capacity to be transmitted between species, it is imperative to establish measures to prevent this agent from entering and establishing in populations of companion animals.","Sánchez-Montes, Sokani; Ballados-González, Gerardo G; Gamboa-Prieto, Janete; Cruz-Romero, Anabel; Romero-Salas, Dora; Pérez-Brígido, Carlos D; Austria-Ruíz, María J; Guerrero-Reyes, Alfredo; Lammoglia-Villagómez, Miguel A; Camacho-Peralta, Ireri P; Morales-Narcia, José Á; Bravo-Ramos, José L; Barrientos-Villeda, Manuel; Blanco-Velasco, Leopoldo A; Becker, Ingeborg",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Limited social interaction with their peers may lead to loneliness and an increased risk of mental health among adolescents. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Internet addiction (IA) among adolescents and analyze the influence of psychosocial factors toward the heightened risk of IA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An online survey comprising sociodemographic questionnaire, Internet Addiction Diagnostic Questionnaire (KDAI), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was distributed. Overall, a total of 2,932 adolescents (mean age, 17.38 ± 2.24 years old;female, 78.7%), originating from 33 of 34 provinces in Indonesia, completed the survey. Results: The point prevalence of IA among Indonesian adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak was 19.3%. Increased Internet use duration, internalization, externalization, low prosocial behavior, and sleep disturbances were found as risk factors of IA, either directly or as mediating variables. Physical distancing, large-scale social restriction (PSBB), and health status were not correlated to IA. Discussion: Physical distancing was not established as a risk of IA. This could be due to other psychological factors such as internalization, externalization, prosocial, and sleep problems that had correlations to IA occurrence among adolescents in the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep impairment might have resulted from the emotional and behavioral issues and directly contributed to IA development. Conclusion: The present study found the prevalence of IA among Indonesian adolescents to be higher than the adult during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several psychological measures were indicated to increase the risk of IA, while physical distancing did not elevate the risk. Thus, remote schooling is preferable in Indonesia along with proper parental supervision to minimize Internet use for entertainment purposes.","Siste, K.; Hanafi, E.; Sen, L. T.; Murtani, B.

591063,Effect of RBD mutation (Y453F) in spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 on neutralizing antibody affinity,2020-11-28,"BACKGROUND: School-aged children have the highest incidence of respiratory virus infections each year, and transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus can be a major concern in school settings. School absenteeism data have been employed as a component of influenza surveillance systems in some locations. Data timeliness and system acceptance remain as key determinants affecting the usefulness of a prospective surveillance system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic school absenteeism surveillance system using smart card–based technology for influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance among a representative network of local primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. METHODS: We designed and implemented a surveillance system according to the Protocol for a Standardized information infrastructure for Pandemic and Emerging infectious disease Response (PROSPER). We employed an existing smart card–based education and school administration platform for data capture, customized the user interface, and used additional back end systems built for other downstream surveillance steps. We invited local schools to participate and collected absenteeism data by the implemented system. We compared temporal trend of the absenteeism data with data from existing community sentinel and laboratory surveillance data. RESULTS: We designed and implemented an ILI surveillance system utilizing smart card–based attendance tracking approach for data capture. We implemented the surveillance system in a total of 107 schools (including 66 primary schools and 41 secondary schools), covering a total of 75,052 children. The system successfully captured information on absences for 2 consecutive academic years (2012-2013 and 2013-2014). The absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community, with an upsurge in disease activity detected up to 1 to 2 weeks preceding other existing surveillance systems. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and implemented a novel smart card technology–based school absenteeism surveillance system. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of building a large-scale surveillance system riding on a routinely adopted data collection approach and the use of simple system enhancement to minimize workload implication and enhance system acceptability. Data from this system have potential value in supplementing existing sentinel influenza surveillance for situational awareness of influenza activity in the community.","Ip, Dennis KM; Lau, Eric HY; So, Hau Chi; Xiao, Jingyi; Lam, Chi Kin; Fang, Vicky J; Tam, Yat Hung; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.6810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986338/,443

PROs are self-reports of patients’ health status without interpretation by anyone else. The tools developed to assess PROs are known as patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs). The technological innovations that have led to an increased ownership of electronic devices have also facilitated the development of electronic PROMs (ePROMs). ePROMs are a conduit for telemedicine in the care of patients with chronic diseases. Various studies have demonstrated that the use of ePROMs in routine clinical practice is both acceptable and feasible with patients increasingly expressing a preference for an electronic mode of administration. There is increasing evidence that the use of electronic patient-reported outcome (ePROMs) could have significant impacts on outcomes valued by patients, healthcare providers and researchers. Whilst the development and implementation of these systems may be initially costly and resource-intensive, patient preferences and existing evidence to support their implementation suggests the need for continued research prioritisation in this area. This narrative review summarises and discusses evidence of the impact of ePROMs on clinical parameters and outcomes relevant to chronic diseases.

ILV is underused in clinical practice, mostly due to the technically demanding placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube (ETT). Moreover, the determination of ventilation parameters for each lung in vivo is limited. In recent years, the development of 3D printing techniques enabled the production of highly accurate physical models of anatomical structures used for in vitro research, considering the high risk of in vivo studies. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of double-lumen ETT on the gas transport and mixing in the anatomically accurate 3D-printed model of the bronchial tree, with lung lobes of different compliances, using various ventilation modes. The bronchial tree was obtained from Respiratory Drug Delivery (RDD Online, Richmond, VA, USA), processed and printed by a dual extruder FFF 3D printer. The test system was also composed of left side double-lumen endotracheal tube, Siemens Test Lung 190 and anesthetic breathing bag (as lobes). Pressure and flow measurements were taken at the outlets of the secondary bronchus. The measured resistance increased six times in the presence of double-lumen ETT. Differences between the flow distribution to the less and more compliant lobe were more significant for the airways with double-lumen ETT. The ability to predict the actual flow distribution in model airways is necessary to conduct effective ILV in clinical conditions.","Kramek-Romanowska, Katarzyna; Stecka, Anna M.; Zieliński, Krzysztof; Dorosz, Agata; Okrzeja, Piotr; Michnikowski, Marcin; Odziomek, Marcin",Materials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576415/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14185189,443

In lncRNA target prediction, there were 166,623 colocalized targets and 2,976,362 correlated targets. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that binding represented the main molecular functions of both the cis- and trans-modes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested that the insulin signaling pathway, Rap1 signaling pathway, tight junctions, MAPK signaling pathway, and cell cycle were enriched for these relative genes. The expression of lncRNAs was verified using qRT-PCR. This study provides a lncRNA catalog for future research concerning the mechanism of the transdifferentiation of cBMSCs into IPCs.","Wang, Jinglu; Dai, Pengxiu; Gao, Dengke; Zhang, Xia; Ruan, Chenmei; Li, Jiakai; Chen, Yijing; Zhang, Luwen; Zhang, Yihua",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21155549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756402/,443

Reported rates of influenza have been higher among UK than among domestic pilgrims, but this could be explained by methodological differences among studies. Accordingly, the present study compared the frequencies of respiratory viruses among UK and Saudi pilgrims using the same study design. Pilgrims with upper respiratory tract symptoms were recruited from Mecca and the neighbouring valley Mina during the Hajj 2006. Nasal swabs were used for point-of-care influenza testing and real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) tests for influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Of 260 pilgrims investigated, 150 were from the UK and 110 were Saudi; of these, 38 (25%) UK pilgrims and 14 (13%) Saudi pilgrims had respiratory infections detectable by rtRT-PCR (p 0.01). In the UK group, there were 19 (13%) cases of rhinovirus infection, 15 (10%) cases of influenza virus infection, two (1%) cases of dual infections with influenza virus and rhinovirus, one (3%) case of parainfluenza virus infection, and one (1%) case of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Fifty-six (37%) UK pilgrims had been vaccinated against influenza virus, with the rates of influenza in the vaccinated and unvaccinated group being 7% and 14%, respectively (p 0.19). In the Saudi group, there were three (3%) cases of rhinovirus infection and 11 (10%) cases of influenza. Only four (4%) Saudi pilgrims had been vaccinated against influenza virus, and none of these was infected with influenza virus. Overall, a significantly higher proportion of the UK pilgrims had detectable respiratory infections (25% vs. 13%, p 0.01). Influenza rates were similar in both groups, but the reported rates of influenza vaccination differed.","Rashid, H.; Shafi, S.; Haworth, E.; El Bashir, H.; Memish, Z.A.; Sudhanva, M.; Smith, M.; Auburn, H.; Booy, R.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14619534; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.01987.x; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14619534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18373688/,443

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease produced by the coronavirus family. The World Health Organization declared the disease a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Podiatrists are in a peculiar situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: that of a health professional aspect and the singularity that most of them practise as self-employed workers. The aim of the study is to evaluate in a group of podiatrists, working at a national level, their knowledge, perception and degree of anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic via the use of a questionnaire specifically developed to this end in the initial phase of the pandemic. We employed a transversal descriptive study with 302 participants, with a purposive sampling technique. The degree of perception and knowledge of the podiatrists about COVID-19 was analysed as well as the cognitive impact of the situation of confinement. The results showed that the podiatrists perceive this situation as serious at the economic and health level, that they have a thorough knowledge of the disease and that they are in a moderate to severe percentile of anxiety. Additionally, 76.2% cancelled their usual work. The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively perceived by this group of podiatrists at the personal, professional, health and economic level, with even a state of anxiety being produced.","Vilar-Palomo, Samuel; Pabón-Carrasco, Manuel; Gonzalez-Elena, María Luisa; Ramírez-Baena, Lucia; Rodríguez-Gallego, Isabel; Castro-Méndez, Aurora",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33114550/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040432,443

Here, we investigate through mathematical modelling the safety profile of HCQ, CQ and other QT-prolonging anti-infective agents to determine their risk categories for Torsade de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmia. We performed safety modelling with uncertainty quantification using a risk classifier based on the qNet torsade metric score, a measure of the net charge carried by major currents during the action potential under inhibition of multiple ion channels by a compound. Modelling results for HCQ at a maximum free therapeutic plasma concentration (free C(max)) of approximately 1.2 µM (malaria dosing) indicated it is most likely to be in the high-intermediate-risk category for TdP, whereas CQ at a free C(max) of approximately 0.7 µM was predicted to most likely lie in the intermediate-risk category. Combining HCQ with the antibacterial moxifloxacin or the anti-malarial halofantrine (HAL) increased the degree of human ventricular action potential duration prolongation at some or all concentrations investigated, and was predicted to increase risk compared to HCQ alone. The combination of HCQ/HAL was predicted to be the riskiest for the free C(max) values investigated, whereas azithromycin administered individually was predicted to pose the lowest risk. Our simulation approach highlights that the torsadogenic potentials of HCQ, CQ and other QT-prolonging anti-infectives used in COVID-19 prevention and treatment increase with concentration and in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs.","Whittaker, Dominic G.; Capel, Rebecca A.; Hendrix, Maurice; Chan, Xin Hui S.; Herring, Neil; White, Nicholas J.; Mirams, Gary R.; Burton, Rebecca-Ann B.",Royal Society open science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996135/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210235,443

Knowledge of antibody seropositivity and its duration may help dictate post-pandemic planning. METHODS: Using assays to detect antibodies to either nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins performed on specimens from 39,086 individuals with confirmed positive COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to January 2021, we analyzed nationwide seropositivity rates of IgG up to 300 days following patients’ initial positive NAAT test. Linear regression identified trends in seropositivity rates and logistic regression tested positive predictability by age, sex, assay type and days post-infection. FINDINGS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies to both SARS-CoV-2 S and N-proteins followed a linear trend reaching approximately 90% positivity at 21 days post-index. The rate of N-protein seropositivity declined at a sharper rate, decaying to 68·2% [95% CI: 63·1–70·8%] after 293 days, while S-antibody seropositivity maintained a rate of 87·8% [95% CI: 86·3–89·1%] through 300 days. In addition to antigen type and the number of days post-positive PCR, age and gender were also significant factors in seropositivity prediction, with those under 65 years of age showing a more sustained seropositivity rate. INTERPRETATION: Observational data from a national clinical laboratory, though limited by an epidemiological view of the U.S. population, offer an encouraging timeline for the development and sustainability of antibodies up to ten months from natural infection and could inform post-pandemic planning.","Alfego, David; Sullivan, Adam; Poirier, Brian; Williams, Jonathan; Adcock, Dorothy; Letovsky, Stanley",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100902; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537021001826; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021001826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056568/,443

However, the evidence to support such transport infrastructure modifications is unclear. Previous studies on public transport use and elderly health were mostly observational studies using cross-sectional data. Few studies have examined the before-and-after effects of a new metro, for example, to see if it leads to improved elderly health. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use a new metro line in Hong Kong as a natural experiment to examine the impact of the metro-led public transport intervention on elderly health. In Hong Kong, more than 90% of daily travels are made by public transport. The public transport modifications consist of the new metro line with eight stations and changes in the walking environment and bus services around the stations. We will look at the before-and-after differences in public transport use and health outcomes between elderly participants living in treatment neighbourhoods (400 m walking buffered areas of the new metro stations) and in control groups (living in comparable areas but unaffected by the new metro). Questionnaire-based baseline data were collected in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, while some qualitative interviews are ongoing. Amid the pandemic, we conducted a quick telephone-based survey of COVID-19’s potential impact on public transport use behaviours of our elderly cohort in September 2020. Note there is no lockdown in Hong Kong until the writing of the paper (January 2021). After the new metro opens, we will conduct a follow-up survey, tentatively in late 2022. We aim to investigate if the new metro and the associated changes in the built environment have any effects on public transport use behaviours, physical activity and wider health outcomes among the elderly (eg, social inclusion, quality of life, subjective well-being). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Hong Kong reviewed and approved the study procedures and materials (reference number: EA1710040).

For diagnostic and for didactic purposes, standardized and reliable tests suitable to assess the competencies involved in “working hygienically” are required. However, existing tests usually use self-report questionnaires, which are suboptimal for this purpose. In the present study, we introduce the newly developed, competence-oriented HygiKo test instrument focusing health-care professionals’ hygiene competence and report empirical evidence regarding its psychometric properties. METHODS: HygiKo is a Situational Judgement Test (SJT) to assess hygiene competence. The HygiKo-test consists of twenty pictures (items), each item presents only one unambiguous hygiene lapse. For each item, test respondents are asked (1) whether they recognize a problem in the picture with respect to hygiene guidelines and, (2) if yes, to describe the problem in a short verbal response. Our sample comprised n = 149 health care professionals (79.1 % female; age: M = 26.7 years, SD = 7.3 years) working as clinicians or nurses. The written responses were rated by two independent raters with high agreement (α > 0.80), indicating high reliability of the measurement. We used Item Response Theory (IRT) for further data analysis. RESULTS: We report IRT analyses that show that the HygiKo-test is suitable to assess hygiene competence and that it allows to distinguish between persons demonstrating different levels of ability for seventeen of the twenty items), especially for the range of low to medium person abilities. Hence, the HygiKo-SJT is suitable to get a reliable and competence-oriented measure for hygiene-competence. CONCLUSIONS: In its present form, the HygiKo-test can be used to assess the hygiene competence of medical students, medical doctors, nurses and trainee nurses in cross-sectional measurements. In order to broaden the difficulty spectrum of the current test, additional test items with higher difficulty should be developed. The Situational Judgement Test designed to assess hygiene competence can be helpful in testing and teaching the ability of working hygienically. Further research for validity is needed.","Heininger, Susanne Katharina; Baumgartner, Maria; Zehner, Fabian; Burgkart, Rainer; Söllner, Nina; Berberat, Pascal O.; Gartmeier, Martin",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02829-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330263/,443

METHODS An online sub-study was conducted (5/21/2020-6/9/2020) among Black men who have sex with women, >18 years old, and who had previously enrolled in the parent study Check It (5/17/2017-3/16/2020) to assess changes in sexual behavior during the stay-at-home orders. RESULTS Among 111 participants, from enrollment in Check It to during stay-at-home orders, recent vaginal sex declined from 96.4% to 47.8% (p<0.0001), reports of multiple female sex partners declined from 45.0% to 14.4% (p<0.0001), and sexual abstinence increased from 3.6% to 38.7% (p<0.0001). Among those who did have vaginal sex, condomless sex rates did not change between enrollment in Check it and the sub-study (64.5% vs. 67.9%, p=0.68). During stay-at-home orders oral sex, virtual sex, and pornography viewing were 40.5%, 42.3%, and 76.6%, respectively. Some (17.1%) acquired a new sex partner during stay-at-home orders and 44.1% left their home to meet a partner for sex. Only 27.9% had seen information about safe sex during the pandemic. Income was diminished for 62.2% and 23.4% moved away from New Orleans when stay-at-home orders were enacted. CONCLUSION While there was an overall reduction in physical sex, half of participants reported physical sex, with many leaving their home to have sex during stay-at-home orders and many not using condoms. Others adopted sexual abstinence, increased virtual sex, and/or pornography viewing which may have protected them from both STIs and COVID-19.

611376,An all-solid-state heterojunction oxide transistor for the rapid detection of biomolecules and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein,2021-01-19,"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis, the public keeps getting epidemic-related information on the media. News reports on the increasing number of fatalities have exposed individuals to death, which causes negative emotional experiences such as tension, anxiety, and fear. This study aimed to investigate whether creativity could serve as an anxiety-buffer when mortality is salient. Based on previous findings, the present study utilized type of creative task and personal search for meaning as moderators. In Study 1, a 2 (mortality salience: absent, present) × 2 (type of creative task: benevolent, malevolent) between-subject design was utilized, and 168 subjects were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. In Study 2, 221 subjects were recruited. The experimental procedure was similar to Study 1, except that the priming paradigm of mortality was changed and search for meaning was included as an additional moderating variable. State anxiety was measured as the dependent variable in both studies. Results of Study 1 showed that, while the benevolent creative task could buffer anxiety in the mortality salience condition, the malevolent creative task did not have the same effect. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between mortality salience, type of creative task, and search for meaning in life on anxiety. In Study 2, the buffering function of benevolent creativity was more intense for participants with a higher level of search for meaning. Together, these findings reveal the influence of different types of creative tasks on individual anxiety levels under death priming conditions and the moderating effect of search for meaning in this relationship. Further, they suggest the need to focus on the role of creativity in terror management.","Cui, Yu-Xin; Zhou, Xiang; Zu, Chong; Zhai, Hong-Kun; Bai, Bo-Ren; Xu, Yu-Mei; Li, Duo",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447248/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.601027,443

To discuss how to best protect people with diabetes from serious outcomes from COVID-19, Diabetes Technology Society, in collaboration with Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, hosted the “International COVID-19 and Diabetes Virtual Summit” on August 26-27, 2020. This unique, unprecedented real-time conference brought together physicians, scientists, government officials, regulatory experts, industry representatives, and people with diabetes from six continents to review and analyze relationships between COVID-19 and diabetes. Over 800 attendees logged in. The summit consisted of five sessions: (I) Keynotes, (II) Preparedness, (III) Response, (IV) Recovery, and (V) Surveillance; eight parts: (A) Background, (B) Resilience, (C) Outpatient Care, (D) Inpatient Care, (E) Resources, (F) High-Risk Groups, (G) Regulation, and (H) The Future; and 24 sections: (1) Historic Pandemics and Impact on Society, (2) Pathophysiology/Risk Factors for COVID-19, (3) Social Determinants of COVID-19, (4) Preparing for the Future, (5) Medications and Vaccines, (6) Psychology of Patients and Caregivers, (7) Outpatient Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Non-Pharmacologic Intervention, (8) Technology and Telehealth for Diabetes Outpatients, (9) Technology for Inpatients, (10) Management of Diabetes Inpatients with COVID-19, (11) Ethics, (12) Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests, (13) Children, (14) Pregnancy, (15) Economics of Care for COVID-19, (16) Role of Industry, (17) Protection of Healthcare Workers, (18) People with Diabetes, (19) International Responses to COVID-19, (20) Government Policy, (21) Regulation of Tests and Treatments, (22) Digital Health Technology, (23) Big Data Statistics, and 24) Patient Surveillance and Privacy. The two keynote speeches were entitled (1) COVID-19 and Diabetes—Meeting the Challenge and (2) Knowledge Gaps and Research Opportunities for Diabetes and COVID-19. While there was an emphasis on diabetes and its interactions with COVID-19, the panelists also discussed the COVID-19 pandemic in general.

611934,A Systemic and Molecular Study of Subcellular Localization of SARS-CoV-2 Proteins,2020-08-02,"PURPOSE: To provide evidence-based recommendations for patients with severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), who had their knee surgery postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed/Medline, Scopus and Cochrane Central databases were systematically reviewed for studies reporting outcomes of home-based treatments for knee OA. Due to between-study differences in treatment strategy and reporting methods the results were not pooled and findings of the current review were presented in a narrative manner. RESULTS: The comprehensive literature search yielded 33 eligible studies that were included in this review. Management is performed at home and consists of exercise, proper nutrition, physical therapy and use of corrective and assistive orthotics. Virtual education on self-management strategies should be part of coping with knee OA. Initiating an exercise programme involving gymnastics, stretching, home cycling and muscle strengthening is highly recommended. Obese patients are encouraged to set weight loss goals and adopt a healthy diet. Potential benefits but weak evidence has been shown for the use of knee braces, sleeves, foot orthotics or cushioned footwear. Walking aids may be prescribed, when considered necessary, along with the provision of instructions for their use. CONCLUSION: When bridging the time to rescheduled surgery, it is essential to use appropriate home-based tools for the management of knee OA if pain is to be reduced and need for analgesics or opioid use is to be diminished while maintaining or even improving the functioning and avoiding further limitation of range of motion and subsequent muscular atrophies. Finally, none of these treatments may completely substitute for the life-changing effect of a total knee arthroplasty in patients with severe knee OA. Hence, the subsequent goal is to gradually and safely reinstate elective surgery.","Karasavvidis, Theofilos; Hirschmann, Michael T.; Kort, Nanne P.; Terzidis, Ioannis; Totlis, Trifon",J Exp Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686011/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-020-00271-5,443

613311,The SARS-CoV-2 Spike variant D614G favors an open conformational state,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Fulminant (life-threatening) COVID-19 can be associated with acute respiratory failure (ARF), multi-system organ failure and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We present a rare case of fulminant COVID-19 associated with reverse-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy (RTCC) that improved with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old previous healthy male presented in the emergency room with 4 days of dry cough, chest pain, myalgias and fatigue. He progressed to ARF requiring high-flow-nasal-cannula (flow: 60 L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%). Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed COVID-19 and chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. Biochemistry suggested CRS: increased C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and interleukin-6. Renal function was normal but lactate levels were elevated. Electrocardiogram demonstrated non-specific changes and troponin-I levels were slightly elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) basal and midventricular akinesia with apex sparing (LV ejection fraction: 30%) and depressed cardiac output (2.8 L/min) consistent with a rare variant of stress-related cardiomyopathy: RTCC. His ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen was < 120. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, plus antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), and prophylactic anticoagulation. Infusion of milrinone failed to improve his cardiogenic shock (day-1). Thus, rescue TPE was performed using the Spectra Optia™ Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA) without protective antibodies. Over 5 days he received daily TPE (each lasting 4 hours). His lactate levels, oxygenation, and LV function normalized and he was weaned off vasopressors. His inflammation markers improved, and he was extubated on day-7. RT-PCR was negative on day-17. He was discharged to home isolation in good condition. CONCLUSION: Stress-cardiomyopathy may complicate the course of fulminant COVID-19 with associated CRS. If inotropic therapy fails, TPE without protective antibodies may help rescue the critically ill patient.","Faqihi, Fahad; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Alshaya, Rayan; Papanikolaou, John; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios J.; Brindley, Peter G.; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01665-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842957/,443

The current study systematically examines the emerging evidence to identify an association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and COVID-19 disease outcome. Methods: Online literature databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Medrixv and BioRixv) were screened following standard search strategy having the appropriate keyword such as Obesity, Underweight, BMI, Body Mass Index, 2019-nCov, COVID-19, novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease. Studies published till 20th April 2020 were included without language restriction. These studies include case reports, case series, cohort, and any other which reported BMI, overweight/obesity or underweight, and its complication with COVID-19 disease. Findings: Obesity plays a significant part in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients, though the role of BMI in the COVID-19 pandemic must not be ignored. Interpretation: Consequences of inflammation of adipose tissue has been reported as a leading cause of insulin resistance and hypertension due to metabolic dysfunction. The results of the current study show that BMI plays a significant role in COVID-19 severity in all ages, especially the elderly population. A panel should review COVID-19 patients with higher BMI and other co-morbidities, and they should be given increased vigilance, testing priority, and therapy. Further, the COVID-19 patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age >50 yrs, and elevated CRP levels should have additional medical considerations. Recommendation: Population and patients with high BMI have moderate to high risk of medical complications with COVID-19, and hence their health status should be monitored more frequently.

To identify biomarkers for SR, we systematically analyzed the molecular alterations in both sorafenib-resistant HCC specimens and cultured cells. By combining bioinformatics tools and experimental validation, four genes (C2orf27A, insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor, complement factor B, and paraoxonase 1) were identified as key genes related to SR in HCC and as independent prognostic factors significantly associated with clinical cancer stages and pathological tumor grades of liver cancer. These genes can affect the cytotoxicity of sorafenib to regulate the proliferation and invasion of Huh7 cells in vitro. Additionally, immune-cell infiltration according to tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, a biomarker integrating the mechanisms of dysfunction and exclusion of T cells showed good predictive power for SR, with an AUC of 0.869. These findings suggest that immunotherapy may be a potential strategy for treating sorafenib-resistant HCC. Furthermore, the results enhance the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of SR in HCC and will facilitate the development of precision therapy for patients with liver cancer.","Yuan, Wei; Tao, Ran; Huang, Da; Yan, Weiming; Shen, Guanxin; Ning, Qin",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495404/,443

In this paper, we use the autoregressive conditional Fréchet model (AcF) to construct a tail risk measurement index for the capital market in China. The tail risk status identified by the scientific index method is used as a monitoring anchor to construct and optimize a tail risk early warning model based on machine learning algorithms. The study yields three findings. (1) The AcF model can overcome the shortcomings of traditional models in tail risk measurement and significantly improve the tail risk measurement efficiency of the capital market. (2) Tail risk synergies between equity and bond markets are significantly stronger than yield synergies, and the tail risk measure index has the role of a leading indicator of significant risk in capital markets. (3) Based on the joint test of risk status and crisis identification efficiency, the Logit model of crisis identification fails whereas the tail risk warning model optimized by machine learning algorithms can accurately identify crises and significant risks. The optimal early warning model pairings for the stock market and bond market are the oversampling-random forest algorithm and the double sampling-random forest algorithm, respectively, with out-of-sample crisis warning accuracies of 81.94% and 90.20%, respectively.","Zhang, Zongxin; Chen, Ying",Comput Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-021-10171-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334954/,443

Metrics, site-level survey results, and examples of interventions conducted to support telemedicine in T1D are shown. Materials and Methods: Thirteen clinics (11 pediatric, 2 adult) provided monthly telemedicine metrics between December 2019 and August 2020 and 21 clinics completed a survey about their telemedicine practices. Results: The proportion of telemedicine visits in T1DX-QI before the pandemic was <1%, rising to an average of 95.2% in April 2020 (range 52.3%–99.5%). Three sites initially used mostly telephone visits before converting to video visits. By August 2020, the proportion of telemedicine visits decreased to an average of 45% across T1DX-QI (range 10%–86.6%). The majority of clinics (62%) performed both video and telephone visits; Zoom was the most popular video platform used. Over 95% of clinics reported using CareLink™, Clarity(®), Glooko™, and/or t:connect(®) to view device data, with only one center reporting automated data upload into the electronic medical record. The majority of centers had multidisciplinary teams participating in the video visits. All sites reported reimbursement for video visits, and 95% of sites reported coverage for telephone visits early on in the pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 116 patients that for suspected COVID-19 infection were subjected to the reverse transcription real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. A computer-aided tool was used to calculate on chest CT images healthy residual lung parenchyma, emphysema, GGO and consolidation volumes for both right and left lung. Expert radiologists, in consensus, assessed the CT images using a structured report and attributed a radiological severity score at the disease pulmonary involvement using a scale of five levels. Nonparametric test was performed to assess differences statistically significant among groups. RESULTS: GGO was the most represented feature in suspected CT by COVID-19 infection; it is present in 102/109 (93.6%) patients with a volume percentage value of 19.50% and a median value of 0.64 L, while the emphysema and consolidation volumes were low (0.01 L and 0.03 L, respectively). Among quantified volume, only GGO volume had a difference statistically significant between the group of patients with suspected versus non-suspected CT for COVID-19 (p < < 0.01). There were differences statistically significant among the groups based on radiological severity score in terms of healthy residual parenchyma volume, of GGO volume and of consolidations volume (p < < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that, using a computer-aided tool, the COVID-19 pneumonia was mirrored with a percentage median value of GGO of 19.50% and that only GGO volume had a difference significant between the patients with suspected or non-suspected CT for COVID-19 infection.","Grassi, Roberto; Belfiore, Maria Paola; Montanelli, Alessandro; Patelli, Gianluigi; Urraro, Fabrizio; Giacobbe, Giuliana; Fusco, Roberta; Granata, Vincenza; Petrillo, Antonella; Sacco, Palmino; Mazzei, Maria Antonietta; Feragalli, Beatrice; Reginelli, Alfonso; Cappabianca, Salvatore",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01305-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206301/,443
618235,Structural basis for the different states of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with ACE2,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND: The case fatality ratio (CFR), the ratio of deaths from an infectious disease to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence. Calculation of the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases during the course of an epidemic tends to result in a biased CFR. The present study develops a simple method to obtain an unbiased estimate of confirmed CFR (cCFR), using only the confirmed cases as the denominator, at an early stage of epidemic, even when there have been only a few deaths. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our method adjusts the biased cCFR by a factor of underestimation which is informed by the time from symptom onset to death. We first examine the approach by analyzing an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong (2003) with known unbiased cCFR estimate, and then investigate published epidemiological datasets of novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the USA and Canada (2009). Because observation of a few deaths alone does not permit estimating the distribution of the time from onset to death, the uncertainty is addressed by means of sensitivity analysis. The maximum likelihood estimate of the unbiased cCFR for influenza may lie in the range of 0.16–4.48% within the assumed parameter space for a factor of underestimation. The estimates for influenza suggest that the virulence is comparable to the early estimate in Mexico. Even when there have been no deaths, our model permits estimating a conservative upper bound of the cCFR. CONCLUSIONS: Although one has to keep in mind that the cCFR for an entire population is vulnerable to its variations among sub-populations and underdiagnosis, our method is useful for assessing virulence at the early stage of an epidemic and for informing policy makers and the public.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Klinkenberg, Don; Roberts, Mick; Heesterbeek, Johan A.

Hook. f. and Thomson) Reversed SARS-CoV-2 Viral Spike-Protein Induced Disease Phenotype in the Xenotransplant Model of Humanized Zebrafish,2021-04-19,"In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), strict social distancing measures (e.g., nationwide lockdown) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are unsustainable in the long-term due to knock-on socioeconomic and psychological effects. However, an optimal epidemiology-focused strategy for ‘safe-reopening’ (i.e., balancing between the economic and health consequences) remain unclear, particularly given the suboptimal disease surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure in these settings. As the lockdown is now being relaxed in many LMICs, in this paper, we have (1) conducted an epidemiology-based “options appraisal” of various available non-pharmacological intervention options that can be employed to safely lift the lockdowns (namely, sustained mitigation, zonal lockdown and rolling lockdown strategies), and (2) propose suitable application, pre-requisites, and inherent limitations for each measure. Among these, a sustained mitigation-only approach (adopted in many high-income countries) may not be feasible in most LMIC settings given the absence of nationwide population surveillance, generalised testing, contact tracing and critical care infrastructure needed to tackle the likely resurgence of infections. By contrast, zonal or local lockdowns may be suitable for some countries where systematic identification of new outbreak clusters in real-time would be feasible. This requires a generalised testing and surveillance structure, and a well-thought out (and executed) zone management plan. Finally, an intermittent, rolling lockdown strategy has recently been suggested by the World Health Organization as a potential strategy to get the epidemic under control in some LMI settings, where generalised mitigation and zonal containment is unfeasible. This strategy, however, needs to be carefully considered for economic costs and necessary supply chain reforms. In conclusion, while we propose three community-based, non-pharmacological options for LMICs, a suitable measure should be context-specific and based on: (1) epidemiological considerations, (2) social and economic costs, (3) existing health systems capabilities and (4) future-proof plans to implement and sustain the strategy.","Chowdhury, Rajiv; Luhar, Shammi; Khan, Nusrat; Choudhury, Sohel Reza; Matin, Imran; Franco, Oscar H.",Eur J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656618/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00660-1,443

Antiretrovirals (ARVs) might have a prophylactic role in these patients. The purpose of this study was to review the most recently published articles on the possible role of ARVs for pre‐ or postexposure prophylaxis against COVID‐19. From June to October 2020, we searched scientific databases using specific key words to identify ongoing trials or articles published before October 2020 investigating any subgroups of ARVs for prophylaxis against COVID‐19. Apart from molecular docking studies, in vitro, animal, and human studies are very limited for evaluating the prophylactic role of ARVs against severe acute respiratory syndrome‐corona virus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. According to our findings, there is no definite evidence to support use of protease inhibitors for this purpose, despite the promising results of molecular studies and limited clinical evidence for ritonavir‐boosted lopinavir, darunavir, and nelfinavir when used early in the course of the disease. Nucleotide/nucleoside reverse‐transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) also have shown binding affinity to main enzymes of SARS‐CoV‐2 in molecular, in vitro, and animal studies. NRTIs like tenofovir and emtricitabine might exhibit a prophylactic role against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. In conclusion, currently there is no evidence to justify the use of ARVs for prophylaxis against COVID‐19.","Alavian, Golbarg; Kolahdouzan, Kasra; Mortezazadeh, Masoud; Torabi, Zahra Sadat",J Clin Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217030/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1788,443

Although there is currently a slowing down of the infection, a reduction of hospitalizations, especially for myocardial infarction, was observed. The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of the infectious disease on ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, through the analysis of recent cases of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients affected by STEMI from March 1 to 31, 2020, during social restrictions of Italian government, were collected and compared with patients with STEMI treated during March 2019. During March 2020, we observed a 63% reduction of patients with STEMI who were admitted to our catheterization laboratory, when compared with the same period of 2019 (13 versus 35 patients). Changes in all time components of STEMI care were notably observed, particularly for longer median time in symptom‐to‐first medical contact, spoke‐to‐hub, and the cumulative symptom‐to‐wire delay. Procedural data and in‐hospital outcomes were similar between the 2 groups, whereas the length of hospitalization was longer in patients of 2020. In this group, we also observed higher levels of cardiac biomarkers and a worse left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline and discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak induced a reduction of hospital access for STEMI with an increase in treatment delay, longer hospitalization, higher levels of cardiac biomarkers, and worse left ventricular function.","Cammalleri, Valeria; Muscoli, Saverio; Benedetto, Daniela; Stifano, Giuseppe; Macrini, Massimiliano; Di Landro, Alessio; Di Luozzo, Marco; Marchei, Massimo; Mariano, Enrica Giuliana; Cota, Linda; Sergi, Domenico; Bezzeccheri, Andrea; Bonanni, Michela; Baluci, Martino; De Vico, Pasquale; Romeo, Francesco",J Am Heart Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.017126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901560/,443

The 35S-labeled RNA probes were generated from two plasmids pPSP.FP1 and pPSP.FP2 containing part of the S gene of TGEV. The procedure was first standardized in cell cultures. The radiolabeled pPSP.FP2 probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP1 probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. ISH has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections.","Sirinarumitr, Theerapol; Paul, Prem S.; Kluge, John P.; Halbur, Patrick G.",Journal of Virological Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0166093495019014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8882645/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166093495019014,443

The purpose of this study is to assess the awareness of AI technologies among health professionals and to investigate their perceptions toward AI applications in medicine. Design: A web-based Google Forms survey was distributed via the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust e-newsletter. Setting: Only staff working at the NHS Foundation Trust received an invitation to complete the online questionnaire. Participants: 98 healthcare professionals out of 7,538 (response rate 1.3%; CI 95%; margin of error 9.64%) completed the survey, including medical doctors, nurses, therapists, managers, and others. Primary outcome: To investigate the prior knowledge of health professionals on the subject of AI as well as their attitudes and worries about its current and future applications. Results: 64% of respondents reported never coming across applications of AI in their work and 87% did not know the difference between machine learning and deep learning, although 50% knew at least one of the two terms. Furthermore, only 5% stated using speech recognition or transcription applications on a daily basis, while 63% never utilize them. 80% of participants believed there may be serious privacy issues associated with the use of AI and 40% considered AI to be potentially even more dangerous than nuclear weapons. However, 79% also believed AI could be useful or extremely useful in their field of work and only 10% were worried AI will replace them at their job. Conclusions: Despite agreeing on the usefulness of AI in the medical field, most health professionals lack a full understanding of the principles of AI and are worried about potential consequences of its widespread use in clinical practice. The cooperation of healthcare workers is crucial for the integration of AI into clinical practice and without it the NHS may miss out on an exceptionally rewarding opportunity. This highlights the need for better education and clear regulatory frameworks.","Castagno, Simone; Khalifa, Mohamed",Front Artif Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733219/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2020.578983,443
626815,Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein to Glycans,2020-07-02,"INTRODUCTION: Due to their stressful lives, Palestinian refugees are prone to use cognitive enhancers (CE) and psychostimulant substances (PS). Recognising health problems associated with CE/PS use can indicate how preventive programs should be directed towards adolescents. Unfortunately, research has not thoroughly investigated the health problems related to tobacco and caffeine products, the most socially acceptable CE/PS among Palestinian refugee adolescents. METHODOLOGY: In 2021, schoolchildren from five Palestinian refugee camps (N=271) aged 12-<16 years agreed to give blood samples and to be interviewed to address the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and tobacco smoking, coffee, energy drinks (ED), black tea, and chocolate consumption. MetS was diagnosed based on International Diabetic Federation Criteria. To address the association, we used binary logistic regression models adjusted to age, gender, BMI, and central obesity. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS was [17 (6.3%)]; (7.4%) in males, (5.1%) in females. The prevalence of substance use was as follows: ED [163 (48.9%)], coffee [255 (76.6%)], black tea [295 (89.1%)], cigarette [35 (10.5%)], waterpipe [59 (17.7%)], and chocolate [309 (93.6%)], with male predominance. Cigarette smokers have increased central obesity (p-value=0.024), and decreased HDL-cholesterol (p-value=0.015) than non-smokers. Similar results were observed for waterpipe smokers besides the increased levels of triglycerides (p-value=0.01). ED consumers have increased central obesity (p-value=0.03) and fast blood sugar (p-value=0.003) than non-consumers. Chocolate consumers have decreased central obesity (p-value=0.008) and increased HDL levels (p-value=0.04) than non-consumers. ED consumers were significantly at higher risk of MetS (OR=9.97, p-value=0.019) than non-consumers and chocolate consumers were at lower risk of MetS (OR=0.14, p-value=0.046) than non-consumers. Waterpipe smokers were at a higher risk of having increased plasma triglycerides than non-consumers (OR=3.4, p-value=0.03). CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of ED consumption and waterpipe smoking in Palestinian refugee adolescents is problematic. Their use was associated with higher odds of MetS, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, which justifies greater attention.","Damiri, Basma; Khatib, Omar; Nazzal, Zaher; Sanduka, Diala; Igbaria, Siwar; Thabaleh, Ammar; Farhoud, Ahmad; Saudi, Lubna; Belkebir, Souad; Al Ali, Rayyan; Alili, Mohammed; Hamdan, Mahmoud; Safarini, Omar A; Younis, Omar",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616165/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s329675,443

The mechanism and regulation of nsp13 has not been explored at the single-molecule level. Specifically, force-dependent unwinding experiments have yet to be performed for any coronavirus helicase. Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the dsRNA, suggesting a passive unwinding mechanism. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be potently activated by picoNewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, drawing stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases. Our findings suggest that mechanoregulation, which may be provided by a directly bound RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, enables on-demand helicase activity on the relevant polynucleotide substrate during viral replication.","Mickolajczyk, Keith J.; Shelton, Patrick M.M.; Grasso, Michael; Cao, Xiaocong; Warrington, Sara E.; Aher, Amol; Liu, Shixin; Kapoor, Tarun M.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766580/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.231274,443

These lesions are associated with blunt or penetrating traumatic injuries of the carotid arteries. We present the first cases of cavernous dural arteriovenous fistulae (cDAVF) in the middle meningeal artery (MMA) after the treatment of direct CCF in the ICA with Willis-covered stents (WCSs). CASE PRESENTATION: Our patients comprised 22 and 50-year-old males with histories of head injuries months before admission at our facility. In both patients above, cerebral angiography revealed fistulae in the right ICA and left ICA, respectively. They were treated with WCSs via the trans-artery endovascular route. In both cases, the treatments were not in the way attempted via the MMA. Subsequently, they developed cDAVF in the middle meningeal artery (MMA), which were treated with Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Onyx HD-500) (Covidien / ev3 Neurovascular) and conservatively, respectively. CONCLUSION: These are the first cases in whom WCSs for the management of direct CCF resulted in cDAVF at the MMA. The WCSs inside the ICA could have resulted in the cDAVF via unknown mechanisms but not iatrogenic.","Wang, Ting; Richard, Seidu A; Zhang, Changwei; Xie, Xiaodong; Wang, Chaohua",Curr Med Imaging,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573405617666210114142800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459242/,443

A bio-inspired modeling pathway is used to generate plausible computational models of the two TMDs forming the monomeric protein model. A flexible region between Leu-13 and Gly-15 is identified for TMD1(1-32) and a region around Gly-46 to Trp-48 for TMD2(36-58). Mutations of the tyrosine residues in TMD2(36-58) into phenylalanine and serine are simulated to identify their role in shaping TMD2. Lowest energy structures of the two TMDs connected with the loop residues are used for a posing study in which small molecule drugs BIT225, amantadine, rimantadine and NN-DNJ, are identified to bind to the loop region. BIT225 is identified to interact with the backbone of the functionally important residues Arg-35 and Trp-36.

In this respect, although coronavirus was not as dangerous as novel diseases such as swine flu and Ebola, the spread and the power of coronavirus infiltration caused public fear across the world. Three viruses among coronaviruses have been epidemic during the recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19 or new coronavirus. Respiratory droplets transmit the coronavirus through direct and indirect contact, and it can be transmitted through the contact in the case of remaining, the infected person's secretion on the surface. Based on the conducted studies on the treatment of COVID-19 disease, there is virtually no cure or vaccine for coronavirus infections yet. Those infected with Covid 19 are quarantined to prevent the outbreak of this disease.

Mobile phone locations are increasingly assimilated for this purpose, but an alternative, unexplored, natively anonymous, absolute method would be to use geophysical sensing to directly measure public infrastructure usage. In this paper, we demonstrate how fiber‐optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) connected to a telecommunication cable beneath Palo Alto, CA, successfully monitored traffic over a 2‐month period, including major reductions associated with COVID‐19 response. Continuous DAS recordings of over 450,000 individual vehicles were analyzed using an automatic template‐matching detection algorithm based on roadbed strain. In one commuter sector, we found a 50% decrease in vehicles immediately following the order, but near Stanford Hospital, the traffic persisted. The DAS measurements correlate with mobile phone locations and urban seismic noise levels, suggesting geophysics would complement future digital city sensing systems.","Lindsey, Nathaniel J.; Yuan, Siyuan; Lellouch, Ariel; Gualtieri, Lucia; Lecocq, Thomas; Biondi, Biondo",Geophys Res Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834188/; https://doi.org/10.1029/2020gl089931,443

Living organisms are constantly exposed to pathogens and a molecular war begins when a host encounters a pathogen. Nevertheless, a disease as an outcome of a pathogen attack remains an exception rather a rule. Pathogenic diseases like influenza and HIV/AIDS have seriously affected many societies worldwide as well as challenge our abilities to fight the responsible agents. Over the past decade, strains of many common pathogens have continued to develop resistance to the drugs that once were effective against them. Parasite genome sequences do not themselves provide a full explanation of the biology of an organism or on the molecular war involved in host-pathogen associations. Since the 1990s, proteomic tools have been successfully employed in a large number of studies to find and identify proteins involved in biological phenomena, such as host-parasite interactions. Thus, it is apparent that parasitologists and molecular biologists should attempt to improve their experimental design. In this chapter, new ways based on evolutionary concepts are suggested to enable further elucidation of the molecular complexities of host–pathogen genome interactions. These new ways could help to increase the knowledge about the molecular war involved in host–pathogen associations, taking into account the environmental factors.","Biron, David G.; Nedelkov, Dobrin; Missé, Dorothée; Holzmuller, Philippe",Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Disease,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012384890100011X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012384890100011X,443

Cells were harvested 6-, 24- and 48 h following hypoxic challenge for assessment of mRNA and protein, using qPCR and Western Blot. The response of the brain endothelial cells to hypoxia was replicated using modular incubator chambers. We observed an acute increase (6 h, p < 0.05), followed by a longer-term decrease (48 h, p < 0.05) in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression, accompanied by reduced expression of TMPRSS2 protein levels (48 h, p < 0.05) under the more severe hypoxic condition (2% O(2)). No changes in levels of von Willebrand Factor (vWF – an endothelial cell damage marker) or interleukin 6 (IL-6 – a pro-inflammatory cytokine) mRNA were observed. We conclude that hypoxia regulates brain endothelial cell ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in vitro, which may indicate human brain endothelial susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent brain sequelae.","Imperio, Guinever E.; Lye, Phetcharawan; Mughis, Hafsah; Hamada, Hirotaka; Bloise, Enrrico; Lye, Stephen J.; Matthews, Stephen G.",Microvasc Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mvr.2021.104232; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026286221001023?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026286221001023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416267/,443

The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, beliefs, and behavior of parents toward fever and its management. Methods: A cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire was applied over a period of 3 months, from January to March 2018, to parents who were living in Saudi Arabia. The inclusion criteria were a parent who is a resident of Saudi Arabia, with at least one child aged 6 years or less, while incomplete questionnaires, having a child aged more than 6 years, or parents who were not living in Saudi Arabia were excluded. Results: A total of 656 parents completed the questionnaire. More than two-thirds of the subjects were female, the majority of whom were aged between 25–33 years old. The best-reported place to measure the temperature of children was the armpit (46%), followed by the ear (28%) and the mouth (10.7%).

Primary PTC tissues and matched normal thyroid tissues were collected, and the Cep63 expression level was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting. A stable Cep63-knockout cell line was constructed to assess the proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis abilities in vitro. A subcutaneous tumorigenesis model was established in nude mice to evaluate the effect of Cep63 on tumor growth and proliferation in vivo. Western blotting was used to explore the relevant signaling pathways. The results revealed that the expression level of Cep63 in PTC tissues was significantly increased. The proliferation, invasion and migration abilities of TPC-1 cells were decreased after Cep63 knockout, and silencing of Cep63 resulted in TPC-1 cell cycle arrest in the S phase. Mechanistically, Cep63 knockout inhibited the activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, Cep63 knockout significantly inhibited biological functions of TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, indicating that Cep63 may be an important oncogene of PTC.","Liu, Chenguang; Yu, Fangqin; Ma, Runsheng; Zhang, Lele; Du, Gongbo; Niu, Dongpeng; Yin, Detao",Oncol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34296302/; https://doi.org/10.3892/or.2021.8150,443

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining public safety necessitates restricting the physical presence of families for hospitalized patients. In response, health systems must rapidly adapt family-centric procedures and tools to circumvent restrictions on physical presence. Strategies for maintaining family integrity must acknowledge clinicians’ limited time and attention to devote to learning new skills. Internet-based solutions can facilitate the routine, predictable, and structured communication which is central to family-centered care. But the reliance on technology may compromise patient privacy and exacerbate racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities for populations that lack access to reliable internet access, devices or technological literacy. We provide a toolbox of strategies for supporting family-centered inpatient care during physical distancing responsive to the current clinical climate.

Adherence of F4 ETEC to the small intestine by binding to specific receptors is mediated by F4 fimbriae. Porcine aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) was recently identified as a new F4 receptor. In this study, 7 coding mutations and 1 mutation in the 3′ untranslated region (3' UTR)were identified in ANPEP by reverse transcriptase (RT–) PCR and sequencing using 3 F4 receptor-positive (F4R+) and 2 F4 receptor-negative (F4R–) pigs, which were F4 phenotyped based on the MUC4 TaqMan, oral immunization, and the in vitro villous adhesion assay. Three potential differential mutations (g.2615C > T, g.8214A > G, and g.16875C > G) identified by comparative analysis between the 3 F4R+ and 2 F4R– pigs were genotyped in 41 additional F4 phenotyped pigs. However, none of these 3 mutations could be associated with F4 ETEC susceptibility. In addition, the RT-PCR experiments did not reveal any differential expression or alternative splicing in the small intestine of F4R+ and F4R– pigs. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the difference in F4 binding to ANPEP is due to modifications in its carbohydrate moieties.","Goetstouwers, T.; Van Poucke, M.; Nguyen, V.

636530,Identifying Distinct Structural Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Fusion Domain Essential for Membrane Interaction,2021-09-27,"COVID-19 presents an urgent global challenge because of its contagious nature, frequently changing characteristics, and the lack of a vaccine or effective medicines. A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services. This requires using advanced intelligent computing such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, cognitive computing, cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: “no actions,” “lockdown,” and “new medicines.” The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the “no actions” scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully.","Alanazi, Saad Awadh; Kamruzzaman, M.

The frequent interactions of wild animals with humans it is more prevalent a common source of such infections and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the zoonotic pathogens among the leading cause of severe respiratory diseases in humans. AIM The major purpose of this study was to study the gene expression profiling for those human samples which are infected with coronavirus or uninfected and compare the differential expression patterns and its functional impact. METHODS For this purpose, the previously studied samples have been collected from public database and the study had been performed and it includes gene expression analysis, pathway analysis, and the network-level understanding. The analysis presents the data for the differentially expressed genes, enriched pathways and the networks for the potential genes and gene sets. In terms of gene expression and the linkage of COVID-19 with type-2 diabetes. RESULTS We observe that there are a large number of genes which show altered gene expression pattern than the normal for coronavirus infection while in terms of pathways it appears that there are few sets of functions which are affected due to altered gene expression and they infer to infection, inflammation, and the immune system. CONCLUSIONS Based on our study, we conclude that the potential genes which are affected due to infection are NFKBIA, MYC, FOXO3, BIRC3, ICAM1, IL8, CXCL1/2/5, GADD45A, RELB, SGK1, AREG, BBC3, DDIT3/4, EGR1, MTHFD2, and SESN2 and the functional changes are mainly associated with these pathways TNF, cytokine, NF-kB, TLR, TCR, BCR, Foxo, and TGF signaling pathways are among them and there are additional pathways such as hippo signaling, apoptosis, estrogen signaling, regulating pluropotency of stem cells, ErbB, Wnt, p53, cAMP, MAPK, PI3K-AKT, oxidative phosphorylation, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, prolactin signaling, adipocytokine, neurotrophine signaling, and longevity regulating pathways.

In severely ill patients, highly elevated serum levels of certain cytokines and considerable cytolytic T cell infiltrates in the lungs have been observed. These same patients may bear low to negligible viral burdens suggesting that an overactive immune response, often termed cytokine storm, contributes to the severity of COVID-19. We report the safety and efficacy of baricitinib combined with remdesivir and dexamethasone in 45 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at a tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Retrospective review of 45 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients received 7-day course of baricitinib, 5-day course of remdesivir and 10-day course of dexamethasone. Clinical status and biomarkers were obtained daily. Outcomes assessed include mortality, duration of hospitalization, presence of shock, need for supplemental oxygen, need for non-invasive ventilation, need for mechanical ventilation and development of thrombosis. RESULTS: Obesity and multiple medical comorbidities were associated with hospitalization in the setting of COVID-19. Treated patients demonstrated rapid declines of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer with gradual improvement in hemoglobin, platelet counts and clinical status. Only 2 of 45 (4.4%) treated patients required mechanical ventilation after initiating treatment and there were six deaths (13.3%).Only 2 of 45 (4.4%) treated patients required mechanical ventilation after initiating treatment.

Hyperglycemia occurring in the setting of either previously diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes is known to be associated with poor outcomes. Here, we aim to provide a simple and practical guidance on the diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in admitted patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The guidance is formulated based on experience of authors and relevant literature on the subject searched using Pubmed. RESULTS: Every patient admitted to a COVID care facility should be investigated for hyperglycemia using a combination of tests including capillary blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c. Oral glucose lowering drugs can be considered in patients with mild COVID illness who have mild hyperglycemia (pre-meal blood glucose of ≥180 mg/dl and post-meal blood glucose of ≥250 mg/dl) and no contraindication to the use of these agents. All patients with moderate-severe disease and/or hyperglycemia of greater severity should be initiated on insulin therapy. Hyperglycemia should be aggressively screened for and managed in patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids.

However, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID‐19. METHODS: This study enrolled 33 COVID‐19 patients in the nineth hospital of Nanchang from January 27(th) to February 24(th), 2020. Clinical indexes of patients upon admission/discharge were examined. Patients were divided into two groups according to different treatment plans (Danoprevir; Lopinavir/Ritonavir). The days to achieve negative nucleic acid testing and the days of hospital stays were counted and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: COVID‐19 patients treated with Danoprevir or Lopinavir/Ritonavir were all improved and discharged. Indexes like blood routine, inflammation and immune‐related indexes were significantly recovered after treatment. Additionally, under the circumstance that there was no significant difference in patients’ general information between the two groups, we found that the mean time to achieve negative nucleic acid testing and hospital stays of patients treated with Danoprevir both were significantly shorter than those of patients with Lopinavir/Ritonavir.

This hindrance comes at a time when the NTDs are progressing towards their ambitious goals for 2030. Mathematical modelling on several NTDs, namely gambiense sleeping sickness, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), trachoma, and visceral leishmaniasis, shows that the impact of this disruption will vary across the diseases. Programs face a risk of resurgence, which will be fastest in high-transmission areas. Furthermore, of the mass drug administration diseases, schistosomiasis, STH, and trachoma are likely to encounter faster resurgence. The case-finding diseases (gambiense sleeping sickness and visceral leishmaniasis) are likely to have fewer cases being detected but may face an increasing underlying rate of new infections. However, once programs are able to resume, there are ways to mitigate the impact and accelerate progress towards the 2030 goals.","Toor, Jaspreet; Adams, Emily R; Aliee, Maryam; Amoah, Benjamin; Anderson, Roy M; Ayabina, Diepreye; Bailey, Robin; Basáñez, Maria-Gloria; Blok, David J; Blumberg, Seth; Borlase, Anna; Rivera, Rocio Caja; Castaño, María Soledad; Chitnis, Nakul; Coffeng, Luc E; Crump, Ronald E; Das, Aatreyee; Davis, Christopher N; Davis, Emma L; Deiner, Michael S; Diggle, Peter J; Fronterre, Claudio; Giardina, Federica; Giorgi, Emanuele; Graham, Matthew; Hamley, Jonathan I D; Huang, Ching-I; Kura, Klodeta; Lietman, Thomas M; Lucas, Tim C D; Malizia, Veronica; Medley, Graham F; Meeyai, Aronrag; Michael, Edwin; Porco, Travis C; Prada, Joaquin M; Rock, Kat S; Le Rutte, Epke A; Smith, Morgan E; Spencer, Simon E F; Stolk, Wilma A; Touloupou, Panayiota; Vasconcelos, Andreia; Vegvari, Carolin; de Vlas, Sake J; Walker, Martin; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32984870/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa933,443

We have begun virtually in this field since COVID-19 pandemic, besides our divergence in the infectious agents’. In this study and based on the previous review, Hypericum perforatum (St. John’s Wort) and Echinacea (gaia HERBS®) were tested in vitro using Vero E6 cells for their anti-viral effects against the newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through its infectious cycle from 0 to 48 hours post infection. The hypericin (0.9 mg) of H. perforatum and the different parts (roots, seeds, aerial) of two types of Echinacea species (Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia) were examined their efficacy in certain concentration and under light-dependent anti-viral activities to measure the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and the viral load with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and to assess the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding on cell culture assay. Interestingly, the mixture (H.E.) of 100 mg/mL of H. perforatum and Echinacea was tested too on SARS-CoV-2 and showed crucial anti-viral activity competing H. perforatum then Echinacea effects as anti-viral treatment. Therefore, the results of gaia HERBS® products, H. perforatum and Echinacea species, applied in this study showed significant anti-viral and virucidal effects in the following order of potency: H. perforatum, H.E., and Echinacea on SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle; and will definitely required a set up of clinical trial with specific therapeutic protocol based on the outcome of this study.

It has been hypothesized that systemic inflammation may aggravate arrhythmias or trigger new‐onset conduction abnormalities. However, the specific type and distribution of electrocardiographic disturbances in COVID‐19 as well as their influence on mortality remain to be fully characterized. METHODS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained from 186 COVID‐19‐positive patients at a large tertiary care hospital in Northern Nevada. The following arrhythmias were identified by cardiologists: sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation (A‐Fib), atrial flutter, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), premature atrial contraction (PAC), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), atrioventricular block (AVB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). The mean PR interval, QRS duration, and corrected QT interval were documented. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the ECG features of patients who died during the hospitalization with those who survived. The influence of ECG features on mortality was assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A‐Fib, atrial flutter, and ST‐segment depression were predictive of mortality. In addition, the mean ventricular rate was higher among patients who died as compared to those who survived. The use of therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with reduced odds of death; however, this association did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The underlying pathogenesis of COVID‐19‐associated arrhythmias remains to be established, but we postulate that systemic inflammation and/or hypoxia may induce potentially lethal conduction abnormalities in affected individuals. Longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the risk factors, pathogenesis, and management of COVID‐19‐associated cardiac arrhythmias.","Antwi‐Amoabeng, Daniel; Beutler, Bryce D.; Singh, Sahajpreet; Taha, Moutaz; Ghuman, Jasmine; Hanfy, Ahmed; Manasewitsch, Nicholas T.; Ulanja, Mark B.; Ghuman, Joban; Awad, Munadel; Gullapalli, Nageshwara; Gbadebo, T.

The situation has recently deteriorated even further because of social distancing measures of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several organizations have started to provide some harm reduction services via online platforms by web outreach. However, little is known on how online outreach services are organized and implemented. Drawing on the example of St. Petersburg-based NGO “Humanitarian Action,” we explored web outreach work in Telegram instant messenger. METHODS: Our data were comprised of 4 semi-structured interviews with the NGO staff and 301 cases of web outreach work with PWUD. We used thematic analysis to study the process of web outreach, harm reduction service provision, and needs of PWUD. RESULTS: Three stages of the process of web outreach work were identified: clients initiating communication, NGO workers addressing clients’ needs, and NGO workers receiving clients’ feedback. Communication proceeded in group chat or direct messages. Challenges in addressing clients’ needs happened when clients turned for help after hours, sent recorded voice messages, sent unclear messages, and/or were unwilling to transition to telephone communication. All web outreach workers reported receiving only positive feedback on their work. The needs of PWUD were categorized into two major themes, depending on whether they can be addressed fully or partially online. In cases of online only provision of services, web outreach workers helped PWUD treat minor injection drug use complications, obtain verified harm reduction information and receive general psychological support. In instances of partial online services provision, PWUD were assisted in getting treatment of severe injection drug use complications, overdoses, and in accessing offline medical, psychological, social, legal and harm reduction services. CONCLUSIONS: Our research demonstrated that web outreach work is a convenient tool for delivering some harm reduction services to PWUD either partially or completely online and for recruiting new clients (including hard-to-reach PWUD that avoid attending brick-and-mortar facilities). Harm reduction organizations should consider incorporating online harm reduction services into their activities. However, further research is needed to explore relative advantages and disadvantages of online harm reduction services.","Davitadze, Arsen; Meylakhs, Peter; Lakhov, Aleksey; King, Elizabeth J.",Harm Reduct J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298081/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00452-6,443

Methods: Fifty-six MS patients were recruited at the Department of Neurology of the University Clinic in Basel. Death anxiety was assessed using the Bochumer Questionnaire on attitude to death and death anxiety 2.0 (BOFRETTA 2.0). Results: Scores of death anxiety towards it in MS patients were low. Only disability (EDSS) was moderately correlated with death anxiety. Depression in MS was significantly correlated with fatigue and disability, but not with the BOFRETTA 2.0.

It is an acute respiratory and infectious disease with no known etiology and treatment. It is continuously causing losses of precious lives and economy at a global scale on daily basis. It is the need of the hour to find more treatment strategies by either developing a drug or to boost the immune system. This opinion article aims to provide Substance P (SP) as a possible cause of the initiation of cytokine storm developed in COVID-19 infection and to suggest Neurokinin-1 Receptor (NK-1R) antagonist, Aprepitant, as a drug to be used for its treatment. This perspective will provide directions to the Biomedical scientists to explore SP and NK-1R and prepare a drug to alleviate the symptoms and cure the disease. It is very important to work on this perspective at earliest to reach to some conclusion regarding the therapeutic intervention. Clinical studies may also be conducted if proven successful. SP is a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, released from the trigeminal nerve of brainstem as a result of nociception. It is directly related to the respiratory illness as in COVID-19 infection. It is responsible for the increased inflammation and the signature symptoms associated with this disease. It is the main switch that needs to be switched off by administering Aprepitant along with glucocorticosteroid, dexamethasone.","Mehboob, Riffat",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34536760/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112159; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221009434; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221009434?v=s5,443

Sensitive and convenient methodologies for the detection of influenza viruses are important for clinical care and infection control as well as epidemiological investigations. Here, we developed a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with quencher/fluorescence oligonucleotides connected by a 5′ backward loop (LF or LB) primer for the detection of two subtypes of influenza viruses: Influenza A (A/H1 and A/H3) and influenza B. The detection limits of the multiplex RT-LAMP assay were 10(3) copies and 10(2) copies of RNA for influenza A and influenza B, respectively. The sensitivities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 94.62% and 97.50% for influenza A and influenza B clinical samples, respectively. The specificities of the multiplex influenza A/B/IC RT-LAMP assay were 100% for influenza A, influenza B, and healthy clinical samples.

RESULTS: The findings of studies on mothers with COVID-19 were limited, and insufficient information is available on the adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. In cases of infection with other coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome during pregnancy, there have been reports on adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm labor, low birth weight, and congenital malformations following high fever in the first trimester. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women may be more susceptible to viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, due to immunological and physiological changes. Therefore, pregnant women should take routine preventive measures, such as washing their hands frequently and avoiding contact with infected people, to prevent infection.","Irani, Morvarid; Pakfetrat, Ali; Mask, Mahin Kiyani",J Educ Health Promot,https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_189_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32509886/,443

There are some 25–100 receptors, commonly called spikes protruding from the envelope shell of the virus. Spikes, resembling the shape of a hot air balloon, may have a total mass similar to the mass of the lipid bi-layer shell. The lipid proteins of the virus are treated as homogeneous elastic material and the problem is formulated as the interaction of thin elastic shell with discrete masses, modeled as short conical cross-sectional beams. The system is subjected to ultrasonic excitation. Using the methods of structural acoustics, it is shown that the scattered pressure is very small and the pressure on the viral shell is simply the incident pressure. The modal analysis is performed for a bare shell, a single spike, and the spike-decorated shell. The predicted vibration frequencies and modes are shown to compare well with the newly derived closed-form solutions for a single spike and existing analytical solutions for thin shells. The fully nonlinear dynamic simulation of the transient response revealed the true character of the complex interaction between local vibration of spikes and global vibration of the multi-degree-of-freedom system. It was shown that harmonic vibration at or below the lowest resonant modes can excite large amplitude vibration of spikes. The associated maximum principal strain in a spike can reach large values in a fraction of a millisecond. Implications for possible tearing off spikes from the shell are discussed. Another important result is that after a finite number of cycles, the shell buckles and collapses, developing internal contacts and folds with large curvatures and strains exceeding 10%. For the geometry and elastic properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, these effects are present in the range of frequencies close to the ones used for medical ultrasound diagnostics.","Wierzbicki, Tomasz; Li, Wei; Liu, Yuming; Zhu, Juner",J Mech Phys Solids,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022509621000600; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022509621000600?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2021.104369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623172/,443

Our study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, preparedness, counselling practices of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19, and the perceived barriers to adequately prevent and control COVID-19 in Yemen. METHODS: Healthcare workers (HCWs) from major healthcare facilities participated in this cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire comprising of five main domains (demographics, knowledge, self-preparedness, counselling practice, perceived barriers) was distributed among HCWs after obtaining informed consent. A convenient sampling technique was used. Descriptive and inferential analyses were applied using SPSS software. RESULTS: A total of 1000 participants were initially targeted to participate in the study with 514 (51.4%) responding, of which 55.3% were female. Physicians and nurses constituted the largest proportion of participants, with 39.5% and 33.3%, respectively. The median scores for knowledge, self-preparedness, and counselling practice were 8 (out of 9), 9 (out of 15), and 25 (out of 30), respectively. The physician group showed a statistically significant association with better knowledge compared to the nurse group only, P<0.001. Males had higher preparedness scores than females, p<0.001. Also, the intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency departments presented a statistically significant difference by which the participants from these departments were more prepared compared to the others (e.g. outpatients, paediatrics and surgery) with P < 0.0001. The lack of awareness among the general population about COVID-19 preventive measures was perceived as the most common barrier for the adequate prevention and control of COVID-19 in Yemen (89.1%). CONCLUSION: The major highlight of this study is that HCWs have, overall, good knowledge, suboptimal preparedness, and adequate counselling practices prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Yemen, despite the high number of perceived barriers. However, urgent action and interventions are needed to improve the preparedness of HCWs to manage COVID-19. The perceived barriers also need to be fully addressed by the local healthcare authorities and international organisations working in Yemen for adequate prevention and control measures to be in place in managing COVID-19.","Al-Ashwal, Fahmi Y.; Kubas, Mohammed; Zawiah, Mohammed; Bitar, Ahmad Naoras; Mukred Saeed, Ramzi; Sulaiman, Syed Azhar Syed; Khan, Amer Hayat; Ghadzi, Siti Maisharah Sheikh",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306750/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243962,443
654974,Simeprevir potently suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication and synergizes with remdesivir,2020-09-03,"The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, our data unveils a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.","Robitaille, Alexa C.; Caron, Elise; Zucchini, Nicolas; Mukawera, Espérance; Adam, Damien; Mariani, Mélissa K.; Gélinas, Anaïs; Fortin, Audray; Brochiero, Emmanuelle; Grandvaux, Nathalie",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-17689-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29234123/,443

When demand for essential resources surpasses availability, difficult triaging decisions are necessary. While algorithms exist, almost nothing is known on societal attitudes regarding triage criteria. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted via social media channels to query a broad sample of society. Participants were asked to make triage decisions in case-based vignettes, exploring a variety of factors. They also were asked to assess how sure they were about their decisions, and how such decisions should be reached. Results: The survey was completed in full by 1626 participants in April 2020. Median age was 39 years (range 12-80 years), 984 (61%) were female. Patient prognosis, responsibility towards others, the absence of behavior-induced co-morbidities, and younger age were rated the most important triage criteria, while participants found that insurance status, social status, and nationality should not play a substantial role. Ethics-committees and point systems were regarded potentially helpful for triage decision-making, while decisions based on order of presentation (first-come first-serve) or on a legal basis were viewed critically. Participants were least sure about their decision when dealing with age or behavior-induced co-morbidities. Overall, women were surer about their decisions than men, participants of Christian faith were also more secure about their decision than atheists-agnostics. Conclusions: This study uses social media to generate insight into public opinion and attitudes regarding triage criteria and modalities. These findings may be helpful for the development of future medical triage algorithms.","Muensterer, O. J.; Gianicolo, E. A.; Paul, N.

657238,"Genome Sequences of Five SARS-CoV-2 Variants from Mumbai, India, Obtained by Nanopore Sequencing",2021-04-15,"The glycocalyx is an important constituent of blood vessels located between the bloodstream and the endothelium. It plays a pivotal role in intercellular interactions in neuroinflammation, reduction of vascular oxidative stress, and provides a barrier regulating vascular permeability. In the brain, the glycocalyx is closely related to functions of the blood-brain barrier and neurovascular unit, both responsible for adequate neurovascular responses to potential threats to cerebral homeostasis. An aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) occurs following rupture of an intracranial aneurysm and leads to immediate brain damage (early brain injury). In some cases, this can result in secondary brain damage, also known as delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). DCI is a life-threatening condition that affects up to 30% of all aSAH patients. As such, it is associated with substantial societal and healthcare-related costs. Causes of DCI are multifactorial and thought to involve neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, thrombosis, and neurovascular uncoupling. To date, prediction of DCI is limited, and preventive and effective treatment strategies of DCI are scarce. There is increasing evidence that the glycocalyx is disrupted following an aSAH, and that glycocalyx disruption could precipitate or aggravate DCI. This review explores the potential role of the glycocalyx in the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to DCI following aSAH. Understanding the role of the glycocalyx in DCI could advance the development of improved methods to predict DCI or identify patients at risk for DCI. This knowledge may also alter the methods and timing of preventive and treatment strategies of DCI. To this end, we review the potential and limitations of methods currently used to evaluate the glycocalyx, and strategies to restore or prevent glycocalyx shedding.","Schenck, Hanna; Netti, Eliisa; Teernstra, Onno; De Ridder, Inger; Dings, Jim; Niemelä, Mika; Temel, Yasin; Hoogland, Govert; Haeren, Roel",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.731641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540844/,443

Psychological difficulties are a significant factor in dermatological diseases and may also aggravate symptom burden. Mind-body interventions are used as a complementary approach to alleviate symptoms in chronic diseases and may represent a valuable non-pharmacological approach in CSU. METHODS: We sought to develop and evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week attention-based training (ABT) programme, coupled to biofeedback technology for CSU. Through convergent interviews, we gathered information from individuals with urticaria about possible links between stress, mood and skin symptoms. Using these data, we recruited 12 participants to engage in an amended ABT programme for patients with CSU, comprising eight 90-min sessions held weekly. Participants completed psychometric measures and measures of urticaria symptomatology as assessed by the urticaria control test, prior to and after the intervention. Adherence to ABT practice was measured using individual inner balance devices which tracked heart rate variability. We completed qualitative interviews after the intervention to obtain feedback on participant experience of the programme. RESULTS: Participants with CSU described how their psychological wellbeing can be linked to skin symptoms, poor sleep and difficulty concentrating. An amended ABT programme was found to be an acceptable component of care in the management of CSU. Retention of participants in the programme was challenging with 33% participants dropping out of the programme. For those who did complete the programme, three participants exceeded weekly practice at week 8. A decrease in severity of urticaria symptomatology as measured by the urticaria control test was observed upon completion of the intervention. The most commonly cited barrier to implementation of the programme was the time commitment required. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating an ABT programme into routine clinical care for CSU patients is feasible and was deemed acceptable and valuable by individuals who took part. Further formal evaluation of ABT for CSU including the analysis of biochemical parameters is required to determine its role in the management of this distressing condition.

Serosurveys are essential to understanding the extent of virus transmission. This cross-sectional study aims to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. METHODS: Between 19 July and 14 August 2020, 4487 households were selected using a random sample stratified by region and citizenship of the head of household (UAE citizen or non-citizen). A cluster sample of 40 labour camps was selected. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were collected. Each participant was first tested by Roche Elecsys(®) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, followed, when reactive, by the LIAISON(®) SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay. RESULTS: Among 8831 individuals from households, seroprevalence was 10·4% [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 9·5–11·4], with higher seroprevalence in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain regions compared with those in Al Dhafra. In households, we found no sex difference and UAE citizens had lower seroprevalence compared with those of other nationalities. Among 4855 workers residing in labour camps, seroprevalence was 68·6% (95% CI 61·7–74·7), with higher seroprevalence among workers from Southeast Asia. In households, individuals with higher body mass indexes demonstrated higher seroprevalences than individuals with normal weight. Anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity.

To track the behavior of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in the infected cells in real time, we produced an infectious recombinant ASFV (B54GFP-2) that expresses and incorporates into the virus particle a chimera of the p54 envelope protein fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The incorporation of the fusion protein into the virus particle was confirmed immunologically and it was determined that p54-EGFP was fully functional by confirmation that the recombinant virus made normal-sized plaques and presented similar growth curves to the wild-type virus. The tagged virus was visualized as individual fluorescent particles during the first stages of infection and allowed to visualize the infection progression in living cells through the viral life cycle by confocal microscopy. In this work, diverse potential applications of B54GFP-2 to study different aspects of ASFV infection are shown. By using this recombinant virus it was possible to determine the trajectory and speed of intracellular virus movement. Additionally, we have been able to visualize for first time the ASFV factory formation dynamics and the cytophatic effect of the virus in live infected cells.

659757,Recognition of Divergent Viral Substrates by the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease,2021-08-26,"BACKGROUND: The mass media are often criticized for oversimplifying the causes of suicide and overlooking some of the risk factors. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this assertion. The study aims to examine the accuracy of news reports in Hong Kong (HK) and in particular whether or not such reports stereotype victims according to gender and suicide method. METHODS: Data from a case–control psychological autopsy (PA) study of 150 HK suicides were utilized. The reports of the PA cases from five major HK newspapers were collected and reviewed to identify whether or not there was a match in terms of the cases' profile and risk factors. RESULTS: The age, gender, and method of the suicides were largely reported correctly (> 70%) but accounts of risk factors were seldom accurate (< 46%). No significant difference was found between tabloid- and non-tabloid-type newspapers' accuracy. Media stereotyping of gender-specific suicide and charcoal-burning suicide was identified. LIMITATIONS: The study was based on a HK sample so the findings are not necessarily applicable elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: The HK mass media generally demonstrated poor accuracy in reporting suicide risk factors. Their reporting was also problematic in terms of stereotyping gender- and method-specific suicides. Clinical practitioners should be alerted to these findings when working with the media. They can also adopt this novel usage of PA data to extract further information from other PA studies and thereby broaden the investigation of reporting accuracy and stereotyping of suicide to more diverse social contexts.","Cheng, Qijin; Yip, Paul S.F.",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2012.03.036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032712002364; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032712002364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608053/,443
661824,Structural modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike/human ACE2 complex interface can identify high-affinity variants associated with increased transmissibility,2021-03-22,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women can lead to fetal deaths and malformations. We have previously reported that ZIKV envelope protein domain III (EDIII) is a subunit vaccine candidate with cross-neutralization activity; however, like many other subunit vaccines, its efficacy is limited. To improve the efficacy of this subunit vaccine, we identified a nonneutralizing epitope on ZIKV EDIII surrounding residue 375, which is buried in the full-length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. We then shielded this epitope with an engineered glycan probe. Compared to the wild-type EDIII, the mutant EDIII induced significantly stronger neutralizing antibodies in three mouse strains and also demonstrated significantly improved efficacy by fully protecting mice, particularly pregnant mice and their fetuses, against high-dose lethal ZIKV challenge. Moreover, the mutant EDIII immune sera significantly enhanced the passive protective efficacy by fully protecting mice against lethal ZIKV challenge; this passive protection was positively associated with neutralizing antibody titers. We further showed that the enhanced efficacy of the mutant EDIII was due to the shielding of the immunodominant nonneutralizing epitope surrounding residue 375, which led to immune refocusing on the neutralizing epitopes. Taken together, the results of this study reveal that an intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines is their artificially exposed immunodominant nonneutralizing epitopes, which can be overcome through glycan shielding. Additionally, the mutant ZIKV protein generated in this study is a promising subunit vaccine candidate with high efficacy in preventing ZIKV infections in mice. IMPORTANCE Viral subunit vaccines generally show low efficacy. In this study, we revealed an intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccine designs: artificially exposed surfaces of subunit vaccines contain epitopes unfavorable for vaccine efficacy. More specifically, we identified an epitope on Zika virus (ZIKV) envelope protein domain III (EDIII) that is buried in the full-length envelope protein but becomes exposed in recombinant EDIII. We further shielded this epitope with a glycan, and the resulting mutant EDIII vaccine demonstrated significantly enhanced efficacy over the wild-type EDIII vaccine in protecting animal models from ZIKV infections. Therefore, the intrinsic limitation of subunit vaccines can be overcome through shielding these artificially exposed unfavorable epitopes. The engineered EDIII vaccine generated in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be further developed to battle ZIKV infections.","Tai, Wanbo; Chen, Jiawei; Zhao, Guangyu; Geng, Qibin; He, Lei; Chen, Yuehong; Zhou, Yusen; Li, Fang; Du, Lanying",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02187-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31189716/,443

This study aimed to scrutinize the mediating effects of health anxiety (HA), anxiety symptoms (AS), and Internet addiction (IA) in the pathway from distress tolerance (DT) to cyberchondria by using a bootstrapping method. In order to examine the role of age in the proposed model, multiple-group path analysis was used to evaluate differences between young and middle adulthood groups. The final sample consisted of both young adult (n = 209) and middle adult (n = 221) Internet users located in Ankara, Turkey. The results of path analyses for both age groups showed that DT is negatively associated with AS and HA; AS and HA are positively associated with IA; IA and HA are positively associated with cyberchondria. Mediation analysis for both age groups demonstrated that AS and HA significantly mediated the relationship between DT and IA; IA significantly mediated the relationships of AS and HA with cyberchondria; HA significantly mediated the relationship between DT and cyberchondria. The results of the multiple-group path analysis showed that the relationship between IA and cyberchondria is significantly stronger in middle adulthood than young adulthood. The results of the current study are consistent with the relevant literature and provide crucial contribution especially by focusing on the role of age.","Durak Batıgün, Ayşegül; Şenkal Ertürk, İpek; Gör, Nağme; Kömürcü Akik, Burcu",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-01038-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921966/,443

METHODS: We retrospectively collected a total of 34 COVID-19 cases (15 male, 19 female, aged 48 ± 16 years, ranging from 10 to 81 years) from 13 families from January 17, 2020 through February 15, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 - part of the family members (first-generation) who had exposure history and others (second-generation) infected through them, and Group 2 - patients from the same family having identical exposure history. We collected clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features for each patient. Comparison tests were performed between the first- and second-generation patients in Group 1. RESULTS: In total there were 21 patients in Group 1 and 20 patients in Group 2. For Group 1, first-generation patients had significantly higher white blood cell count (6.5 × 10(9)/L (interquartile range (IQR): 4.9–9.2 × 10(9)/L) vs 4.5 × 10(9)/L (IQR: 3.7–5.3 × 10(9)/L); P = 0.0265), higher neutrophil count (4.9 × 10(9)/L (IQR: 3.6–7.3 × 10(9)/L) vs 2.9 × 10(9)/L (IQR: 2.1–3.3 × 10(9)/L); P = 0.0111), and higher severity scores on HRCT (3.9 ± 2.4 vs 2.0 ± 1.3, P = 0.0362) than the second-generation patients. Associated underlying diseases (odds ratio, 8.0, 95% confidence interval: 3.4–18.7, P = 0.0013) were significantly correlated with radiologic severity scores in second-generation patients. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the family cluster cases suggests that COVID-19 had no age or sex predominance.

Viroporins are a growing family of viral proteins able to enhance membrane permeability, promoting virus budding. Initially, the MHV E gene was inducibly expressed in Escherichia coli cells, leading to the arrest of bacterial growth, cell lysis and permeabilization to different compounds. Thus, exit of labeled nucleotides from E. coli cells to the cytoplasm was apparent upon expression of MHV E. In addition, enhanced entry of the antibiotic hygromycin B occurred at levels comparable to those observed with the viroporin 6K from Sindbis virus. Mammalian cells are also readily permeabilized by the expression of MHV E protein. Finally, brefeldin A powerfully blocks the viroporin activity of the E protein in BHK cells, suggesting that an intact vesicular system is necessary for this coronavirus to permeabilize mammalian cells.","Madan, Vanessa; García, Meritxell de Jesús; Sanz, Miguel A.; Carrasco, Luis",FEBS Lett,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001457930500654X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15963987/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S001457930500654X,443

In particular, the impact of “medical internationalism” is being felt across the Pacific region, with new doctors returning home in far greater numbers than ever before, the majority having graduated from medical schools in Cuba, China and other countries outside the region, in addition to the more typical numbers graduating and returning home from the region's main medical schools in Fiji and Papua New Guinea. With an agreed regional vision of “Healthy Islands” across the Pacific, the main objective of expanding overseas training opportunities for Pacific island medical students has been to correct the widespread centralization and maldistribution of the medical workforce in PICs and improve health access and quality of care in rural areas by deploying the new graduates to outer-island facilities. However, the return of these new graduates in several PICs has demonstrated that additional training is required to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to practice safely and sustainably in unsupervised settings. Thus, the development of specific postgraduate programmes has been urgently needed to provide pathways to vocational training and specialization in rural medicine appropriate to the Pacific region. Rocketship Pacific Ltd. (Rocketship) is an international health charity, based in Australia, dedicated to improving health in Pacific island countries through stronger primary care. Rocketship's particular focus to date has been on education and capacity-building for doctors and nurses working in rural communities and outer-island facilities. Since 2015, Rocketship has been working in partnership with the Ministries of Health and other key partners in Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga and Vanuatu to design and deliver postgraduate training programmes in the core generalist disciplines family, community and rural hospital medicine. To date, this has resulted in new postgraduate Family Medicine courses being established in Timor-Leste and Tonga; a rural medical workforce support programme being delivered in Vanuatu; and a new Postgraduate Diploma in Rural Generalist Medicine being designed in Solomon Islands. These new programmes, as well as other notable initiatives elsewhere in the Pacific such as the Master of Medicine (Rural) programme in Papua New Guinea, the Diploma and Master of Family Medicine programme in Fiji and the Cook Islands Fellowship in General Practice, are transforming the health workforce in PICs with the potential to benefit island people across the “Blue Continent.” This paper describes the establishment of new postgraduate training programmes in family, community and rural hospital medicine in Timor-Leste, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu from the perspective of Rocketship, the non-profit organization engaged by each country's Ministry of Health (or equivalent) to provide expert technical assistance with their initiative.","McIver, Lachlan; Manahan, Dan; Jones, Sam; 'Ulufonua, Lisiate",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614569/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.612531,443
663511,Amino acid variation analysis of surface spike glycoprotein at 614 in SARS-CoV-2 strains,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerged enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea and mortality in neonatal piglets. PDCoV has spread to many countries around the world, leading to significant economic losses in the pork industry. Therefore, a rapid and sensitive method for detection of PDCoV in clinical samples is urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a single-tube one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay specific for nucleocapsid gene to diagnose and monitor PDCoV infections. The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay was 1 × 10(1) copies of PDCoV, which was approximately 100-fold more sensitive than gel-based one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This assay could specifically amplify PDCoV and had no cross amplification with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), porcine astrovirus (PAstV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). By screening a panel of clinical specimens (N = 192), this method presented a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and was 1–2 log more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR in detection of PDCoV. CONCLUSIONS: The RT-LAMP assay established in this study is a potentially valuable tool, especially in low-resource laboratories and filed settings, for a rapid diagnosis, surveillance, and molecular epidemiology investigation of PDCoV infections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for detection of newly emerged PDCoV with LAMP technology.

665064,"SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from late April in Stockholm, Sweden reveal a novel mutation in the spike protein",2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND: The digital revolution is rapidly transforming health care and clinical teaching and learning. Relative to other medical fields, the interdisciplinary fields of speech-language pathology (SLP), phoniatrics, and otolaryngology have been slower to take up digital tools for therapeutic, teaching, and learning purposes—a process that was recently expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many current teaching and learning tools have restricted or institution-only access, there are many openly accessible tools that have gone largely unexplored. To find, use, and evaluate such resources, it is important to be familiar with the structures, concepts, and formats of existing digital tools. OBJECTIVE: This descriptive study aims to investigate digital learning tools and resources in SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology. Differences in content, learning goals, and digital formats between academic-level learners and clinical-professional learners are explored. METHODS: A systematic search of generic and academic search engines (eg, Google and PubMed); the App Store; Google Play Store; and websites of established SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology organizations was conducted. By using specific search terms and detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, relevant digital resources were identified. These were organized and analyzed according to learner groups, content matter, learning goals and architectures, and digital formats. RESULTS: Within- and between-learner group differences among 125 identified tools were investigated. In terms of content, the largest proportion of tools for academic-level learners pertained to anatomy and physiology (60/214, 28%), and that for clinical-professional learners pertained to diagnostic evaluation (47/185, 25.4%). Between groups, the largest differences were observed for anatomy and physiology (academic-level learners: 60/86, 70%; clinical-professional learners: 26/86, 30%) and professional issues (8/28, 29% vs 20/28, 71%). With regard to learning goals, most tools for academic-level learners targeted the performance of procedural skills (50/98, 51%), and those for clinical-professional learners targeted receptive information acquisition (44/62, 71%). Academic-level learners had more tools for supporting higher-level learning goals than clinical-professional learners, specifically tools for performing procedural skills (50/66, 76% vs 16/66, 24%) and strategic skills (8/10, 80% vs 2/10, 20%). Visual formats (eg, pictures or diagrams) were dominant across both learner groups. The greatest between-group differences were observed for interactive formats (45/66, 68% vs 21/66, 32%). CONCLUSIONS: This investigation provides initial insights into openly accessible tools across SLP, phoniatrics, and otolaryngology and their organizing structures. Digital tools in these fields addressed diverse content, although the tools for academic-level learners were greater in number, targeted higher-level learning goals, and had more interactive formats than those for clinical-professional learners. The crucial next steps include investigating the actual use of such tools in practice and students’ and professionals’ attitudes to better improve upon such tools and incorporate them into current and future learning milieus.","Lin, Yuchen; Neuschaefer-Rube, Christiane",JMIR Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313592/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27901,443

The present study sought to examine potential associations between changes to sleep and eating habits during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Questions for diet asked, “since quarantine: I’m eating healthier, eating more processed foods, home-cooked meals and more regularly,” “I’m enjoying food in quarantine and I’m struggling with overeating in quarantine.” Sleep questions asked “since quarantine: I have managed to keep a regular sleep-wake schedule, my sleep has improved, I’m struggling to fall asleep, I’m waking up more during the night, I’m more sleepy during the day and I’m taking more naps during the day.” Answers were reported on a 4-point scale ranging from “strongly disagree to strongly agree.” Ordinal logistic regressions were used, adjusted for age and sex and examined each dietary variable as ordinal outcome and each sleep variable as predictor. RESULTS: Those who report that they kept a more regular schedule were more likely to report eating healthier (oOR=3.13, p=0.007), eating more home-cooked meals (oOR=3.19, p=0.005), and less likely to be eating more processed foods (oOR=0.39, p=0.02), struggle with overeating (oOR=0.39, p=0.02) or undereating (oOR=0.30, p=0.004) or snacking (oOR=0.25, p=0.001). Those reporting more difficulty falling asleep were less likely to be eating healthier (oOR=0.25, p=0.002) and more likely to be eating more processed foods (oOR=3.07, p=0.009) and snacking (oOr=2.36, P=0.04). Those reporting more difficulty with awakenings were less likely to report eating healthier (oOR=0.34, p=0.03) and more likely to report eating more processed foods (oOR=4.52, p=0.001). Those with more sleepiness were less likely to report eating healthier (oOR=0.29, p=0.01) and more homecooked meals (oOR=0.40, p=0.046) and more likely to report eating more processed foods (oOR=6.42, p<0.0005), overeating (oOR=3.63, p=0.01) and snacking (oOR=5.81, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: Research studying psychological, behavioral and environmental factors that are contributing to changes in sleep and dietary patterns is especially important during a pandemic that has forced people into changes that they may not have been prepared for and which may result in long-term health outcomes.

Thus, health service providers should have access to mental health interventions that can reach more parents than traditional face-to-face interventions. However, despite increasing evidence on the efficacy of internet-based mental health interventions, the pace in transferring such interventions to health care has been slow. One of the major suggested barriers to this may be the health personnel’s attitudes to perceived usefulness of internet-based interventions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine health professionals’ perceived usefulness of internet-based mental health interventions and to identify the key areas that they consider new internet-based services to be useful. METHODS: Between May and September 2018, 2884 leaders and practitioners of infant and child health services were recruited to a cross-sectional web-based survey through the following channels: (1) existing email addresses from the Regional Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Eastern and Southern Norway, course database, (2) an official mailing list to infant and child health services, (3) social media, or (4) other recruitment channels. Respondents filled in background information and were asked to rate the usefulness of internet-based interventions for 12 different infant and child mental health problem areas based on the broad categories from the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-5). Perceived usefulness was assessed with 1 global item: “How often do you think internet-based self-help programs can be useful for following infant and child mental health problems in your line of work?” The answers were scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (often). RESULTS: The participants reported that they sometimes or often perceived internet-based interventions as useful for different infant and child mental health problems (scale of 0-3, all means>1.61). Usefulness of internet-based interventions was rated acceptable for sleep problems (mean 2.22), anxiety (mean 2.09), and social withdrawal and shyness (mean 2.07), whereas internet-based interventions were rated as less useful for psychiatric problems such as obsessive behaviors (mean 1.89), developmental disorders (mean 1.91), or trauma (mean 1.61). Further, there were a few but small differences in perceived usefulness between service leaders and practitioners (all effect sizes<0.32, all P<.02) and small-to-moderate differences among daycare centers, well-baby clinics, municipal child welfare services, and child and adolescent mental health clinics (all effect sizes<0.69, all P<.006). CONCLUSIONS: Internet-based interventions for different infant and child mental health problems within services such as daycare centers, well-baby clinics, municipal child welfare services, and child and adolescent mental health clinics are sometimes or often perceived as useful. These encouraging findings can support the continued exploration of internet-based mental health interventions as a way to improve parental support.","Størksen, Hege Therese; Haga, Silje Marie; Slinning, Kari; Drozd, Filip",JMIR Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.2196/15149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206058/,443

669548,Evaluation of Inhibitory Activity In Silico of In-House Thiomorpholine Compounds between the ACE2 Receptor and S1 Subunit of SARS-CoV-2 Spike,2021-09-17,"Airports are a high complex type of projects that are exposed to many disruptiveness. Proper management between airport expansion projects and airport operations is needed to ensure safety and efficiency of the project and the aviation. Scenario-based preference modeling is one of the robustness analysis techniques that describes the influence of disruptive scenarios on the project initiatives across different criteria. A scenario-based preference model was applied in this work to investigate the influence of different scenarios on Kuwait International Airport expansion. Scenario-based preference is a multi-criteria assessment, which allows the involvement of multiple stakeholders. The key target of the model was to illustrate the most and least robust initiatives, and the highest and least ranked initiatives over the scenarios. The analysis also ranked the scenarios based on their level of disruptiveness. The outcomes of this method can be used to mitigate the system and improve the project robustness by understanding each kind of risk impact. The results showed that the most and least disruptive scenarios were S3, economic crisis, and S5, compelling circumstance, and the most robust initiative was x1, completion of the main terminal building (T2). It is important to discuss the contribution and insights extracted from these analyses. For example, showing the most and least disruptive scenarios is not enough. It is important to mention what insights the readers can gain by knowing the importance of these scenarios. It is very important to highlight the significance of the results. The results showed that the most disruptive scenario was economic crisis. This indicates the fact that current Covid 19 pandemic had significantly affected the local economy, reduced country income that is based mainly on oil and consumed considerable budget on medical related activities. This had resulted in a lower expenditure on mega infrastructure projects as the airport, which caused considerable delay and interruption to major activities. Furthermore, the results showed that the most robust initiative was completion of the main terminal building (T2). This is mainly true due to the fact that the government is very keen to complete this major terminal in the airport as it will release the pressure on the old portion of the airport and increase the airport capacity. Based on these facts, it is clear that priorities in airport infrastructure activities and construction initiatives were affected considerably by the global and local circumstances and come first the global pandemic.","AlKheder, Sharaf; Talib, Dalal; Al-Mutairi, Ayedh",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303987/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149142,443

In our treatment center, the implementation of a holistic care model of time-sharing management for severe and critical COVID-19 patients has further aggravated the shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) professional nurses. Therefore, we developed a short-term specialized and targeted nursing training program to help ICU nurses to cope with stress and become more efficient, thus reducing the number of nurses required in the ICU. In order to avoid possible human-to-human spread, small teaching classes and remote training were applied. The procedural training mode included four steps: preparation, plan, implementation, and evaluation. An evaluation was conducted throughout the process of nursing training. In this study, we documented and shared experiences in transitioning from traditional face-to-face programs to remote combined with proceduralization nursing training mode from our daily work experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shown to be helpful for nurses working in the ICU.","Wang, Hui; Kang, Kai; Gao, Yang; Yang, Bo; Li, Jing; Wang, Lei; Bi, Ying; Yu, Kai-Jiang; Dai, Qing-Qing; Zhao, Ming-Yan",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i5.999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644163/,443

The pressure drop, filtration efficiency, and anti-viral ability of the filter were evaluated against aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 in a continuous air flow condition. A mathematical approach was developed to measure the anti-viral ability of the filter with various virus deposition times. Moreover, two quality factors based on the anti-viral ability of the filter, and a traditional quality factor based on filtration efficiency, were calculated. The filtration efficiency and pressure drop increased with decreasing media velocity and with increasing SA particle coating level. The anti-viral efficiency also increased with increasing SA particle coating level, and decreased by with increasing virus deposition time. Consequently, SA particle coating on a filter does not have significant effects on filtration quality, and there is an optimal coating level to produce the highest anti-viral quality.","Joe, Yun Haeng; Woo, Kyoungja; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389414006694; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389414006694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25179108/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.08.013,443

It is the most dangerous epidemic existing currently all over the world. To date, there is no licensed vaccine and not any particular efficient therapeutic agent available to prevent or cure the disease. So development of an effective vaccine is the urgent need of the time. The proposed study aims to identify potential vaccine candidates by screening the complete proteome of SARS-COV-2 using the computational approach. From 14 protein entries in UniProtKB, 4 proteins were screened for epitope prediction based on consensus antigenicity predictions and various physico-chemical criteria like transmembrane domain, allergenicity, GRAVY value, toxicity, stability index. Comprehensive analysis of these 4 antigens revealed that spike protein (P0DTC2) and nucleoprotein (P0DTC9) show the greatest potential for experimental immunogenicity analysis. These 2 proteins have several potential CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes, as well as high probability of B-cell epitope regions as compared to well-characterized antigen the matrix protein 1 [Influenza A virus (H5N1)]. In addition, the epitope SIIAYTMSL predicted from spike protein (P0DTC2) and epitope SPRWYFYYL predicted from nucleoprotein (P0DTC9) exhibited more than 60% population coverage in the target populations Europe, North America, South Asia, Northeast Asia taken in this study. These epitopes have also been found to exhibit highly significant TCR–pMHC interactions having a joint Z value of 4.51 and 4.37 respectively. Therefore, this analysis suggests that the predicted epitopes might be suitable vaccine candidates and should be subjected to further in-vivo and in-vitro studies.","Jain, Richa; Jain, Ankit; Verma, Santosh kumar",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10989-021-10205-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897313/,443

Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and −229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism. These results demonstrate the value of considering multiple cell models and perturbational modalities for understanding SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.","Rebendenne, Antoine; Roy, Priyanka; Bonaventure, Boris; Chaves, Valadão Ana Luiza; Desmarets, Lowiese; Rouillé, Yves; Tauziet, Marine; Arnaud-Arnould, Mary; Giovannini, Donatella; Lee, Yenarae; DeWeirdt, Peter; Hegde, Mudra; Garcia de, Gracia Francisco; McKellar, Joe; Wencker, Mélanie; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine; Moncorgé, Olivier; Doench, John G.; Goujon, Caroline",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-555275/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075371/,443

For coronaviruses, RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show antiviral activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS‐CoV‐2, SARS‐CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS‐CoV‐2 (−9.11 kcal/mol), SARS‐CoV (−8.03 kcal/mol), and MERS‐CoV (−8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has lower binding energy of −8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS‐CoV‐2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one π‐cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be a potential SARS‐CoV‐2 RdRp inhibitor for further study.","Lung, Jrhau; Lin, Yu‐Shih; Yang, Yao‐Hsu; Chou, Yu‐Lun; Shu, Li‐Hsin; Cheng, Yu‐Ching; Liu, Hung Te; Wu, Ching‐Yuan",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167173/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25761,443

SARS-CoV-2 RNA been detected in the breast milk of lactating women, but the potential role of breastfeeding in transmission to infants has remained uncertain. METHODS: Breast milk specimens were examined for the presence of the virus by RT-PCR and/or culture. Specimens that contained viral RNA (vRNA) were examined for the presence of subgenomic coronavirus RNA (sgRNA), a putative marker of infectivity. Culture methods were used to determine the thermal stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk. RESULTS: Breast milk samples from 110 women (65 confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, 36 with symptoms but without tests, and 9 with symptoms but a negative SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test) were tested by RT-PCR (285 samples) and/or viral culture (160 samples). Although vRNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the milk of 7 of 110 (6%) women with either a confirmed infection or symptomatic illness, and in 6 of 65 (9%) of women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, virus was not detected in any culture. None of the 7 milk specimens with detectable vRNA contained sgRNA. Notably, when artificially added to human milk in control experiments, infectious SARS-CoV-2 could be cultured despite several freeze-thaw cycles, as occurs in the storage and usage of human milk. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be found infrequently in the breastmilk of women with recent infection, but we found no evidence that breastmilk contains infectious virus or that breastfeeding represents a risk factor for transmission of infection to infants.","Krogstad, Paul; Contreras, Deisy; Ng, Hwee; Tobin, Nicole; Chambers, Christina D.; Bertrand, Kerri; Bode, Lars; Aldrovandi, Grace",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851178/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.05.21254897v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.05.21254897,443

The present study sought to investigate whether the relationship between adolescents' perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms was alleviated by their character strengths. A total of 617 adolescents were recruited and completed the online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicated that adolescents' perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly positively correlated with their depression symptoms. Character strengths were significantly negatively correlated with adolescents' perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms. Moreover, the moderating effect of character strengths on the relationship between adolescents' perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and their depression symptoms was significant. Therefore, adolescents' character strengths as a protective factor could buffer the effect of perceived stress of the COVID-19 pandemic on their depression symptoms and contribute to maintaining their mental health.","Liu, Qianwen; Wang, Zhenhong",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921004396; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111062; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921004396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177027/,443

690332,Membrane fusion and immune evasion by the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant,2021-08-17,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced, amplified and created new health inequalities. There is less evidence on how COVID-19 prevalence varies by measures of work and occupation which represent a key social determinant of health. The aim of the study is to evaluate how occupational inequalities in the prevalence of COVID-19 varies across England and their possible explanatory factors. Methods: We used data for 363,651 individuals (2,178,835 observations) aged 18 years and over between 1st May 2020 and 31st January 2021 from the ONS Covid Infection Survey, a representative longitudinal survey of individuals in England. We focus on two measures of work; employment status for all adults, and work sector of individuals currently working. Multi-level binomial regression models were used to estimate the likelihood of testing positive of COVID-19, adjusting for known explanatory covariates. Results: 0.9% of participants tested positive for COVID-19 over the study period. COVID-19 prevalence was higher among adults who were students or furloughed (i.e., temporarily not working). Among adults currently working, COVID-19 prevalence was highest in adults employed in the hospitality sector, with higher prevalence for individuals employed in transport, social care, retail, health care and educational sectors. Inequalities by work were not consistent over time. Conclusions: We find an unequal distribution of infections relating to COVID-19 by work and employment status. Our findings demonstrate the need for greater workplace interventions to protect employees, but also that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs outside of work. In particular, populations who experienced social and economic harms through being furloughed were also more likely to experience a double burden of increased likelihood of COVID-19.","Green, M.
