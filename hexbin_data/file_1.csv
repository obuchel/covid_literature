1,Nitric oxide: a pro-inflammatory mediator in lung disease?,2000-08-15,"Inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide (NO•) and increased indices of NO• -dependent oxidative stress. Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.","Vliet, Albert van der; Eiserich, Jason P; Cross, Carroll E",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC59543/,1
299,Prevalence of human herpesvirus 6 antibodies and DNA in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients: two-year single centre experience,2008-05-30,"INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has been recognized as a potentially significant pathogen in hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Different clinical manifestations have been described, including fever, skin rash, bone marrow suppression, and encephalitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a group of 26 adult recipients of allogeneic HSCTs was conducted. Serum samples taken before transplant were examined for the presence of specific anti-HHV-6 IgM and IgG antibodies. After transplantation, quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine viral load in plasma samples from days 0–80 post-transplant. RESULTS: HHV-6 DNA was detected in plasma samples in 8 (30%) of the 26 recipients between days 18 and 40 after transplantation. All of them developed fever of unknown origin and over 50% had graft-versus-host disease features. Three individuals from this group died during detectable HHV-6 viremia. Another two recipients showed a single positive PCR result at a later time. Infection with HHV-6 was thus confirmed in 10 (38.5%) of the 26 graft recipients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high frequency of detectable HHV-6 viral load in stem cell transplant recipients in Poland. Further investigation to monitor HHV-6 reactivation in graft recipients will be important to improve outcome for these patients.","Dzieciątkowski, Tomasz; Przybylski, Maciej; Torosian, Tigran; Tomaszewska, Agnieszka; Łuczak, Mirosław",Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2766496/,1
387,Hospital Triage System for Adult Patients Using an Influenza-Like Illness Scoring System during the 2009 Pandemic—Mexico,2010-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged during 2009. To help clinicians triage adults with acute respiratory illness, a scoring system for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented at Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: A medical history, laboratory and radiology results were collected on emergency room (ER) patients with acute respiratory illness to calculate an ILI-score. Patients were evaluated for admission by their ILI-score and clinicians' assessment of risk for developing complications. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from intermediate and high-risk patients for influenza testing by RT-PCR. The disposition and ILI-score of those oseltamivir-treated versus untreated, clinical characteristics of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) patients versus test-negative patients were compared by Pearson's Χ(2), Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Of 1840 ER patients, 230 were initially hospitalized (mean ILI-score = 15), and the rest were discharged, including 286 ambulatory patients given oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 11), and 1324 untreated (median ILI-score = 5). Fourteen (1%) untreated patients returned, and 3 were hospitalized on oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 19). Of 371 patients tested by RT-PCR, 104 (28%) had pandemic influenza and 42 (11%) had seasonal influenza A detected. Twenty (91%) of 22 imaged hospitalized pandemic influenza patients had bilateral infiltrates compared to 23 (38%) of 61 imaged hospital test-negative patients (p<0.001). One patient with confirmed pandemic influenza presented 6 days after symptom onset, required mechanical ventilation, and died. CONCLUSIONS: The triaging system that used an ILI-score complimented clinicians' judgment of who needed oseltamivir and inpatient care and helped hospital staff manage a surge in demand for services.","Rodriguez-Noriega, Eduardo; Gonzalez-Diaz, Esteban; Morfin-Otero, Rayo; Gomez-Abundis, Gerardo F.; Briseño-Ramirez, Jaime; Perez-Gomez, Hector Raul; Lopez-Gatell, Hugo; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia M.; Ramírez, Ernesto; López, Irma; Iguala, Miguel; Chapela, Ietza Bojórquez; Zavala, Ethel Palacios; Hernández, Mauricio; Stuart, Tammy L.; Villarino, Margarita Elsa; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Waterman, Steve; Uyeki, Timothy; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871038/,1
505,Non-Invasive Microstructure and Morphology Investigation of the Mouse Lung: Qualitative Description and Quantitative Measurement,2011-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of lung cancer is known to improve the chances of successful treatment. However, lungs are soft tissues with complex three-dimensional configuration. Conventional X-ray imaging is based purely on absorption resulting in very low contrast when imaging soft tissues without contrast agents. It is difficult to obtain adequate information of lung lesions from conventional X-ray imaging. METHODS: In this study, a recently emerged imaging technique, in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging (IL-XPCI) was used. This powerful technique enabled high-resolution investigations of soft tissues without contrast agents. We applied IL-XPCI to observe the lungs in an intact mouse for the purpose of defining quantitatively the micro-structures in lung. FINDINGS: The three-dimensional model of the lung was successfully established, which provided an excellent view of lung airways. We highlighted the use of IL-XPCI in the visualization and assessment of alveoli which had rarely been studied in three dimensions (3D). The precise view of individual alveolus was achieved. The morphological parameters, such as diameter and alveolar surface area were measured. These parameters were of great importance in the diagnosis of diseases related to alveolus and alveolar scar. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that IL-XPCI had the ability to represent complex anatomical structures in lung. This offered a new perspective on the diagnosis of respiratory disease and may guide future work in the study of respiratory mechanism on the alveoli level.","Zhang, Lu; Li, Dongyue; Luo, Shuqian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045447/,1
704,Amiodarone Exposure During Modest Inflammation Induces Idiosyncrasy-like Liver Injury in Rats: Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,2011-10-09,"Amiodarone [2-butyl-3-(3′,5′-diiodo-4’α-diethylaminoethoxybenzoyl)-benzofuran] (AMD), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is known to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxic reactions in human patients. One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity. To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of AMD or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce low-level inflammation. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities as well as increased total bile acid concentrations in serum and midzonal hepatocellular necrosis were observed only in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats. The time interval between AMD and LPS administration was critical: AMD injected 16 h before LPS led to liver injury, whereas AMD injected 2–12 h before LPS failed to cause this response. The increase in ALT activity in AMD/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with AMD as well as LPS. The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of AMD were not affected by LPS coexposure. Serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was significantly increased by LPS and was slightly prolonged by AMD. In Hepac1c7 cells, addition of TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and its primary metabolite, mono-N-desethylamiodarone. In vivo inhibition of TNF signaling by etanercept attenuated the AMD/LPS-induced liver injury in rats. In summary, AMD treatment during modest inflammation induced severe hepatotoxicity in rats, and TNF contributed to the induction of liver injury in this animal model of idiosyncratic AMD-induced liver injury.","Lu, Jingtao; Jones, A.

805,Lack of Association between CLEC5A Gene Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Kawasaki Disease in Taiwanese Children,2011-12-22,"Background. Kawasaki disease is characterized by systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. Previous genetic studies have identified certain candidate genes associated with susceptibility to KD and coronary artery lesions. Host innate immune response factors are involved in modulating the disease outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate CLEC5A (C-type lectin domain family 5) genetic polymorphisms with regards to the susceptibility and outcome of KD. Methods. A total of 1045 subjects (381 KD patients and 664 controls) were enrolled to identify 4 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of CLEC5A (rs1285968, rs11770855, rs1285935, rs1285933) by using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed in cases and controls, and genetic effects were evaluated by the chi-square test. Results. No significant associations were noted between the genotypes and allele frequency of the 4 CLEC5A tSNPs between controls and patients. In the patients, polymorphisms of CLEC5A showed no significant association with coronary artery lesion formation and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response. Conclusions. This study showed for the first time that polymorphisms of CLEC5A are not associated with susceptibility to KD, coronary artery lesion formation, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment response in a Taiwanese population.","Yang, Ya-Ling; Chang, Wei-Pin; Hsu, Yu-Wen; Chen, Wei-Chiao; Yu, Hong-Ren; Liang, Chi-Di; Tsai, Yao-Ting; Huang, Ying-Hsien; Yang, Kuender D.; Kuo, Ho-Chang; Chang, Wei-Chiao",J Biomed Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3318896/,1
917,Activation of the Canonical Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Pathway during Lung Morphogenesis and Adult Lung Tissue Repair,2012-08-20,"Signaling by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) has been implicated in early lung development, adult lung homeostasis and tissue-injury repair. However, the precise mechanism of action and the spatio-temporal pattern of BMP-signaling during these processes remains inadequately described. To address this, we have utilized a transgenic line harboring a BMP-responsive eGFP-reporter allele (BRE-eGFP) to construct the first detailed spatiotemporal map of canonical BMP-pathway activation during lung development, homeostasis and adult-lung injury repair. We demonstrate that during the pseudoglandular stage, when branching morphogenesis progresses in the developing lung, canonical BMP-pathway is active mainly in the vascular network and the sub-epithelial smooth muscle layer of the proximal airways. Activation of the BMP-pathway becomes evident in epithelial compartments only after embryonic day (E) 14.5 primarily in cells negative for epithelial-lineage markers, located in the proximal portion of the airway-tree, clusters adjacent to neuro-epithelial-bodies (NEBs) and in a substantial portion of alveolar epithelial cells. The pathway becomes activated in isolated E12.5 mesenchyme-free distal epithelial buds cultured in Matrigel suggesting that absence of reporter activity in these regions stems from a dynamic cross-talk between endoderm and mesenchyme. Epithelial cells with activated BMP-pathway are enriched in progenitors capable of forming colonies in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. As lung morphogenesis approaches completion, eGFP-expression declines and in adult lung its expression is barely detectable. However, upon tissue-injury, either with naphthalene or bleomycin, the canonical BMP-pathways is re-activated, in bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells respectively, in a manner reminiscent to early lung development and in tissue areas where reparatory progenitor cells reside. Our studies illustrate the dynamic activation of canonical BMP-pathway during lung development and adult lung tissue-repair and highlight its involvement in two important processes, namely, the early development of the pulmonary vasculature and the management of epithelial progenitor pools both during lung development and repair of adult lung tissue-injury.","Sountoulidis, Alexandros; Stavropoulos, Athanasios; Giaglis, Stavros; Apostolou, Eirini; Monteiro, Rui; Chuva de Sousa Lopes, Susana M.; Chen, Huaiyong; Stripp, Barry R.; Mummery, Christine; Andreakos, Evangelos; Sideras, Paschalis",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3423416/,1
927,"Clinical characteristics of pediatric hospitalizations associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Northern Bavaria, Germany",2012-06-18,"BACKGROUND: The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (PIA) virus infected large parts of the pediatric population with a wide clinical spectrum and an initially unknown complication rate. The aims of our study were to define clinical characteristics and outcome of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009-associated hospitalizations (PIAH) in children <18 years of age. All hospitalized cases of children <18 years of age with laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 in the region of Wuerzburg (Northern Bavaria, Germany) between July 2009 and March 2010 were identified. For these children a medical chart review was performed to determine their clinical characteristics and complications. RESULTS: Between July 2009 and March 2010, 94 PIAH (62% males) occurred in children <18 years of age, with a median age of 7 years (IQR: 3–12 years). Underlying diseases and predisposing factors were documented in 40 (43%) children; obesity (n = 12, 30%), asthma (n = 10, 25%) and neurologic disorders (n = 8, 20%) were most frequently reported. Sixteen (17%) children received oxygen supplementation; three (3%) children required mechanical ventilation. Six (6%) children were admitted to an intensive care unit, four of them with underlying chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Most PIAH demonstrated a benign course of disease. However, six children (6%) needed treatment at an intensive care unit for severe complications.","Wieching, Anna; Benser, Jasmin; Kohlhauser-Vollmuth, Christina; Weissbrich, Benedikt; Streng, Andrea; Liese, Johannes G",BMC Res Notes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3438061/,1
930,Prospective application of clinician-performed lung ultrasonography during the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic: distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia,2012-07-10,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department visits quadrupled with the initial onset and surge during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in New York City from April to June 2009. This time period was unique in that >90% of the circulating virus was surveyed to be the novel 2009 H1N1 influenza A according to the New York City Department of Health. We describe our experience using lung ultrasound in a case series of patients with respiratory symptoms requiring chest X-ray during the initial onset and surge of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. METHODS: We describe a case series of patients from a prospective observational cohort study of lung ultrasound, enrolling patients requiring chest X-ray for suspected pneumonia that coincided with the onset and surge of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Twenty pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza patients requiring chest X-ray were enrolled during this time period. Median age was 6.7 years. Lung ultrasound via modified Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency protocol assisted in the identification of viral pneumonia (n = 15; 75%), viral pneumonia with superimposed bacterial pneumonia (n = 7; 35%), isolated bacterial pneumonia only (n = 1; 5%), and no findings of viral or bacterial pneumonia (n = 4; 20%) in this cohort of patients. Based on 54 observations, interobserver agreement for distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia using lung ultrasound was ĸ = 0.82 (0.63 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound may be used to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia. Lung ultrasound may be useful during epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory illnesses for rapid point-of-care triage and management of patients.","Tsung, James W; Kessler, David O; Shah, Vaishali P",Crit Ultrasound J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3439382/,1
1365,Randomized Controlled Ferret Study to Assess the Direct Impact of 2008–09 Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine on A(H1N1)pdm09 Disease Risk,2014-01-27,"During spring-summer 2009, several observational studies from Canada showed increased risk of medically-attended, laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 illness among prior recipients of 2008–09 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). Explanatory hypotheses included direct and indirect vaccine effects. In a randomized placebo-controlled ferret study, we tested whether prior receipt of 2008–09 TIV may have directly influenced A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. Thirty-two ferrets (16/group) received 0.5 mL intra-muscular injections of the Canadian-manufactured, commercially-available, non-adjuvanted, split 2008–09 Fluviral or PBS placebo on days 0 and 28. On day 49 all animals were challenged (Ch0) with A(H1N1)pdm09. Four ferrets per group were randomly selected for sacrifice at day 5 post-challenge (Ch+5) and the rest followed until Ch+14. Sera were tested for antibody to vaccine antigens and A(H1N1)pdm09 by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), microneutralization (MN), nucleoprotein-based ELISA and HA1-based microarray assays. Clinical characteristics and nasal virus titers were recorded pre-challenge then post-challenge until sacrifice when lung virus titers, cytokines and inflammatory scores were determined. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups of influenza-naïve animals. Antibody rise to vaccine antigens was evident by ELISA and HA1-based microarray but not by HI or MN assays; virus challenge raised antibody to A(H1N1)pdm09 by all assays in both groups. Beginning at Ch+2, vaccinated animals experienced greater loss of appetite and weight than placebo animals, reaching the greatest between-group difference in weight loss relative to baseline at Ch+5 (7.4% vs. 5.2%; p = 0.01). At Ch+5 vaccinated animals had higher lung virus titers (log-mean 4.96 vs. 4.23pfu/mL, respectively; p = 0.01), lung inflammatory scores (5.8 vs. 2.1, respectively; p = 0.051) and cytokine levels (p>0.05). At Ch+14, both groups had recovered. Findings in influenza-naïve, systematically-infected ferrets may not replicate the human experience. While they cannot be considered conclusive to explain human observations, these ferret findings are consistent with direct, adverse effect of prior 2008–09 TIV receipt on A(H1N1)pdm09 illness. As such, they warrant further in-depth investigation and search for possible mechanistic explanations.","Skowronski, Danuta M.; Hamelin, Marie-Eve; De Serres, Gaston; Janjua, Naveed Z.; Li, Guiyun; Sabaiduc, Suzana; Bouhy, Xavier; Couture, Christian; Leung, Anders; Kobasa, Darwyn; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; de Bruin, Erwin; Balshaw, Robert; Lavigne, Sophie; Petric, Martin; Koopmans, Marion; Boivin, Guy",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3903544/,1
1571,Genetic Variants of CD209 Associated with Kawasaki Disease Susceptibility,2014-08-22,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis with unknown etiology mainly affecting children in Asian countries. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209) in humans was showed to trigger an anti-inflammatory cascade and associated with KD susceptibility. This study was conducted to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of CD209 and the risk KD. METHODS: A total of 948 subjects (381 KD and 567 controls) were recruited. Nine tagging SNPs (rs8112310, rs4804800, rs11465421, rs1544766, rs4804801, rs2287886, rs735239, rs735240, rs4804804) were selected for TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Clinical phenotypes, coronary artery lesions (CAL) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment outcomes were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Significant associations were found between CD209 polymorphisms (rs4804800, rs2287886, rs735240) and the risk of KD. Haplotype analysis for CD209 polymorphisms showed that A/A/G haplotype (P = 0.0002, OR = 1.61) and G/A/G haplotype (P = 0.0365, OR = 1.52) had higher risk of KD as compared with G/G/A haplotype in rs2287886/rs735239/rs735240 pairwise allele analysis. There were no significant association in KD with regards to CAL formation and IVIG treatment responses. CONCLUSION: CD209 polymorphisms were responsible for the susceptibility of KD, but not CAL formation and IVIG treatment responsiveness.","Kuo, Ho-Chang; Huang, Ying-Hsien; Chien, Shu-Chen; Yu, Hong-Ren; Hsieh, Kai-Sheng; Hsu, Yu-Wen; Chang, Wei-Chiao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141786/,1

1830,Designation of a Novel DKK1 Multiepitope DNA Vaccine and Inhibition of Bone Loss in Collagen-Induced Arthritic Mice,2015-05-05,"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a secretory inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling, plays a critical role in certain bone loss diseases. Studies have shown that serum levels of DKK1 are significantly higher in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and are correlated with the severity of the disease, which indicates the possibility that bone erosion in RA may be inhibited by neutralizing the biological activity of DKK1. In this study, we selected a panel of twelve peptides using the software DNASTAR 7.1 and screened high affinity and immunogenicity epitopes in vitro and in vivo assays. Furthermore, we optimized four B cell epitopes to design a novel DKK1 multiepitope DNA vaccine and evaluated its bone protective effects in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of RA. High level expression of the designed vaccine was measured in supernatant of COS7 cells. In addition, intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with this vaccine was also highly expressed and sufficient to induce the production of long-term IgG, which neutralized natural DKK1 in vivo. Importantly, this vaccine significantly attenuated bone erosion in CIA mice compared with positive control mice. These results provide evidence for the development of a DNA vaccine targeted against DKK1 to attenuate bone erosion.","Zhang, Xiaoqing; Liu, Sibo; Li, Shentao; Du, Yuxuan; Dou, Yunpeng; Li, Zhanguo; Yuan, Huihui; Zhao, Wenming",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4436448/,1
2138,Vaccination against type 1 angiotensin receptor prevents streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy,2015-09-26,"ABSTRACT: Recently, our group has developed a therapeutic hypertensive vaccine against angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor (AT1R) named ATRQβ-001. To explore its potential effectiveness on streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy, male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control and a diabetic model. After 1 week, the diabetic rats were divided into four subgroups (each with 15 rats) for 14-week treatments with saline, olmesartan, ATRQβ-001, and Qβ virus-like particle (VLP), respectively. In addition to lower blood pressure, ATRQβ-001 vaccination ameliorated biochemical parameter changes of renal dysfunction, mesangial expansion, and fibrosis through inhibiting oxidative stress, macrophage infiltration, and proinflammatory factor expression. Furthermore, ATRQβ-001 vaccination suppressed renal Ang II-AT1R activation and abrogated the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-Ang (1–7), similar to olmesartan treatment, while no obvious feedback activation of circulating or local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was only observed in vaccine group. In rat mesangial cells, the anti-ATR-001 antibody inhibited high glucose-induced transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF)-β1/Smad3 signal pathway. Additionally, no significant immune-mediated damage was detected in vaccinated animals. In conclusion, the ATRQβ-001 vaccine ameliorated streptozotocin-induced diabetic renal injury via modulating two RAS axes and inhibiting TGF-β1/Smad3 signal pathway, providing a novel, safe, and promising method to treat diabetic nephropathy. KEY MESSAGES: Overactivation of RAS plays a crucial role in the development of the DN. Our aim was to verify the effectiveness of ATRQβ-001 vaccine in STZ-induced DN. The ATRQβ-001 modulated two RAS axes and inhibited TGF-β1/Smad3 signal pathway. The vaccine therapy may provide a novel, safe, and promising method to treat DN.

2266,Development of a Rapid Point-of-Use DNA Test for the Screening of Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® Soybean in Seed Samples,2016-05-26,"Testing for the presence of genetically modified material in seed samples is of critical importance for all stakeholders in the agricultural industry, including growers, seed manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. While rapid antibody-based testing for the transgenic protein has fulfilled this need in the past, the introduction of new variants of a given transgene demands new diagnostic regimen that allows distinguishing different traits at the nucleic acid level. Although such molecular tests can be performed by PCR in the laboratory, their requirement for expensive equipment and sophisticated operation have prevented its uptake in point-of-use applications. A recently developed isothermal DNA amplification technique, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), combines simple sample preparation and amplification work-flow procedures with the use of minimal detection equipment in real time.

For all participants, TNF-α − 308 G > A and IFN-γ + 874 A > T genetic polymorphisms were characterized using the PCR technique. RESULTS: Cases with SLE showed a significantly higher TNF-α − 308 A allele carriage rate (AA + GA genotypes) compared to controls (26.4% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.009, OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.26–4.99). These cases showed also a significantly higher carriage rate for the IFN-γ + 874 T allele (AT + TT genotypes) compared to controls (47.2% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.02, OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.11–3.21). Comparing age, gender, and disease severity presented by nephritis class, activity and chronicity indices in cases carrying the TNF-α − 308 A allele and in cases carrying IFN-γ + 874 T allele versus others showed no significant difference (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TNF-α − 308 A and IFN-γ + 874 T allele carriage are associated with susceptibility but not severity of SLE in Egyptian subjects.","Al-Kholy, Wfaa; Elsaid, Afaf; Sleem, Aml; Fathy, Hend; Elshazli, Rami; Settin, Ahmad",Meta Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909826/,1
2525,Toxicogenomics analysis of mouse lung responses following exposure to titanium dioxide nanomaterials reveal their disease potential at high doses,2016-10-19,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) induce lung inflammation in experimental animals. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive toxicogenomic analysis of lung responses in mice exposed to six individual TiO(2)NPs exhibiting different sizes (8, 20 and 300nm), crystalline structure (anatase, rutile or anatase/rutile) and surface modifications (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) to investigate whether the mechanisms leading to TiO(2)NP-induced lung inflammation are property specific. A detailed histopathological analysis was conducted to investigate the long-term disease implications of acute exposure to TiO(2)NPs. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 18, 54, 162 or 486 µg of TiO(2)NPs/mouse via single intratracheal instillation. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium only. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were sampled on 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. Although all TiO(2)NPs induced lung inflammation as measured by the neutrophil influx in BALF, rutile-type TiO(2)NPs induced higher inflammation with the hydrophilic rutile TiO(2)NP showing the maximum increase. Accordingly, the rutile TiO(2)NPs induced higher number of differentially expressed genes. Histopathological analysis of lung sections on Day 90 post-exposure showed increased collagen staining and fibrosis-like changes following exposure to the rutile TiO(2)NPs at the highest dose tested. Among the anatase, the smallest TiO(2)NP of 8nm showed the maximum response. The anatase TiO(2)NP of 300nm was the least responsive of all. The results suggest that the severity of lung inflammation is property specific; however, the underlying mechanisms (genes and pathways perturbed) leading to inflammation were the same for all particle types. While the particle size clearly influenced the overall acute lung responses, a combination of small size, crystalline structure and hydrophilic surface contributed to the long-term pathological effects observed at the highest dose (486 µg/mouse). Although the dose at which the pathological changes were observed is considered physiologically high, the study highlights the disease potential of certain TiO(2)NPs of specific properties.","Rahman, Luna; Wu, Dongmei; Johnston, Michael; William, Andrew; Halappanavar, Sabina",Mutagenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5180171/,1
2625,Effects of school breaks on influenza-like illness incidence in a temperate Chinese region: an ecological study from 2008 to 2015,2017-03-06,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of winter/summer school breaks on occurrences of influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: We jointly analysed ILI surveillance data with the timing of school breaks in a temperate district in Beijing, China from 2008 to 2015. ILI incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of schoolchildren (5–14 and 15–24 years of age) to adults (25–59 and >60 years of age) were used to measure the age shift of ILI incidence before, during and after the 4-week winter/7-week summer breaks. Serfling-based Poisson regression model with adjustment for unmeasured confounders was built to further assess the effect of winter school breaks. RESULTS: ILI incidences were consistently lower during winter breaks than before winter breaks for all age groups. IRRs of younger schoolchildren aged 5–14 to adults were higher during winter school breaks than before breaks, while the opposite was true for the IRRs of older schoolchildren aged 15–24 to adults. Schoolchildren-to-adults IRRs during summer breaks were significantly lower than before or after school breaks (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both winter and summer breaks were associated with reductions of ILI incidences among schoolchildren and adults. Our study contributes additional evidence on the effects of school breaks on ILI incidence, suggesting school closure could be effective in controlling influenza transmission in developing countries.","Chu, Yanhui; Wu, Zhenyu; Ji, Jiayi; Sun, Jingyi; Sun, Xiaoyu; Qin, Guoyou; Qin, Jingning; Xiao, Zheng; Ren, Jian; Qin, Di; Zheng, Xueying; Wang, Xi-Ling",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5353286/,1
2806,Alterations in Gene Expression of Components of the Renin-Angiotensin System and Its Related Enzymes in Lung Cancer,2017-07-16,"OBJECTIVES: The study assessed the existence and significance of associations between the expression of fifteen renin-angiotensin system component genes and lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NCBI's built-in statistical tool, GEO2R, was used to calculate Student's t-tests for the associations found in a DNA expression study of adenocarcinoma and matched healthy lung tissue samples. The raw data was processed with GeneSpring™ and then used to generate figures with and without Sidak's multiple comparison correction. RESULTS: Ten genes were found to be significantly associated with adenocarcinoma. Seven of these associations remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Notably, AGTR2, which encodes the AT(2) angiotensin II receptor subtype, was significantly underexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue (p < 0.01). AGTR1, ACE, ENPEP, MME, and PRCP, which encode the AT(1) angiotensin II receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, aminopeptidase N, neprilysin, and prolylcarboxypeptidase, respectively, were also underexpressed. AGT, which encodes angiotensinogen, the angiotensin peptide precursor, was overexpressed in adenocarcinoma tissue. CONCLUSION: The results suggest an association between the expression of the genes for renin-angiotensin system-related proteins and adenocarcinoma. While further research is necessary to conclusively demonstrate a link between the renin-angiotensin system and lung cancers, the results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the pathology of adenocarcinoma.","Goldstein, Benjamin; Trivedi, Malav; Speth, Robert C.",Lung Cancer Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534309/,1
3347,Estimating the Asymptomatic Ratio of Norovirus Infection During Foodborne Outbreaks With Laboratory Testing in Japan,2018-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Foodborne norovirus outbreak data in Japan from 2005–2006, involving virological surveillance of all symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, were reanalyzed to estimate the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection along with the risk of infection and the probability of virus shedding. METHODS: Employing a statistical model that is considered to capture the data-generating process of the outbreak and virus surveillance, maximum likelihood estimation of the asymptomatic ratio was implemented. RESULTS: Assuming that all norovirus outbreaks (n = 55) were the result of random sampling from an identical distribution and ignoring genogroup and genotype specificities, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated at 32.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7–36.7). Although not significant, separate estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of the GII.4 genotype appeared to be greater than other genotypes and was estimated at 40.7% (95% CI, 32.8–49.0). CONCLUSION: The present study offered the first explicit empirical estimates of the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection in natural infection settings. The estimate of about 30% was consistent with those derived from volunteer challenge studies. Practical difficulty in controlling GII.4 outbreaks was supported by the data, considering that a large estimate of the asymptomatic ratio was obtained for the GII.4 genotype.","Miura, Fuminari; Matsuyama, Ryota; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6111106/,1
3410,Inflammasome: A Double-Edged Sword in Liver Diseases,2018-09-25,"Inflammasomes have emerged as critical innate sensors of host immune that defense against pathogen infection, metabolism syndrome, cellular stress and cancer metastasis in the liver. The assembly of inflammasome activates caspase-1, which promotes the maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), and initiates pyroptotic cell death (pyroptosis). IL-18 exerts pleiotropic effects on hepatic NK cells, priming FasL-mediated cytotoxicity, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent responses to prevent the development of liver diseases. However, considerable attention has been attracted to the pathogenic role of inflammasomes in various acute and chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, nanoparticle-induced liver injury, alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In this review, we summarize the latest advances on the physiological and pathological roles of inflammasomes for further development of inflammasome-based therapeutic strategies for human liver diseases.","Luan, Jingyun; Ju, Dianwen",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167446/,1
3771,Exercise in Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency: Harmful or Harmless? A Narrative Review,2019-04-04,"OBJECTIVES: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, theoretically, renders red blood cells (RBC) susceptible to oxidative stress. G6PD deficiency has also been found in other types of cells than RBC, such as leukocytes and myocytes, where an inefficient protection against oxidative stress may occur too. Glutathione (GSH), a significant antioxidant molecule, levels are lower in G6PD individuals, and theoretically, the probability of oxidative stress and haemolysis due to exercise in individuals with G6PD deficiency is increased, whereas dietary supplementation with antioxidants may have beneficial effects on various aspects of this enzymopathy. METHODS: A search of the available literature was conducted using the keywords glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), deficiency, disease, exercise, muscle, antioxidant, vitamin, supplement, and supplementation. The search was limited to publications in English, conducted on humans, and published until August 2018. After screening, only relevant articles were included. RESULTS: There is little evidence indicating that G6PD deficiency can cause perturbations in redox status, haemolysis, and clinical symptoms such as fatigability and myoglobinuria, especially after intense exercise, compared to individuals with normal enzyme levels. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise could be used by G6PD-deficient individuals as a tool to improve their quality of life. However, there is a lack of training studies, and assessment of the effects of regular and systematic exercise in G6PD-deficient individuals is warranted. Finally, since GSH levels are lower in G6PD deficiency, it would be interesting to examine the effects of antioxidant or cysteine donor supplements on redox status after exercise in these individuals.","Georgakouli, Kalliopi; Fatouros, Ioannis G.; Draganidis, Dimitrios; Papanikolaou, Konstantinos; Tsimeas, Panagiotis; Deli, Chariklia K.; Jamurtas, Athanasios Z.",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476018/,1
3998,Vaccination in Multiple Sclerosis: Friend or Foe?,2019-08-07,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease of the central nervous systems (CNS). Disease-modifying treatments (including immunosuppressive treatments) have shown positive effects on the disease course, but are associated with systemic consequences on the immune system and may increase the risk of infections and alter vaccine efficiency. Therefore, vaccination of MS patients is of major interest. Over the last years, vaccine hesitancy has steadily grown especially in Western countries, partly due to fear of sequelae arising from vaccination, especially neurological disorders. The interaction of vaccination and MS has been discussed for decades. In this review, we highlight the immunology of vaccination, provide a review of literature and discuss the clinical consideration of MS, vaccination and immunosuppression. In conclusion, there is consensus that MS cannot be caused by vaccines, neither by inactivated nor by live vaccines. However, particular attention should be paid to two aspects: First, in immunocompromised patients, live vaccines may lead to a stronger immune reaction with signs of the disease against which the patients have been vaccinated, albeit in weakened form. Second, protection provided by vaccination should be controlled in patients who have been vaccinated while receiving immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. In conclusion, there is evidence that systemic infections can worsen MS, thus vaccination will lower the risk of relapses by reducing the risk of infections. Therefore, vaccination should be in general recommended to MS patients.","Zrzavy, Tobias; Kollaritsch, Herwig; Rommer, Paulus S.; Boxberger, Nina; Loebermann, Micha; Wimmer, Isabella; Winkelmann, Alexander; Zettl, Uwe K.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6693409/,1
4010,Viral and bacterial pathogens identification in children hospitalised for severe pneumonia and parapneumonic empyema,2012-11-09,"Pneumonia is caused by respiratory bacteria and/or viruses. Little is known if co-infections are an aggravating factor in hospitalised children with severe pneumonia. We studied the impact of respiratory pathogens on the severity of pneumonia. Between 2007 and 2009, 52 children hospitalised with a well-documented diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with or without parapneumonic empyema (PPE), were enrolled in the study. The patients were classified into 2 groups: CAP + PPE (n = 28) and CAP (n = 24). The identification of respiratory viruses and bacteria in nasopharyngeal aspirates and pleural effusion samples were performed using conventional bacterial techniques and molecular assays. Using real-time multiplex PCR and antigen detection, Streptococcus pneumoniae was the main agent identified in 76% of the cases by molecular tests and BinaxNOW® in pleural fluid. A total of 8% of pleural fluid samples remained undiagnosed. In nasopharyngeal aspirates, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were detected in both CAP and CAP + PPE populations; however, the percentage of viral co-detection was significantly higher in nasopharyngeal aspirates from CAP + PPE patients (35%) compared with CAP patients (5%). In conclusion, viral co-detection was observed mainly in patients with more severe pneumonia. Molecular biology assays improved the pathogens detection in pneumonia and confirmed the S. pneumoniae detection by BinaxNOW® in pleural effusion samples. Interestingly, the main S. pneumoniae serotypes found in PPE are not the ones targeted by the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.","Telles, Jean-Noel; Richard, Nathalie; Gillet, Yves; Hartwig, Susanne; Pouzol, Stéphane; Dollet, Sandra; Messaoudi, Melina; Paredes, Elodie; Ploton, Christine; Lina, Gerard; Vernet, Guy; Floret, Daniel; Javouhey, Etienne; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia",Pneumonia (Nathan),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6707413/,1

A total of 400 farms were enrolled and followed during the study period. Among these, 109 farms submitted samples suspected for AI to the laboratory, and only 47 farms were confirmed positive by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) test. Data was collected from these 109 farms about their demography, management, and biosecurity practices. The cumulative incidence of H9N2 was 11.75 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 8.76–15.23). The highest number of cases (40.42 %) was reported in January. One most likely cluster (p = 0.009, radius = 4.61 km) occurred in the Kasur district. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the presence of wild birds on the farms (odds ratio (OR) = 16.18; 95 % CI 3.94–66.45) was independently associated with H9N2 infection. Cleaning of cages before delivery on farm (OR = 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.06–0.47), presence of a footbath at the entrance of farm (OR = 0.24; 95 % CI 0.08–0.79), and changing of gloves (OR = 0.33; 95 % CI 0.11–0.99) were protective factors against H9N2 infection.

6096,Brain renin angiotensin in disease,2008-04-02,"ABSTRACT: The highest incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is in southeast China, including Taiwan. Many side effects have been observed following radiation therapy with chemotherapy; hence, exploring new treatment modalities for NPC is an important future direction. Angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)] is an endogenous heptapeptide hormone and important component of the renin–angiotensin system that acts through both the Mas receptor and AT2 receptor, exhibiting anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties in cancer cells. However, the anti-cancer activity of Ang-(1–7) related to autophagy in NPC remains largely debated. The effects and signaling pathway(s) involved in the Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis in NPC were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Ang-(1–7) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC-TW01 cells. Ang-(1–7) induced autophagy by increasing the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and by enhancing p62 degradation via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathway with involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways in vitro study. In addition, pre-treatment with Ang-(1–7) inhibited tumor growth in NPC xenografts by inducing autophagy, suggesting a correlation between PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition and the abovementioned anti-cancer activities. However, no autophagy was observed following Ang-(1–7) post-treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that Ang-(1–7) plays a novel role in autophagy downstream signaling pathways in NPC, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for alleviation the incidence of NPC and preventive treatment of recurrent NPC. KEY MESSAGES: Ang-(1–7) inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by activating autophagy. Ang-(1–7)pre-treatment inhibits tumor growth via autophagy by suppressing PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Ang-(1–7) may provide a novel preventative treatment for NPC and recurrent NPC.

6542,Chloroquine relieves acute lung injury in rats with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing pancreatitis,2013-06-17,"In contrast to cardiovascular disease, the impact of nutritional status on the prevention and outcome of stroke has received limited investigation. We present a mechanism based on animal studies, clinical data, and epidemiological data by which protein-energy status in the acute stroke and immediate postinjury periods may affect outcome by regulating glutathione (GSH), a key component of antioxidant defense. As cysteine is the limiting amino acid for GSH synthesis, the GSH concentration of a number of nonneural tissues has been shown to be decreased by fasting, low-protein diets, or diets limiting in sulfur amino acids. The mechanism may also be relevant in brain since GSH in some brain regions is responsive to dietary sulfur amino acid supply and to the pro-cysteine drug, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate. The latter is an intracellular cysteine delivery system used to overcome the toxicity associated with cysteine supplementation. These findings may provide the mechanism to explain both the inverse correlation between dietary protein and stroke mortality and the documented association between suboptimal protein-energy status and diminished functional status following a stroke. Future investigations should examine the role of nutritional intervention in neuroprotective strategies aimed at improving stroke outcome. Pharmacological interventions such as L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate should be investigated in animal models of stroke, as well as the impact of nutritional status on the response to these agents. Finally, micronutrient deficiencies that may accompany protein-energy malnutrition, such as selenium, should also be investigated for their role in antioxidant defense in cerebral ischemia.","Paterson, Phyllis G.; Juurlink, Bernhard H.

This study aimed to analyze the clinical and laboratory characteristics of systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SoJIA) with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in 13 patients. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data of 13 SoJIA patients with MAS treated in our hospital from January 2003 to October 2007 were analyzed.

6815,Identification of complement-related host genetic risk factors associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outcome: challenges ahead,2018-10-10,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is an acute viral respiratory illness that causes high morbidity and mortality globally. Therapeutic actions are limited to vaccines and a few anti-viral drugs. Polygala (P.) japonica herba is rich in Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C(53)H(86)O(23)), used for acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections treatment in China. Hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. PSF was reported to have anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway. The action of PSF to alleviate pulmonary inflammation caused by influenza A virus (IAV) infection requires careful assessment. In the present study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of PSF on mice with pneumonia caused by influenza H1N1 (A/FM/1/47). METHODS: Mice were infected intranasally with fifteen 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD(50)) of influenza virus. BALB/c mice were treated with PSF or oseltamivir (oral administration) for 2 h post-infection and received concomitant treatment for 5 days after infection. On day 6 post-infection, 10 mice per group were killed to collect related samples, measure body weight and lung wet weight, and detect the viral load, cytokine, prostaglandins, pathological changes, and cell pathway protein expression in the lungs. In addition, the survival experiments were carried out to investigate the survival of mice. The expression profile of cell pathway proteins was detected and analyzed using a broad pathway antibody array and confirmed the findings from the array by western blotting. RESULTS: Polygalasaponin F and oseltamivir can protect against influenza viral infection in mice. PSF and oseltamivir significantly relieved the signs and symptoms, reduced body weight loss, and improved the survival rate of H1N1-infected mice. Moreover, PSF efficiently decreased the level of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-γ, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in lung tissues of mice infected with influenza virus (p < 0.05–0.01). Oseltamivir had a similar effect to lung cytokine of PSF, but did not decrease the levels of TXA(2) and PGE(2). There was a twofold or greater increase in four cell pathway protein, namely NF-κB p65 (2.68-fold), I-kappa-B-alpha (IκBα) (2.56-fold), and MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) (7.15-fold) assessed in the array induced by influenza virus. Western blotting showed that the expression of these proteins was significantly decreased in lung after influenza virus challenge in PSF and oseltamivir-treated mice (p < 0.05–0.01). CONCLUSION: Polygalasaponin F appears to be able to augment protection against IAV infection in mice via attenuation of pulmonary inflammatory responses. Its effect on IAV-induced pulmonary inflammation was associated with suppression of Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-κB expressions.","Ye, Yi; Wang, Huixian; Liu, Jinyuan; Zhao, Fang; Xu, Peiping",Inflammopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102181/,1

Significant co-morbidities and hemodynamic instability are often present, and routine critical care unit resuscitation may worsen hemodynamics and limit the chances of survival in patients with an already underlying poor prognosis. Right ventricular failure results from structural or functional processes that limit the right ventricle’s ability to maintain adequate cardiac output. It is commonly seen as the result of left heart failure, acute pulmonary embolism, progression or decompensation of pulmonary hypertension, sepsis, acute lung injury, or in the perioperative setting. Prompt recognition of the underlying cause and institution of treatment with a thorough understanding of the elements necessary to optimize preload, cardiac contractility, enhance systemic arterial perfusion, and reduce right ventricular afterload are of paramount importance. Moreover, the emergence of previously uncommon entities in patients with pulmonary hypertension (pregnancy, sepsis, liver disease, etc.) and the availability of modern devices to provide support pose additional challenges that must be addressed with an in-depth knowledge of this disease.","Coz Yataco, Angel; Aguinaga Meza, Melina; Buch, Ketan P.; Disselkamp, Margaret A.",Heart Fail Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102249/,1

We review diagnostic and therapeutic strategies employed in APS patients with DAH and discuss our experience in managing these complex patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Pulmonary capillaritis likely contributes to the pathogenesis, however is only observed in half of the biopsies. Corticosteroids induce remission in the majority of patients, however almost half recur and require a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive to maintain remission. Cyclophosphamide- or rituximab-based regimens achieve the highest remission rates (50%); other strategies include intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, and/or azathioprine. SUMMARY: Given the rarity of DAH in APS, treatment is guided by interdisciplinary experience. Why certain patients achieve full remission with corticosteroids while others require immunosuppressive agents is unknown; future research should focus on the pathophysiology and optimal management.","Stoots, Sarah Abramson; Lief, Lindsay; Erkan, Doruk",Curr Rheumatol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102334/,1

7161,"Role of Viruses in Acute Gastroenteritis in Infants and Young Children at Vellore, South India",1996-06-11,"To examine the potential roles of melatonin in Cd uptake, accumulation and detoxification in Malus plants, we exposed two different apple rootstocks varying greatly in Cd uptake and accumulation to either 0 or 30 μM Cd together with 0 or 100 μM melatonin. Cd stress stimulated endogenous melatonin production to a greater extent in the Cd-tolerant M. baccata than in the Cd-susceptible M. micromalus ‘qingzhoulinqin’. Melatonin application attenuated Cd-induced reductions in growth, photosynthesis, and enzyme activity, as well as ROS and MDA accumulation. Melatonin treatment more effectively restored photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments, and biomass in Cd-challenged M. micromalus ‘qingzhoulinqin’ than in Cd-stressed M. baccata. Exogenous melatonin lowered root Cd(2+) uptake, reduced leaf Cd accumulation, decreased Cd translocation factors (T(f)s), and increased root, stem, and leaf melatonin contents in both Cd-exposed rootstocks. Melatonin application increased both antioxidant concentrations and enzyme activities to scavenge Cd-induced ROS. Exogenous melatonin treatment altered the mRNA levels of several genes regulating Cd uptake, transport, and detoxification including HA7, NRAMP1, NRAMP3, HMA4, PCR2, NAS1, MT2, ABCC1, and MHX. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous melatonin reduced aerial parts Cd accumulation and mitigated Cd toxicity in Malus plants, probably due to the melatonin-mediated Cd allocation in tissues, and induction of antioxidant defense system and transcriptionally regulated key genes involved in detoxification.","He, Jiali; Zhuang, Xiaolei; Zhou, Jiangtao; Sun, Luyang; Wan, Huixue; Li, Huifeng; Lyu, Deguo",Tree Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107249/,1
7381,VIRAL INFECTION IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HLA-DR MATCHED CONTROLS,1986-04-11,"The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease. At present, no plague vaccines are available for use in the United States. One candidate for the development of a subunit vaccine is the Y. pestis virulence (V) antigen, a protein that mediates the function of the Yersinia outer protein virulence factors and suppresses inflammatory responses in the host. On the basis of the knowledge that adenovirus (Ad) gene-transfer vectors act as adjuvants in eliciting host immunity against the transgene they carry, we tested the hypothesis that a single administration of a replication-defective Ad gene-transfer vector encoding the Y. pestis V antigen (AdsecV) could stimulate strong protective immune responses without a requirement for repeat administration. AdsecV elicited specific T cell responses and high IgG titers in serum within 2 weeks after a single intramuscular immunization. Importantly, the mice were protected from a lethal intranasal challenge of Y. pestis CO92 from 4 weeks up to 6 months after immunization with a single intramuscular dose of AdsecV. These observations suggest that an Ad gene-transfer vector expressing V antigen is a candidate for development of an effective anti-plague vaccine","Chiuchiolo, Maria J.; Boyer, Julie L.; Krause, Anja; Senina, Svetlana; Hackett, Neil R.; Crystal, Ronald G.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109909/,1

In the present study, a novel method, known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), is described for the rapid and specific detection of the species, using a primer set derived from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene. Amplification products can be detected macroscopically by visual inspection in vials using SYBR Green I as well as by electrophoresis on agarose gel. The LAMP assay resulted in specific amplification of P. marneffei ITS using pure cultures after a 1-h reaction at 65 °C in a water bath; no cross-reactivity with other fungi including other biverticillate penicillia was observed. The detectable DNA limit was two copies. In addition, specific amplification was achieved using paraffin wax-embedded tissue samples from patients with penicilliosis marneffei and tissue samples from bamboo rats. The method provides a powerful tool for rapid diagnostics in the clinical lab, and has potential for use in ecological studies.","Sun, Jiufeng; Li, Xiqing; Zeng, Hanxiang; Xie, Zhi; Lu, Changming; Xi, Liyan; de Hoog, Gert S.",FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110349/,1

Eighty exacerbations in 54 patients were studied. Exacerbations associated with influenza (n=8) were compared with those associated with other nonbacterial infections (n=15) and those in which no nonbacterial infection was detected (n=57). Patients with influenza had lower Shwachman scores and were more likely to be seroposifive for C-reactive protein than patients in the other two groups. Patients with influenza had lower Shwachman scores and were more likely to be seropositive for C-reactive protein than patients in the other two groups. Patients with influenza had a mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second of 26%, compared with test results obtained before the exacerbation. In contrast, the mean decrease in forced expiratory volume per second was 6% for other nonbacterial infections and 12% for the group without nonbacterial infection (p<0.05 for both comparisons). The forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity decreased 44% in the influenza group compared with 13% and 17% in the other two groups, respectively (p<0.01 for both comparisons). The influenza group also had a higher proportion of patients with at least a 20% decrease in forced expiratory volume per second and forced expiratory flow in first 25% of vital capacity than the other two groups had (p<0.05 for all comparisons). These data suggest that influenza is associated with severe exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis and support recommendations for efforts to prevent influenza in this population.","Pribble, Charles G.; Black, Philip G.; Bosso, John A.; Turner, Ronald B.",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130847/,1

Here we report an expert system, which utilizes this knowledge base, for predicting localization sites of proteins only from the information on the amino acid sequence and the source origin. We collected data for 401 eukaryotic proteins with known localization sites (subcellular and extracellular) and divided them into training data and testing data. Fourteen localization sites were distinguished for animal cells and 17 for plant cells. When sorting signals were not well characterized experimentally, various sequence features were computationally derived from the training data. It was found that 66% of the training data and 59% of the testing data were correctly predicted by our expert system.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was transmitted to 6‐day‐old piglets by dosing with homogenates of muscle and lymph node collected from 500 clinically normal pigs at the time of slaughter. All piglets in 2 separately housed litters showed clinical signs of TGE with 5 piglets dying within 10 d of oral dosing with homogenates. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was isolated from 2 of these piglets and all piglets developed TGE antibody. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was not isolated in tissue culture from muscle and lymph node homogenates, but was isolated from 4 (0.8%) of 500 tonsil samples collected from the same pigs. A survey of 250 serum samples provided an estimate of the prevalence of slaughtered pigs with TGE antibody of 34.8% in the sample population. The results indicate that carcases of some pigs from TGE endemic areas contain viable TGE virus, and that there would be a substantial risk of introducing TGE virus into Australia by the importation of uncooked pig meat from these areas.","COOK, DR; HILL, HT; TAYLOR, JD",Aust Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159502/,1

We aimed to describe the distribution of RV species and associations between RV species and clinical features in children hospitalized with clinically severe pneumonia (CSP) in Morocco. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were collected from 700 children, 2–59 months of age, admitted with CSP to the Hôpital d'Enfants de Rabat in Morocco. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 92% of children, of which RV was the most common (53%). PCR assays, sequencing, and phylogenetic tree analyses were carried out on 183 RV‐positive NPAs to determine RV species and genotypes. Of 157 successfully genotyped NPAs, 60 (38.2%) were RV‐A, 8 (5.1%) were RV‐B, and 89 (56.7%) were RV‐C. Wheezing and cyanosis were more common in RV‐C‐positive than RV‐A‐positive children (80.9% vs. 56.7%; P = 0.001 for wheezing and 10.1% vs. 0%; P = 0.011 for cyanosis). Physician's discharge diagnosis of pneumonia was more frequent among RV‐A‐positive (40.0%) than RV‐C‐positive children (20.2%; P = 0.009). RV‐A and RV‐C showed distinct seasonal patterns.

10819,Physiology in Medicine: Understanding dynamic alveolar physiology to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury,2017-06-01,"BACKGROUND: China is the second highest pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) burden country worldwide. However, retreatment of PTB has often developed resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs. The cure rate (approximately 50.0–73.3%) and management of retreatment of PTB in China needs to be improved. Qinbudan decoction has been widely used to treat PTB in China since the 1960s. Previously clinical studies have shown that the Qinbudan tablet (QBDT) promoted sputum-culture negative conversion and lesion absorption. However, powerful evidence from a randomized controlled clinical trial is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of QBDT as an adjunct therapy for retreatment of PTB. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in China. People diagnosed with PTB were enrolled who received previous anti-TB treatment from April 2011 to March 2013. The treatment group received an anti-TB regimen and QBDT, and the control group was administered an anti-TB regimen plus placebo. Anti-TB treatment options included isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin for 2 months (2HRZES), followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months (6HRE), daily for 8 months. Primary outcome was sputum-culture conversion using the MGIT 960 liquid medium method. Secondary outcomes included lung lesion absorption and cavity closure. Adverse events and reactions were observed after treatment. A structured questionnaire was used to record demographic information and clinical symptoms of all subjects. Data analysis was performed by SPSS 25.0 software in the full analysis set (FAS) population. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one cases of retreatment PTB were randomly divided into two groups: the placebo group (88 cases) and the QBDT group (93 cases). A total of 166 patients completed the trial and 15 patients lost to follow-up. The culture conversion rate of the QBDT group and placebo group did not show a noticeable improvement by using the covariate sites to correct the rate differences (79.6% vs 69.3%; rate difference = 0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.02–0.23; F = 2.48, P = 0.12) after treatment. A significant 16.6% increase in lesion absorption was observed in the QBDT group when compared with the placebo group (67.7% vs 51.1%; rate difference = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.02–0.31; χ(2) = 5.56, P = 0.02). The intervention and placebo group did not differ in terms of cavity closure (25.5% vs 21.1%; rate difference = 0.04, 95% CI: - 0.21–0.12; χ(2) = 0.27, P = 0.60). Two patients who received chemotherapy and combined QBDT reported pruritus/nausea and vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: No significant improvement in culture conversion was observed for retreatment PTB with traditional Chinese medicine plus standard anti-TB regimen. However, QBDT as an adjunct therapy significantly promoted lesion absorption, thereby reducing lung injury due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.

Here, CXCR2 expression on granulocyte and macrophage progenitor cells (GMPs) was found to participate in myeloid cell differentiation within the tumor environment. In CXCR2-deficient tumor-bearing mice, GMPs exhibited fewer macrophage and dendritic cell progenitor cells than wild-type tumor-bearing mice, thereby decreasing monocytic MDSCs (mo-MDSCs) expansion. CXCR2 deficiency increased SAP18 expression in tumor-bearing mice, which reduced STAT3 phosphorylation through restraining ERK1/2 activation. Our findings reveal a critical role for CXCR2 in regulating hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation under tumor conditions, and SAP18 is a key negative regulator in this process. Thus, inhibiting CXCR2 expression may alter the tumor microenvironment and attenuate tumor progression.","Han, Xiaoqing; Shi, Huifang; Sun, Yingying; Shang, Chao; Luan, Tao; Wang, Dake; Ba, Xueqing; Zeng, Xianlu",Cell Death Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687752/,1

Type 5 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu5) receptors might be particularly important. They are critically involved in synaptic plasticity and their availability has been reported to be lower in people with alcohol, tobacco, and cocaine use disorders. Since these reductions could reflect effects of drug use or pre-existing traits, we used positron emission tomography to measure mGlu5 receptor availability in young adults at elevated risk for addictions. Fifty-nine participants (age 18.5 ± 0.6) were recruited from a longitudinal study that has followed them since birth. Based on externalizing traits that predict future substance use problems, half were at low risk, half were at high risk. Cannabis use histories varied markedly and participants were divided into three subgroups: zero, low, and high use. Compared to low risk volunteers, those at elevated risk had lower [(11)C]ABP688 binding potential (BP(ND)) values in the striatum, amygdala, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Cannabis use by risk group interactions were observed in the striatum and OFC. In these regions, low [(11)C]ABP688 BP(ND) values were only seen in the high risk group that used high quantities of cannabis. When these high risk, high cannabis use individuals were compared to all other participants, [(11)C]ABP688 BP(ND) values were lower in the striatum, OFC, and insula. Together, these results provide evidence that mGlu5 receptor availability is low in youth at elevated risk for addictions, particularly those who frequently use cannabis.","Cox, Sylvia M.

In addition, the emergence of community support options via information and communication technologies such as Skype and Facetime, social media (e.g., Facebook), and telelactation providers are providing mothers with a new range of support options that can help bridge geographic barriers to traditional community support. However, telelactation services that use information and communication technologies to connect breastfeeding mothers to remotely located breastfeeding experts require reliable, affordable, high-quality broadband connections to facilitate interaction between mothers and their support resources.

In essence, the topology of a network can reveal the impact a drug candidate may have on a given biological state, leading the way for enhanced disease characterization and the design of advanced therapies. Network-based approaches, in particular, are highly suited for these purposes as they hold the capacity to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. Here, we present drug2ways, a novel methodology that leverages multimodal causal networks for predicting drug candidates. Drug2ways implements an efficient algorithm which reasons over causal paths in large-scale biological networks to propose drug candidates for a given disease. We validate our approach using clinical trial information and demonstrate how drug2ways can be used for multiple applications to identify: i) single-target drug candidates, ii) candidates with polypharmacological properties that can optimize multiple targets, and iii) candidates for combination therapy. Finally, we make drug2ways available to the scientific community as a Python package that enables conducting these applications on multiple standard network formats.","Rivas-Barragan, Daniel; Mubeen, Sarah; Guim Bernat, Francesc; Hofmann-Apitius, Martin; Domingo-Fernández, Daniel",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735677/,1

Here, we identify and characterize their inhibitory properties against human cathepsins B and L, potent, ubiquitously expressed cysteine peptidases involved in protein turnover and homeostasis, as well as pathological conditions, such as cancer. We show that CAPE and CGA inhibit both peptidases, while CA shows a preference for cathepsin B, resulting in the strongest inhibition among these combinations. All compounds are linear (complete) inhibitors acting via mixed or catalytic mechanisms. Cathepsin B is more strongly inhibited at pH 7.4 than at 5.5, and CA inhibits its endopeptidase activity preferentially over its peptidyl-dipeptidase activity. Altogether, the results identify the CA scaffold as a promising candidate for the development of cathepsin B inhibitors, specifically targeting its endopeptidase activity associated with pathological proteolysis of extracellular substrates.","Ulčakar, Liza; Novinec, Marko",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824550/,1

Bluetongue in cattle is associated with vesicular lesions, weight loss, low milk production, and low reproductive capacity. It should not be ignored as it is associated with large economic losses to the livestock breeding industry in China. Although many studies have investigated bluetongue virus infection in cattle, no nationwide study on the prevalence of bluetongue virus infection in cattle from China has yet been conducted. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors for bluetongue in cattle. Results: We collected 50 publications from 1988 to 2019 through PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese journal database, and Wanfang database. A total of the pooled bluetongue seroprevalence of 12.2% (5,332/87,472) in cattle was tested. The point estimate of bluetongue collected from 2001 to 2011 was 22.5% (95% CI: 1.2–58.9), which was higher than after 2012 (9.9%, 95% CI: 3.3–19.4). The analysis of the feeding model subgroup revealed that the seroprevalence of bluetongue was significantly higher (P < 0.05) among free-range cattle (22.5%; 95% CI: 7.7–42.3) than among cattle from intensive farming systems (1.8%; 95% CI: 0.0–6.7). The seroprevalence of bluetongue in different species showed significant variation (P < 0.05), with the highest seroprevalence of 39.8% (95% CI: 18.7–63.0) in buffalo and the lowest seroprevalence of 4.3% (95% CI: 1.2–9.0) in yak. In the zoogeographical division subgroup, the seroprevalence of bluetongue correlated positively within a certain range with the species distribution of Culicoides. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that bluetongue was prevalent in cattle in China. In addition, the contact with sheep, other ruminants, or transmission media such as Culicoides may increase the seroprevalence of bluetongue disease in cattle. It is necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the bluetongue seroprevalence. Moreover, comprehensive and improved strategies and measures should be implemented to prevent and control the spread of bluetongue.","Gong, Qing-Long; Wang, Qi; Yang, Xue-Yao; Li, Dong-Li; Zhao, Bo; Ge, Gui-Yang; Zong, Ying; Li, Jian-Ming; Leng, Xue; Shi, Kun; Liu, Fei; Du, Rui",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901971/,1

However, rational synthesis of such materials with good conductivity and electrochemical activity is the topical challenge for high-performance devices. Here, SnO(2)/graphene nanocomposite is taken as a typical example and develops a universal synthesis method that overcome these challenges and prepares the oxygen-deficient SnO(2) hollow nanospheres/graphene (r-SnO(2)/GN) nanocomposite with excellent performance for supercapacitors and gas sensors. The electrode r-SnO(2)/GN exhibits specific capacitance of 947.4 F g(−1) at a current density of 2 mA cm(−2) and of 640.0 F g(−1) even at 20 mA cm(−2), showing remarkable rate capability. For gas-sensing application, the sensor r-SnO(2)/GN showed good sensitivity (~13.8 under 500 ppm) and short response/recovering time toward methane gas. These performance features make r-SnO(2)/GN nanocomposite a promising candidate for high-performance energy storage devices and gas sensors.","Lin, Liyang; Chen, Susu; Deng, Tao; Zeng, Wen",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912979/,1
15971,Differences in clinical severity of respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children,2021-03-04,"At the inception of human brain mapping, two principles of functional anatomy underwrote most conceptions—and analyses—of distributed brain responses: namely, functional segregation and integration. There are currently two main approaches to characterizing functional integration. The first is a mechanistic modeling of connectomics in terms of directed effective connectivity that mediates neuronal message passing and dynamics on neuronal circuits. The second phenomenological approach usually characterizes undirected functional connectivity (i.e., measurable correlations), in terms of intrinsic brain networks, self-organized criticality, dynamical instability, and so on. This paper describes a treatment of effective connectivity that speaks to the emergence of intrinsic brain networks and critical dynamics. It is predicated on the notion of Markov blankets that play a fundamental role in the self-organization of far from equilibrium systems. Using the apparatus of the renormalization group, we show that much of the phenomenology found in network neuroscience is an emergent property of a particular partition of neuronal states, over progressively coarser scales. As such, it offers a way of linking dynamics on directed graphs to the phenomenology of intrinsic brain networks.","Friston, Karl J.; Fagerholm, Erik D.; Zarghami, Tahereh S.; Parr, Thomas; Hipólito, Inês; Magrou, Loïc; Razi, Adeel",Netw Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935044/,1

However, their rate of use in German psychiatric inpatient routine care is low. The current study aimed to investigate the attitude of mental health care professionals working in inpatient care regarding internet-delivered interventions, including presumed benefits, barriers and facilitators. In total, 176 health professionals from ten inpatient psychiatric hospitals throughout Germany were surveyed on site. The professionals’ attitude towards internet-delivered interventions in inpatient care was assessed by an adapted version of the ‘Attitude toward Telemedicine in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy’ (ATTiP) questionnaire. To identify benefits, barriers and facilitators, we developed open-response questions that were based on the ‘Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology’ (UTAUT) and analyzed by a qualitative content analysis. Professionals reported little experience or knowledge about internet-delivered interventions. Their attitude towards internet-delivered interventions in psychiatric inpatient care was rather indifferent. The most frequently mentioned potential benefits were an optimised treatment structure and patient empowerment; the most frequently anticipated barriers were too severe symptoms of patients, the feared neglect of face-to-face contacts and insufficient technical equipment; and the most frequently mentioned facilitators were high usability of the internet-based intervention, a sufficient functional level of the patient and further education of staff. For successful implementation in the inpatient sector, internet-delivered interventions must be adapted to the special needs of severely mentally ill patients and to the hospital management systems and workflow. In addition, technical preconditions (internet access, devices) must be met. Last, further education of mental health care professionals is needed.

16245,GOECP/SEOR radiotherapy guidelines for small-cell lung cancer,2021-03-24,"OBJECTIVE: The American Diabetes Association and the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommend monitoring blood glucose (BG) every 1-2 hours in patients receiving insulin infusion to guide titration of insulin infusion to maintain serum glucose in the target range; however, this is based on weak evidence. We evaluated the compliance of hourly BG monitoring and relation of less frequent BG monitoring to glycemic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review performed on 56 consecutive adult patients who received intravenous insulin infusion for persistent hyperglycemia in the ICU at Saint Vincent Hospital, a tertiary care community hospital an urban setting in Northeast region of USA. The frequency of fingerstick blood glucose (FSBG) readings was reviewed for compliance with hourly FSBG monitoring per protocol and the impact of FSBG testing at different time intervals on the glycemic status. Depending on time interval of FSBG monitoring, the data was divided into three groups: Group A (<90 min), Group B (91-179 min) and Group C (≥180 min). RESULTS: The mean age was 69 years (48% were males), 77% patients had preexisting type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mean MPM II score was 41. Of the 1411 readings for BG monitoring on insulin infusion, 467 (33%) were in group A, 806 (57%) in group B and 138 (10%) in group C; hourly BG monitoring compliance was 12.6%. The overall glycemic status was similar among all groups. There were 14 (0.99%) hypoglycemic episodes observed. The rate of hypoglycemic episodes was similar in all three groups (p=0.55). CONCLUSION: In patients requiring insulin infusion for sustained hyperglycemia in ICU, the risk of hypoglycemic episodes was not significantly different with less frequent BG monitoring. The compliance to hourly blood glucose monitoring and ICU was variable, and hypoglycemic episodes were similar across the groups despite the variation in monitoring. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The importance of glycemic control in ICU has been well established and it is a resource intensive venture. However, there are no major studies highlighting the most optimal time interval for blood glucose checks in critically ill patients on insulin infusion. With this study we hypothesize that time duration between blood glucose checks can be increased safely without any untoward effects. Our study provides evidence for effective resource management with reducing the time spent with every glucose check and directly translating into high value care.","Lal, Amos; Haque, Nurul; Lee, Jennifer; Katta, Sai Ramya; Maranda, Louise; George, Susan; Trivedi, Nitin",Acta Biomed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975947/,1
16891,Abstracts of the 10th Virtual Conseuro 2021 Congress,2021-04-22,"Early and successful extubation prevents several morbidities in preterm newborns. Several secondary non-invasive respiratory modalities exist but with their merits and demerits. Given the benefits of nasal high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (nHFOV), we tried to examine whether nHFOV could reduce reintubation rates compared to nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) during the post-extubation phase in preterm infants. Stratified randomisation based on gestational age was done for 86 mechanically ventilated preterm infants between 26 and 36(+6) weeks of gestation within 2 weeks of age to receive either nHFOV or NIPPV post-extubation. The main objective was to compare extubation failure within 72 h following extubation and secondarily feed intolerance, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (> grade 3), composite bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)/mortality, composite duration of oxygen supplementation/ventilation support and SpO2/FiO2 ratio. No statistical difference was noted for primary outcome (RR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.23 to 2.78; p = 1.00) and secondary outcomes. However, nHFOV appeared possibly better in respect to feed tolerance rates and pCO2 washout. Conclusion: Extubation failure within 72 h in infants less than 37 weeks of gestation did not differ between the two groups. However, nHFOV seems promising in reducing enteral feeding issues and pCO2 elimination. Larger multicentre studies are required for exploring benefits of nHFOV.

18350,Can we use mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for COVID-19 patients in puerperium period?,2021-05-28,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Influenza cause a large burden of disease. Evidence of their interaction via temporary cross-protection implies that prevention of one could inadvertently lead to an increase in the burden of the other. However, evidence for the public health impact of such interaction is sparse and largely derives from ecological analyses of peak shifts in surveillance data. To test the robustness of estimates of interaction parameters between RSV and Influenza from surveillance data we conducted a simulation and back-inference study. We developed a two-pathogen interaction model, parameterised to simulate RSV and Influenza epidemiology in the UK. Using the infection model in combination with a surveillance-like stochastic observation process we generated a range of possible RSV and Influenza trajectories and then used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to back-infer parameters including those describing competition. We find that in most scenarios both the strength and duration of RSV and Influenza interaction could be estimated from the simulated surveillance data reasonably well. However, the robustness of inference declined towards the extremes of the plausible parameter ranges, with misleading results. It was for instance not possible to tell the difference between low/moderate interaction and no interaction. In conclusion, our results illustrate that in a plausible parameter range, the strength of RSV and Influenza interaction can be estimated from a single season of high-quality surveillance data but also highlights the importance to test parameter identifiability a priori in such situations.","Waterlow, Naomi R.; Flasche, Stefan; Minter, Amanda; Eggo, Rosalind M.",Epidemics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193815/,1
18367,Novel CD123 polyaptamer hydrogel edited by Cas9/sgRNA for AML-targeted therapy,2021-06-12,"Rationale: Hosts defend against viral infection by sensing viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns and activating antiviral innate immunity through TBK1-IRF3 signaling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Methods: SiRNAs targeting Sirt1-7 were transfected into macrophages to screen the antiviral function. Sirt5 deficient mice or macrophages were subjected to viral infection to assess in vivo and in vitro function of Sirt5 by detecting cytokines, viral replicates and survival rate. Immunoprecipitation, WesternBlot and luciferase reporter assay were used to reveal molecular mechanism. Results: In this study, we functionally screened seven Sirtuin family members, and found that Sirtuin5 (Sirt5) promotes antiviral signaling and responses. Sirt5 deficiency leads to attenuated antiviral innate immunity in vivo and in vitro upon viral infection by decreasing TBK1-IRF3 activation and type I IFN production. Sirt5 overexpression increased antiviral innate immunity. Mechanism investigation revealed that Sirt5 interacts with DDX3 and demalonylates DDX3, which is critical for TBK1-IRF3 activation. Mutation of the demalonylation lysine sites (K66, K130, and K162) of DDX3 increased ifnβ transcription. Furthermore, the acetylation on lysine 118 of DDX3 positively regulated ifnβ transcription, whereas Sirt5 could not deacetylate this site. Conclusion: Sirt5 promotes anti- RNA and DNA virus innate immune responses by increasing TBK1 signaling through demalonylating DDX3, which identifies a novel regulatory pathway of antiviral innate immune response.","He, Xingying; Li, Tianliang; Qin, Kewei; Luo, Shiyuan; Li, Zhenjie; Ji, Qingqing; Song, Honghao; He, Huyang; Tang, Hao; Han, Chaofeng; Li, Hongjiao; Luo, Yan",Theranostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8210596/,1
18465,Calprotectin: An Ignored Biomarker of Neutrophilia in Pediatric Respiratory Diseases,2021-05-21,"There has been a great deal of interest in bovine colostrum within sports nutrition over the last 25 years. Studies have investigated the effects on body composition, physical performance, recovery, gut damage and permeability, immune function, and illness risk. This narrative review considers available evidence in each of these areas. Although some studies have shown protection against performance decrements caused by periods of intensified training, there is limited evidence for effects on body composition and physical performance. There is stronger evidence for benefit on gut permeability and damage markers and on immune function and illness risk, especially during periods of intensified training. The balance of available evidence for gut permeability and illness risk is positive, but further research is required to fully determine all mechanisms responsible for these effects. Early suggestions that supplementation with bovine colostrum products could increase systemic IGF-1 levels are not supported by the balance of available evidence examining a range of doses over both short- and long-term periods. Nevertheless, dose–response studies would be valuable for determining the minimum efficacious dose, although this is complicated by variability in bioactivity between products, making any dose–response findings applicable only to the specific products used in such studies.","Davison, Glen",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225123/,1

Although it is well established that direct admission to hospital at home from the community as a substitute for hospital care provides superior outcomes and lower cost, the effectiveness of transfer hospital at home—that is, completing hospitalization at home—is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of the transfer component of a Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital in Home program (T-HIH), taking advantage of natural geographical limitations in a program’s service area. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this quality improvement study, T-HIH was offered to veterans residing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and their outcomes were compared with those of propensity-matched veterans residing in adjacent Camden, New Jersey, who were admitted to the VA hospital from 2012 to 2018. Data analysis was performed from October 2019 to May 2020. INTERVENTION: Enrollment in the T-HIH program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were hospital length of stay, 30-day and 90-day readmissions, VA direct costs, combined VA and Medicare costs, mortality, 90-day nursing home use, and days at home after hospital discharge. An intent-to-treat analysis of cost and utilization was performed. RESULTS: A total of 405 veterans (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [0.83] years; 399 men [98.5%]) with medically complex conditions, primarily congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (mean [SD] hierarchical condition categories score, 3.54 [0.16]), were enrolled. Ten participants could not be matched, so analyses were performed for 395 veterans (all of whom were men), 98 in the T-HIH group and 297 in the control group. For patients in the T-HIH group compared with the control group, length of stay was 20% lower (6.1 vs 7.7 days; difference, 1.6 days; 95% CI, −3.77 to 0.61 days), VA costs were 20% lower (−$5910; 95% CI, −$13 049 to $1229), combined VA and Medicare costs were 22% lower (−$7002; 95% CI, −$14 314 to $309), readmission rates were similar (23.7% vs 23.0%), the numbers of nursing home days were significantly fewer (0.92 vs 7.45 days; difference, −6.5 days; 95% CI, −12.1 to −0.96 days; P = .02), and the number of days at home was 18% higher (81.4 vs 68.8 days; difference, 12.6 days; 95% CI, 3.12 to 22.08 days; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, T-HIH was significantly associated with increased days at home and less nursing home use but was not associated with increased health care system costs.","Cai, Shubing; Intrator, Orna; Chan, Caitlin; Buxbaum, Laurence; Haggerty, Mary Ann; Phibbs, Ciaran S.; Schwab, Edna; Kinosian, Bruce",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243231/,1

Citation-related publication productivity metrics, such as the h-index, are increasingly used for hiring, salary, grants, retention, promotion, and tenure decisions. Exploring sex differences in these metrics across academic medicine provides deeper insight into why differences are observed in career outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the available literature on sex differences in h-index of academic faculty physicians across all medical specialties and all levels of academic rank. DATA SOURCES: Medical literature with the term h-index found in PubMed and published between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, was used. STUDY SELECTION: A PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes), PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses), and MOOSE (Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) selection protocol was used to find observational studies that published h-indexes for faculty physicians that were stratified by sex. Studies were excluded if they were review articles, retracted, or unavailable online. Ultimately, 14 of 786 studies (1.78%) met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data from 9 studies across 16 specialties were examined using weighted random-effects meta-analyses. Five studies were excluded because of overlapping specialties with another study or because they were missing appropriate statistics for the meta-analysis. Four of these studies were included in qualitative synthesis to bring the total to 13 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary study outcome was the h-index. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 10 665 North American unique academic physicians across 9 different studies from the years 2009 to 2018. Of the 10 665 physicians, 2655 (24.89%) were women. Summary effect sizes for mean h-indexes of men and women and mean h-index difference between men and women were determined for all faculty physicians and at each academic rank. Overall, female faculty had lower h-indexes than male faculty (mean difference, −4.09; 95% CI, −5.44 to −2.73; P < .001). When adjusting for academic rank, female faculty still had lower h-indexes than male faculty at the ranks of assistant professor (mean difference, −1.3; 95% CI, −1.90 to −0.72; P < .001), associate professor (mean difference, −2.09; 95% CI, −3.40 to −0.78; P = .002), and professor (mean difference, −3.41; 95% CI, −6.24 to −0.58; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, women had lower h-indexes than men across most specialties and at all academic ranks, but it is unclear why these differences exist. These findings suggest that future investigation should be conducted regarding the causes of lower h-indexes in women and that interventions should be developed to provide a more equitable environment for all physicians regardless of sex.","Ha, Giang L.; Lehrer, Eric J.; Wang, Ming; Holliday, Emma; Jagsi, Reshma; Zaorsky, Nicholas G.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8243235/,1
19097,An Extended Approach to Predict Retinopathy in Diabetic Patients Using the Genetic Algorithm and Fuzzy C-Means,2021-06-26,"Cigarette smoke (CS) is the main etiological factor in the pathogenesis of emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is associated with abnormal epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Previously, we have shown an association among circadian rhythms, CS-induced lung inflammation, and nuclear heme receptor α (REV-ERBα), acting as an antiinflammatory target in both pulmonary epithelial cells and fibroblasts. We hypothesized that molecular clock REV-ERBα plays an important role in CS-induced circadian dysfunction and EMT alteration. C57BL/6J WT and REV-ERBα heterozygous (Het) and –KO mice were exposed to CS for 30 days (subchronic) and 4 months (chronic), and WT mice were exposed to CS for 10 days with or without REV-ERBα agonist (SR9009) administration. Subchronic/chronic CS exposure caused circadian disruption and dysregulated EMT in the lungs of WT and REV-ERBα–KO mice; both circadian and EMT dysregulation were exaggerated in the REV-ERBα–KO condition. REV-ERBα agonist, SR9009 treatment reduced acute CS-induced inflammatory response and abnormal EMT in the lungs. Moreover, REV-ERBα agonist (GSK4112) inhibited TGF-β/CS–induced fibroblast differentiation in human fetal lung fibroblast 1 (HFL-1). Thus, CS-induced circadian gene alterations and EMT activation are mediated through a Rev-erbα–dependent mechanism, which suggests activation of REV-ERBα as a novel therapeutic approach for smoking-induced chronic inflammatory lung diseases.","Wang, Qixin; Sundar, Isaac K.; Lucas, Joseph H.; Muthumalage, Thivanka; Rahman, Irfan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8262497/,1
19182,The immunoregulatory function of peripheral blood CD71(+) erythroid cells in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis,2021-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Primary headache disorders are common and burdensome conditions. They are associated to several comorbidities, such as cardiovascular or psychiatric ones, which, in turn, contribute to the global burden of headache. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive description of the pooled prevalence of comorbidities of primary headache disorders using a meta-analytical approach based on studies published between 2000 and 2020. METHODS: Scopus was searched for primary research (clinical and population studies) in which medical comorbidities were described in adults with primary headache disorders. Comorbidities were extracted using a taxonomy derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. We compared prevalence of comorbidities among headache sufferers against general population using GBD-2019 estimates, and compared comorbidities’ proportions in clinical vs. population studies, and by age and gender. RESULTS: A total of 139 studies reporting information on 4.19 million subjects with primary headaches were included: in total 2.75 million comorbidities were reported (median per subject 0.64, interquartile range 0.32–1.07). The most frequently addressed comorbidities were: depressive disorders, addressed in 51 studies (pooled proportion 23 %, 95 % CI 20–26 %); hypertension, addressed in 48 studies (pooled proportion 24 %, 95 % CI 22–26 %); anxiety disorders addressed in 40 studies (pooled proportion 25 %, 95 % CI 22–28 %). For conditions such as anxiety, depression and back pain, prevalence among headache sufferers was higher than in GBD-2109 estimates. Associations with average age and female prevalence within studies showed that hypertension was more frequent in studies with higher age and less females, whereas fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, and depressive disorders were more frequent in studies with younger age and more female. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the most relevant comorbidities of primary headache disorders – back pain, anxiety and depression, diabetes, ischemic heart disease and stroke – are among the most burdensome conditions, together with headache themselves, according to the GBD study. A joint treatment of headaches and of these comorbidities may positively impact on headache sufferers’ health status and contribute to reduce the impact of a group of highly burdensome diseases.

First, to accurately predict China’s solar PV installed capacity, this paper proposes a multi-factor installed capacity prediction model based on bidirectional long short-term memory-grey relation analysis. The results show that, the MAPE value of the GRA-LSTM combined model established in this paper is 5.995, compared with the prediction results of other models, the prediction accuracy of the GRA-BiLSTM model is higher. Second, the BiLSTM model is used to forecast China’s installed solar PV capacity from 2020 to 2035.

20277,The Elk1/MMP-9 axis regulates E-cadherin and occludin in ventilator-induced lung injury,2021-08-23,"Endometrial stem/progenitor cells have been proved to exist in periodically regenerated female endometrium and can be divided into three categories: endometrial epithelial stem/progenitor cells, CD140b(+)CD146(+) or SUSD2(+) endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs), and side population cells (SPs). Endometrial stem/progenitor cells in the menstruation blood are defined as menstrual stem cells (MenSCs). Due to their abundant sources, excellent proliferation, and autotransplantation capabilities, MenSCs are ideal candidates for cell-based therapy in regenerative medicine, inflammation, and immune-related diseases. Endometrial stem/progenitor cells also participate in the occurrence and development of endometriosis by entering the pelvic cavity from retrograde menstruation and becoming overreactive under certain conditions to form new glands and stroma through clonal expansion. Additionally, the limited bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMDSCs) in blood circulation can be recruited and infiltrated into the lesion sites, leading to the establishment of deep invasive endometriosis. On the other hand, cell derived from endometriosis may also enter the blood circulation to form circulating endometrial cells (CECs) with stem cell-like properties, and to migrate and implant into distant tissues. In this manuscript, by reviewing the available literature, we outlined the characteristics of endometrial stem/progenitor cells and summarized their roles in immunoregulation, regenerative medicine, and endometriosis, through which to provide some novel therapeutic strategies for reproductive and cancerous diseases.","Kong, Yue; Shao, Yang; Ren, Chunxia; Yang, Gong",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8383353/,1

Exploring spatial and temporal variation of residential land prices and the effect of land market factors on residential land prices can help the government formulate targeted regulations and policies. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal evolution of residential land prices and the factors influencing the land market in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region based on land transaction data from 2014–2017 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results show the following: ① Residential land prices in Beijing and Tianjin are significantly higher than those in other regions, while Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and western mountainous areas have the lowest residential land prices. Over time, a development trend of residential land price polycentricity gradually emerged, and the locational correlation has gradually increased. ② Under the influence of the land finance model of local governments in China, three factors, namely, the land stock utilization rate, revenue from residential land transfers, and the growth of residential land transaction areas, have significantly contributed to the increase in residential land prices. ③ Under the land market supply and demand mechanism and government management, four indicators, namely, the land supply rate, the per capita residential land supply area, the degree of marketization of the residential land supply, and the frequency of residential land transactions, have suppressed the rise in residential land prices. ④ The overall effect of land market factors on residential land prices in the central and northern regions of Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei is stronger than that in the southern regions, which may be related to the more active land market and stricter macromanagement policies in Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas.","An, Pengfei; Li, Can; Duan, Yajing; Ge, Jingfeng; Feng, Xiaomiao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8409656/,1

However, the number of discoveries of new bioactive compounds decreases since decades. New procedures (e.g., activating strategies or innovative fermentation techniques) were developed to enhance the productivity of actinomycetes. Nevertheless, compound identification remains challenging among others due to high rediscovery rates. Rapid and cheap genome sequencing as well as the advent of bioinformatical analysis tools for biosynthetic gene cluster identification in combination with mass spectrometry-based molecular networking facilitated the tedious process of dereplication. In recent years several studies have been dedicated to accessing the biosynthetic potential of Actinomyces species, especially streptomycetes, by using integrated genomic and metabolomic screening in order to boost the discovery rate of new antibiotics. This review aims to present the various possible applications of this approach as well as the newly discovered molecules, covering studies between 2014 and 2021.

Despite their widespread use, they are rare opportunistic pathogens responsible for a high proportion of Saccharomyces mycosis cases. The potential virulence attributes of S. ‘boulardii’ as well as its interactions with the human immune system have been studied, however, no information is available on how these yeasts may change due to in-host evolution. To fill this gap, we compared the general phenotypic characteristics, cell morphology, virulence factors, epithelial and immunological interactions, and pathogenicity of four probiotic product samples, two mycosis, and eight non-mycosis samples of S. ‘boulardii’. We assessed the characteristics related to major steps of yeast infections. Mycosis and non-mycosis isolates both displayed novel characters when compared to the product isolates, but in the case of most virulence factors and in pathogenicity, differences were negligible or, surprisingly, the yeasts from products showed elevated levels. No isolates inflicted considerable damage to the epithelial model or bore the hallmarks of immune evasion. Our results show that strains in probiotic products possess characteristics that enable them to act as pathogens upon permissive conditions, and their entry into the bloodstream is not due to active mechanisms but depends on the host. Survival in the host is dependent on yeast phenotypic characteristics which may change in many ways once they start evolving in the host. These facts call attention to the shortcomings of virulence phenotyping in yeast research, and the need for a more thorough assessment of probiotic use.","Imre, Alexandra; Kovács, Renátó; Pázmándi, Kitti; Nemes, Dániel; Jakab, Ágnes; Fekete, Tünde; Rácz, Hanna Viktória; Dóczi, Ilona; Bácskay, Ildikó; Gácser, Attila; Kovács, Károly; Majoros, László; Farkas, Zoltán; Pócsi, István; Pfliegler, Walter P.",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472476/,1

For the purpose of vaccine manufacturing, suspension cells are preferred over adherent ones due to simplified sub-cultivation and an easier scale-up process, both of which could significantly reduce production cost. This study aimed to establish a procedure for the culture of BoHV-1 in the suspended MDBK cell line in serum-free medium. We screened several commercially available serum-free media and chose ST503 for subsequent experiments. We successfully adapted the adherent MDBK cells to suspended growth in ST503 in the absence of serum. The maximum density of suspension-adapted MDBK cells could reach 2.5 × 10(7) cells/mL in ST503 medium with optimal conditions. The average size of suspension-adapted cells increased to 18 ± 1 µm from 16 ± 1 µm. Moreover, we examined tumorigenicity of the suspended cells and found no sign of tumorigenicity post adaptation. Next, we developed a protocol for the culture of BoHV-1 in the cell line described above and found that ultrasonic treatment could facilitate virus release and enhance virus yield by 11-fold, with the virus titer reaching 8.0 ± 0.2 log(10)TCID(50)/mL. Most importantly, the prototype inactivated BoHV-1 vaccine we generated using the suspension cultures of MDBK cells induced neutralizing antibodies to a titer comparable to that of the commercial inactivated BoHV-1 vaccine. Overall, we established and optimized a protocol for the production of inactivated BoHV-1 vaccine in MDBK cells adapted for suspension culture, which provides insights for future large-scale manufacturing of BoHV-1 vaccine.","Wang, Pengpeng; Huang, Shulin; Hao, Chengwu; Wang, Zhanhui; Zhao, Haoran; Liu, Mengyao; Tian, Xinrui; Ge, Letu; Wu, Wenxue; Peng, Chen",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473029/,1

24692,Otitis Media and Sinusitis,2009,"Over the past years, biodiversity has been reduced on an unprecedented scale, while new infectious diseases are emerging at an increasing rate. Greater overall biodiversity could lead to a greater diversity of hosts and thus of pathogens. Yet disease regulation – due to the buffering role of host diversity – is considered to be one of the services provided by biodiversity. In this chapter, we ask how biodiversity is linked to infectious disease. First, we investigate the influence of the biodiversity of pathogens. We highlight that the number of pathogen species is not well known but that new findings are facilitated by the rapid expansion of molecular techniques. We show that, although there is a trend to find higher pathogen richness toward the equator, identifying a global pattern between the richness of all pathogen species and their latitudinal distribution is challenging. We emphasize that pathogen intraspecific diversity is a crucial factor in disease emergence and allows pathogens to adapt to the selective pressures they face. In addition, the selective pressure acting on hosts due to parasite, and reinforced by parasite diversity within hosts seems to be a major evolutionary and ecological force shaping hosts biodiversity. Second, we investigate how the diversity of hosts influences infectious disease ecology. For multi-host diseases, a change in host species richness or abundance can modify the dynamics of local infectious diseases by either reducing (“dilution effect”) or increasing (“amplification effect”) the risk of transmission to the targeted host species. The underlying hypothesis is that, the competence of reservoirs varies according to the host species. The dilution effect has been demonstrated mainly through theoretical work and there have been only few case studies. Regarding the genetic diversity of host, an important issue is: to what extent does a reduction of this diversity impact the ability of the host population to response to infectious diseases? Third, we rapidly examine the role of biodiversity in the treatment of infectious diseases. To conclude, we consider that the consequences of the loss of species biodiversity on infectious diseases is still largely unknown, notably due to the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of host-pathogen relationships, especially at the population and at the community level.. We highlight that work on multi-host/ ulti-pathogen systems should be fostered and that new approaches, such as metagenomic investigations that does not require a priori assumptions, are promising to describe a community of pathogens and their interactions.","Vourc’h, Gwenaël; Plantard, Olivier; Morand, Serge",New Frontiers of Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121084/,1

Healthcare workers are also at risk of acquiring nosocomial viral infections, affecting their own health, as well as facilitating spread of the infection to other patients, their family, and the community. Healthcare-associated viral infections may occur in a variety of healthcare settings, including clinics, emergency centers, urgent care centers, procedure suites, operating rooms, hospital wards, nurseries, and intensive care units. In addition, non-patient care areas, such as the cafeteria, waiting areas, and playrooms may also be a source of viral infections that can spread in the healthcare setting. These infections may be device-related or transmitted via blood products or organ donation and respiratory droplets, through food including human milk, person to person, or via air ducts, fomites, and surfaces. They most commonly involve the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; however, all organ systems may potentially be involved. Both DNA and RNA viruses, either common or exotic, may contribute to healthcare-associated viral infections. Advances in molecular viral diagnostics have enabled rapid detection and routine surveillance for viral infections and now allow early identification of viruses. Prompt identification allows timely containment measures to minimize transmission to other patients or healthcare workers and avoids hospital, community, and global outbreaks.","Demmler-Harrison, Gail J.",Healthcare-Associated Infections in Children,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121921/,1

The risk of SARS reemergence in humans remains high due to the large animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-like coronavirus and the genome instability of RNA coronaviruses. An epidemic in 2003 affected more than 8,000 patients in 29 countries, with 10% mortality. SARS infection is transmitted by air droplets. Clinical and laboratory manifestations include fever, chills, rigor, myalgia, malaise, diarrhea, cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatine kinase activities. Health care workers are a high-risk group, and advanced age is strongly associated with disease severity. Treatment has been empirical, and there is no licensed SARS vaccine for humans so far. However, presence of long-lived neutralizing antibodies and memory T- and B-lymphocytes in convalescent SARS patients raises hope for active immunization. Furthermore, results from preclinical SARS vaccines expressing spike protein to elicit neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses that are protective in mouse and nonhuman primate models are encouraging. Very little is known of the early events in viral clearance and the onset of innate and inflammatory responses during the SARS infection. Regulation of the innate immune response is associated with the development of adaptive immunity and disease severity in SARS infection. Notably, SARS-CoV has evolved evasive strategies to suppress antiviral type I interferon responses in infected cells. In addition, inflammatory responses are characterized by upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as IL-6, IP-10, and MCP-1 in tissues and serum, and massive infiltrations of inflammatory cells such as macrophages in infected tissues. Due to the lack of animal models that mimic the clinical manifestations of human SARS infection for mechanistic study and vaccine evaluation, development of a safe prophylactic SARS vaccine for human use remains a huge challenge. This chapter is written to summarize and highlight the latest clinical, serological, and immunological parameters relevant to the pathogenesis and protective immunity of SARS infection in humans.","Li, Chris Ka-fai; Xu, Xiaoning",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123234/,1
26468,Therapeutic Strategies for DLI: How Should DLI Be Treated?,2017-06-01,"Proteins are important biomolecules, extensively involved in almost all biological processes. A number of proteins are also implicated in infectious diseases. Bacterial proteins used in adhesion to host epithelium, bacterial toxins, and viral membrane glycoproteins are some of the proteins involved in infectious diseases. Even components of the host innate immune system like Toll-like receptors and Nod-like receptors and adaptive immune components like immunoglobulins aiding in defense against pathogens are important biological proteins. Chaperones like acid and heat shock proteins provide protection from high temperatures, metabolic poisons, and other stressful conditions. Several natural and artificial proteins are components of vaccines, a key strategy to control fatal diseases, lacking empirical treatment. It is necessary to investigate these proteins, to develop new biomedical tools and technologies, aiding in eradication of various diseases. Thus, further research should be carried out in this field, for saving and improving quality of human lives.","Ranjan, Prabhat; Dey, Asmita; Sharma, Vinod Praveen; Tiwari, Neeraj Kumar",Biomedical Applications of Natural Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123379/,1

This multistep process is initiated by specific binding interactions between glycoproteins in the viral envelope and appropriate receptors on the cell surface. In the case of HIV-1, attachment of virions to the cell surface is attributed to a high affinity interaction between envelope spike glycoproteins (Env, composed of the surface protein gp120 and the transmembrane protein gp41) and a complex made of the primary CD4 receptor and a seven-transmembrane co-receptor (e.g., CXCR4 or CCR5) (reviewed in [1]). Then a chain of dynamic events take place that enable the viral nucleocapsid to penetrate within the target cell following the destabilization of membrane microenvironment and the formation of a fusion pore.","Pöhlmann, Stefan; Tremblay, Michel J.",Entry Inhibitors in HIV Therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123856/,1

In this work, we propose an information-driven adaptive model, where disease and disease information can evolve simultaneously. For the information-driven adaptive process, susceptible (infected) individuals who have abilities to recognize the disease would break the links of their infected (susceptible) neighbors to prevent the epidemic from further spreading. Simulation results and numerical analyses based on the pairwise approach indicate that the information-driven adaptive process can not only slow down the speed of epidemic spreading, but can also diminish the epidemic prevalence at the final state significantly. In addition, the disease spreading and information diffusion pattern on the lattice as well as on a real-world network give visual representations about how the disease is trapped into an isolated field with the information-driven adaptive process. Furthermore, we perform the local bifurcation analysis on four types of dynamical regions, including healthy, a continuous dynamic behavior, bistable and endemic, to understand the evolution of the observed dynamical behaviors. This work may shed some lights on understanding how information affects human activities on responding to epidemic spreading.","Zhan, Xiu-Xiu; Liu, Chuang; Sun, Gui-Quan; Zhang, Zi-Ke",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126912/,1

31094,CHAPTER 9: Viral pneumonia,2006-08-01,"A field study was performed in which bioaerosols were sampled at a field site undergoing land placement of anaerobically digested, de‐watered biosolid material. The data from these field studies were then used to generate microbial release rates from the biosolids for use in modeling bioaerosol transport. Continuous‐point sources represented by large biosolid piles (temporary storage before placement) in the field, and continuous‐area sources represented by large fields upon which biosolids were placed by spraying, were modeled using microbial transport models; and downwind microbial concentrations were generated. These quantified transport data were then entered into microbial dose‐response models in an attempt to characterize the risk of pathogenic bacteria and viruses infecting workers and nearby population centers. The risk of viral and bacterial infection to workers at biosolid land application sites is 3:100 and 2:100, respectively, under 2‐m/s wind conditions and 1 hr of exposure. The route of exposure proposed in this model is the transport, inhalation, deposition, and swallowing of bacterial or viral pathogens. Note that these risk models by nature would tend to overestimate the actual risk to populations (wastewater workers) consisting primarily of immunocompetent individuals. Under these low‐wind conditions, nearby population centers where such immunocompetent populations may exist (here considered to be 10 000 m from the land application sites) are predicted to be at little risk (1.95 × 10(−):100) of infection from aerosolized bacteria and at no risk from aerosolized viruses.","Dowd, Scot E.; Gerba, Charles P.; Pepper, Ian L.; Pillai, Suresh D.",J Environ Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167141/,1

The acoustic pressure in far field is predicted using the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings analogy implemented in the libAcoustics library based on the OpenFOAM software package. The determined properties of the flow and acoustic fields are compared with experimental data. The flow structures are characterized by the development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability waves, which lead to energy outflux in the radial direction. Their further growth is accompanied by the formation of large and small-scale eddies leading to the generation of acoustic noise. The results showed that for selected jets the highest levels of generated noise is obtained at angles around 30° which agrees well with experimental data.","Epikhin, Andrey; Kraposhin, Matvey",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304686/,1

The final goal is to predict the peak of the epidemic outbreak per country with a reliable technique. The difference to other modelling approaches is to stay extremely close to the available data, using as few hypotheses and parameters as possible. For the convenience of readers, the basic notions of modelling epidemics are collected first, focusing on the standard SIR model. Proofs of various properties of the model are included. But such models are not directly compatible with available data. Therefore a special variation of a SIR model is presented that directly works with the data provided by the Johns Hopkins University. It allows to monitor the registered part of the pandemic, but is unable to deal with the hidden part. To reconstruct data for the unregistered Infected, a second model uses current experimental values of the infection fatality rate and a data-driven estimation of a specific form of the recovery rate. All other ingredients are data-driven as well. This model allows predictions of infection peaks. Various examples of predictions are provided for illustration. They show what countries have to face that are still expecting their infection peak. Running the model on earlier data shows how closely the predictions follow the transition from an uncontrolled outbreak to the mitigation situation by non-pharmaceutical interventions like contact restrictions.

Under sum of squares (SOS) relaxation, the problem of barrier certificate generation is equivalent to that of solving a bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) with a particular type. The paper reveals the special feature of the problem, and adopts it to build a novel computational method. The proposed method introduces a sequential iterative scheme that is able to find analytical solutions, rather than the nonlinear solving procedure to produce numerical solutions used by general BMI solvers and thus is more efficient than them. In addition, different from popular LMI solving based methods, it does not make the verification conditions more conservative, and thus reduces the risk of missing feasible solutions. Benefitting from these two appealing features, it can produce barrier certificates not amenable to existing methods, which is supported by a complexity analysis as well as the experiment on some benchmarks.","Chen, Xin; Peng, Chao; Lin, Wang; Yang, Zhengfeng; Zhang, Yifang; Li, Xuandong",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363221/,1

Aerosols are small particles suspended in the atmosphere which affects the air quality. The concentration and characteristics of the atmospheric aerosols can vary from place to place. Aerosols are major constituents for the formation of haze and thus responsible for degradation in the satellite images. During the novel corona virus disease pandemic (COVID-19) countrywide lockdown in India, aerosols level significantly lowered in the north Indian cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain. In this paper, an analysis of image quality was done for Sentinel-2A/2B satellite images for different north Indian cities with respect to the impact of aerosols on image sharpness and surface reflectance values during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period. The image quality of the images was evaluated through the power spectrum, gradient, and reflectance values in the image. It was observed that the sharpness of the satellite images increased during the lockdown period due to the reduction in aerosols levels in the atmosphere. There was an increase in the power spectrum values from 5% (minimum) to 12% (maximum) in the blue band, 4% (minimum) to 10% (maximum) in the green band, and 1.7% (minimum) to 6% (maximum) in the red band in the satellite images of major cities in the Indo-Gangetic plain during the lockdown period. Since haze is an additive component in the images, thus it was also observed that surface reflectance values had decreased in visible bands for the features which have low surface reflectance values like water (30%), vegetation (21%) and barren land (17%) and surface reflectance values had increased in visible bands for the features which have high surface reflectance values like building (19%) during the lockdown period.","Joshi, Ashish; Agrawal, Shefali; Chauhan, Prakash",J Indian Soc Remote Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522456/,1

Similar to other biometrics such as face, iris and fingerprints, ear also has a large amount of specific and unique features that allow for person identification. In this current worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 situation, most of the face identification systems fail due to the mask wearing scenario. The human ear is a perfect source of data for passive person identification as it does not involve the cooperativeness of the human whom we are trying to recognize and the structure of ear does not change drastically over time. Acquisition of a human ear is also easy as the ear is visible even in the mask wearing scenarios. Ear biometric system can complement the other biometric systems in automatic human recognition system and provides identity cues when the other system information is unreliable or even unavailable. In this work, we propose a six layer deep convolutional neural network architecture for ear recognition. The potential efficiency of the deep network is tested on IITD-II ear dataset and AMI ear dataset. The deep network model achieves a recognition rate of 97.36% and 96.99% for the IITD-II dataset and AMI dataset respectively. The robustness of the proposed system is validated in uncontrolled environment using AMI Ear dataset.

In response to this, and in an effort to continue sharing and advancing knowledge in spine surgery, a multi-institutional collaboration formed a “virtual” spine educational platform. METHODS: Our group, consisting of five spinal neurosurgeons and one neuroradiologist, formed an online platform called the Virtual Global Spine Conference (VGSC). A website was created and maintained by the Weill Cornell Neurosurgery Department, and biweekly, Zoom meetings were established where prominent spine physicians from various specialties would deliver case-based presentations on spine and spine surgery related conditions at no cost to the participants. The “faculty hosts” coordinated the speakers, promotion and delivery of the program. All sessions are recorded and archived online. RESULTS: In less than one month, over 1000 surgeons, trainees and other specialists signed up for the program, with a continuous rate of 50–100 new registrants per week. Each session draws an audience of 200–300 participants. An early survey to the participants indicated that 94% would like this program to continue post-COVID. CONCLUSION: The early success of the Virtual Global Spine Conference is a reflection of the continued interest in spine education despite the COVID pandemic. There is widespread opinion, backed by our own survey results, that many want to see “virtual” education continue post-pandemic. The future goals of VGSC are to continue to deliver high-quality sessions led by prominent surgeons and other specialists, to better engage and collaborate with national organizations, and to collect long-term, granular data to better assess effectiveness and quality of this program.","Baaj, Ali A; Than, Khoi D; Gibbs, Wende; Baum, Griffin R; Rasouli, Jonathan J; Shin, John H",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717396/,1

Optimization is one form of analysis. We argue that in many cases it may be better to replace the optimization problem with the satisficing problem, where instead of searching for optimal solutions, the goal is to search for solutions that adhere to a given threshold bound. This work defines and investigates the satisficing problem on a two-player graph game with the discounted-sum cost model. We show that while the satisficing problem can be solved using numerical methods just like the optimization problem, this approach does not render compelling benefits over optimization. When the discount factor is, however, an integer, we present another approach to satisficing, which is purely based on automata methods. We show that this approach is algorithmically more performant – both theoretically and empirically – and demonstrates the broader applicability of satisficing over optimization.","Bansal, Suguman; Chatterjee, Krishnendu; Vardi, Moshe Y.",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979197/,1

They include: the nature of the president’s supporters, including their supposed “racial resentment” and the nature and reality of their powerful emotional connections of respect and standing linking them with Trump. We then turn to TrumpThink—a magical mystery tour reflecting how Trump understands his world, full of unexpected associative detours, logical lane changing, and surprisingly clear reconnection to his original train of thought. TrumpTalk shares those qualities. It is often meandering, frequently exaggerated, regularly provocative, and honestly heartfelt if rarely fact-check level “correct.” We then take up the issue of TrumpTruth—how he uses facts and tweets—the president’s serial imprecise relationship with “the Truth,” including “larger Truths”; and promise keeping as a strategy for his reelection.","Renshon, Stanley",The Real Psychology of the Trump Presidency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991529/,1

Using a multivariate analysis of turnout figures at the district and country levels, this research note explores if ballot box and Internet voters differ in their electoral participation patterns. It concludes that turnout must be understood based on the voting modality that French voters choose. While the characteristics of the electoral district (community size, geographical, and historical proximity with France, and party competition) impact ballot box voter turnout, Internet voter turnout is most influenced by the host country’s economic and infrastructure development.","Dandoy, Régis; Kernalegenn, Tudi",Fr Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8091990/,1

This article provides an updated narrative review on the management of septic shock in paediatric practice. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed using the following Medical Subject Headings: “sepsis”, “septic shock” and “systemic inflammatory response syndrome”. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies and reviews. The search was limited to the English literature and specific to children. RESULTS: Septic shock is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The outcome can be improved if the diagnosis is made promptly and treatment initiated without delay. Early treatment with antimicrobial therapy, fluid therapy and vasoactive medications, and rapid recognition of the source of sepsis and control are the key recommendations from paediatric sepsis management guidelines. CONCLUSION: Most of the current paediatric sepsis guideline recommendations are based on the adult population; therefore, the research gaps in paediatric sepsis management should be addressed.","Hon, Kam Lun; Leung, Karen Ka Yan; Oberender, Felix; Leung, Alexander KC",Drugs Context,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177956/,1

It is opportunistic in nature and causes hospital acquired infections. Subtractive proteomics and reverse vaccinology approaches were employed to screen out the best proteins for vaccine designing. Whole proteome of K. oxytoca strain ATCC 8724, consisting of 5483 proteins, was used for designing the vaccine. Total 1670 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope were predicted through NetCTL while 1270 helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were predicted through IEDB server. The epitopes were screened for non-toxicity, allergenicity, antigenicity and water solubility. After epitope screening 300 CTL and 250 HTL epitopes were submitted to IFN-γ epitope server to predict their Interferon-γ induction response. The selected IFN-γ positive epitopes were tested for their binding affinity with MHCI-DRB1 by MHCPred. The 15 CTL and 13 HTL epitopes were joined by linkers AAY and GPGPG respectively in vaccine construct. Chain C of Pam3CSK4 (PDB ID; 2Z7X) was linked to the vaccine construct as an adjuvant. A 450aa long vaccine construct was submitted to I-TASSER server for 3D structure prediction. Thirteen Linear B cells were predicted by ABCPred server and 10 sets of discontinues epitopes for 3D vaccine structure were predicted by DiscoTope server. The modeled 3D vaccine construct was docked with human Toll-like receptor 2 (PDB ID: 6NIG) by PatchDock. The docked complexes were refined by FireDock. The selected docked complex showed five hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge. The vaccine sequence was reverse transcribed to get nucleotide sequence for In silico cloning.

59415,Contributions From the Pulmonary Pathology Society: Selected Topics on Nonneoplastic Diseases.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: Peer-based exercise interventions that cultivate new opportunities for support with a fellow cancer survivor may result in increased exercise volume. It is not clear whether adding qualified exercise professional (QEP) support to peer-based interventions improves health outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether breast cancer survivor (BCS) dyads who receive 10 weekly sessions of virtually delivered QEP support have improved outcomes compared to BCS dyads who do not receive QEP support. METHODS: Participants Adult BCS with medical clearance for exercise, who have an internet-connected device, and currently engage in < 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Intervention BCS will be matched using evidence-based criteria. The intervention group will receive dyadic exercise information sessions and a program tailored by a QEP for 10 weeks (intervention period) and have access to the QEP for an additional 4 weeks (tapering period). The control will not receive any QEP support. Outcomes The primary outcome is post-intervention self-reported exercise volume. Secondary outcomes include device-assessed exercise volume (i.e., Fitbit), social support, and health-related quality of life. Randomization 108 participants, matched in dyads, will be randomized 1:1 to the MatchQEP or Match groups using a web-based scheme. Statistical analysis Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, post-tapering, and at 12 weeks post-intervention follow-up. DISCUSSION: The findings from this RCT will determine if matched BCS dyads who receive 10 weeks of virtually delivered QEP support have higher levels of self-report and device-measured exercise, social support, and health related quality of life compared to matched dyads without QEP-delivered exercise guidance. To our knowledge this will be the first study to assess the combined effect of peer- and QEP support on exercise volume. Project findings will inform and optimize intervention methods aimed to increase exercise among BCS through accessible exercise supports.

59418,2nd ESMO Consensus Conference on Lung Cancer: non-small-cell lung cancer first-line/second and further lines of treatment in advanced disease.,2014,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the requirement for a more sophisticated healthcare system and real-time data analytics in the pandemic mitigation process. Moreover, real-time data plays a crucial role in the detection and alerting process. Combining smart healthcare systems with accurate real-time information about medical service availability, vaccination, and how the pandemic is spreading can directly affect the quality of life and economy. The existing architecture models are become inadequate in handling the pandemic mitigation process using real-time data. The present models are server-centric and controlled by a single party, where the management of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data is doubtful. Therefore, a decentralised user-centric model is necessary, where the CIA of user data is assured. In this paper, we have suggested a decentralized blockchain-based pandemic detection and assistance system (iBlock). The iBlock uses robust technologies like hybrid computing and IPFS to support system functionality. A pseudo-anonymous personal identity is introduced using H-PCS and cryptography for anonymous data sharing. The distributed data management module guarantees data CIA, security, and privacy using cryptography mechanisms. Furthermore, it delivers useful intelligent information in the form of suggestions and alerts to assist the users. Finally, the iBlock reduces stress on healthcare infrastructure and workers by providing accurate predictions and early warnings using AI/ML.","Egala, Bhaskara S.; Pradhan, Ashok K.; Badarla, Venkataramana; Mohanty, Saraju P.",J Signal Process Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515159/,1

As the availability of dosing algorithms, tools, and platforms increases, so do the investment in technology services and actual implementation of clinical services offering these solutions to patients. Nowhere is this needed more than in pediatric populations, which are still reliant on adult drug development and bridging strategies to support dosing, often in the absence of actual dose-finding studies in the target pediatric population. Still, there is more work to be done to ensure that proper governance of these services is maintained, and that sustainability of these early implementations is guided by new science as it evolves and meaningful outcome data to confirm that such services deliver on both clinical and economic return on investment. In addition, the field should ensure that all approaches beyond a therapeutic drug monitoring-driven, pharmacokinetic-centric approach should be considered as the tools and services evolve, especially when pediatric-specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodyamic and pharmacogenetic data are available and shown to be useful to guide dosing. This review evaluates current pediatric precision dosing efforts, highlighting their utility, longevity, and sustainability and assesses the current process for implementing such approaches examining current barriers that stand in the way of broader implementation and the stakeholders that must engage to ensure its ultimate success.","Barrett, Jeffrey S; Barrett, Ryan F; Vinks, Alexander A",Journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185896/,1

60176,Microstructural Integrity of Salvaged Penumbra after Mechanical Thrombectomy.,2019-12-19,"BACKGROUND Unilateral diaphragm paralysis (UDP) may potentially worsen sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Unilateral diaphragm paralysis has been associated with proximal brachial plexus blockade, such as interscalene and supraclavicular block. The impact of UDP in patients with SDB is not known in this context. The objectives of this scoping review were to explore the associations between UDP and worsening SDB severity, oxygenation, and pulmonary function. METHODS A systematic search was developed, peer-reviewed, and applied to Embase, Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases to include studies involving adult patients (≥ 18 yr) with SDB, where the effects of UDP on SDB severity, oxygenation, and pulmonary function were examined. RESULTS Six studies (n = 100 patients) with UDP and SDB were included. The sample population was derived exclusively from respirology-sleep clinics, and none were surgical patients. Compared with control (no UDP), UDP was associated with an increased respiratory disturbance index, most pronounced during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and supine sleep. Supine and REM sleep were associated with obstructive and mixed (both obstructive and central) events, respectively. Compared with control, UDP was associated with a lower mean and minimum oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen tension during all sleep stages and in all body positions. The majority of UDP patients were found to have clinically significant reductions in mean forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity values, consistent with restrictive ventilatory pattern. CONCLUSION We observed an association between UDP and increasing SDB severity, particularly during REM sleep and while sleeping in the supine position. Although we identified weaknesses in study design and lack of perioperative data, anesthesiologists should be aware of this association when considering proximal brachial plexus blockade in patients with SDB.","Singh, Mandeep; Mejia, Jorge M; Auckley, Dennis; Abdallah, Faraj; Li, Christopher; Kumar, Vivek; Englesakis, Marina; Brull, Richard",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-021-01970-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725316/,1

Peer education is a proven and effective approach for promoting reproductive health among young people, especially HIV/AIDS education. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a peer-led education intervention in addressing sexual and reproductive health related knowledge and concerns among young people in Kaduna and Kano States, northwest Nigeria. METHODS A pre and post-test study was conducted among 8930 young people aged 15-24 years who participated in the MTV Shuga Peer Education intervention selected from communities in Kaduna and Kano States. A baseline pre-test was conducted before the education program, and it was followed up with a post-test at the end of the five-day long peer education sessions. RESULTS Majority of the respondents, 7846 (87.9%) were adolescents aged 15-19 years while the rest 1084 (12.1%) were young adults aged 20-24 years. A total of 6099 (68.3%) of the respondents correctly stated that condoms prevent pregnancy during the pre-test compared to 6429 (72.0%) peers during the post test. Lower abdominal pain was correctly indicated as a symptom of STI by 6282 (70.3%) and 6984 (78.2%) of the respondents at pre-test and post-test respectively. More males (58.5%) had good knowledge about condom use compared to the females, 51.9% (χ2 = 24.62, p < 0.001). while more females (79.6%) compared to 74.7% males opined that going for HIV test with their sexual partner is important to them during the pre-test (χ2 = 19.44, p≤ 0.001).However, no significant difference was observed on knowledge of condom use and opinion on going for HIV testing with sexual partner among either gender at post-test. CONCLUSION Significant positive changes in knowledge, views and opinions regarding STIs and HIV, HIV anti-stigma and the use of condoms were observed following exposure to the peer sessions of the MTV Shuga peer education intervention. Sustained exposure and access to informative and enlightening peer education sessions over time have the potential to comprehensively improve SRH knowledge, influence positive opinion change and in turn adoption of positive behaviours among young people.","Akuiyibo, Selema; Anyanti, Jennifer; Idogho, Omokhudu; Piot, Sara; Amoo, Babatunde; Nwankwo, Nelson; Anosike, Nnamdi",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01251-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641895/,1

DESIGN Scoping review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and grey references including ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception to 3 August 2021. STUDY SELECTION All human trials in the English language related to sedation in paediatric critically ill patients were included. After title and abstract screening, full-text review was performed. 29 trials were eligible for final analysis. DATA EXTRACTION A coding manual was developed and pretested. Trial characteristics were double extracted. RESULTS The majority of trials were single centre (22/29, 75.9%), parallel group superiority (17/29, 58.6%), double-blinded (18/29, 62.1%) and conducted in an academic setting (29/29, 100.0%). Trial enrolment (≥90% planned sample size) was achieved in 65.5% of trials (19/29), and retention (≥90% enrolled subjects) in 72.4% of trials (21/29). Protocol violations were reported in nine trials (31.0%). The most commonly studied cohorts were mechanically ventilated patients (28/29, 96.6%) and postsurgical patients (11/29, 37.9%) with inclusion criteria for age ranging from 0±0.5 to 15.0±7.3 years (median±IQR). The median age of enrolled patients was 1.7 years (IQR=4.4 years). Patients excluded from trials were those with neurological impairment (21/29, 72.4%), complex disease (20/29, 69.0%) or receipt of neuromuscular blockade (10/29, 34.5%). Trials evaluated drugs/protocols for sedation management (20/29, 69.0%), weaning (3/29, 10.3%), daily interruption (3/29, 10.3%) or protocolisation (3/29, 10.3%). Primary outcome measures were heterogeneous, as were assessment instruments and follow-up durations.

61333,A proposed grading system for endovascular treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations: Buffalo score.,2015,"BACKGROUND The vascular and gastrointestinal effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs), are not well characterised, particularly in patients at increased risk of vascular disease. We aimed to provide such information through meta-analyses of randomised trials. METHODS We undertook meta-analyses of 280 trials of NSAIDs versus placebo (124,513 participants, 68,342 person-years) and 474 trials of one NSAID versus another NSAID (229,296 participants, 165,456 person-years). The main outcomes were major vascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death); major coronary events (non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death); stroke; mortality; heart failure; and upper gastrointestinal complications (perforation, obstruction, or bleed). FINDINGS Major vascular events were increased by about a third by a coxib (rate ratio [RR] 1·37, 95% CI 1·14-1·66; p=0·0009) or diclofenac (1·41, 1·12-1·78; p=0·0036), chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events (coxibs 1·76, 1·31-2·37; p=0·0001; diclofenac 1·70, 1·19-2·41; p=0·0032). Ibuprofen also significantly increased major coronary events (2·22, 1·10-4·48; p=0·0253), but not major vascular events (1·44, 0·89-2·33). Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to a coxib or diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Naproxen did not significantly increase major vascular events (0·93, 0·69-1·27). Vascular death was increased significantly by coxibs (1·58, 99% CI 1·00-2·49; p=0·0103) and diclofenac (1·65, 0·95-2·85, p=0·0187), non-significantly by ibuprofen (1·90, 0·56-6·41; p=0·17), but not by naproxen (1·08, 0·48-2·47, p=0·80). The proportional effects on major vascular events were independent of baseline characteristics, including vascular risk. Heart failure risk was roughly doubled by all NSAIDs. All NSAID regimens increased upper gastrointestinal complications (coxibs 1·81, 1·17-2·81, p=0·0070; diclofenac 1·89, 1·16-3·09, p=0·0106; ibuprofen 3·97, 2·22-7·10, p<0·0001; and naproxen 4·22, 2·71-6·56, p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION The vascular risks of high-dose diclofenac, and possibly ibuprofen, are comparable to coxibs, whereas high-dose naproxen is associated with less vascular risk than other NSAIDs. Although NSAIDs increase vascular and gastrointestinal risks, the size of these risks can be predicted, which could help guide clinical decision making.

NfL is increasingly considered as possible biomarker of disease activity in neurological conditions. Several works reviewed the utility of NfL in the different diseases. Nonetheless, NfL is a universal marker of neuronal damage, which interpretation spaces beyond the single disease.

However, ACE-2 plays a common role in the pathogenesis of adipocyte hypertrophy and COVID 19. Areas covered: In this ""Perspective"", the author would like to emphasize the use of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells in COVID 19 and the issues that clinicians should pay attention to in fat graft applications in terms of adipose tissue-RAS relationship. The new normal for adipose tissue in COVID 19 will be highlighted. Expert Opinion: ADSCs may potentially be used in COVID-19. However, it has been speculated that ACE2 receptors are responsible for the pathogenesis of adipose tissue overgrowth and may be a potential danger in terms of the relationship between ACE2 receptors and COVID19. We speculate that reducing the size of overgrown fat tissue by ultra-sharp blades and using near-normal adipocytes will create a ""new normal"".","Copcu, H Eray",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2020.1822812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32910704/,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective, observational study, CT scan of 92 NCIP patients admitted to Policlinico Tor Vergata, were analyzed using a quantitative, computed-based and a semiquantitative, radiologist-assessed scoring system. Correlations of the two radiological scores with clinical and laboratory features, the CALL score, and their association with a composite adverse outcome were assessed. RESULTS The two scores correlated significantly with each other (ρ=0.637, p<0.0001) and were independently associated with age, LDH, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and with the composite outcome, which occurred in 24 patients. CONCLUSION In NCIP patients, two different radiological scores correlated with each other and with several clinical, laboratory features, and the CALL score.

62829,WEB Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Clinical and Anatomic Results in the French Observatory.,2016,"OBJECTIVE Noise in operating rooms (OR) can have negative effects on both patients and surgical care workers. Noise can also impact surgical performance, team communication, and patient outcomes. Such implications of noise have been studied in orthopedics, neurosurgery, and urology. High noise levels have also been demonstrated in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) procedures. Despite this, no previous study has amalgamated the data on noise across all OHNS ORs to determine how much noise is present during OHNS surgeries. This study aims to review all the literature on noise associated with OHNS ORs and procedures. METHODS Ovid Medline, EMBASE Classic, Pubmed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases were searched following PRISMA guidelines. Data was collected on noise measurement location and surgery type. Descriptive results and statistical analysis were completed using Stata. RESULTS This search identified 2914 articles. Final inclusion consisted of 22 studies. The majority of articles analyzed noise level exposures during mastoid surgery (18/22, 82%). The maximum noise level across all OHNS ORs and OHNS cadaver studies were 95.5 a-weighted decibels (dBA) and 106.6 c-weighted decibels (dBC), respectively (P = 0.2068). The mean noise level across all studies was significantly higher in OHNS cadaver labs (96.9 dBA) compared to OHNS ORs (70.1 dBA) (P = 0.0038). When analyzed together, the mean noise levels were 84.9 dBA. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review demonstrates that noise exposure in OHNS surgery exceeds safety thresholds. Further research is needed to understand how noise may affect team communication, surgical performance and patient outcomes in OHNS ORs.","Sampieri, Gianluca; Namavarian, Amirpouyan; Levin, Marc; Philteos, Justine; Lee, Jong Wook; Koskinen, Anni; Lin, Vincent; Lee, John",Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00487-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33573705/,1

Currently, available diagnostic biomarkers are neither sensitive nor specific. Thus, the present study aimed to identify novel circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of CRC. All samples were provided by The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Analysis of the GSE108153 and GSE55139 datasets, downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was performed using the online tool, GEO2R. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to determine miR-592 expression in CRC tissues, cells and serums of patients. Subsequently, the diagnostic value of serum miR-592 was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Both the assessment of clinical samples and bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that miR-592 expression levels were significantly upregulated in the tissues and serum of patients with CRC, suggesting that elevated serum miR-592 may be tumor-derived. ROC analysis indicated that serum miR-592 levels may differentiate patients with early stage CRC and advanced adenoma from healthy individuals, with area under the curve values of 0.801 and 0.747, respectively. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that serum miR-592 may be implicated as a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of CRC.","Pan, Zhenguo; Miao, Lin",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724351/,1

During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of Covid-19 occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss, with approximately 15% of personnel diagnosed as asymptomatic for Covid-19. Disease spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals have been implicated for large outbreaks of Covid-19. In March of 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in zones three and four of 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from March 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals were actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles, table surfaces and sanitizer dispensers. Most plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of positive test results of plant personnel and environmental surfaces in one plant showed a good correlation between the two. Our work illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for identifying the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic personnel in workplaces and may aid in controlling infection spread.","Ming, Ziwen; Han, Sukkyun; Deng, Kai; Reyes, Enrique; Ha, Youngsil; Kim, SungSoo; Zhao, Yu; Dobritsa, Anatoly; Wu, Meiting; Zhang, Dandan; Cox, David P; Joyner, Emma; Kulasekara, Hemantha; Kim, Seong Hong; Jang, Yong Seog; Fowler, Curtis; Fei, Xing; Akasaki, Hikari; Themeli, Eni; Agapov, Alexander; Bruneau, Dylan; Tran, Thao; Szczesny, Cameron; Kienzle, Casey; Tenney, Kristina; Geng, Hao; Myoda, Samuel; Samadpour, Mansour",Journal of food protection,https://doi.org/10.4315/jfp-20-465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460439/,1
63054,Immediate Clinical Success After Percutaneous Ablation of Extra-adrenal Paraganglioma.,2018,"BACKGROUND Malignant brain edema (MBE) is a devastating complication in ischemic stroke. Data on MBE in patients who have had mechanical thrombectomy (MT) are relatively scarce. OBJECTIVE To investigate the incidence, predictors, and clinical outcomes of MBE in patients after MT. METHODS We included 130 consecutive patients after MT caused by anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke, treated with MT. MBE was defined as a midline shift of ≥5 mm on the follow-up imaging within 72 hours after MT. Characteristics of patients at admission and details of treatment were collected. The 90-day modified Rankin scale score was used as a measure of functional outcomes. RESULTS Of the 130 patients (age, 68.6±10.9 years; male, 50%), 35 (26.9%) patients developed MBE. The patients with MBE had a lower rate of functional independence (OR=7.831; 95% CI 1.731 to 35.427; p=0.008) and significantly higher mortality at 90 days (OR=7.958; 95% CI 2.274 to 27.848; p=0.001) than patients without MBE. In 104 (80%) patients with successful recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b-3), 24 (23.1%) patients exhibited MBE. After adjustment for confounding, ICA occlusion (OR=3.746; 95% CI 1.169 to 12.006; p=0.026) and worse collateral score (grade 1 vs grade 0: OR=0.727; 95% CI 0.192 to 2.753; p=0.638; grade 2 vs grade 0: OR=0.130; 95% CI 0.021 to 0.819; p=0.030) were significantly associated with the development of MBE, despite successful recanalization. CONCLUSIONS MBE after MT is not uncommon and was related to poor functional outcomes. Localization of a vessel occlusion and collateral status may play a role in the development of MBE.","Huang, Xianjun; Yang, Qian; Shi, Xiaolei; Xu, Xiangjun; Ge, Liang; Ding, Xianhui; Zhou, Zhiming",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-014650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798266/,1
63204,Susceptibility Artifacts in the Anterior Cranial Fossa Mimicking Hemorrhage in Patients with Anosmia.,2021-08-05,"INTRODUCTION There is worldwide concern over the psycho-emotional impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCWs). This study aimed to elicit HCWs' perceptions of the adequacy of protective measures in high-risk clinical areas and the factors associated with these perceptions. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study conducted in April 2020. An anonymous electronic survey was sent via email to operating theatre (OT) and intensive care unit (ICU) staff of Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore. RESULTS Of the 358 eligible participants, 292 (81.6%) responded to the survey. 93.2% of the participants felt that precautionary measures at work were sufficient and 94.9% acknowledged that adequate training was provided. More than 60% of the participants opined that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were moderate to high. Female gender, nursing occupation and duration of service < 10 years were significantly associated with increased fear of contracting COVID-19, less control over occupational exposure and lower perceived need to care for COVID-19 patients. Having young children at home did not significantly affect these perceptions. The most important ICU precautions were availability of personal protective equipment outside the rooms of COVID-19 positive patients (95.3%) and having visitor restrictions (95.3%). The most important OT measures were having a dedicated OT for COVID-19 positive patients (91.2%) and having simulation as part of protocol familiarisation (91.7%). CONCLUSION Overall, there was high confidence in the adequacy of COVID-19 protective measures to prevent healthcare transmission in Singapore. The pandemic had a lower degree of psycho-emotional impact on HCWs here as compared to other countries.","Au-Yong, Phui-Sze Angie; Peh, Wee-Ming; Koh, Frederick Hong-Xiang; Teo, Li-Ming; Ng, Siok-Peng; Tan, Alina Li-Na; Ng, Aven Shan-Hua; Chew, Min-Hoe",Singapore medical journal,https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2021046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866717/,1
63307,Unleashing the Power of Laboratory Developed Tests: Closing Gaps in COVID Diagnosis and Beyond.,2020-06-02,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enteropathogenic Alphacoronavirus, has caused enormous economic losses in the pork industry. Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) is a characteristic feature of alpha- and betacoronaviruses, which exhibits both functional conservation and mechanistic diversity in inhibiting host gene expression and antiviral responses. However, the detailed structure and molecular mechanisms underlying the Alphacoronavirus nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression remain unclear. Here, we report the first full-length crystal structure of Alphacoronavirus nsp1 from PEDV. The structure displays a six-stranded β-barrel fold in the middle of two α-helices. The core structure of PEDV nsp1 shows high similarity to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp1 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nsp1, despite its low degree of sequence homology. Using ribopuromycylation and Renilla luciferase reporter assays, we showed that PEDV nsp1 can dramatically inhibit general host gene expression. Furthermore, three motifs (amino acids [aa] 67 to 71, 78 to 85, and 103 to 110) of PEDV nsp1 create a stable functional region for inhibiting protein synthesis, differing considerably from Betacoronavirus nsp1. These results elucidate the detailed structural basis through which PEDV nsp1 inhibits host gene expression, providing insight into the development of a new attenuated vaccine with nsp1 modifications.IMPORTANCE Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has led to tremendous economic losses in the global swine industry. PEDV nsp1 plays a crucial role in inhibiting host gene expression, but its functional mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report the full-length structure of PEDV nsp1, the first among coronaviruses to be reported. The 1.25-Å resolution crystal structure of PEDV nsp1 shows high similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp113-128 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) nsp11-104, despite a lack of sequence homology. Structural and biochemical characterization demonstrated that PEDV nsp1 possesses a stable functional region for inhibition of host protein synthesis, which is formed by loops at residues 67 to 71, 78 to 85, and 103 to 110. The different functional regions in PEDV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 may explain their distinct mechanisms. Importantly, our structural data are conducive to understanding the mechanism of PEDV nsp1 inhibition of the expression of host genes and may aid in the development of a new attenuated vaccine.","Shen, Zhou; Ye, Gang; Deng, Feng; Wang, Gang; Cui, Min; Fang, Liurong; Xiao, Shaobo; Fu, Zhen F; Peng, Guiqing",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01896-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237834/,1

Health interventions to promote physical activity are more likely to be successful if they take into account the experiences and perspectives of their target population. Our study objective was to explore barriers and facilitators to physical activity among Latino adolescents with the goal of informing future interventions for this population. METHOD Semistructured interviews were conducted with (n = 30) low-income, Latino adolescents. The interviews were analyzed using inductive methods and the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation model of behavior. RESULTS Adolescents described capability gaps including lacking skills for preferred activities. School physical education and parks provided opportunities for adolescents to be physically active. Adolescents also described opportunity challenges, including age limits, not being able to afford preferred classes, and safety concerns. Families provided role modeling but rarely engaged in activities with adolescents. Adolescents were motivated to engage in physical activity but often lacked the necessary resources.

63631,Utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with poor performance status.,2020-07-29,"A novel strain of H1N1 influenza A virus (pH1N1) emerged in 2009, causing a worldwide pandemic. Several studies suggest that this virus is antigenically more closely related to human influenza viruses that circulated prior to 1957 than viruses of more recent seasonal influenza varieties. The extent to which individuals who are naïve to the 2009 pH1N1 virus carry cross-reactive CD8+ T cells is not known, but a certain degree of reactivity would be expected since there is substantial conservation among the internal proteins of the virus. In the present study, we examined the production of multiple cytokines in response to virus from CD8+ T cells in healthy adult subjects, between 18 and 50 years of age (born post 1957), who had no evidence of exposure to the 2009 pH1N1 virus, and had blood collected prior to the emergence of the pandemic in April of 2009. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in vitro with a panel of live viruses, and assayed by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. Although results were variable, most subjects exhibited cytokine positive CD8+ T cells in response to pH1N1. Cytokine producing cells were predominantly single positive (IL2, IFNγ, or TNFα); triple-cytokine producing cells were relatively rare. This result suggests that although many adults carry cross-reactive T cells against the emergent pandemic virus, these cells are in a functionally limited state, possibly because these subjects have not had recent exposure to either seasonal or pandemic influenza strains.","Scheible, Kristin; Zhang, Gang; Baer, Jane; Azadniv, Mitra; Lambert, Kris; Pryhuber, Gloria; Treanor, John J; Topham, David J",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2010.12.073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211588/,1

We present the characteristics and outcomes of patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) with immunosuppressive drugs, either tocilizumab or anakinra compared with controls. METHODS A Single-center observational prospective study on ICU invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was the clinical improvement at day 28. A Bayesian framework was employed and all analyses were adjusted for confounders. RESULTS Sixty-one consecutive invasively ventilated patients were included, nine (14∙7%) received tocilizumab and 15 (24∙6%) received anakinra. Over the first seven days, tocilizumab was associated with a greater decrease in C-reactive protein (p<0∙001). After adjusting for confounders, the probability of clinical improvement at day 28 compared to control was 7∙6% (OR, 0∙36 [95% CrI, 0∙09-1∙46]) for tocilizumab and 40∙9% (OR, 0∙89 [95% CrI, 0∙32-2∙43]) for anakinra. At day 28, the probability of being in a better clinical category was 2∙5% (OR, 2∙98 [95% CrI, 1∙00-8∙88]) for tocilizumab, and 49∙5% (OR, 1∙00 [95% CrI, 0∙42-2∙42]) for anakinra. CONCLUSIONS In invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients, treatment with anakinra was associated with a higher probability of clinical improvement compared to tocilizumab; however, treatment with either drug did not result in clinically meaningful improvements compared with controls.","Monti, Giacomo; Campochiaro, Corrado; Zangrillo, Alberto; Scandroglio, Anna Mara; Fominskiy, Evgeny; Cavalli, Giulio; Landoni, Giovanni; Beretta, Luigi; Mucci, Milena; Calabró, Maria Grazia; Pieri, Marina; Nardelli, Pasquale; Sartorelli, Marianna; Baiardo Redaelli, Martina; Morselli, Federica; Serpa Neto, Ary; Bellomo, Rinaldo; Dagna, Lorenzo",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15339-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102804/,1

For coronaviruses, replicase nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) has been proposed to function in the formation and organization of replication complexes. Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp4 is glycosylated at residues Asn176 (N176) and N237 during plasmid expression of nsp4 in cells. To test if MHV nsp4 residues N176 and N237 are glycosylated during virus replication and to determine the effects of N176 and N237 on nsp4 function and MHV replication, alanine substitutions of nsp4 N176, N237, or both were engineered into the MHV-A59 genome. The N176A, N237A, and N176A/N237A mutant viruses were viable, and N176 and N237 were glycosylated during infection of wild-type (wt) and mutant viruses. The nsp4 glycosylation mutants exhibited impaired virus growth and RNA synthesis, with the N237A and N176A/N237A mutant viruses demonstrating more profound defects in virus growth and RNA synthesis. Electron microscopic analysis of ultrastructure from infected cells demonstrated that the nsp4 mutants had aberrant morphology of virus-induced double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) compared to those infected with wt virus. The degree of altered DMV morphology directly correlated with the extent of impairment in viral RNA synthesis and virus growth of the nsp4 mutant viruses. The results indicate that nsp4 plays a critical role in the organization and stability of DMVs. The results also support the conclusion that the structure of DMVs is essential for efficient RNA synthesis and optimal replication of coronaviruses.","Gadlage, Mark J; Sparks, Jennifer S; Beachboard, Dia C; Cox, Reagan G; Doyle, Joshua D; Stobart, Christopher C; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01772-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19846526/,1

RECENT FINDINGS In 2013 with the discovery and validation study of biomarkers for AKI (Sapphire) advancement in care was provided allowing for the early identification of patients at high risk for developing AKI. It was the combination of new biomarkers and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for managing patients with AKI that provided an opportunity to improve patient care. In 2017, the PrevAKI study implemented KDIGO guideline management in high-risk patients identified by biomarkers followed in 2018 with the BigPAK study that used a similar approach, both of which demonstrated positive outcomes in patient care. Next, real-world evaluations followed supporting biomarker guided management of AKI in clinical practice. Also, proposals for better nephrotoxin management, a major modifiable exposure to prevent AKI, were provided with the foresight in identifying high-risk patients. SUMMARY Stress and damage biomarker-based approaches to patient care seem to be promising for identifying patients at high risk for developing AKI and thus offers an opportunity for early management to prevent and ameliorate AKI and drug-associated AKI.","Kane-Gill, Sandra L; Meersch, Melaine; Bell, Max",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027146/,1
64010,Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of lung cancer presenting as ground-glass opacity.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in gynecologic oncology, with the majority of published reports originating from a small number of specialized centers. It is unclear to what degree ERAS is implemented in hospitals globally. This international survey investigated the status of ERAS protocol implementation in open gynecologic oncology surgery to provide a worldwide perspective on peri-operative practice patterns. METHODS Requests to participate in an online survey of ERAS practices were distributed via social media (WhatsApp, Twitter, and Social Link). The survey was active between January 15 and March 15, 2020. Additionally, four national gynecologic oncology societies agreed to distribute the study among their members. Respondents were requested to answer a 17-item questionnaire about their ERAS practice preferences in the pre-, intra-, and post-operative periods. RESULTS Data from 454 respondents representing 62 countries were analyzed. Overall, 37% reported that ERAS was implemented at their institution. The regional distribution was: Europe 61%, Americas 53%, Asia 30%, and Africa 17%. ERAS gynecologic oncology guidelines were well adhered to (>80%) in the domains of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, early removal of urinary catheter after surgery, and early introduction of ambulation. Areas with poor adherence to the guidelines included the use of bowel preparation, adoption of modern fasting guidelines, carbohydrate loading, use of nasogastric tubes and peritoneal drains, intra-operative temperature monitoring, and early feeding. CONCLUSION This international survey of ERAS in open gynecologic oncology surgery shows that, while some practices are consistent with guideline recommendations, many practices contradict the established evidence. Efforts are required to decrease the variation in peri-operative care that exists in order to improve clinical outcomes for patients with gynecologic cancer globally.","Bhandoria, Geetu Prakash; Bhandarkar, Prashant; Ahuja, Vijay; Maheshwari, Amita; Sekhon, Rupinder K; Gultekin, Murat; Ayhan, Ali; Demirkiran, Fuat; Kahramanoglu, Ilker; Wan, Yee-Loi Louise; Knapp, Pawel; Dobroch, Jakub; Zmaczyński, Andrzej; Jach, Robert; Nelson, Gregg",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2020-001683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32753562/,1
64087,Inter-rater reliability of published flow diversion occlusion scales.,2016,"PURPOSE To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic two-port totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS A 10-year retrospective analysis from 2004 to 2013 of patients undergoing two-port TEP performed by a single surgeon at three surgical centers. RESULTS 336 consecutive patients underwent two-port TEP repairing 478 hernias. 315 (93.8 %) patients were male and 21 (6.2 %) were female. Mean age ± SD was 47 ± 14 years and mean body mass index ± SD was 28.0 ± 4.7 kg/m(2). Indications for surgery included primary repair 303 (90.2 %), recurrence from open repair 28 (8.3 %), and incarcerated inguinal hernia 5 (1.5 %). 194 (57.7 %) cases were unilateral and 142 (42.3 %) were bilateral. Operative time ± SD was 38.7 ± 14.9 min for unilateral repair and 43.4 ± 17.6 min for bilateral repair. Two-port TEP was successful in 316 (94.0 %). 20 (6.0 %) cases required the addition of a third port. 2 (0.6 %) cases were converted to open repair. Mean follow-up time ± SD was 5.4 ± 2.7 years. Postoperative complications included urinary retention 5 (1.5 %), seroma 7 (2.1 %), hematoma 1 (0.3 %), surgical site infection 4 (1.2 %), and chronic inguinal pain 3 (0.9 %). 11 (2.3 %) hernias recurred. CONCLUSION Two-port TEP appears to be a feasible, safe, and effective method for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and should be considered a viable, less invasive alternative to conventional three-port techniques.","Fuglestad, M A; Waisbren, S J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1402-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26143073/,1
64509,Artery of Davidoff and Schechter Supply in Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas.,2020-01-23,"PURPOSE Gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and the second most common cause for cancer associated mortality. Anti-tumor effects of tamoxifen in breast cancer are well-established. However, no study has so far investigated the effects of tamoxifen on gene expression of Notch1 and DLL1 in gastric cancer cell line. The present study was conducted to explore the effects of tamoxifen, as a repurposed drug, on gene expression of Notch1 and DLL1 in MKN-45, a gastric cancer cell line. METHODS MKN-45 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS. Cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen on these cells at various concentrations were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay. For gene expression analysis, the cells were first incubated with 100 μM tamoxifen followed by total RNA extraction from treated and control cells. Then, cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative real-time PCR using specific primers for Notch1 and DLL1 was performed to assess the effect of tamoxifen on the transcript of them. RESULTS Treatment with tamoxifen decreased viability of MKN-45 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CC50 was estimated to be around 200 μM. Also, tamoxifen at the dose of 100 μM could significantly downregulate mRNA levels of both Notch1 and DLL1 genes as compared with untreated cells by 24% and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSION Based on these results, tamoxifen interferes with Notch signaling pathway through downregulating the expression of Notch1 and DLL1 genes and this could be regarded as a mechanism for its anti-cancer effects in this malignant disease.","Khanipouyani, Faranak; Akrami, Hassan",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-020-00511-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901446/,1

Respiratory infection caused by more than one viral pathogen (viral co-infection) or both viral and bacterial pathogens (combined viral and bacterial pneumonia) have been described. Secondary bacterial pneumonia can follow the initial phase of viral respiratory infection or occur during the recovery phase. No obvious pattern or guidelines exist for viral coinfection, combined viral and bacterial pneumonia, or secondary bacterial pneumonia in the context of SARS-CoV-2.

64971,Identification and treatment of infected total hip arthroplasty.,2012,"BACKGROUND We used laboratory indicators to evaluate the quality of pathogen-reduced red blood cell suspension (RBCS) compared with gamma-irradiated RBCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS To determine biochemical and metabolic parameters of RBCS, we obtained 50 whole blood units from healthy volunteers and randomized them into 2 groups: 25 were pathogen-reduced, and then, RBCS prepared from them. RBCS from the other 25 was gamma-irradiated. Sampling was carried out on day zero before and after treatment and at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. To determine lymphocyte inactivation, we collected another 35 whole blood units. Each was sampled to form 3 study groups: untreated, gamma-irradiated and pathogen-reduced. Daily sampling was carried out during 3 days of storage. RESULTS The quality of RBCS from both groups was largely the same, except for haemolysis and red blood cell fragility, which were more pronounced in the pathogen-reduced group. This finding limited the shelf life of pathogen-reduced RBCS to 14 days. Lymphocyte viability was significantly reduced after both treatments. Proliferation of lymphocytes after pathogen reduction was reduced to the detection limit, while low-level proliferation was observed in gamma-irradiated samples. CONCLUSION Pathogen-reduced red blood cells have acceptable quality and can be used for transfusion within 14 days. Results of inactivation of lymphocytes demonstrate that pathogen reduction technology, applied on WB, can serve as an alternative to irradiation.","Kumukova, Irina; Trakhtman, Pavel; Starostin, Nicolay; Borsakova, Daria; Ignatova, Anastasia; Bayzyanova, Yana",Vox sanguinis,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222171/,1

Methods This was an observational record-based study, longitudinal in design. Data of 281 SARI patients who have attended All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, Bihar, India during 25th April 2020, till 12th July 2020 (16 weeks) were used for the study. Results Out of 281 study participants, 95 (33.8%) were detected to have COVID-19 and 42 (14.9%) died. Among COVID-positive study subject's death rate was 28.4%. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis; increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.02 [1.00-1.03]), gender (males) (AOR = 2.51 [1.27-4.96]), presenting symptom (cough) (AOR = 2.88 [1.46-5.70]), co-morbidity (hypothyroidism) (AOR = 4.59 [1.45-14.56]) and delay between symptom onset and admission (>2 days) (AOR = 2.46 [1.19-5.07]) were significant predictors of COVID-19 infection among study participants adjusted with other co-morbidities (diabetes and hypertension). Similarly, place of residence (outside Patna district) (AOR = 2.38 [1.03-5.50]), co-morbidity (diabetes) (AOR = 3.08 [1.12-8.50]), intensive care unit (ICU) requirement at admission (yes) (AOR = 9.47 [3.98-22.52]) and COVID status (positive) (AOR = 6.33 [2.68-14.96]) were significant predictors of death among the study participants whereas place of residence (outside Patna district) (AOR = 4.04 [1.33-12.28]) and ICU requirement at admission (yes) (AOR = 7.22 [2.54-20.52]) were attributes affecting death of COVID-positive study participants. Conclusion Risk of COVID-19 infection among the study participants was high. Age, gender and co-morbidities increased the risk of infection. COVID-19 infection negatively impacted the treatment outcome of the study participants.

METHODS Since 2006, data from patients undergoing a highly restrictive primary LSG have been prospectively registered in a database and analysed. Preoperative co-morbid conditions, operating time, hospital stay, early and late complications rate and evolution of weight loss after 5 years of follow-up were analysed. RESULTS A total of 156 patients were included, 74.3% of whom were women. The mean age was 43.2 ± 13.1 years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 41.5 ± 7.9 kg/m2. Seventy patients (44.8%) presented a BMI under 40 kg/m2. The mortality rate was 0%. The leakage rate was 1.2%, and the total 30-d morbidity rate was 5.1% (8/156). With a mean follow-up of 32.7 ± 28.5 (range 6-112) mo, the mean percent of excess of weight loss (%EWL) was 82.0 ± 18.8 at 1 year, 76.7 ± 21.3 at 3 years and 60.3 ± 28.9 at 5 years. The mean percent of excess of BMI loss (%EBMIL) was 94.9 ± 22.4 at 1 year, 89.4 ± 27.4 at 3 years and 74.8 ± 29.4 at 5 years. Patients with preoperative BMI less than 40 kg/m2 achieved greater weight loss than did the overall study population. Diabetes remitted in 75% of the patients and HTA improved in 71.7%. CPAP masks were withdrawn in all patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. CONCLUSION LSG built with a narrow 34 F bougie and starting 3 cm from the pylorus proved to be safe and highly effective in terms of weight loss as a stand-alone procedure, particularly in patients with a preoperative BMI lower than 40 kg/m2.","Hoyuela, Carlos",World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.4240/wjgs.v9.i4.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28503259/,1
65613,Early results of the Axium MicroFX for Endovascular Repair of IntraCranial Aneurysm (AMERICA) study: a multicenter prospective observational registry.,2014,"Background Bactericidal capacity, durable inhibition of biofilm formation, and a three-dimensional (3D) porous structure are the emphases of infected bone defect (IBD) treatment via local scaffold implantation strategy. Purpose In this study, silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-loaded nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA)@ reduced graphene oxide (RGO) 3D scaffolds (AHRG scaffolds) were designed to alleviate bone infection, inhibit biofilm formation, and promote bone repair through the synergistic effects of AgNPs, RGO, and nHA. Materials and Methods AHRGs were prepared using a one-step preparation method, to create a 3D porous scaffold to facilitate a uniform distribution of AgNPs and nHA. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was used as a model-resistant bacterium, and the effects of different silver loadings on the antimicrobial activity and cytocompatibility of materials were evaluated. Finally, a rabbit IBD model was used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the AHRG scaffold in vivo. Results The results showed successful synthesis of the AHRG scaffold. The ideal 3D porous structure was verified using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and selected area electron diffraction measurements revealed uniform distributions of AgNP and nHA. In vitro antibacterial and cytocompatibility indicated that the 4% AHRG scaffolds possessed the most favorable balance of bactericidal properties and cytocompatibility. In vivo evaluation of the IBD model showed promising treatment efficacy of AHRG scaffolds. Conclusion The as-fabricated AHRG scaffolds effectively eliminated infection and inhibited biofilm formation. IBD repair was facilitated by the bactericidal properties and 3D porous structure of the AHRG scaffold, suggesting its potential in the treatment of IBDs.","Weng, Weizong; Li, Xiaoqun; Nie, Wei; Liu, Haoyuan; Liu, Shanshan; Huang, Jianming; Zhou, Qirong; He, Jia; Su, Jiacan; Dong, Zhifeng; Wang, Dongliang",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s241859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764934/,1
65698,Real-world effectiveness of cladribine for Australian patients with multiple sclerosis: An MSBase registry substudy.,2020-06-12,"The functional role of IL-12 and IL-23 in host defense and disease following viral infection of the CNS was determined. Instillation of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a positive-strand RNA virus) into the CNS of mice results in acute encephalitis followed by a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease. Antibody-mediated blocking of either IL-23 (anti-IL-23p19) or IL-12 and IL-23 (anti-IL-12/23p40) signaling did not mute T-cell trafficking into the CNS or antiviral effector responses and mice were able to control viral replication within the brain. Therapeutic administration of either anti-IL-23p19 or anti-IL-12/23p40 to mice with viral-induced demyelination did not attenuate T-cell or macrophage infiltration into the CNS nor improve clinical disease or diminish white matter damage. In contrast, treatment of mice with anti-IL-12/23p40 or anti-IL-23p19 resulted in inhibition of the autoimmune model of demyelination, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These data indicate that (1) IL-12 and IL-23 signaling are dispensable in generating a protective T-cell response following CNS infection with MHV, and (2) IL-12 and IL-23 do not contribute to demyelination in a model independent of autoimmune T-cell-mediated pathology. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of IL-12 and/or IL-23 for the treatment of autoimmune diseases may offer unique advantages by reducing disease severity without muting protective responses following viral infection.","Held, Katherine S; Glass, William G; Orlovsky, Yevgeniya I; Shamberger, Kimberly A; Petley, Ted D; Branigan, Patrick J; Carton, Jill M; Beck, Heena S; Cunningham, Mark R; Benson, Jacqueline M; Lane, Thomas E",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2008.0014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18570589/,1

This meta-analysis compared 24-h/daytime/night-time SBP and DBP mean values and SBP/DBP nocturnal dipping status from ABPMs in participants with or without hypertension. METHODS Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Complete databases were searched for articles published before 3 May 2019. Eligible studies reporting a 24-h ABPM repeated at least once within 1 month were included. The mean daytime/night-time/24-h BP values, percentage of nocturnal dipping, and proportion of nondippers were compared between the first and second day of measurements, and the proportion of participants with inconsistent dipping status were estimated using a random effect model. RESULTS Population-based analysis found a 0-1.1 mmHg difference between the first and second ABPM for 24-h/daytime/night-time SBP and DBP and 0-0.5% for percentage of SBP/DBP nocturnal dipping. The proportion of non-dippers was not different between the first and second ABPM. Intra-individual analysis found that the 95% limit of agreements (LOA) for SBP/DBP were wide and the 95% LOA for daytime SBP, common reference to diagnose hypertension, ranged -16.7 to 18.4 mmHg. Similarly, 32% of participants had inconsistent nocturnal dipping status. CONCLUSION ABPM had excellent reproducibility at the population level, favouring its application for research purposes; but reproducibility of intra-individual BP values and dipping status from a 24-h ABPM was limited. The available evidence was limited by the lack of high-quality studies and lack of studies in non-Western populations.","Bo, Yacong; Kwok, Kin-On; Chung, Vincent Chi-Ho; Yu, Chun-Pong; Tsoi, Kelvin Kam-Fai; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan; Lee, Eric Kam-Pui",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000002522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32555001/,1

METHODS This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from January 31, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Data of 902 patients were obtained from clinical records in hospitals, primary care units, and community pharmacies. Inclusion criteria were adults with IMIDs treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs who started therapy 3 months prior to study commencement. Patients with poor adherence to treatments were excluded. COVID-19 was classified as ""definitive"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive), ""possible"" (characteristic symptoms and negative PCR), and ""suspected"" (characteristic symptoms but PCR not performed). RESULTS COVID-19 was diagnosed in 70 patients (11 definitive, 19 possible, and 40 suspected). The cumulative incidence of definitive COVID-19 was 1.2%. When considering all cases, the incidence was 7.8%. Patients on biosimilars tumor necrosis factor blockers were more likely to have a diagnosis of COVID-19 (odds ratio, 2.308; p < 0.001). Patients on anti-B-cell therapies had a lower incidence of infections (p = 0.046). Low rates of hospitalization (14.3%), pneumonia (14.3%), death (2.9%), or thrombosis (2.9%) were observed, and 94.3% of patients recovered.

In particular, hydroxytyrosol (HTyr), tyrosol (Tyr), and the secoiridoids oleacein and oleocanthal play central roles as anti-inflammatory, neuro-protective and anti-cancer agents. These compounds cannot be easily obtained via chemical synthesis, and their isolation and purification from EVOO is cumbersome. Indeed, both processes involve the use of large volumes of organic solvents, hazardous reagents and several chromatographic steps. In this work we propose a novel optimized procedure for the green extraction, isolation and purification of HTyr, Tyr, oleacein and oleocanthal directly from EVOO, by using a Natural Deep Eutectic Solvent (NaDES) as an extracting phase, coupled with preparative high-performance liquid chromatography. This purification method allows the total recovery of the four components as single pure compounds directly from EVOO, in a rapid, economic and ecologically sustainable way, which utilizes biocompatible reagents and strongly limits the use or generation of hazardous substances.","Francioso, Antonio; Federico, Rodolfo; Maggiore, Anna; Fontana, Mario; Boffi, Alberto; D'Erme, Maria; Mosca, Luciana",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796621/,1
66824,Successful percutaneous embolization of a persistent extraperitoneal bladder leak.,2014,"CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1), a type I transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell adhesion has been shown to act as an angiogenic factor for mouse and human endothelial cells. Based on the ability of CEACAM1 to initiate lumen formation in human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D culture (Matrigel), we hypothesized that murine CEACAM1 may play a similar role in vasculogenesis. In order to test this hypothesis, murine embryonic stem (ES) cells stimulated with VEGF were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EB) for 8 days (-8-0 d) and transferred to Matrigel in the presence or absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody for an additional 12 days (0-12 d). In the absence of anti-CEACAM1 antibody or in the presence of an isotype control antibody, the EB in Matrigel underwent extensive sprouting, generating lengthy vascular structures with well-defined lumina as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. Both the length and architecture of the vascular tubes were inhibited by anti-CEACAM1 mAb CC1, a mAb that blocks the cell-cell adhesion functions of CEACAM1, thus demonstrating a critical role for this cell-cell adhesion molecule in generating and maintaining vasculogenesis. QRT-PCR analysis of the VEGF treated ES cells grown under conditions that convert them to EB revealed expression of Ceacam1 as early as -5 to -3 d reaching a maximum at day 0 at which time EBs were transferred to Matrigel, thereafter levels at first declined and then increased over time. Other markers of vasculogenesis including Pecam1, VE-Cad, and Tie-1 were not detected until day 0 when EBs were transferred to Matrigel followed by a steady increase in levels, indicating later roles in vasculogenesis. In contrast, Tie-2 and Flk-1 (VEGFR2) were detected on day five of EB formation reaching a maximum at day 0 on transfer to Matrigel, similar to Ceacam1, but after which Tie-2 declined over time, while Flk-1 increased over time. QRT-PCR analysis of the anti-CEACAM1 treated ES cells revealed a significant decrease in the expression of Ceacam1, Pecam1, Tie-1, and Flk-1, while VE-Cad and Tie-2 expression were unaffected. These results suggest that the expression and signaling of CEACAM1 may affect the expression of other factors known to play critical roles in vasculogenesis. Furthermore this 3D model of vasculogenesis in an environment of extracellular matrix may be a useful model for comparison to existing models of angiogenesis.","Gu, Angel; Tsark, Walter; Holmes, Kathryn V; Shively, John E",Experimental cell research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.02.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19285068/,1
67155,Flow diverter stent treatment for ruptured basilar trunk perforator aneurysms.,2016,"AIM To identify health needs and healthcare access barriers of accompanied refugee and asylum seeking children in the North East of England, and pilot a new service model to address these. METHODS Mixed methods study (retrospective analysis of routinely collected service data, qualitative data from focus groups) of children who attended a hospital-based specialist clinic. RESULTS Over two years 80 children were referred to this service. Most frequent diagnoses (total n=104) were anaemia (n=17), neurodevelopmental (n=12), respiratory (n=12) and mental health (n=9) conditions. Mild-moderate stunting (23%), overweight and obesity (41%), stunting with obesity (9%) and micronutrient deficiencies (vitamin D (66%), vitamin A (40%) and manifest (14%) or latent (25%) iron deficiency anaemia) were highly prevalent. 62% of children had experienced psychological trauma, and 39% had abnormal results in psychosocial wellbeing screening. 21% of children required secondary or tertiary care, 8% mental health referrals, and 47% were followed up in this specialist clinic. Focus groups with families and the community report unaddressed health needs and substantial barriers of access to healthcare. CONCLUSION Refugee and asylum seeking children have substantial health needs and healthcare access barriers that are not routinely addressed. The authors propose a service model for healthcare provision.","Harkensee, Christian; Andrew, Rachel",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33783882/,1
67479,The Clinical Prognostic Value of the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio in Brain Metastases from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer-Harboring EGFR Mutations.,2020,"Stigma is a common phenomenon worldwide and infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and leprosy are often associated with high levels of stigma. Several studies have been conducted concerning the effects of stigma and the impact on social participation, but comparative studies are rare. The objective of this study was to identify differences and similarities between HIV/AIDS and leprosy-related stigma. From April till July 2009, 190 questionnaire-based interviews were conducted to assess the levels of internalized stigma (Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale), perceived stigma (Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue stigma scale) and social participation (Participation scale) in a cross-sectional sample of people affected by leprosy (PL) and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Respondents were selected from several hospitals, charity projects and during home visits in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu. Our results showed that both PLHA (n = 95) and leprosy-affected respondents (n = 95) faced a substantial burden of internalized and perceived stigma, with the former reporting a significantly higher level of stigma. As a result, PLHA faced more frequent and also more severe participation restrictions than PL. Especially, restrictions in work-related areas were reported by the majority of the respondents. In conclusion, PLHA faced a significantly higher level of stigma and participation restriction than PL. However, the latter also reported a substantial burden of stigma and participation restrictions. The study suggests that it may be possible to develop joint interventions based on the commonalities found. More research is needed to define these more precisely and to test the effectiveness of such joint interventions in reducing stigma and improving social participation.","Stevelink, S A M; van Brakel, W H; Augustine, V","Psychology, health & medicine",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2011.555945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21391136/,1

Studies using administrative data have estimated that 14%-22% of women filled a prescription for opioids during pregnancy; however, data on self-reported prescription opioid use during pregnancy are limited. METHODS CDC analyzed 2019 data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey in 32 jurisdictions and maternal and infant health surveys in two additional jurisdictions not participating in PRAMS to estimate self-reported prescription opioid pain reliever (prescription opioid) use during pregnancy overall and by maternal characteristics among women with a recent live birth. This study describes source of prescription opioids, reasons for use, want or need to cut down or stop use, and receipt of health care provider counseling on how use during pregnancy can affect an infant. RESULTS An estimated 6.6% of respondents reported prescription opioid use during pregnancy. Among these women, 21.2% reported misuse (a source other than a health care provider or a reason for use other than pain), 27.1% indicated wanting or needing to cut down or stop using, and 68.1% received counseling from a provider on how prescription opioid use during pregnancy could affect an infant. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE Among respondents reporting opioid use during pregnancy, most indicated receiving prescription opioids from a health care provider and using for pain reasons; however, answers from one in five women indicated misuse. Improved screening for opioid misuse and treatment of opioid use disorder in pregnant patients might prevent adverse outcomes. Implementation of public health strategies (e.g., improving state prescription drug monitoring program use and enhancing provider training) can support delivery of evidence-based care for pregnant women.","Ko, Jean Y; D'Angelo, Denise V; Haight, Sarah C; Morrow, Brian; Cox, Shanna; Salvesen von Essen, Beatriz; Strahan, Andrea E; Harrison, Leslie; Tevendale, Heather D; Warner, Lee; Kroelinger, Charlan D; Barfield, Wanda D",MMWR.

The molecular mechanisms used by GBS to survive and proliferate in blood are not well understood. Here, using a highly virulent GBS strain and Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS), we performed genome-wide screens to discover novel GBS genes required for bacterial survival in human whole blood and plasma. The screen identified 85 and 41 genes that are required for GBS growth in whole blood and plasma, respectively. A common set of 29 genes was required in both whole blood and plasma. Targeted gene deletion confirmed that (i) genes encoding methionine transporter (metP) and manganese transporter (mtsA) are crucial for GBS survival in whole blood and plasma, (ii) gene W903_1820 encoding a small multi-drug export family protein contributes significantly to GBS survival in whole blood, (iii) the shikimate pathway gene aroA is essential for GBS growth in whole blood and plasma, and (iv) deletion of srr1 encoding a fibrinogen-binding adhesin increases GBS survival in whole blood. Our findings provide new insight into the GBS-host interactions in human blood.","Zhu, Luchang; Yerramilli, Prasanti; Pruitt, Layne; Saavedra, Matthew Ojeda; Cantu, Concepcion C; Olsen, Randall J; Beres, Stephen B; Waller, Andrew S; Musser, James M",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00357-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747604/,1
68145,Flow-Diverter Stents for the Treatment of Saccular Middle Cerebral Artery Bifurcation Aneurysms.,2016,"An alarming rise in hospital outbreaks implicating hand-washing sinks has led to widespread acknowledgment that sinks are a major reservoir of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in patient care areas. An earlier study using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Escherichia coli (GFP-E. coli) as a model organism demonstrated dispersal from drain biofilms in contaminated sinks. The present study further characterizes the dispersal of microorganisms from contaminated sinks. Replicate hand-washing sinks were inoculated with GFP-E. coli, and dispersion was measured using qualitative (settle plates) and quantitative (air sampling) methods. Dispersal caused by faucet water was captured with settle plates and air sampling methods when bacteria were present on the drain. In contrast, no dispersal was captured without or in between faucet events, amending an earlier theory that bacteria aerosolize from the P-trap and disperse. Numbers of dispersed GFP-E. coli cells diminished substantially within 30 minutes after faucet usage, suggesting that the organisms were associated with larger droplet-sized particles that are not suspended in the air for long periods.IMPORTANCE Among the possible environmental reservoirs in a patient care environment, sink drains are increasingly recognized as a potential reservoir to hospitalized patients of multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens. With increasing antimicrobial resistance limiting therapeutic options for patients, a better understanding of how pathogens disseminate from sink drains is urgently needed. Once this knowledge gap has decreased, interventions can be engineered to decrease or eliminate transmission from hospital sink drains to patients. The current study further defines the mechanisms of transmission for bacteria that colonize sink drains.","Kotay, Shireen M; Donlan, Rodney M; Ganim, Christine; Barry, Katie; Christensen, Bryan E; Mathers, Amy J",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01997-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367005/,1
68272,Alteration of laboratory findings after radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: relationship to severity of the underlying liver disease and the ablation volume.,2015,"BACKGROUND The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic caused a shortage of qualified nurses in Spain. As a result, the government authorized the hiring of senior students. OBJECTIVES To explore the perspectives of a group of final-year nursing students who were hired on the basis of a relief contract for health professionals during the first COVID-19 outbreak, regarding their learning process and their mixed role as students and novice nurses. DESIGN A qualitative exploratory study was conducted. SETTINGS The Nursing Department of the European University of Madrid, and the Red Cross College of Nursing. PARTICIPANTS Eighteen nursing students were recruited, aged between 18 and 65 years old, enrolled in the fourth year of Nursing Studies and who were hired under a relief contract for health professionals during the pandemic. METHODS Purposive sampling was used. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were carried out using a question guide. Interviews were conducted in a private video chat room platform. Also, a thematic, inductive analysis was performed. This study was conducted according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS Four specific themes emerged: a) The students' role during the relief contract; b) The learning process during the pandemic; c) Barriers to learning; and d) A unique learning opportunity. The students had an undefined mixed role, which hindered their skills and activities. Learning was self-directed, sometimes through trial and error, and through experiencing critical events. Time constraints and having to learn under pressure were experienced as difficulties for learning. Nevertheless, this was a unique professional learning opportunity. The students learned to be organized and effective, acknowledge their limitations, gain confidence, face their fears, and mature. CONCLUSIONS These results can help inform nurse training programs and improve the organization and incorporation of nurses in health care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Velarde-García, Juan Francisco; Cachón-Pérez, Jose Miguel; Rodríguez-García, Marta; Oliva-Fernández, Oscar; González-Sanz, Pilar; Espejo, Marta Mas; González-Hervías, Raquel; Álvarez-Embarba, Beatriz; Moro-López-Menchero, Paloma; Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Palacios-Ceña, Domingo",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965720/,1
68452,To sleep: perchance to ditch the ventilator.,2018,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are so-named because they interfere with viral infection in vertebrate cells. The study of cellular responses to type I IFNs led to the discovery of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which also governs the response to other cytokine families. We review here the outcome of viral infections in mice and humans with engineered and inborn deficiencies, respectively, of (i) IFNAR1 or IFNAR2, selectively disrupting responses to type I IFNs, (ii) STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, also impairing cellular responses to type II (for STAT1) and/or III (for STAT1, STAT2, IRF9) IFNs, and (iii) JAK1 and TYK2, also impairing cellular responses to cytokines other than IFNs. A picture is emerging of greater redundancy of human type I IFNs for protective immunity to viruses in natural conditions than was initially anticipated. Mouse type I IFNs are essential for protection against a broad range of viruses in experimental conditions. These findings suggest that various type I IFN-independent mechanisms of human cell-intrinsic immunity to viruses have yet to be discovered. This article is protected by copyright.

69543,Extracellular vesicles and infectious diseases: new complexity to an old story.,2016,"COVID-19 has involved numerous countries across the globe and the disease burden, susceptible age group; mortality rate has been variable depending on the demographical profile, economic status, and health care infrastructure. In the current clinical environment, COVID-19 is one of the most important clinical differential diagnoses in patients presenting with respiratory symptoms. The optimal mechanical ventilation strategy for these patients has been a constant topic of discussion and very importantly so, since a great majority of these patients require invasive mechanical ventilation and often for an extended period of time. In this report we highlight our experience with a COVID-19 patient who most likely suffered barotrauma either as a result of traumatic endotracheal intubation or primarily due to COVID-19 itself. We also aim to highlight the current literature available to suggest the management strategy for these patients for a favorable outcome. The cases described are diverse in terms of age variance and other comorbidities. According to the literature, certain patients, with COVID-19 disease and spontaneous pneumothorax were noted to be managed conservatively and oxygen supplementation with nasal cannula sufficed. Decision regarding need and escalation to invasive mechanical ventilation should be taken early in the disease to avoid complications such as patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) and barotrauma sequelae such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum Recent systematic review further supports the fact that the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in certain patients with COVID-19 pneumonia may give a false sense of security and clinical stabilization but has no overall benefit to avoid intubation. While invasive mechanical ventilation may be associated with higher rates of barotrauma, this should not mean that intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be delayed. This becomes an important consideration when non-intensivists or personnel with less experience provide care for this vulnerable patient population who may rely too heavily on NIV to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation.","Lal, Amos; Mishra, Ajay Kumar; Akhtar, Jamal; Nabzdyk, Christoph",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926176/,1

This work evaluated the performance of a novel growth tube collector (GTC), which utilizes laminar-flow water-based condensation to facilitate particle growth, for the collection of airborne MS2 viruses. METHODS AND RESULTS Fine aerosols (<500 nm) containing MS2 coliphage were generated from a Collison nebulizer, conditioned by a dilution dryer and collected by a GTC and a BioSampler. The GTC effectively condensed water vapour onto the virus particles, creating droplets 2-5 μm in diameter, which facilitated collection. Comparison of particle counts upstream and downstream revealed that the GTC collected >93% of the inlet virus particles, whereas the BioSampler's efficiency was about 10%. Viable counts of the GTC-collected viruses were also one order of magnitude higher than those of the BioSampler (P = 0·003). CONCLUSION The efficiency of the GTC for the viable collection of MS2 viruses exceeds that of industry standard instrument, the BioSampler, by a factor of 10-100. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY This study reveals that the GTC is an effective collector of viable MS2 aerosols, and concludes the instrument will be an effective tool for studying viable virus aerosols and the inhalation risks posed by airborne viruses.","Pan, M; Eiguren-Fernandez, A; Hsieh, H; Afshar-Mohajer, N; Hering, S V; Lednicky, J; Hugh Fan, Z; Wu, C-Y",Journal of applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jam.13051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751045/,1

Does histology of thrombi influence the effectiveness of thrombectomy?,2018,"OBJECTIVE Maintenance of certification is a relatively new concept in the United States, and there is no mandatory retirement for surgeons. Our aim was to compare technical and team performance of surgeons of different ages in a simulated laparoscopic surgical crisis and validate a potential recredentialing tool for surgeons. METHODS Using a single-blinded protocol, the performance of six ""Seasoned"" surgeons >55 years (mean 64, range 55-83) was compared to six ""control"" surgeons <55 years (mean 46, range 34-53) in a simulation. Surgical teams established pneumoperitoneum, trocar access, and managed intraabdominal hemorrhage in a simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomy while videotaped as part of an IRB protocol. Surgeons' performance was scored using validated technical and team performance scales. RESULTS All of the ""seasoned"" surgeons relegated the use of unfamiliar technology to their assistants. All control surgeons achieved intraabdominal pneumoperitoneum themselves. Mean blood loss for seasoned surgeons and control surgeons was 2,555 versus 2,725 ml (NS), respectively. After recognition of bleeding in the unstable patient, senior surgeons converted to an urgent laparotomy case after 2.4 vs. 3.3 min for control group (NS). No difference was observed in overall technical and team abilities (p = NS). On debriefing, 85% of surgeons recommended simulation for training and recertification. CONCLUSIONS Seasoned surgeons can use their assistant surgeon well to assure a safe and effective operation. Mandatory operating room retirement based on age may be arbitrary and should be replaced by performance measures. Simulation may prove a valuable tool for self -assessment and recredentialing.","Powers, Kinga; Rehrig, Scott T; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Callery, Mark P; Jones, Daniel B",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-009-0802-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19190969/,1
70369,Investigation of a New Version of the Liquid Embolic Agent PHIL with Extra-Low-Viscosity in an Endovascular Embolization Model.,2018,"BACKGROUND In chronic heart failure many patients have recurrent hospital admissions and it is the leading cause of admission in people aged over 65 years. In those with end-stage heart failure, there is limited evidence that furosemide can be given subcutaneously to relieve symptoms and avoid hospital admission. METHOD We initiated a community-based continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) furosemide service for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We aimed to increase patient choice, offer an alternative to hospital admission and, in patients at the end of their life, allow them to die at their preferred place of care with symptom alleviation. We retrospectively reviewed case notes. RESULTS 36 consecutive episodes of CSCI of treatment were recorded in 28 patients. 15 patients (54%) survived beyond the initial treatment course with 13 patients (87%) avoiding acute hospital admission. There was a reduction in mean hospital admission rates from 2.87 to 0.73 (p<0.001) in the 6-month periods either side of the first episode of CSCI furosemide. A median reduction of 4 kg weight loss was recorded. 13 patients died during the initial treatment course. 12 (92%) died at home and 1 died at the hospital palliative care unit. All had symptoms controlled. CONCLUSION Subcutaneous furosemide can be successfully delivered in the community. In addition to palliation in the final days of life, community subcutaneous furosemide can be an effective treatment leading to weight loss and improved symptoms with survival for several months.","Brown, Andrew; Westley, Katharine; Robson, Judith; Armstrong, Leonie; Matthews, Iain; Runnett, Craig; Ripley, David; Thomas, Honey",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2019-002158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647034/,1

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Responses were sought from Tennessee adults 18 to 64 years of age who were not healthcare providers. The survey instrument focused on vaccine-related beliefs, prior and planned influenza and pneumococcal vaccine use, and attitudes toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Inferential statistics assessed survey responses, and logistic regression determined predictors of the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS A total of 1,000 completed responses were analyzed (a 62.9% response rate), and respondents were mostly White (80.1%), insured (79.6%), and/or actively working (64.2%); the sample was well balanced by gender, age, income, and political leaning. Approximately one-third (34.4%) of respondents indicated some historical vaccine hesitancy, and only 21.4% indicated always getting a seasonal influenza vaccination. More than half (54.1%) indicated at least some hesitancy toward vaccination against COVID-19, with 32.1% citing lack of evidence of vaccine effectiveness as the leading reason. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was more likely among those with more moderate (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.749-3.607) or conservative (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.048-4.421) political leanings, Black Americans (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.182-2.742), and residents of nonmetropolitan areas (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.386-2.865). CONCLUSION Subgroups of the population may prove more challenging to vaccinate against COVID-19, requiring targeted approaches to addressing hesitancy to ensure more-vulnerable populations are adequately covered.","Gatwood, Justin; McKnight, Madison; Fiscus, Michelle; Hohmeier, Kenneth C; Chisholm-Burns, Marie",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954426/,1

The UK government introduced strict social distancing measures on 23rd March 2020, with the country put into a full lockdown to further halt the spread of the virus.The aims of this article are to ascertain whether there was a rise in the incidence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) presentations to the emergency department at a level one trauma center associated with the introduction of lockdown measures. METHOD An observational study from a level one trauma center was carried out. Retrospective data from 23rd March 2020 to 1st May 2020 was collected and compared to the same time period in 2019. Data was collected from coded electronic patient records. RESULTS Total attendances to the Emergency Department (ED) reduced from 2019 to 2020 (5198 and 3059 respectively). There was a significant increase in the total number of self-harm presentations between 2019 and 2020 (103 vs 113, p-value <0.001) as well as paracetamol, NSAID and opiate overdoses, with more cases requiring hospital admission in 2020 vs 2019. CONCLUSIONS Societal lockdown measures secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant effect on the mental health of patients. One way this can be detected is through an increased incidence and severity of deliberate self-harm injuries presenting to the ED.

After a short discussion on the concept of emerging issues, the authors present some past examples of public health programs. These examples (malaria, dengue, chikungunya and cholera) are used to propose optimized ways of decision/action that may help to avoid possible crisis in a rapidly changing world. Then, the different lessons learnt are, under certain limits, associated with a forecasting analysis.","Manigat, Roberte; Wallet, France; André, Jean-Claude",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,https://doi.org/10.4415/ann_10_03_02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20847454/,1
71591,Digital systems for improving outcomes in patients with primary immune defects.,2020-10-13,"Social distancing guidelines during COVID can be isolating, especially for older adults, with potential for poor health outcomes. Technology offers opportunities for remote connection, yet, older adults' use of and perspectives on technology during this time remain largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to gain insight into older adults' technology use and preferences to inform the development of a technology training intervention to support older adult well-being. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 older adults. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative, constant comparison approach. Findings were consistent with Socioemotional Selectivity Theory; respondents were primarily interested in technology to support emotionally meaningful goals. Participants indicated limited interest in technology training, referencing diminished future time perspectives to explain disinterest. Findings suggest that efforts to encourage older adults' expanded technology adoption should highlight how use supports emotionally meaningful goals and provide low-effort, timely training, tied to specific and clear applications.","Bardach, Shoshana H; Rhodus, Elizabeth K; Parsons, Kelly; Gibson, Allison K",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464821996864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648357/,1

A single-day point prevalence survey was conducted on January 18, 2020, in 53 referral/tertiary hospitals in 22 countries. 1957 (17%) of 11557 patients presenting to EDs had infections. The mean qSOFA score was 0.37 ± 0.74. Sepsis (qSOFA ≥ 2) was recorded in 218 (11.1%) patients. The mean qSOFA score was significantly higher in low-middle (1.48 ± 0.963) compared to upper-middle (0.17 ± 0.482) and high-income (0.36 ± 0.714) countries (P < 0.001). Eight (3.7%) patients with sepsis were treated as outpatients. The most common diagnoses were upper-respiratory (n = 877, 43.3%), lower-respiratory (n = 316, 16.1%), and lower-urinary (n = 201, 10.3%) infections. 1085 (55.4%) patients received antibiotics. The most-commonly used antibiotics were beta-lactam (BL) and BL inhibitors (n = 307, 15.7%), third-generation cephalosporins (n = 251, 12.8%), and quinolones (n = 204, 10.5%). Irrational antibiotic use and inappropriate hospitalization decisions seemed possible. Patients were more septic in countries with limited resources. Hence, a better organizational scheme is required.","Erdem, Hakan; Hargreaves, Sally; Ankarali, Handan; Caskurlu, Hulya; Ceviker, Sevil Alkan; Bahar-Kacmaz, Asiye; Meric-Koc, Meliha; Altindis, Mustafa; Yildiz-Kirazaldi, Yasemin; Kizilates, Filiz; Alsalman, Jameela; Cag, Yasemin; Kamal, Abu Hena Mostafa; Dokmetas, Ilyas; Dindar-Demiray, Emine Kubra; Shehata, Ghaydaa Ahmed; Hasman, Hakan; Sadykova, Ainur; Llopis, Ferran; Ramosaco, Ergys; Logar, Mateja; Alay, Handan; Kesmez-Can, Fatma; Ruch, Yvon; Bulut, Dilek; Makek, Mateja Jankovic; Marino, Andrea; Mahboob, Amjad; El-Kholy, Amani; Abdallah, Dirar; Sefa-Sayar, Merve; Karaali, Ridvan; Aslan, Selda; Dar, Razi Even; Abdalla, Esam; Monzón-Camps, Helena; Baljić, Rusmir; Mgdalena, Dumitru Irina; Naghili, Behrouz; Abbas Dafalla, Mohamed Elhassan; Alwashmi, Ameen S S; Carmen, Cernat Roxana; Ramirez-Estrada, Sergio; Wojewodzka-Zelezniakowicz, Marzena; Akyildiz, Ozay; Zajkowska, Joanna; El-Sokkary, Rehab; Pandya, Nirav; Amer, Fatma; Alavi-Darazam, Ilad; Grgić, Svjetlana; Wegdan, Ahmed Ashraf; El-Kholy, Jehan; Bulut-Avsar, Cansu; Kulzhanova, Sholpan; Tasbakan, Meltem; Kumari, Hema Prakash; Dirani, Natalia; Koganti, Kalyan; Konkayev, Aidos K; Petrov, Michael M; Cascio, Antonio; Liskova, Anna; Del Vecchio, Rosa Fontana; Lambertenghi, Lorenza; Mladenov, Nikolay; Oncu, Serkan; Rello, Jordi",Journal of chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/1120009x.2020.1863696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734040/,1

This review covers the literature until May 2020 centered on the early prediction of the viability of in vitro developed embryos using several analytical techniques, including NMR. Nowadays, the predominant non-invasive technique for selecting viable embryos is based on morphology, where variables associated with the rate of cleavage and blastocyst formation are evaluated by the embryologist following standardized criteria that are somewhat subjective. This morphological approach is therefore inadequate for the prediction of embryo quality, and several studies have focused on developing new non-invasive methods using molecular approaches based particularly on metabolomics. This review outlines the potential of NMR as one of these non-invasive in vitro methods based on the analysis of spent embryo culture media.","Salmerón, Ana M; Abreu, Ana Cristina; Vilches-Ferrón, Miguel; Fernández, Ignacio",NMR in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955062/,1

Rapidly evolving technologies combined with state-of-the-art data analyses open new horizons to probe brain activity, but selecting appropriate imaging modalities from the plethora of available techniques can be challenging for clinicians. This update reviews selected advances in neuroimaging that demonstrate clinical relevance and translational potential in the assessment of severely brain-injured patients with DoC. RECENT FINDINGS Magnetic resonance imaging and high-density electroencephalography provide measurements of brain connectivity between functional networks, assessments of language function, detection of covert consciousness, and prognostic markers of recovery. Positron emission tomography can identify patients with preserved brain metabolism despite clinical unresponsiveness and can measure glucose consumption rates in targeted brain regions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and near-infrared spectroscopy are noninvasive and practical tools with promising clinical applications. SUMMARY Each neuroimaging technique conveys advantages and pitfalls to assess consciousness. We recommend a multimodal approach in which complementary techniques provide diagnostic and prognostic information about brain function. Patients demonstrating neuroimaging evidence of covert consciousness may benefit from early adapted rehabilitation. Translating methodological advances to clinical care will require the implementation of recently published international guidelines and the integration of neuroimaging techniques into patient-centered decision-making algorithms.","Sanz, Leandro R D; Thibaut, Aurore; Edlow, Brian L; Laureys, Steven; Gosseries, Olivia",Current opinion in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054109/,1
72782,Validation of an 'endovascular-first' approach to spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas: an intention-to-treat analysis.,2017,"On the 20th of March 2020, triggered by the public health emergency declared, the Health Authorities in Madrid reported a legal instruction (Orden 371/2020) indicating the organization of a provisional hospital to admit patients with COVID-19 at the Trade Fair Institution (IFEMA). Several pharmacists working in the Pharmacy and Medical Devices Department of the Madrid Regional Health Service were called to manage the Pharmacy Department of the abovementioned hospital. Required permissions to set up a PD were here authorized urgently. Tackling human and material resources, and computer systems for drug purchase and electronic prescription, were some of the initial issues that hindered the pharmaceutical provision required for patients from the very day one. Once the purchase was assured, mainly by direct purchase from suppliers, drug dispensing up to 1,250 hospitalized patients (25 nursing units) and 8 ICU patients was taken on. Dispensing was carried out through either drug stocks in the nursing units or individual patient dispensing for certain drugs. Moreover, safety issues related to prescription were considered, and as the electronic prescription was implemented we attained 100% prescriptions review and validation. The constitution of a multidisciplinary Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee let agree to a pharmacotherapy guide, pres cription protocols, therapeutic equivalences, interactions, and drug dispensing circuits. The Pharmacy Department strategy was to ensure a very quick response to basic tasks keeping the aim to offer a pharmaceutical care of the highest quality whenever possible. Working under a health emergency situation, with many uncertainties and continuous pressure was a plight. However, the spirit of collaboration in and out of the Pharmacy Department was aligned with the whole hospital motivation to offer the highest quality of healthcare. These were possibly the keys to allow caring for almost 4,000 patients during the 42 days that the hospital lasted.","Aranguren-Oyarzábal, Ainhoa; Segura-Bedmar, María; Calvo-Alcántara, María José",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533673/,1

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of 193 women who underwent sacrocolpopexy with 2 different types of sutures attaching polypropylene mesh to the vagina: delayed absorbable sutures (median follow-up, 43 weeks) and permanent sutures (median follow-up, 106 weeks). Vaginal apical failure was defined as Point C greater than or equal to half of the total vaginal length. Anterior-posterior compartmental failures were defined as Point Ba and/or Point Bp more than 0 cm. Fisher exact and χ2 tests were used to compare failure rates. There were no documented suture erosions in the delayed absorbable monofilament suture group during the review period. Two patients in the permanent suture group were found to have permanent suture in the bladder more than 30 weeks after the index procedure. RESULTS Failure rates for the 45 subjects in the delayed absorbable group and 148 subjects in the permanent suture group were similar (4.4% vs 3.4%, p = 0.74) and not statistically different in any compartment: apical (0% vs 1.4%, p = 0.43), anterior (4.4% vs 2%, p = 0.38), or posterior (0% vs 1.4%, p = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS Delayed absorbable monofilament suture appears to be a reasonable alternative to permanent suture for mesh attachment to the vagina during sacrocolpopexy. The use of delayed absorbable suture could potentially prevent complications of suture erosion into the bladder or vagina remote from the time of surgery.","Tan-Kim, Jasmine; Menefee, Shawn A; Lippmann, Quinn; Lukacz, Emily S; Luber, Karl M; Nager, Charles W",The Permanente journal,https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/14-022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662525/,1

Methods: We have explored the potential role of estrogens in this COVID-19 gendered impact. Results: Estrogens stimulate the humoral response to viral infections, while testosterone and progesterone give an immune suppression of both innate and cell-mediated immune responses. We hypothesise that estrogens, in particular estradiol but also synthetic estrogen such as ethinylestradiol, could protect women from the most serious complications of COVID-19. The use of medications that keep hormonal levels high and stable, such as combined hormonal contraceptive, could therefore play a protective role.

In this analysis, we examine the effect of PCDT in patients with femoral-popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (without involvement of more proximal veins). PATIENTS AND METHODS Within the ATTRACT trial, 300 patients had DVT involving the femoral vein without involvement of the common femoral or iliac veins and were randomized to receive PCDT with anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone (no PCDT). Patients were followed for 24 months. RESULTS From 6 to 24 months, between the PCDT versus no PCDT arms, there was: no difference in any PTS (Villalta scale ≥ 5: risk ratio [RR] = 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-1.24); moderate-or-severe PTS (Villalta scale ≥ 10: RR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.57-1.52); severity of PTS scores; or general or disease-specific quality of life (p > 0.5 for all comparisons). From baseline to both 10 and 30 days, there was no difference in improvement of leg pain or swelling between treatment arms. From baseline to 10 days, major bleeding occurred in three versus none (p = 0.06) and any bleeding occurred in eight versus two (p = 0.032) PCDT versus no PCDT patients. Over 24 months, recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 16 PCDT and 12 no PCDT patients (p = 0.24). CONCLUSION In patients with femoral-popliteal DVT, PCDT did not improve short- or long-term efficacy outcomes, but it increased bleeding.

Quantifying retention time is fundamental for assessing biological impact and for the use of plastic as bioindicators of plastic pollution. Presumably, plastic is retained in the grinding section of the stomach (gizzard or ventriculus) until ground small enough and particles then pass into intestines and are defecated. We assume that particle size is related to time in the ventriculus and compared size of plastic particles in juveniles, which were exposed to plastic for a known time, to non-juveniles which were exposed for an unknown longer period. Plastic particles from Northern Fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) were of similar size between groups suggesting similar wear and retention time. Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) juveniles contained larger particles than adults suggesting particles retained in adults were worn down and thus held for a longer period.","Nania, Tessa G; Shugart, Gary W",Marine pollution bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399276/,1
74700,Importance of repeat angiography in the diagnosis of iatrogenic anterior cerebral artery territory pseudoaneurysm following endoscopic sinus surgery.,2016,"BACKGROUND Cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) is a neurological disease, hallmarked by remarkable low concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The primary causes of CFD include the presence of folate receptor (FR) autoantibodies, defects of FR encoding gene FOLR1, mitochondrial diseases and congenital abnormalities in folate metabolism. CASE PRESENTATION Here we first present a Chinese male CFD patient whose seizure onset at 2 years old with convulsive status epilepticus. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed the development of encephalomalacia, laminar necrosis in multiple lobes of the brain and cerebellar atrophy. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) uncovered a homozygous missense variant of c.524G > T (p.C175F) in FOLR1 gene. Further laboratory tests demonstrated the extremely low level of 5-MTHF in the CSF from this patient, which was attributed to cerebral folate transport deficiency. Following the intravenous and oral treatment of calcium folinate, the concentrations of 5-MTHF in CSF were recovered to the normal range and seizure symptoms were relieved as well. CONCLUSIONS One novel variation of FOLR1 was firstly identified from a Chinese male patient with tonic-clonic seizures, developmental delay, and ataxia. The WES and laboratory results elucidated the etiology of the symptoms. Clinical outcomes were improved by early diagnosis and proper treatment.","Zhang, Ciliu; Deng, Xiaolu; Wen, Yafei; He, Fang; Yin, Fei; Peng, Jing",BMC medical genetics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12881-020-01162-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243190/,1

74984,Percutaneous Renal Tumor Ablation: Radiation Exposure During Cryoablation and Radiofrequency Ablation.,2016,"BACKGROUND Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is the standard of care for the surgical treatment of non-spinal osteoid osteoma and has greatly reduced morbidity associated with surgical excision. Precise placement of the RF ablation probe is necessary to avoid incomplete ablation. Limiting radiation exposure is especially advantageous in the pediatric population in whom osteoid osteoma frequently occurs. The aim of this study was to compare the radiation dosimetry and clinical outcomes among patients treated with RF ablation using three different localization techniques. METHODS Case-control methods were used to analyze sixty-six cases. Patients were categorized into three treatment groups: (1) intraoperative three-dimensional cone-beam CT (computed tomography) imaging (O-Arm) with surgical navigation (StealthStation S7), (2) intraoperative three-dimensional imaging (O-Arm) only, and (3) radiology suite-based diagnostic CT imaging. Radiation dosimetry and clinical outcome were analyzed with use of the dose-length product and local-relapse-free survival, respectively. RESULTS Mean age was nineteen years for the twenty-three patients in group 1, twenty years for the seven patients in group 2, and nineteen years for the thirty-six patients in group 3. Mean follow-up was fifty-three months. The mean radiation dose for groups 1, 2, and 3 was 446.62, 379.78, and 1058.83 mGy-cm, respectively. Significant (p < 0.05) differences in the radiation dose existed between groups 1 and 3 and between groups 2 and 3, whereas no difference was found between groups 1 and 2. Local-remission-free survival at three years for groups 1, 2, and 3 was 84.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.5% to 100%), 100% (95% CI, 100% to 100%), and 90.7% (95% CI, 80.7% to 100%), respectively. Fifty-eight (92%) of the sixty-three followed patients were asymptomatic at the latest follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS RF ablation using intraoperative cone-beam CT imaging, with or without surgical navigation, was associated with a significantly lower radiation dose compared with ablation using a radiology suite-based CT technique. Ablation using each of the three imaging techniques was equally effective in treating osteoid osteomas with a similar risk of relapse.","Cheng, Edward Y; Naranje, Sameer M; Ritenour, E Russell",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

75257,Impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis control in China.,2020-05-01,"Societal events - such as natural disasters, political shifts, or economic downturns - are time-varying and impact the learning potential of students in unique ways. These impacts are likely accentuated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which precipitated an abrupt and wholesale transition to online education. Unfortunately, the individual-level consequences of these events are difficult to determine because the extant literature focuses on single-occasion surveys that produce only group-level inferences. To better understand individual-level variability in stress and learning, intensive longitudinal data can be leveraged. The goal of this paper is to illustrate this by discussing three different techniques for the analysis of intensive longitudinal data: (1) regression analyses; (2) multilevel models; and (3) person-specific network models, (e.g., group iterative multiple model estimation; GIMME). For each technique, a brief background in the context of education research is provided, an illustrative analysis is presented using data from college students who completed a 75-day intensive longitudinal study of cognition, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and intellectual interests during the 2016 U.S. Presidential election - a period of heightened sociopolitical stress - and strengths and limitations are considered.

As a new biotechnology, suprachoroidal injections of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) containing a reporter plasmid induce reporter expression in rat photoreceptors and RPE throughout the entire eye and maintain expression for at least 8 months. Multiple injections markedly increase expression. Suprachoroidal injection of NPs containing a VEGF expression plasmid caused severe subretinal neovascularization progressing to subretinal fibrosis, similar to what occurs in untreated patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, providing a new model and proof of concept for level and duration of expression. Suprachoroidal injection of NPs containing a VEGF-binding protein expression plasmid significantly suppressed VEGF-induced vascular leakage and neovascularization demonstrating therapeutic potential. These data suggest that nonviral NP suprachoroidal gene transfer may provide a noninvasive, repeatable alternative to subretinal injection of viral vectors.","Shen, Jikui; Kim, Jayoung; Tzeng, Stephany Y; Ding, Kun; Hafiz, Zibran; Long, Da; Wang, Jiangxia; Green, Jordan J; Campochiaro, Peter A",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba1606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937452/,1

75783,Rare complication of anterior communicating artery aneurysm coiling: Transient retrograde amnesia.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit not only respiratory symptoms but also symptoms of chemo-sensitive disorders. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins using immunohistochemistry, in the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, and lung of rats. RESULTS Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the taste buds of the tongue, nasal epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, and alveoli with varying degrees of expression. Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was more distinct in the peripheral alveoli than in the central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, and respiratory dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated the COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by TMPRSS2 expression. This study might provide potential clues for further investigation of the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Sato, Taku; Ueha, Rumi; Goto, Takao; Yamauchi, Akihito; Kondo, Kenji; Yamasoba, Tatsuya",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.29132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940922/,1
75785,COVID-19 and TB control in immigrant communities.,2020-09-01,"Fluorescent and computational methods were used to elucidate the binding expedient of 2-carbamido-1,3-indandione (CAID) tautomers to nucleotides. The dependence of the fluorescence emission of CAID loaded nucleic acids sequences to compound concentration, temperature and time variation was investigated. It was found that the subject compound binds to nucleic acids but does not intercalate. According to our quantum-chemical calculations on the conjugation between CAID and nucleotides, the binding in the formed complexes may be through hydrogen bonds. Two possible types of complexes were considered - CAID to the phosphate group and CAID to the nucleobase. To estimate the binding affinity the interaction energies of the formed complexes were calculated. Tautomer 2-carboamide-1-hydroxy-3-oxo-indane is preferred in the formation of complexes and the phosphate group complexes were more stable. Generally, the guanosine and deoxyguanosine monophosphate complexes were the most preferred regardless of the complex type. Because of the lack of cytotoxic effect on untransformed cell lines of mouse embryo fibroblasts Balb/c 3T3 according to our previous report (Markova et al, (2017) Bulg Chem Commun, 49D, 221-226) and the affinity to nucleic acids, we can suggest that the subject compound could be suitable to be used as a novel type of fluorescent biomarker.","Stoyanova, Nina; Markova, Nadezhda; Angelov, Ivan; Philipova, Irena; Enchev, Venelin",Photochemistry and photobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393108/,1

The concept of a surge of infected patients resulting in an overwhelming number of critical patients has been a central concern in healthcare planning during the COVID-19 era. RECENT FINDINGS One crucial question remains as to how to manage patients with end stage renal disease and acute kidney injury in case of a massive surge of critically ill infected patients. Some publications address practical and ingenious solutions for just such a surge of need for renal replacement therapy. We present a plan for using a blood pump, readily available dialysis filter, and a prefilter and postfilter replacement fluid set up. This is in conjunction with multiple intravenous pumps to develop a simple hemofiltration apparatus. SUMMARY The current set up may be a readily available option for use in critical situations where the need for renal replacement therapy outstrips the capacity of traditional hemodialysis services in a hospital or region.","Hanna, Ramy M; Ferrey, Antoney; Rhee, Connie M; Sam, Ramin; Pearce, David; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Burl, Don",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnh.0000000000000658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186219/,1

As part of the advance care planning (ACP) process, staff nurses in the acute care setting are often involved in all of the above areas. It is yet unclear what nurses' roles and responsibilities are and what skills are needed in the ACP process. The themes that staff nurses and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) discuss in relationship to ACP are manifold. This scoping review demonstrates that staff nurses' core role is advocating for the wishes and values of patients with any life-limiting disease. Staff nurses also serve as facilitators, educators, and advocates to help start ACP conversations and ease patients' transitions between settings based on well-discussed decisions. To be able to engage in ACP discussions, APRNs must have excellent communication skills. Continuous training to improve these skills is mandatory. In the future, clarifying the contribution of staff nurses and APRNs in the ACP process in relation to other members of the interprofessional team can lay the groundwork for improved interprofessional collaboration.","Fliedner, Monica; Halfens, Ruud J G; King, Cynthia R; Eychmueller, Steffen; Lohrmann, Christa; Schols, Jos M G A",Journal of hospice and palliative nursing : JHPN : the official journal of the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/njh.0000000000000715; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284145/,1

METHODS Retrospective chart review. Statistical analyses with SPSS. RESULTS PATIENTS 4 stage II/III cervical carcinoma, 75 clinical stage I/II endometrial carcinoma, 36 clinically stage I/II tubal/ovarian cancer. 36 transperitoneal approaches; 79 extraperitoneal approaches. Both groups had similar age, 58years (range 29-80), BMI of 25 (range 18-41), blood loss, 150cm(3) (range 25-1500), and hospital stay, 1day (range 1-6). The extraperitoneal surgery took longer (240 v 202min; p=.001); yielded more nodes (50 v 41; p=.004). Extraperitoneal approach yielded more inframesenteric (14 v 10; p=.036), and infrarenal nodes (14 v 9; p=.001). 25% of cervical, 19% of endometrial and 14% of ovarian cancer patients had metastases in radiographically negative infrarenal nodes. 50% of cervical, 33% of endometrial and 17% of ovarian cancer patients had therapy altered by aortic lymphadenectomy. When the inframesenteric nodes were positive, 63% of endometrial and 80% of ovarian cancer patients had infrarenal metastases. More metastases were identified with increasing aortic node count. Extraperitoneal lymphadenectomy had no learning curve (p=0.320), while transperitoneal lymphadenectomy did (p=0.016). Higher BMI patients had lower aortic node yields by transperitoneal (p=.057) but not extraperitoneal approach (p=.578). Among the 14 patients whose BMI was 35-41, mean extraperitoneal total aortic nodal yield was 30; transperitoneal yield was 6. CONCLUSIONS Infrarenal aortic lymphadenectomy may offer higher aortic nodal yields, even in patients with BMI's of 45. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm whether this dissection in high-risk patients ensures more accurate therapy, and possibly improves cure rates.","O'Hanlan, Katherine A; Sten, Margaret S; O'Holleran, Michael S; Ford, Niesha N; Struck, Danielle M; McCutcheon, Stacey P",Gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygyno.2015.09.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26407477/,1

The objectives of this study were to investigate the RSV circulation among children aged <5 years in Bulgaria, to identify the RSV-A and RSV-B genotypes and to perform an amino acid sequence analysis of second hypervariable region (HVR2) of the G gene. During the 2014/15 and 2015/16 winter seasons, nasopharyngeal specimens of 610 children aged <5 years with ARI were tested using Real Time RT-PCR for influenza viruses, RSV, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected in 429 (70%) out of 610 patients examined and RSV was the most frequently identified virus (26%) followed by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (14%) (p < .05). RSV was the most prevalent pathogen in patients with bronchiolitis (48%) and pneumonia (38%). In the 2014/15 season, RSV-A dominated slightly (53%), while in the next season RSV-B viruses prevailed more strongly (66%). The phylogenetic analysis based on the G gene indicated that all 21 studied RSV-A strains belonged to the ON1 genotype; the vast majority (96%) of the RSV-B strains were classified into BA9 genotype and only one - into BA10 genotype. All Bulgarian RSV-A and RSV-B sequences contained a 72-nt and a 60-nt duplication in the HVR2, respectively. The study showed the leading role of this pathogen as a causative agent of serious respiratory illnesses in early childhood, year-on-year fluctuations in RSV incidence, a shift from RSV-A to RSV-B subgroup dominance and relatively low genetic divergence in the circulating strains.","Korsun, Neli; Angelova, Svetla; Tzotcheva, Iren; Georgieva, Irina; Lazova, Snezhina; Parina, Snezhana; Alexiev, Ivaylo; Perenovska, Penka",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2017.1375708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28948867/,1

OBJECTIVE To characterize the additional costs associated with endovascular treatment of basilar tip aneurysms rather than microsurgical clipping. MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained clinical records and billing information for 141 basilar tip aneurysms treated with clip ligation (n=48) or endovascular embolization (n=93). Costs included direct and indirect costs associated with index hospitalization, as well as re-treatments, follow-up visits, imaging studies, rehabilitation, and disability. Effectiveness of treatment was quantified by converting functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score) into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was performed using cost/QALY ratios. RESULTS Average index hospitalization costs were significantly higher for patients with unruptured aneurysms treated with clip ligation ($71 400 ± $47 100) compared with coil embolization ($33 500 ± $22 600), balloon-assisted coiling ($26 200 ± $11 600), and stent-assisted coiling ($38 500 ± $20 900). Multivariate predictors for higher index hospitalization cost included vasospasm requiring endovascular intervention, placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, longer length of stay, larger aneurysm neck and width, higher Hunt-Hess grade, and treatment-associated complications. At 1 year, endovascular treatment was associated with lower cost/QALY than clip ligation in unruptured aneurysms ($52 000/QALY vs $137 000/QALY, respectively, p=0.006), but comparable rates in ruptured aneurysms ($193 000/QALY vs $233 000/QALY, p=0.277). Multivariate predictors for higher cost/QALY included worse mRS score at discharge, procedural complications, and larger aneurysm width. CONCLUSIONS Coil embolization of basilar tip aneurysms is associated with a lower cost/QALY. This effect is sustained during follow-up. Clinical condition at discharge is the most significant predictor of overall cost/QALY at 1 year.","Abecassis, Isaac Josh; Sen, Rajeev; Kelly, Cory Michael; Levy, Samuel; Barber, Jason; Ghodke, Basavaraj; Levitt, Michael; Kim, Louis J; Sekhar, Laligam N",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-014747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31239332/,1

This preliminary study aimed to understand the implications of school closures on SBHC operations. Survey data were collected from a convenience sample of representatives from 427 SBHCs, representing approximately one sixth of SBHCs nationwide. When schools closed in spring 2020, 77% of SBHCs closed temporarily, 5% closed permanently, and 12% remained physically open. Telehealth was a crucial strategy used to continue delivering essential services. The percentage reporting any telehealth service offering before and after school closures increased by over 200%. Yet they also reported challenges, including financial and policy restraints. Many SBHCs that closed temporarily did so because their host schools closed, suggesting that making arrangements to remain open if a similar situation to the COVID-19 pandemic should arise might be beneficial. SBHCs are a proven cost-effective model to deliver health care in resource-limited communities. These preliminary study results indicate that SBHCs maintained service delivery following school closures, though many faced challenges.

However, approaches to identifying inadequate diets in clinical practice remain inconsistent, and dietary interventions (on both individual and public health policy levels) frequently focus on facilitating 'healthy choices', with limited emphasis on structural constraints. We examine the ethical implications of introducing a routine question in the medical history about ability to access food. Not collecting data on food security means that clinicians are unable to identify people who may benefit from support on an individual level, unable to consider relevant dietary risk factors for disease and disease progression and unable to monitor population trends and inequalities in dietary access in order to design effective policy interventions. We argue that the current lack of routine screening for food insecurity is inconsistent with our approach to other health behaviours (eg, smoking and alcohol use), as well as with doctors' frequent informal role as gatekeepers to the food aid system, and recent calls for governmental action on food insecurity and health inequalities from individual clinicians and professional bodies. Potential ethical barriers to asking patients about food security are addressed, including concerns about stigma, limiting autonomy, fair resource allocation, unclear professional remits and clinicians' ability to offer effective interventions. We suggest that there is an ethical imperative for doctors to ask patients about their ability to access healthy food. Gathering this data provides a valuable first step in re-framing the social determinants of health as modifiable risks, rather than inevitable inequities.","Knight, Jessica Kate; Fritz, Zoe",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34261802/,1

Little is known about the challenges to advance care planning in this context, or the changes services made to adapt. AIM Describe the challenges that UK specialist palliative care services experienced regarding advance care planning during COVID-19 and changes made to support timely conversations. DESIGN Online survey of UK palliative/hospice services' response to COVID-19. Closed-ended responses are reported descriptively. Open-ended responses were analysed using a thematic Framework approach using the Social Ecological Model to understand challenges. RESPONDENTS Two hundred and seventy-seven services. RESULTS More direct advance care planning was provided by 38% of services, and 59% provided more support to others. Some challenges to advance care planning pre-dated the pandemic, whilst others were specific to/exacerbated by COVID-19. Challenges are demonstrated through six themes: complex decision making in the face of a new infectious disease; maintaining a personalised approach; COVID-19-specific communication difficulties; workload and pressure; sharing information; and national context of fear and uncertainty. Two themes demonstrate changes made to support: adapting local processes and adapting local structures. CONCLUSIONS Professionals and healthcare providers need to ensure advance care planning is individualised by tailoring it to the values, priorities, and ethnic/cultural/religious context of each person.

RESULTS 504 enrolled patients underwent unilateral or bilateral IHR (RAS, n = 159; open, n = 190; laparoscopic, n = 155) at 17 medical institutions from May 2016 through December 2018. Propensity score matching provided a balanced comparison: RAS versus open (n = 112 each) and RAS versus laparoscopic (n = 80 each). Overall, operative times were significantly different between the RAS and laparoscopic cases (83 vs. 65 min; p < 0.001). Fewer RAS patients required prescription pain medication than either open (49.5% vs. 80.0%; p < 0.001) or laparoscopic patients (45.3% vs. 65.4%; p = 0.013). Median number of prescription pain pills taken differed for RAS vs. open (0.5 vs. 15.5; p = 0.001) and were comparable for RAS vs laparoscopic (7.0 vs. 6.0; p = 0.482) among patients taking prescribed pain medication. Time to return to normal activities differed for RAS vs. open (3 vs. 4 days; p = 0.005) and were comparable for RAS vs. laparoscopic (4 vs. 4 days; p = 0.657). Median CCS scores through 3 months were comparable for the three approaches. Postoperative complication rates for the three groups also were comparable. One laparoscopic case was converted to open. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that IHR can be performed effectively with the robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, or open approaches. There was no difference in the median number of prescription pain medication pills taken between the RAS and laparoscopic groups. A difference was observed in the overall number of patients reporting the need to take prescription pain medication. Comparable operative times were observed for RAS unilateral IHR patients compared to open unilateral IHR patients; however, operative times for RAS overall and bilateral subjects were longer than for open patients. Operative times were longer overall for RAS patients compared to laparoscopic patients; however, there was no difference in conversion and complication rate in the RAS vs. laparoscopic groups or the complication rate in the RAS vs. open group. Time to return to normal activities for RAS IHR patients was comparable to that of laparoscopically repaired patients and significantly sooner compared to open IHR patients.","LeBlanc, K; Dickens, E; Gonzalez, A; Gamagami, R; Pierce, R; Balentine, C; Voeller, G",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-020-02224-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32495043/,1

79761,PTPN14 aggravates inflammation through promoting proteasomal degradation of SOCS7 in acute liver failure.,2020-09-25,"Electrical manipulation of skyrmions attracts considerable attention for its rich physics and promising applications. To date, such a manipulation is realized mainly via spin-polarized current based on spin-transfer torque or spin-orbital torque effect. However, this scheme is energy consuming and may produce massive Joule heating. To reduce energy dissipation and risk of heightened temperatures of skyrmion-based devices, an effective solution is to use electric field instead of current as stimulus. Here, we realize an electric-field manipulation of skyrmions in a nanostructured ferromagnetic/ferroelectrical heterostructure at room temperature via an inverse magneto-mechanical effect. Intriguingly, such a manipulation is non-volatile and exhibits a multistate feature. Numerical simulations indicate that the electric-field manipulation of skyrmions originates from strain-mediated modification of effective magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our results open a direction for constructing low-energy-dissipation, non-volatile, and multistate skyrmion-based spintronic devices.","Wang, Yadong; Wang, Lei; Xia, Jing; Lai, Zhengxun; Tian, Guo; Zhang, Xichao; Hou, Zhipeng; Gao, Xingsen; Mi, Wenbo; Feng, Chun; Zeng, Min; Zhou, Guofu; Yu, Guanghua; Wu, Guangheng; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Wenhong; Zhang, Xi-Xiang; Liu, Junming",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17354-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681004/,1

80200,Novel Coronavirus: What Neuroradiologists Should Do.,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND Although dysmenorrhea is not a life-threatening condition, it can cause a substantial burden on individuals and communities. There is no data on the prevalence of dysmenorrhea in Kuwait. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea among female public high-school students in Kuwait and investigate factors associated with dysmenorrhea. METHODS A cross-sectional study using multistage cluster sampling with probability proportional to size method was conducted on 763 twelfth grade female public high-school students (aged 16-21 years). We used face-to-face interview with a structured questionnaire to collect data on dysmenorrhea and presumed risk factors. Weight and height of the students were measured using appropriate weight and height scales in a standardized manner. The association between dysmenorrhea and potential risk factors was assessed using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS The one-year prevalence of dysmenorrhea was found to be 85.6% (95%CI: 83.1-88.1%). Of the participants with dysmenorrhea, 26% visited a public or a private clinic for their pain and 4.1% were hospitalized for their menstrual pain. Furthermore, 58.2% of students with dysmenorrhea missed at least one school day and 13.9% missed at least one exam. Age of menarche (p-value = 0.005), regularity and flow of the menstrual period (p-value = 0.025, p-value = 0.009; respectively), and drinking coffee (p-value = 0.004) were significantly associated with dysmenorrhea in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION Dysmenorrhea seems to be highly prevalent among female high-school students in Kuwait, resembling that of high-income countries. Because of the scale of the problem, utilizing school nurses to reassure and manage students with primary dysmenorrhea and referring suspected cases of secondary dysmenorrhea is recommended.","Al-Matouq, Sharefah; Al-Mutairi, Hessah; Al-Mutairi, Ohood; Abdulaziz, Fatima; Al-Basri, Dana; Al-Enzi, Mona; Al-Taiar, Abdullah",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-019-1442-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30885151/,1

Microvesicular steatosis, inflammation, vascular congestion, and thrombosis in the liver have been described in autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. Several factors, including direct cytopathic effect of the virus, immune-mediated collateral damage, or an exacerbation of preexisting liver disease may contribute to liver pathology in COVID-19. Due to its immunological functions, the liver is an organ likely to participate in the viral response against SARS-CoV-2 and this may predispose it to injury. A better understanding of the mechanism contributing to liver injury is needed to develop and implement early measures to prevent serious liver damage in patients suffering from COVID-19. This review summarizes current reports of SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on how direct infection and subsequent severe inflammatory response may contribute to liver injury in patients with and without preexisting liver disease.","Lizardo-Thiebaud, Maria J; Cervantes-Alvarez, Eduardo; Limon-de la Rosa, Nathaly; Tejeda-Dominguez, Farid; Palacios-Jimenez, Mildred; Méndez-Guerrero, Osvely; Delaye-Martinez, Marco; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Fatima; Romero-Morales, Beatriz; Liu, Wei-Hui; Huang, Christene A; Kershenobich, David; Navarro-Alvarez, Nalu",Seminars in liver disease,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1715108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886936/,1
80318,Editorial: emerging respiratory infections in the 21st century.,2009,"Over the last year, significant steps have been made toward understanding the pathogenesis of esophageal diseases and translating this knowledge to clinical practice. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common outpatient diagnosis in gastroenterology and has a high prevalence in the general population. As many as 40% of patients with GERD have incomplete response to medical therapy, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying lack of response are now better understood. Novel medical and minimally invasive interventions are available to optimize management of GERD. Esophageal cancer, regardless of the histological subtype, has among the worst survival statistics among all malignancies. Taking advantage of technological advances in genome sequencing, the mutational spectra in esophageal cancer are now emerging, offering novel avenues for targeted therapies. Early diagnosis is another strand for improving survival. While genome-wide association studies are providing insights into genetic susceptibility, novel approaches to early detection of cancer are being devised through the use of biomarkers applied to esophageal samples and as part of imaging technologies. Dysmotility and eosinophilic esophagitis are the differential diagnoses in patients with dysphagia. New pathophysiological classifications have improved the management of motility disorders. Meanwhile, exciting progress has been made in the endoscopic management of these conditions. Eosinophilic esophagitis is still a relatively new entity, and the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. However, it is now clear that an allergic reaction to food plays an important role, and dietary interventions as well as biologic agents to block the inflammatory cascade are novel, promising fields of clinical research.","di Pietro, Massimiliano; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",F1000prime reports,https://doi.org/10.12703/p5-44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24167725/,1

In this study, fine epitope mapping and conservation analysis of linear B-cell epitopes on the PPRV NP has been undertaken using biosynthetic peptides. Nineteen linear B-cell epitopes were identified and their corresponding minimal motifs were located on the NP of PPRV China/Tibet/Geg/07-30. Conservation analysis indicated that ten of the 19 minimal motifs were conserved among 46 PPRV strains. Peptides containing the minimal motifs were recognized using anti-PPRV serum from a goat immunized with PPRV vaccine strain Nigeria 75/1. Identified epitopes and their motifs improve our understanding of the antigenic characteristics of PPRV NP and provide a basis for the development of epitope-based diagnostic assays.","Yu, Ruisong; Fan, Xiaoming; Xu, Wanxiang; Li, Wentao; Dong, Shijuan; Zhu, Yumin; He, Yaping; Tang, Haiping; Du, Rong; Li, Zhen",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25465659/,1

81119,Ventilator-induced lung injury.,2014,"Background The presence of extracranial carotid disease (ECD) is associated with less favorable clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by intracranial proximal occlusion. Acute intra-arterial treatment (IAT) in the setting of extracranial and intracranial lesions is considered challenging, and whether it yields improved outcomes remains uncertain. Objective To examine whether the presence of ECD modified the effect of IAT for intracranial proximal anterior circulation occlusion. Design Prespecified subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands. (Trial registrations: NTR1804 [Netherlands Trial Register] and ISRCTN10888758). Setting 16 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients Acute ischemic stroke caused by proximal intracranial arterial occlusion of the anterior circulation. Extracranial carotid disease was defined as cervical internal carotid artery stenosis (>50%) or occlusion. Intervention IAT treatment versus no IAT. Measurements The primary outcome was functional outcome, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days and reported as adjusted common odds ratio (acOR) for a shift in direction of a better outcome. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis with an interaction term was used to estimate treatment effect modification by ECD. Results The overall acOR was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.21 to 2.30) in favor of the intervention. The acOR was 3.1 (CI, 1.7 to 5.8) in the prespecified subgroup of patients with ECD versus 1.3 (CI, 0.9 to 1.9) in patients presenting without ECD. Both acORs are in favor of the intervention (P for interaction = 0.07). Limitation The study was not powered for subgroup analysis. Conclusion Intra-arterial treatment may be at least as effective in patients with ECD as in those without ECD, and it should not be withheld in these complex patients with acute ischemic stroke.

81511,Impact of Modified TICI 3 versus Modified TICI 2b Reperfusion Score to Predict Good Outcome following Endovascular Therapy.,2017,"OBJECTIVES To describe the short term capability of Australian intensive care units (ICUs) to increase capacity in response to heightened demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN Survey of ICU directors or delegated senior clinicians (disseminated 30 August 2021), supplemented by Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) registry data. SETTING All 194 public and private Australian ICUs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Numbers of currently available and potentially available ICU beds in case of a surge; available levels of ICU-relevant equipment and staff. RESULTS All 194 ICUs Australian responded to the survey. The total number of currently open staffed ICU beds was 2183, 195 fewer (8.2%) than in 2020; the decline was greater for rural/regional (18%) and private ICUs (18%). The reported maximal ICU bed capacity (5623) included 813 additional physical ICU bed spaces and 2627 ""surge areas"" outside ICUs. The number of available ventilators (7196) exceeded the maximum number of ICU beds. However, the reported available number of additional nursing staff would facilitate the immediate opening of 383 additional physical ICU beds (47%), but not the additional bed spaces outside ICUs. CONCLUSIONS The number of currently available staffed ICU beds was lower than in 2020. Equipment shortfalls have been remediated, with sufficient ventilators to equip every ICU bed. ICU capacity can be increased in response to demand, but is constrained by the availability of appropriately trained staff. Fewer than half the potentially additional physical ICU beds could be opened with currently available staff levels while maintaining pre-pandemic models of care.","Litton, Edward; Huckson, Sue; Chavan, Shaila; Bucci, Tamara; Holley, Anthony; Everest, Evan; Kelly, Sean; McGloughlin, Steven; Millar, Johnny; Nguyen, Nhi; Nicholls, Mark; Secombe, Paule; Pilcher, David",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642941/,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest CT images of pediatric patients with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. Computed tomography findings were divided into 3 groups: normal, consistent, and inconsistent with COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of CT were calculated by reference to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The study included patients with a mean age of 11.1 years (1 month-17 years). Of the patients, 43 (40.19%) had normal CT, 34 (31.77%) had CT findings consistent with COVID-19, and 30 (28.04%) had CT findings inconsistent with COVID-19. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CT were 47.92%, 81.36%, 67.65%, and 65.75%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Because the sensitivity of CT in the pediatric age group is low, it should be used cautiously for the evaluation of COVID-19 in the pediatric age group.","Rona, Günay; Voyvoda, Nuray; Arifoğlu, Meral; Karaaslan, Ayşe; Çetin, Ceren",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0000000000001127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186172/,1

Inappropriate colonoscopies might lead to unnecessary exams, increasing risks and costs. AIM To estimate the impact of colonoscopy appropriateness in terms of gain in additional diagnoses and sparing of unnecessary exams. METHODS Systematic review including studies reporting the prevalence of relevant findings, colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) according to colonoscopy appropriateness as defined by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and European Panel on Appropriateness of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. RESULTS Twenty-one studies with 19,822 patients were included. Colonoscopy was appropriate in 15,162 (71%, CI 64%-78%). Appropriateness significantly increased the probability of relevant findings (34% vs. 18%; RR 1.81, CI 1.53-2.14), CRC (7% vs. 2%; RR 3.62, CI 2.44-5.37) and IBD (6% vs. 4%; RR 1.86, CI 1.09-3.19). Appropriateness had sensitivity 88% (CI 85%-91%), 97% (CI 93%-98%) and 89% (CI 80%-94%), and specificity 24% (CI 20%-29%), 22% (CI 18%-26%) and 24% (CI 20%-28%) for relevant findings, CRC and IBD, respectively. On average, performing colonoscopy with appropriate indication would find 15 (CI 10-21) more relevant findings, five (CI 3-9) more CRCs and three (CI 1-9) more diagnoses of IBD per 100 patients, and save 24 (CI 20-29), 22 (CI 18-26) and 24 (CI 20-28) examinations per 100 patients for relevant findings, CRC and IBD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Appropriateness affects the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy for CRC, IBD and relevant findings.

Unfortunately, no effective drugs or vaccines have been reported yet. The main protease (MPRO) remains the most validated pharmacological target for the design and discovery of inhibitors. OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study was to find a prospective natural scaffold as an inhibitor for MPRO main protease in SARS-CoV-2 and compare it with repurposed antiviral drugs lopinavir and nelflinavir. METHODS Natural compound libraries were screened for potential scaffold against MPRO main protease. Molecular dynamics simulation, MM-GBSA and principle component analyses of enzyme-ligand complexes were carried out with the top-ranking hits and compared with the repurposed antiviral drugs lopinavir and nelfinavir. RESULTS The structure-based virtual screening indicated phenylbenzopyrone of flavonoids as one of the top-ranking scaffolds that have the potential to inhibit the main protease with O-glycosidic form performing better than corresponding aglyconic form. Simulation studies indicated that glycosidic form of flavonoid as more suitable inhibitor with compounds rutin, procyanidin B6, baicalin and galloylquercetin, demonstrating high affinity and stability, and rutin emerging as one of the best candidate compound. Interestingly, rutin was reported to have inhibitory activity against similar protease (3Cprotease of enterovirus A71) as well as implicated in lung fibrosis. CONCLUSION The present study displaying flavonoids, possessing a potential scaffold for inhibiting main protease activity for all betacoronavirus is an attempt to provide new and safe drug leads within a reasonably short period.","Potshangbam, Angamba Meetei; Nongdam, Potshangbam; Kumar, A Kiran; Rathore, R S",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201022666210127113027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504301/,1

N-(ortho-phenol)-histidine chelator was synthesized by modifying the single amino acid L-histidine, a natural amino acid, with an additional phenol group to obtain the bifunctional tridentate ligand after reductive amination. Bioconjugation was based on the carbodiimide activation of the carboxylate of chelator and on further reaction with the amine groups present on the antibody fragments. Radiolabeling was accomplished by replacing the three aqua ligands of the complex precursor [Tc(CO)3(H2O)3] with the tridentate chelator. The antibody fragments radiolabeled with [Tc(CO)3] core were tested for stability by the cysteine challenge test. The immunoreactivity and binding affinity of the radiolabeled fragments were studied using in-vitro cell-binding assays. Radiochemical yields achieved for [Tc(CO)3] core labeling of fab and f(ab')2 were 91.6±9.1% and 80.7±8.5%, respectively. Stability studies of radiolabeled antibody fragments showed that the Tc label was stable to transchelation by cysteine. Both Tc-fab and Tc-f(ab')2 retained their reactivity and affinity to the mesothelin antigen. From our studies, it can be concluded that the newly synthesized N-(ortho-phenol)-histidine chelator is a promising candidate for [Tc(CO)3] labeling of biomolecules and for developing other novel Tc radiopharmaceuticals.","Misri, Ripen; Saatchi, Katayoun; Häfeli, Urs O",Nuclear medicine communications,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0b013e328343dee5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21285909/,1

Understanding the dynamics of maternal antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer can inform neonatal management as well as maternal vaccination strategies. Objective To assess the association between maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody concentrations. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study took place at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1714 women delivered at the study site between April 9 and August 8, 2020. Maternal and cord blood sera were available for antibody measurement for 1471 mother/newborn dyads. Exposures SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data. Results The study cohort consisted of 1714 parturient women, with median (interquartile range) age of 32 (28-35) years, of whom 450 (26.3%) identified as Black/non-Hispanic, 879 (51.3%) as White/non-Hispanic, 203 (11.8%) as Hispanic, 126 (7.3%) as Asian, and 56 (3.3%) as other race/ethnicity. Among 1471 mother/newborn dyads for which matched sera were available, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 83 of 1471 women (6%; 95% CI, 5%-7%) at the time of delivery, and IgG was detected in cord blood from 72 of 83 newborns (87%; 95% CI, 78%-93%). IgM was not detected in any cord blood specimen, and antibodies were not detected in any infant born to a seronegative mother. Eleven infants born to seropositive mothers were seronegative: 5 of 11 (45%) were born to mothers with IgM antibody only, and 6 of 11 (55%) were born to mothers with significantly lower IgG concentrations compared with those found among mothers of seropositive infants. Cord blood IgG concentrations were positively correlated with maternal IgG concentrations (r = 0.886; P < .001). Placental transfer ratios more than 1.0 were observed among women with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as those with mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease 2019. Transfer ratios increased with increasing time between onset of maternal infection and delivery. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred across the placenta after asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection during pregnancy. Cord blood antibody concentrations correlated with maternal antibody concentrations and with duration between onset of infection and delivery. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally derived SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to provide neonatal protection from coronavirus disease 2019.","Flannery, Dustin D; Gouma, Sigrid; Dhudasia, Miren B; Mukhopadhyay, Sagori; Pfeifer, Madeline R; Woodford, Emily C; Triebwasser, Jourdan E; Gerber, Jeffrey S; Morris, Jeffrey S; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Bolton, Marcus J; Arevalo, Claudia P; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Goodwin, Eileen C; Hensley, Scott E; Puopolo, Karen M",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512440/,1
84110,Delayed Leukoencephalopathy: A Rare Complication after Coiling of Cerebral Aneurysms.,2020-01-30,"BACKGROUND Wounds are among the most common medical conditions affecting horses and have a major economic impact on the horse industry. Wound healing in horses is distinct to that documented in other species, and often results in delayed healing and extensive scarring, with compromised functional and aesthetic outcomes. To date, there is no conventional method objectively proven to accelerate healing or to successfully prevent complications associated with second intention healing. Several effects of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) may be particularly useful to the management of wounds in horses. However, cumbersome designs of classic NPWT devices render them unsuitable for equine practice. A new lightweight, portable and disposable unit of NPWT (PICO®), should facilitate the use of this modality by equine practitioners. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using this canister-free system to treat experimental open wounds in horses. RESULTS No difficulties were encountered with the application or maintenance of the PICO® system during the ex vivo experiment or during the preliminary in vivo experiment conducted on intact skin. All horses readily tolerated the PICO® but difficulties with adhesion and seal prevented the completion of the experimental wound study despite the use of many adjunctive adhesives. CONCLUSION The current PICO® dressing design is not suitable to be used as a dressing for open wounds in horses though the device is well tolerated by equine patients. A dressing with a wider adhesive edge, a superior adhesive and a more flexible pad would likely be better adapted to enable its future use in equine practice.","Kamus, Louis; Rameau, Marie; Theoret, Christine",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1829-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841889/,1
84431,Switching from natalizumab to ocrelizumab in patients with multiple sclerosis.,2020-06-19,"A 5443 Da peptide with sequence homology to defensins was purified from purple pole beans (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. 'Extra-long Purple Pole bean'). This peptide was isolated by adsorption on an affinity chromatographic medium Affi-Gel Blue gel and ion-exchange chromatographic media SP-Sepharose (sulfopropyl-Sepharose) and Mono S and by gel filtration on Superdex peptide. The peptide inhibited mycelial growth in Mycosphaerella arachidicola, Helminthosporium maydis, Fusarium oxysporum, Verticillium dahliae, Rhizoctonia solani, Candida albicans and Setosphaeria turcica with an IC50 of 0.8, 0.9, 2.3, 3.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 9.8 microM respectively. Its antifungal potency was higher than that of the plant defensin coccinin (IC50>50 microM). It induced membrane permeabilization in C. albicans as evidenced by SYTOX Green uptake, but did not affect erythrocyte membrane permeability. It inhibited growth in M. arachidicola by inducing chitin accumulation at hyphal tips as was shown by Congo Red staining. The antifungal activity was pH stable and thermostable. The peptide inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma (HepG2), breast cancer (MCF7), colon cancer (HT29) and cervical cancer (SiHa) cells but not that of human embryonic liver (WRL68) cells. Its anti-HepG2 activity (IC50=4.1+/-0.8 microM, n=3) was higher than that of another plant defensin, gymnin (IC50>50 microM). Its anti-MCF7 activity (IC50=8.3+/-0.3 microM, n=3) was similar to that of other plant defensins. It reduced the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 0.5+/-0.1 microM, n=3, much more potently than other plant defensins (IC50>40 microM). There is the possibility of using the purple pole bean defensin for producing antifungal drugs and/or transgenic plants with fungal resistance.","Lin, Peng; Wong, Jack Ho; Ng, Tzi Bun",Bioscience reports,https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20090004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19335335/,1
84841,"Relationship Between Nasal Cycle, Nasal Symptoms and Nasal Cytology.",2019,"OBJECTIVES Minimally invasive resection of small, deep intrapulmonary lesions can be challenging due to the difficulty of localizing them during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We report our preliminary results evaluating the feasibility of an image-guided, minimally invasive, 1-stop-shop approach for the resection of small, deep intrapulmonary lesions in a hybrid operating room (OR). MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifteen patients (5 men, 10 women; mean age, 63 years) with a total of 16 solitary, deep intrapulmonary nodules of unknown malignant status were identified for intraoperative wire marking. Patients were placed on the operating table for resection by VATS. A marking wire was placed within the lesion under 3D laser and fluoroscopic guidance using a cone beam computed tomography system. Then, wedge resection by VATS was performed in the same setting without repositioning the patient. RESULTS Complete resection with adequate safety margins was confirmed for all lesions. Marking wire placement facilitated resection in 15 of 16 lesions. Eleven lesions proved to be malignant, either primary or secondary; 5 were benign. Mean lesion size was 7.7 mm; mean distance to the pleural surface was 15.1 mm (mean lesion depth-diameter ratio, 2.2). Mean procedural time for marking wire placement was 35 minutes; mean VATS duration was 36 minutes. CONCLUSIONS Computed tomography-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a new, safe, and effective procedure for minimally invasive resection of small, deeply localized intrapulmonary lesions. The benefits of computed tomography-assisted thoracoscopic surgery are 1. One-stop-shop procedure, 2. Lower risk for the patient (no patient relocation, no marking wire loss), and 3. No need to coordinate scheduling between the CT room and OR.","Kostrzewa, Michael; Kara, Kerim; Rathmann, Nils; Tsagogiorgas, Charalambos; Henzler, Thomas; Schoenberg, Stefan O; Hohenberger, Peter; Diehl, Steffen J; Roessner, Eric D",Investigative radiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28141614/,1

85015,Grading of Regional Apposition after Flow-Diverter Treatment (GRAFT): a comparative evaluation of VasoCT and intravascular OCT.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Prospective studies on rivaroxaban and apixaban have shown the safety and efficacy of direct anticoagulation agents (DOAC)s used peri-procedurally during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of atrial fibrillation (AF). Studies comparing the two agents have not been performed. METHODS Consecutive patients from a prospective registry who underwent RFA of AF between April 2012 and March 2015 and were on apixaban or rivaroxaban were studied. Clinical variables and outcomes were noted. RESULTS There were a total of 358 patients (n = 56 on apixaban and n = 302 on rivaroxaban). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups. The last dose of rivaroxaban was administered the night before the procedure in 96% of patients. In patients on apixaban, 48% of patients whose procedure was in the afternoon took the medication on the morning of the procedure. TIA/CVA occurred in 2 patients (0.6%) in rivaroxaban group with none in apixaban group (p = 0.4). There was no difference in the rate of pericardial effusion between apixaban and rivaroxaban groups [1.7% vs 0.6% (p = 0.4)]. Five percent of patients in both groups had groin complications (p = 0.9). In apixaban group, all groin complications were small hematomas except one patient who had a pseudoaneurysm (1.6%). One pseudo-aneurysm, 1 fistula and 3 large hematomas were noted in patients on rivaroxaban (1.7%) with the rest being small hematomas. DOACs were restarted post procedure typically 4 h post hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS Peri-procedural uninterrupted use of apixaban and rivaroxaban during AF RFA is safe and there are no major differences between both groups.","Pillarisetti, Jayasree; Reddy, Madhu; Vodapally, Mamatha; Annapureddy, Tulasi; Molugu, Maruthsakhi; Atkins, Donita; Bommana, Sudharani; Pimentel, Rhea; Dendi, Raghuveer; Lakkireddy, Dhanunjaya",Indian pacing and electrophysiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipej.2020.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810538/,1

The Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference (PACC) panel of experts convened in 2000, 2003, and 2007 to make recommendations on the rational use of IT analgesics based on preclinical and clinical literature and clinical experiences. METHODS The PACC panel convened again in 2011 to update the standard of care for IT therapies to reflect current knowledge gleaned from literature and clinical experience. A thorough literature search was performed, and information from this search was provided to panel members. Analysis of published literature was coupled with the clinical experience of panel members to form recommendations regarding the use of IT analgesics to treat chronic pain. RESULTS After a review of literature published from 2007 to 2011 and discussions of clinical experience, the panel created updated algorithms for the rational use of IT medications for the treatment of neuropathic pain and nociceptive pain. CONCLUSIONS The advent of new algorithmic tracks for neuropathic and nociceptive pain is an important step in improving patient care. The panel encourages continued research and development, including the development of new drugs, devices, and safety recommendations to improve the care of patients with chronic pain.","Deer, Timothy R; Prager, Joshua; Levy, Robert; Rathmell, James; Buchser, Eric; Burton, Allen; Caraway, David; Cousins, Michael; De Andrés, José; Diwan, Sudhir; Erdek, Michael; Grigsby, Eric; Huntoon, Marc; Jacobs, Marilyn S; Kim, Philip; Kumar, Krishna; Leong, Michael; Liem, Liong; McDowell, Gladstone C; Panchal, Sunil; Rauck, Richard; Saulino, Michael; Sitzman, B Todd; Staats, Peter; Stanton-Hicks, Michael; Stearns, Lisa; Wallace, Mark; Willis, K Dean; Witt, William; Yaksh, Tony; Mekhail, Nagy",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-1403.2012.00476.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22748024/,1

Among the most important public health costs of lockdown restrictions are the potential adverse effects on mental health and physical activity. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and Google COVID-19 Mobility Reports we find evidence of reduced park mobility during the initial period of the first UK lockdown and confirm existing evidence of worsening mental health. Linkage with weather data shows that contrary to popular belief, daily or weekly weather conditions do not exacerbate the mental health consequences of the pandemic, as we found no systematic associations during the first lockdown period; on the other hand, we find systematic links between park mobility and weather over the same period.","Burdett, Ashley; Davillas, Apostolos; Etheridge, Ben",Health economics,https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114722/,1

Cette étude avait pour but de prédire les répercussions de la pandémie sur les issues des patients et l’utilisation des ressources hospitalières en Ontario (Canada). MÉTHODES: Nous avons conçu un modèle de simulation axé sur les personnes illustrant le flux de patients atteints de la COVID-19 dans les hôpitaux ontariens. Nous avons simulé diverses combinaisons de trajectoires épidémiques et de capacités de soins hospitaliers. Les paramètres à l’étude étaient le nombre de patients devant être admis au service d’hospitalisation ou à l’unité des soins intensifs (USI) —avec ou sans respirateur mécanique —, le nombre de jours jusqu’à l’épuisement des ressources, le nombre de patients en attente de ressources et le nombre de décès. RÉSULTATS: Nous avons constaté que la mise en place rapide de mesures de santé publique efficaces éviterait l’épuisement des ressources hospitalières. Les simulations dans lesquelles les mesures d’éloignement sanitaire étaient inefficaces ou adoptées tardivement ont montré que l’épuisement des ressources prendrait de 14 à 26 jours et qu’il y aurait, dans le pire des cas, 13 321 décès de personnes en attente de ressources. Cet épuisement pourrait être évité ou retardé par la mise en place de mesures rigoureuses visant à améliorer la capacité des hôpitaux en matière de soins intensifs, de respirateurs mécaniques et de soins hospitaliers. INTERPRÉTATION: Sans l’adoption de mesures d’éloignement sanitaire rigoureuses, le système de santé ontarien n’aurait pas eu les ressources nécessaires pour prendre en charge le nombre attendu de patients atteints de la COVID-19, même en cas d’augmentation rapide de sa capacité hospitalière. Les pénuries auraient fait augmenter le taux de mortalité. En ralentissant la transmission de la maladie par la mise en place de mesures de santé publique et l’augmentation de la capacité des hôpitaux, l’Ontario a probablement évité que ces derniers subissent une pression catastrophique.","Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A; Mac, Stephen; Ximenes, Raphael; Naimark, David M J; Sander, Beate",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200715-f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199458/,1

Targeting activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the major extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing cells within the damaged liver, has been regarded as one of the main treatments for hepatic fibrosis. In the present study, we performed preliminary bioinformatics analysis attempting to identify possible factors related to hepatic fibrosis and found that lncRNA G protein-coupled receptor 137B (Gpr137b-ps) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) showed to be markedly upregulated within carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-caused hepatic fibrotic mice tissue samples and activated HSCs. CXCL14 The silencing of lncRNA Gpr137b-ps or CXCL14 alone could significantly improve CCl4-induced fibrotic changes in mice liver in vivo and collagen I and III release by HSCs and HSC proliferation in vitro. miR-200a-3p directly targeted lncRNA Gpr137b-ps and CXCL14, respectively. LncRNA Gpr137b-ps relieved miR-200a-3p-induced inhibition on CXCL14 expression via acting as a ceRNA. In HSCs, the effects of lncRNA Gpr137b-ps silencing on collagen I and III release by HSCs and HSC proliferation were significantly reversed by miR-200a-3p inhibition, and the effects of miR-200a-3p inhibition were reversed by CXCL14 silencing. In conclusion, we demonstrated a lncRNA Gpr137b-ps/miR-200a-3p/CXCL14 axis that modulates HSC activation and might exert an effect on the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.","Liao, Jinmao; Zhang, Zheng; Yuan, Qi; Liu, Qiong; Kuang, Jia; Fang, Yuan; Hu, Xiaoxuan",Toxicology letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2020.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069761/,1

86466,Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI).,2009,"BACKGROUND N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation requires the binding of a co-agonist on the glycine-binding site. D-serine is the main endogeneous co-agonist of NMDA receptors, and its availability significantly depends on the activity of the metabolic enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). Inhibition of DAAO increases the brain levels of D-serine, and modulates a variety of physiological functions including cognitive behavior. METHODS Here, we examined the effects of a novel 4‑hydroxypyridazin-3(2H)‑one derivative DAAO inhibitor, Compound 30 (CPD30) on passive avoidance learning and on neuronal firing activity in rats. RESULTS D-serine administration was applied as reference, which increased cognitive performance and enhanced hippocampal firing activity and responsiveness to NMDA after both local and systemic application. Similarly to D-serine, CPD30 (0.1 mg/kg) effectively reversed MK-801 induced memory impairment in the passive avoidance test. Furthermore, local iontophoretic application of CPD30 in the vicinity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons significantly increased firing rate, and enhanced their responses to locally applied NMDA. Compound 30 also enhanced hippocampal firing activity after systemic administration. In 0.1-1.0 mg/kg doses, CPD30 increased spontaneous and NMDA-evoked firing activity of the neurons. Effects of CPD30 on NMDA-responsiveness emerged faster (at 10 min post-injection) when 1.0 mg/kg dose was applied compared to the onset of the effects of 0.1 mg/kg CPD30 (at 30 min post-injection). CONCLUSIONS The present results confirm that the inhibition of DAAO enzyme is an effective strategy for cognitive enhancement. Our findings further facilitate the understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of DAAO inhibition in the mammalian brain.","Nagy, Lili Veronika; Bali, Zsolt Kristóf; Kapus, Gábor; Pelsőczi, Péter; Farkas, Bence; Lendvai, Balázs; Lévay, György; Hernádi, István",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyaa095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305805/,1

We describe the feasibility and the technique of single-port laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy in gynecologic malignancies. METHODS The study was approved by the institutional review board at the Cleveland Clinic (Cleveland, Ohio). Inclusion criterion was patients with apparent early-stage gynecologic malignancies who required pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node sampling or lymphadenectomy and were candidates for single-port laparoscopy. Procedures were performed through a single 2.0- to 3.0-cm umbilical incision using a single-port device, deflecting-tip laparoscope, and multifunctional instrumentation. RESULTS Twenty-one patients underwent single-port surgery/staging performed during the study period. The median patient age was 58 years (range, 17-80 years), and the median patient body mass index was 30 mg/kg² (range, 19-46 mg/kg²). Median overall operating time was 120 minutes (range, 60-185 minutes). Median pelvic and para-aortic node counts were 14 (range, 7-19) and 6 (range, 2-14), respectively.

They are advocated by consensus guidelines and mandated for Medicare reimbursement. However, outcomes data remain mixed. We aimed to characterize the population of patients undergoing unprotected carotid artery stenting (CAS) and assess the utility of distal filter EPD (F-EPD) in elective CAS. METHODS We analyzed patients enrolled in the CARE Registry® undergoing CAS between May, 2005 and January, 2012. We assessed the relationship between distal F-EPD use versus no use (No-EPD) and the composite of in-hospital death or stroke (MAE) in unadjusted and 1:3 propensity-matched analyses. RESULTS Embolic protection was not attempted in a total of 579 out of 13,263 cases performed (4.4%). Patients in the No-EPD group had worse preprocedure neurologic risk factors including higher rates of acute evolving stroke, prior TIA/stroke, symptomatic lesion status, spontaneous carotid artery dissection, and use of general anesthesia intraprocedurally (all Standardized Differences{sd} >10). After exclusion of nonelective cases there was no significant difference in MAE between the No-EPD and F-EPD groups (1.6% vs. 2.3%, sd = 4.72). Additionally, after propensity matching, rates of MAE did not differ between the No-EPD (n = 355) and F-EPD (n = 1065) groups (1.7% vs. 2.5%, sd = 5.87). CONCLUSIONS Patients selected to undergo unprotected CAS in contemporary practice have high rates of adverse preprocedure neurologic risk factors.

86899,Poor Results of Flow Diversion as Salvage Treatment for Intracranial Aneurysm Rerupture After Surgical Clip Reconstruction.,2019-11-12,"PURPOSE Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is currently restricted to the treatment of target tissues with a small size (<3 cm in diameter). To overcome this problem with RFA, some phenomena need to be understood first. The study presented in this paper investigated the relationship between the area of target tissue necrosis (TTN) and the size of target tissue in pulsed radiofrequency ablation (PRFA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Liver tumour, one of the common targets of RFA in clinical practice, was used as the target tissue in this study. Two types of pulsed RF power supply methods (half-square and half-sine) and three target tissues with different sizes (25 mm, 30 mm and 35 mm in diameter) were studied using finite element modelling. The finite element model (FEM) was validated by using an in vitro experiment with porcine liver tissue. The first roll-off occurrence or 720 s, whichever occurs first, was chosen as the ablation termination criterion in this study. RESULTS For each target tissue size, the largest TTN area was obtained using the maximum voltage applied (MVA) without roll-off occurrence. In this study, target tissues with a 25 mm diameter can be ablated cleanly but target tissues with 30-mm and 35-mm failed to be ablated. CONCLUSIONS The half-square PRFA could achieve a larger TTN area than the half-sine PRFA. The MVA decreases with an increase in the target tissue diameter in both the half-square PRFA and the half-sine PRFA. The findings of this study are in agreement with the clinical results that lesions (≥ 3 cm in diameter) have less favourable results from RFA.","Zhang, Bing; Moser, Michael A J; Zhang, Edwin M; Luo, Yigang; Zhang, Wenjun","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2015.1058429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26360111/,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS From October 2015 to January 2018, 76 patients with lung nodules underwent CT-guided coil localization and subsequent VATS in our center. The tail of the coil remained above the visceral pleura. Data regarding the technical success of coil localization and wedge resection were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 96 lung nodules in 76 patients were localized. The technical success rate of CT-guided coil localization was 97.9% (94/96). Among the 94 localized nodules, 88 coils were visible and six coils were palpated during VATS. Nine patients experienced pneumothorax and two patients experienced hemoptysis after coil localization. Two patients underwent VATS beyond 24 h after coil localization. The technical success rate of wedge resection of lung nodules was 97.9%. Seventeen patients with multiple target lung nodules underwent one-stage video-assisted resection of all target nodules after coil localization. CONCLUSION Preoperative CT-guided coil localization is a safe and convenient method to facilitate a high success rate of diagnostic VATS wedge-resection of lung nodules. Coil localization can also facilitate one-stage VATS wedge-resection of multiple nodules.","Yang, Zhong-Jie; Liang, Yong-Hui; Li, Ming; Fang, Peng",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13645706.2019.1576053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712417/,1
87075,Cavernous carotid aneurysms in the era of flow diversion: a need to revisit treatment paradigms.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Notes is the logical answer to scarless surgery, but despite being around for almost 4-5 years, it has to still garner a major support because of a number of limitations. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery, especially when done through the umbilicus, should be the perfect answer as far as the absence of any visible scar is concerned. MATERIALS AND METHODS All the 67 patients were operated by the same surgeon through a transversely placed umbilical incision in the lower half of the umbilicus. Three conventional ports, 10, 5, and 5 mm, were introduced through the same skin incision but separate transfacial punctures. The instruments included 10-mm and 5-mm 30° rigid telescopes and rigid instruments as in standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with irreducible hernia and obstructed hernia were included, and those with strangulated hernia were excluded. RESULTS All the patients were men, with an average age of 38.6 years. Three patients had bilateral hernia and 2 each had irreducible and obstructed hernia. The mean operating time was 42.8 minutes for unilateral hernias when tackers were used and 51.7 minutes in those in whom intracorporeal suturing was done. The operating time for bilateral hernias was 71.7 minutes. There was minimal flap discharge, without infection, in 3 patients. There were no other complications. There were no conversions and no recurrences upto 9 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical single-skin-incision laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair for groin hernias, performed solely with conventional instruments, is feasible, easy to learn, and probably the future of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.","Sinha, Rajeev",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The aim of this study is to describe our technique and to evaluate the short term outcomes and efficacy of SILS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in a selected group of patients in a single center. METHODS From March 2012 to January 2013, a total of fourteen patients underwent SILS RYGB using a single vertical 2.5-3 cm intra-umbilical incision, 3-ports placed trans-fascially, and a liver suspension technique in Cleveland Clinic's Bariatric & Metabolic Institute, in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Patient selection, short-term outcomes and technical issues were retrospectively viewed in this study. RESULTS A total of 14 morbid obese patients (12 women and 2 men; mean age, 46 years). Mean operative time was 196 (range 131-265) min. Mean weight at surgery was 113 (range 91-135) kg. One patient required placement of one additional port (7 %). No conversions to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) or open surgery was needed. The estimated blood loss was 40 (range 20-100) ml. In terms of pain control, the frequency of patient controlled analgesia had a mean use of 21 times in postoperative day 0 (POD), 37 times in POD1 and 13 times in POD2. Pain score (assessed by visual analogue scale) had a median score of 6.9 in POD0, 5.2 In POD1 and 3.8 in POD2. Weight loss was approximately 7.25 lb. (±4.5) after first postoperative visit, 28.9 lb. (±11.86) after 1 month and 45.4 lb. (±15.4) after 4 months. No patients required re-operation or readmission during the 90 days after surgery. CONCLUSION Single incision is feasible, safe and reproducible technique used as an access to complex surgeries like gastric bypass in carefully selected patients. Results in short-term outcomes are comparable to those observed in literature. Some potential benefits include less postoperative pain, improved cosmesis, and patient satisfaction. Randomized trials involving larger patient series with a longer follow-up and larger cohort studies and/or systematic reviews will be necessary to assess the extent of the benefits and limitations of SILS in bariatric surgery.","Zepeda Mejia, Ivan Alberto; Rogula, Tomasz",Annals of surgical innovation and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13022-015-0016-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473005/,1
87957,Evaluation of the Angiographic Grading Scale in Aneurysms Treated with the WEB Device in 80 Rabbits: Correlation with Histologic Evaluation.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Tracheal intubation remains an everyday challenge for anaesthesiologists, even in patients without suspected difficult airways. The ideal positioning of the patient's head (flat, raised a few centimetres on a cushion in the sniffing position (SP), or raised to achieve horizontal alignment between the external acoustic meatus and the sternal angle) and the use of videolaryngoscopy remain controversial. This trial aims to compare the efficacy for orotracheal intubation of the SP or the head-elevated laryngoscopy position (HELP), which has been shown to improve laryngeal visualization and the intubation condition particularly in obese patients, in combination with a McGrath Mac videolaryngoscope whose video screen is either on or off (Video or NoVideo). METHODS AND ANALYSIS The HELP-VDL factorial trial is a prospective, randomised, parallel, multicentre, open study of 240 adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation under general anaesthesia. Patients will be allocated into four groups: SP-NoVideo, HELP-NoVideo, SP-Video and HELP-Video. The primary outcome is the proportion of orotracheal intubations that requires the assistance of a nurse anaesthetist. The secondary outcomes include the intubation duration, the first intubation success rate, the quality of visualisation of the glottis, the glottis visualisation score, adjunctive manoeuvres and alternative techniques used, the occurrence of oesophageal intubation, failure of tracheal intubation, the incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation, the perception of a difficult intubation, the score on the Intubation Difficulty Scale, cooperation among the members of the anaesthesia team, the evolution of vital signs and the frequency and severity of intubation complications. Data will be analysed on the intention-to-treat principle and a per-protocol basis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee Ile de France V (Paris, France). Participant recruitment began on 3 July 2019. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.Trial registration numberNCT03987009; Pre-results.","Le Guen, Morgan; Coppere, Zoé; Dufour, Guillaume; Ouattara, Jonathan; Trichereau, Julie; Fischler, Marc",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641332/,1
88112,Ruptured Fusiform Aneurysm of the Anterior Spinal Artery : Successful Treatment with Flow Diverter Stent Placed in the Feeding Vertebral Artery.,2018,"OBJECTIVES Monitoring cerebral autoregulation may help identify the lower limit of autoregulation in individual patients. Mean arterial blood pressure below lower limit of autoregulation appears to be a risk factor for postoperative acute kidney injury. Cerebral autoregulation can be monitored in real time using correlation approaches. However, the precise thresholds for different cerebral autoregulation indexes that identify the lower limit of autoregulation are unknown. We identified thresholds for intact autoregulation in patients during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and examined the relevance of these thresholds to postoperative acute kidney injury. DESIGN A single-center retrospective analysis. SETTING Tertiary academic medical center. PATIENTS Data from 59 patients was used to determine precise cerebral autoregulation thresholds for identification of the lower limit of autoregulation. These thresholds were validated in a larger cohort of 226 patients. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS Invasive mean arterial blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocities, regional cortical oxygen saturation, and total hemoglobin were recorded simultaneously. Three cerebral autoregulation indices were calculated, including mean flow index, cerebral oximetry index, and hemoglobin volume index. Cerebral autoregulation curves for the three indices were plotted, and thresholds for each index were used to generate threshold- and index-specific lower limit of autoregulations. A reference lower limit of autoregulation could be identified in 59 patients by plotting cerebral blood flow velocity against mean arterial blood pressure to generate gold-standard Lassen curves. The lower limit of autoregulations defined at each threshold were compared with the gold-standard lower limit of autoregulation determined from Lassen curves. The results identified the following thresholds: mean flow index (0.45), cerebral oximetry index (0.35), and hemoglobin volume index (0.3). We then calculated the product of magnitude and duration of mean arterial blood pressure less than lower limit of autoregulation in a larger cohort of 226 patients. When using the lower limit of autoregulations identified by the optimal thresholds above, mean arterial blood pressure less than lower limit of autoregulation was greater in patients with acute kidney injury than in those without acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS This study identified thresholds of intact and impaired cerebral autoregulation for three indices and showed that mean arterial blood pressure below lower limit of autoregulation is a risk factor for acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.","Liu, Xiuyun; Akiyoshi, Kei; Nakano, Mitsunori; Brady, Ken; Bush, Brian; Nadkarni, Rohan; Venkataraman, Archana; Koehler, Raymond C; Lee, Jennifer K; Hogue, Charles W; Czosnyka, Marek; Smielewski, Peter; Brown, Charles H",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278074/,1
88162,Safety updates in novel therapeutics for pediatric rheumatic disease.,2021-09-01,"Patients with limited cardiac reserve are less likely to survive and develop more complications following major surgery. By augmenting oxygen delivery index (DO2I) with a combination of intravenous fluids and inotropes (goal directed therapy (GDT)), postoperative mortality and morbidity of high-risk patients may be reduced. However, although most studies suggest that GDT may improve outcome in high-risk surgical patients, it is still not widely practiced. We set out to test the hypothesis that GDT results in greatest benefit in terms of mortality and morbidity in patients with the highest risk of mortality and have undertaken a systematic review of the current literature to see if this is correct. We performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reviews of GDT in surgical patients. To minimize heterogeneity we excluded studies involving cardiac, trauma, and paediatric surgery. Extremely high risk, high risk and intermediate risks of mortality were defined as >20%, 5 to 20% and <5% mortality rates in the control arms of the trials, respectively. Meta analyses were performed and Forest plots drawn using RevMan software. Data are presented as odd ratios (OR; 95% confidence intervals (CI), and P-values). A total of 32 RCTs including 2,808 patients were reviewed. All studies reported mortality. Five studies (including 300 patients) were excluded from assessment of complication rates as the number of patients with complications was not reported. The mortality benefit of GDT was confined to the extremely high-risk group (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.41; P < 0.0001). Complication rates were reduced in all subgroups (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.60; P < 0.00001). The morbidity benefit was greatest amongst patients in the extremely high-risk subgroup (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.51; P < 0.0001), followed by the intermediate risk subgroup (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.67; P = 0.0002), and the high-risk subgroup (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89; P = 0.01). Despite heterogeneity in trial quality and design, we found GDT to be beneficial in all high-risk patients undergoing major surgery. The mortality benefit of GDT was confined to the subgroup of patients at extremely high risk of death. The reduction of complication rates was seen across all subgroups of GDT patients.","Cecconi, Maurizio; Corredor, Carlos; Arulkumaran, Nishkantha; Abuella, Gihan; Ball, Jonathan; Grounds, R Michael; Hamilton, Mark; Rhodes, Andrew",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc11823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23672779/,1
88298,Use of flow-diverting stents as salvage treatment following failed stent-assisted embolization of intracranial aneurysms.,2016,"OBJECTIVE To study the effect of platelet count (PC) on bleeding risk and outcome in stroke patients treated with IV thrombolysis (IVT) and to explore whether withholding IVT in PC < 100 × 109/L is supported. METHODS In this prospective multicenter, IVT register-based study, we compared PC with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH; Second European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study [ECASS II] criteria), poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3-6), and mortality at 3 months. PC was used as a continuous and categorical variable distinguishing thrombocytopenia (<150 × 109/L), thrombocytosis (>450 × 109/L), and normal PC (150-450 × 109/L [reference group]). Moreover, PC < 100 × 109/L was compared to PC ≥ 100 × 109/L. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS Among 7,533 IVT-treated stroke patients, 6,830 (90.7%) had normal PC, 595 (7.9%) had thrombocytopenia, and 108 (1.4%) had thrombocytosis. Decreasing PC (every 10 × 109/L) was associated with increasing risk of sICH (ORadjusted 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.05) but decreasing risk of poor outcome (ORadjusted 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99) and mortality (ORadjusted 0.98, 95% CI 0.98-0.99). The risk of sICH was higher in patients with thrombocytopenic than in patients with normal PC (ORadjusted 1.73, 95% CI 1.24-2.43). However, the risk of poor outcome (ORadjusted 0.89, 95% CI 0.39-1.97) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.09, 95% CI 0.83-1.44) did not differ significantly. Thrombocytosis was associated with mortality (ORadjusted 2.02, 95% CI 1.21-3.37). Forty-four (0.3%) patients had PC < 100 × 109/L. Their risks of sICH (ORunadjusted 1.56, 95% CI 0.48-5.07), poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.63, 95% CI 0.82-3.24), and mortality (ORadjusted 1.38, 95% CI 0.64-2.98) did not differ significantly from those of patients with PC ≥ 100 × 109/L. CONCLUSION Lower PC was associated with increased risk of sICH, while higher PC indicated increased mortality. Our data suggest that PC modifies outcome and complications in individual patients, while withholding IVT in all patients with PC < 100 × 109/L is challenged.","Gensicke, Henrik; Al Sultan, Abdulaziz S; Strbian, Daniel; Hametner, Christian; Zinkstok, Sanne M; Moulin, Solène; Bill, Olivier; Zini, Andrea; Padjen, Visnja; Kägi, Georg; Pezzini, Alessandro; Seiffge, David J; Traenka, Christopher; Räty, Silja; Amiri, Hemasse; Zonneveld, Thomas P; Lachenmeier, Romina; Polymeris, Alexandros; Roos, Yvo B; Gumbinger, Christoph; Jovanovic, Dejana R; Curtze, Sami; Sibolt, Gerli; Vandelli, Laura; Ringleb, Peter A; Leys, Didier; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Michel, Patrik; Lyrer, Philippe A; Peters, Nils; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Engelter, Stefan T",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000004982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29367438/,1

88491,Preliminary in vivo evaluation of a novel intrasaccular cerebral aneurysm occlusion device.,2015,"Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) were investigated as recently as in the seventies. However, they have been overshadowed for decades, due to the success of lithium-ion batteries that demonstrated higher energy densities and longer cycle lives. Since then, the witness a re-emergence of the SIBs and renewed interest evidenced by an exponential increase of the publications devoted to them (about 9000 publications in 2019, more than 6000 in the first six months this year). This huge effort in research has led and is leading to an important and constant progress in the performance of the SIBs, which have conquered an industrial market and are now commercialized. This progress concerns all the elements of the batteries. We have already recently reviewed the salts and electrolytes, including solid electrolytes to build all-solid-state SIBs. The present review is then devoted to the electrode materials. For anodes, they include carbons, metal chalcogenide-based materials, intercalation-based and conversion reaction compounds (transition metal oxides and sulfides), intermetallic compounds serving as functional alloying elements. For cathodes, layered oxide materials, polyionic compounds, sulfates, pyrophosphates and Prussian blue analogs are reviewed. The electrode structuring is also discussed, as it impacts, importantly, the electrochemical performance. Attention is focused on the progress made in the last five years to report the state-of-the-art in the performance of the SIBs and justify the efforts of research.","Mauger, Alain; Julien, Christian M",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13163453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764379/,1
88526,Prevalence of Intracranial Aneurysms in Patients with Connective Tissue Diseases: A Retrospective Study.,2016,"BACKGROUND Postanesthetic shivering is a common complication of anesthesia, which accounts for much discomfort in postoperative patients and may increase postoperative complications in high-risk patients. Due to the lack of high-quality evidence, it is difficult to draw a conclusion about optimal anti-shivering medication. The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to analyze and evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic use of ketamine for preventing postanesthetic shivering. METHODS We searched the following databases: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails for randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome observed was the difference of the incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering between ketamine group and placebo group. The secondary outcomes were the sedation score and incidence of the side effects caused by ketamine and any other drugs utilized in the studies. RESULTS In this meta-analysis, we analyzed a total of 16 trials including 1485 patients. Ketamine reduced the incidence rate of postanesthetic shivering compared to a placebo (odds ratio [OR]: 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06 to 0.26, P<0.01). Regarding side effects, there was no evident variability of the incidence of nausea and vomiting. Usage of ketamine was associated with a lower rate of hypotension and bradycardia when compared to a placebo. Hallucinations were more frequently observed in patients who received higher doses of ketamine. No significant difference was found in the incidence of postanesthetic shivering with ketamine versus other pharmacological interventions. CONCLUSIONS Ketamine can prevent postanesthetic shivering without severe side effects. However, ketamine shows no advantage over other anti-shivering drugs.","Zhou, Yang; Mannan, Abdul; Han, Yuan; Liu, He; Guan, Hui-Lian; Gao, Xing; Dai, Ming-Sheng; Cao, Jun-Li",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-019-0910-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31888509/,1

Fifty-five DNA-methylated genes significantly associated with drug resistance in OC were screened, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying changes in methylation levels of these genes were systematically integrated.Enrichment and annotation of biological processes indicated that most of the above DNA-methylated genes were significantly associated with cell proliferation and cell cycle. In addition, pathway enrichment demonstrated that the above DNA-methylated genes were significantly associated with PI3K-AKT and P53 signaling pathways. Among the 55 genes, 4 were significantly associated with OC prognostic disease-free survival, namely bromodomain containing 4, PDZ domain containing 1 (PDZK1), phosphatase and tensin homolog, and TNF receptor superfamily member 10c; 5 were significantly related to overall survival, namely bromodomain containing 4, PDZK1, PIK3C2B, Rh associated glycoprotein, and DYRK; among them, the degree of methylation of TNF receptor superfamily member 10c, PDZK1, and Rh associated glycoprotein genes was significantly correlated with mRNA expression.

We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible disease model which includes the possibility for 'spontaneous' (or 'automatic') infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment 'infection' (10 years) or discontentment 'infection' (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.","Hill, Alison L; Rand, David G; Nowak, Martin A; Christakis, Nicholas A",Proceedings.

In this study, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to explore the tolerance capacities of B. papyrifera and its phytoremediation potential in the HM-contaminated soil. The results indicated that B. papyrifera could effectively decrease malondialdehyde (MDA) content by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activities along with the cultivation in the HM-contaminated soil. Significant (p < 0.05) negative relationships were found between MDA content and superoxide dismutase (r = -0.620) and catalase activities (r = -0.702) in B. papyrifera leaves. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis indicated that the main functional groups in B. papyrifera roots were slightly influenced by HMs, and organic acids, carbohydrates, protein, and amino acids might bind with HMs in plant roots to alleviate the adverse effect of HMs on plants growth. Meanwhile, B. papyrifera had great potential used for the phytoextraction of Cd and Zn in HM-contaminated soil. The maximum total Cd and Zn accumulation amount in B. papyrifera shoots could attach to 2.26 and 66.8 mg·pot-1, respectively. These observations suggested that B. papyrifera has large biomass and high tolerance to HMs, which can be regarded as a promising plant for the eco-remediation of HM-contaminated sites.Novelty statement In this study, a fast-growing woody plant, Broussonetia papyrifera, was used for heavy metal(loid) (HM)-contaminated soil remediation. We found that B. papyrifera can effectively alleviate the adverse effect of HMs on plant growth by enhancing the antioxidant enzyme activities in leaves and binding HMs with organic acids, carbohydrates, protein, and amino acids in roots. Furthermore, the maximum total Cd and Zn accumulation amount in B. papyrifera shoots could attach to 2.26 and 66.8 mg·pot-1, which suggested that B. papyrifera might be regarded as a promising woody plant used for the phytoextraction of Cd and Zn in the contaminated soil.","Zeng, Peng; Guo, Zhaohui; Xiao, Xiyuan; Zhou, Hang; Gu, Jiaofeng; Liao, Bohan",International journal of phytoremediation,https://doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2021.1958746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369831/,1

This pandemic has created a sustained stress on the modern healthcare system, with unforeseen and potential drastic effects. Although the initial focus during this pandemic has been preparedness and response directed to the pandemic itself, traumatic injury has continued to remain a common problem that requires immediate evaluation and care to provide optimal outcomes. The State of Washington had the first reported case and death related to COVID-19 in the United States. Harborview Medical Center, which serves as the sole Level-1 adult and pediatric trauma center for the state, was rapidly affected by COVID-19, but still needed to maintain preparedness and responses to injured patients for the region. Although initially the focus was on the emerging pandemic on institutional factors, it became obvious that sustained efforts for regional trauma care required a more global focus. Because of these factors, Harborview Medical Center was quickly entrusted to serve as the coordinating center for the regions COVID-19 response, while also continuing to provide optimal care for injured patients during the pandemic. This response allowed the care of injured patients to be maintained within designated trauma centers during this pandemic. This present report summarizes the evolution of trauma care delivery during the first phase of this pandemic and provides informative recommendations for sustained responses to the care of injured patients during the pandemic based on lessons learned during the initial response.","Cuschieri, Joseph; Robinson, Bryce; Lynch, John; Mitchell, Steve; Arbabi, Saman; Bryson, Chloe; Sayre, Michael; Maier, Ronald V; Bulger, Eileen",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378302/,1

Concerns about the use of synthetic meshes in the pelvis and the associated risk of erosion have led to the recent use of biological meshes in some colorectal units. This retrospective study aims to assess the outcomes of patients undergoing LVR using a noncross-linked nondermal biological mesh. METHOD The medical notes of all patients who underwent LVR between 1 December 2011 and 31 May 2014 were reviewed. The rate of obstructed defaecation before surgery was retrospectively determined from medical records using the Rome III criteria. The rates of obstructed defaecation and faecal incontinence following surgery were determined using a self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 51 patients had LVR between 1 December 2011 and 31 May 2014. Their mean age was 57.3 ± 2.5 years and the mean follow-up was 23 ± 1 months. There were seven (13.7%) postoperative complications. In total, 45 (88%) patients completed the functional outcome questionnaires. Before surgery, 33 (73.3%) patients complained of symptoms of obstructed defaecation. At the end of follow-up, 22 (48.8%, P = 0.001) patients continued to have some symptoms of obstructed defaecation. Before surgery, 12 (26.7%) patients complained of faecal incontinence. At the end of follow-up, only three (6.7%, P = 0.004) patients reported faecal incontinence. At the end of follow-up, recurrence of symptoms had occurred in six (13.3%) patients. CONCLUSION LVR using a biological mesh is safe and results in significant reduction in symptoms associated with external rectal prolapse and rectal intussusception.","Albayati, S; Morgan, M J; Turner, C E",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.13671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28371010/,1

And without going through the traumatic experience of hospitalization, society as a whole will suffer post-traumatic stress, due to home isolation. In many cases, the disease has directly impacted close people, which will translate into a higher prevalence of mental health-related problems. In this sense, no one doubts the psychological and social footprint that the pandemic will leave on the majority of the population. The work carried out has the objective of identifying the disorders of the emotions as a result of the covid-19 and the confinement in university students of the National University Hermilio Valdizán. The type and level of research was descriptive, exploratory, explanatory, applicative, analytical, prospective and cross-sectional, with a sample of 100 university students from the different academic professional schools of the university. For data collection, the questionnaire was used and the virtual survey was used as a technique. The main results show that university students present emotional disorders such as: sleep problems (85%) and feelings of depression and hopelessness (83%). It is concluded that as a result of confinement, university students present psychological problems of anxiety and depression (46%), 22% present depression and stress, while 17% of university students present post-traumatic stress as a result of COVID-19 and confinement.","Tamayo García, Mónica Roxana; Miraval Tarazona, Zoila Elvira; Mansilla Natividad, Peggy",Revista de comunicacion y salud,https://doi.org/10.35669/rcys.2020.10(2).343-354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936922/,1
91036,Correlation between CT and diffusion-weighted imaging of acute cerebral ischemia in a rat model.,2011,"Background The number of residency applications submitted by medical students rises annually, resulting in increased work and costs for residency programs and applicants, particularly in emergency medicine. We propose a solution to this problem: an optional, two-stage Match with a ""summer match"" stage, in which applicants can submit a limited number of applications early. This would be conducted similarly to the early decision process for college admissions. The study objectives were to explore stakeholder opinions on the feasibility of a summer match and to identify the ideal logistic parameters to operationalize this proposal. Methods We used exploratory qualitative methodology following a constructivist paradigm to develop an understanding of the potential impact of a summer match. We interviewed 34 key stakeholders in the U.S. residency application process identified through purposive sampling including educational administrators (program directors, designated institutional officials, medical school deans) and trainees (students, residents). We coded and thematically analyzed interview data in two stages using an inductive approach. Results We identified six themes from the participant interviews that broadly reflected issues of the residency application process, value, and equity. These themes included disrupting the status quo, logistic concerns, match strategy, differential benefits, unintended consequences, and return on investment. Most study participants supported the summer match concept, with medical students and residents most in favor. We developed a theoretical summer match protocol based on these findings. Conclusions A summer match may reduce the burdens of increasing residency applications and associated costs. Pilot testing is necessary to confirm this hypothesis and determine the impact of the proposed summer match protocol. Unintended consequences must be considered carefully during implementation.","Dacre, Michael; Hopson, Laura R; Branzetti, Jeremy; Regan, Linda; Sebok-Syer, Stefanie S; Gisondi, Michael A",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222750/,1

Two sampling methods, a pump sieving water onto filters with different pore sizes (20, 100 and 300 μm), and a common manta trawl (333 μm), were utilized to sample surface water from 12 sites at the vicinity of potential sources for microplastic emissions. The number and polymer types of microplastics in the samples were determined with optical microscopy and μFTIR spectroscopy. The average concentrations were 0.27 ± 0.18 (mean ± standard deviation) microplastics m-3 in manta trawled samples and 1.8 ± 2.3 (>300 μm), 12 ± 17 (100-300 μm) and 155 ± 73 (20-100 μm) microplastics m-3 in pump filtered samples. The majority (64%) of the identified microplastics (n = 168) were fibers and the rest were fragments. Materials were identified as polymers commonly used in consumer products, such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate. Microplastic concentrations were high near the discharge pipe of a wastewater treatment plant, harbors and snow dumping site. This article is protected by copyright.

We have previously shown altered metabolism of DA-target structures, the ventral and dorsal striatum, between early and late abstinence. However, specific changes within the midbrain DA system were not investigated. Here, we investigated potential time and region-specific changes of activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in rats that had extended or limited access to cocaine and later underwent a period of abstinence. We found that DA activity is decreased only in the VTA in rats with extended access to cocaine, with no changes in SNc DA activity. These changes in VTA DA activity may participate in the negative emotional state and in the incubation of drug seeking that occur during abstinence from cocaine.","Salin, Adélie; Lardeux, Virginie; Solinas, Marcello; Belujon, Pauline",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1093/ijnp/pyaa096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305794/,1

OBJECTIVE To present the results of a single-arm, prospective, multicenter trial of the LVIS for treatment of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. METHODS 31 patients with unruptured, wide-necked (neck ≥4 mm or dome:neck ratio ≤2) intracranial aneurysms were treated with the LVIS device and bare platinum coils at six US centers (investigational device exemption G110014). Clinical follow-up was conducted at 30 days and 6 months. Angiographic follow-up was performed at 6 months. The primary safety endpoint was any major stroke or death within 30 days or major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death within 6 months. 'Probable benefit' was defined as ≥90% angiographic occlusion at 6 months. An independent core laboratory adjudicated the angiographic results. An independent clinical events committee adjudicated the clinical endpoints. RESULTS Average aneurysm size was 7.2 mm (SD 3.8) and average neck width was 4.6 mm (SD 1.8). 68% of patients had a dome:neck ratio ≤2. LVIS placement was technically successful in 29/31 patients (93.5%). No primary safety endpoints occurred during the study (0%). No patient had a higher modified Rankin Score at 6 months than at baseline. 26/28 (92.9%) treated aneurysms with 6-month angiographic follow-up demonstrated ≥90% angiographic occlusion. 21/28 (75%) were completely occluded at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The LVIS device facilitated the coil embolization of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms with high rates of technical success, an excellent safety profile, and very high rates of complete and near-complete occlusion at follow-up.

92245,Surgical Intervention for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients with Pleural Carcinomatosis: Results From the Japanese Lung Cancer Registry in 2004.,2015,"Incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has increased exponentially in the West over the past few decades. Following detection of advanced cancers, 5-year survival rates remain bleak, making identification of early neoplasia, which has a better outcome, important. Detection of subtle oesophageal lesions during endoscopy can be challenging, and advanced imaging techniques might improve their detection. High-definition endoscopy has become a standard in most endoscopy centres, and this technology probably provides better delineation of mucosal features than standard-definition endoscopy. Various image enhancement techniques are now available with the development of new electronics and software systems. Image enhancement with chromoendoscopy using dyes has been a cost-effective option for many years, yet these techniques have been replaced in some contexts by electronic chromoendoscopy, which can be used with the press of a button. However, Lugol's chromoendoscopy remains the gold standard to identify squamous dysplasia. Identification and characterization of subtle neoplastic lesions could help to target biopsies and perform endoscopic resection for better local staging and definitive therapy. In vivo histology with techniques such as confocal endomicroscopy could make endotherapy feasible within a shorter timescale than when relying on histology on tissue samples. Once early neoplasia is identified, treatments include endoscopic resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection or various ablative techniques. Endotherapy has the advantage of being a less invasive technique than oesophagectomy, and is associated with lower mortality and morbidity. Endoscopic ablation therapies have evolved over the past few years, with radiofrequency ablation showing the best results in terms of success rates and complications in Barrett dysplasia.","Mannath, Jayan; Ragunath, Krish",Nature reviews.

However, there are numerous technologies that vary in suitability for different economic and social climates. This study sets out to develop and apply a multi-criteria decision making methodology that can be used to evaluate the trade-offs between the benefits, opportunities, costs and risks of alternative energy from waste technologies in both developed and developing countries. The technologies considered are mass burn incineration, refuse derived fuel incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery. By incorporating qualitative and quantitative assessments, a preference ranking of the alternative technologies is produced. The effect of variations in decision criteria weightings are analysed in a sensitivity analysis. The methodology is applied principally to compare and assess energy recovery from waste options in the UK and India. These two countries have been selected as they could both benefit from further development of their waste-to-energy strategies, but have different technical and socio-economic challenges to consider. It is concluded that gasification is the preferred technology for the UK, whereas anaerobic digestion is the preferred technology for India. We believe that the presented methodology will be of particular value for waste-to-energy decision-makers in both developed and developing countries.","Yap, H Y; Nixon, J D",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2015.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26275797/,1

Among nurses in Turkey, we want to explore how anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation affect nurses' quality of life. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life (COVID-19 EQLS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-1 and STAI-2), psychological health, and social isolation among nurses. It also aimed to identify whether the influence of trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation are stronger than the direct influence of state anxiety on nurses' quality of life during the pandemic. METHODS A cross-sectional study design and STROBE guidelines were implemented. In this study, 638 nurses in Turkey were included using simple random sampling. The participants completed the STAI-1 and STAI-2 and COVID-19 EQLS online-form. The parallel-serial mediation model was used to examine the relationships between the determined variables. RESULTS Psychological health, psychological effects of social isolation, and trait anxiety fully mediated the relationship between state anxiety and quality of life of nurses. The total indirect effect of the confidence interval of bootstrapping was statistically different from zero. CONCLUSIONS Trait anxiety, psychological health, and social isolation were the main factors with statistically significant indirect effects on the quality of life of Turkish nurses in this study.","Potas, Nihan; Koçtürk, Nilüfer; Toygar, Sükrü Anıl",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024800/,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Electroencephalogram (EEG) of 22 medical students was recorded while performing five key tasks on the robotic surgical simulator: Instrument Control, Ball Placement, Spatial Control II, Fourth Arm Tissue Retraction, and Hands-on Surgical Training Tasks. All students completed the Surgery Task Load Index(SURG-TLX), which includes one domain for subjective assessment of distraction (scale: 1-20). Scores were divided into low (score 1-6, subjective label: 1), intermediate (score 7-12, subjective label: 2), and high distraction (score 13-20, subjective label: 3). These cut-off values were arbitrarily considered based on a verbal assessment of participants and experienced surgeons. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm was trained utilizing EEG recordings from the medical students and used to classify their distraction levels. The accuracy of our method was determined by comparing the subjective distraction scores on SURG-TLX and the results from the proposed classification algorithm. Also, Pearson correlation was utilized to assess the relationship between performance scores (generated by the simulator) and distraction (Subjective assessment scores). RESULTS The proposed end-to-end model classified distraction into low, intermediate, and high with 94%, 89%, and 95% accuracy, respectively. We found a significant negative correlation (r=-0.21; p=0.003) between performance and SURG-TLX distraction scores.

92992,Spontaneous delayed migration/shortening of the pipeline embolization device: report of 5 cases.,2013,"Down Syndrome (DS), also known as Trisomy 21 (T21), is the most common human chromosomal anomaly. Although DS can affect many organ systems, lung and heart disease are the leading causes of death. An abundance of existing data suggests lung abnormalities originate postnatally in DS. However, a single report of branching insufficiency in DS has inferred a potential prenatal origin. The histology of T21 fetal lungs (n = 15) was assessed by an experienced pathologist. Spatial differences in cellular phenotypes were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Comprehensive gene expression in prenatal T21 lungs (n = 19), and age-matched controls (n = 19), was performed using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and validated by RT-qPCR. Histopathological abnormalities were observed in approximately half of T21 prenatal lung samples analyzed, which included dilated terminal airways/acinar tubules, dilated lymphatics, and arterial wall thickening. IHC for Ki67 revealed significant reductions in epithelial and mesenchymal cell proliferation, predominantly in tissues displaying pathology. IHC demonstrated that airway smooth muscle was reduced and discontinuous in the proximal airway in conjunction with reduced SOX2. RNAseq identified 118 genes significantly dysregulated (FDR <0.05) in T21 lung when unadjusted, and 316 genes when adjusted for age. Ontology analysis showed IFN pathway genes were appreciably upregulated, whereas complement and coagulation cascades and extracellular matrix pathway genes were downregulated. RT-qPCR confirmed the changes in genes associated with these pathways in prenatal T21 lungs. Our data demonstrate that specific histological, cellular, and molecular abnormalities occur prenatally in different compartments of human T21 lung, which could be representative of premature stage progression.

Loss-of-function mutations in the stefin B gene (CSTB) gene were reported in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1). We have identified an interaction between stefin B and nucleosomes, specifically with histones H2A.Z, H2B, and H3. In synchronized T98G cells, stefin B co-immunoprecipitated with histone H3, predominantly in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. Stefin B-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts entered S phase earlier than wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In contrast, increased expression of stefin B in the nucleus delayed cell cycle progression in T98G cells. The delay in cell cycle progression was associated with the inhibition of cathepsin L in the nucleus, as judged from the decreased cleavage of the CUX1 transcription factor. In vitro, inhibition of cathepsin L by stefin B was potentiated in the presence of histones, whereas histones alone did not affect the cathepsin L activity. Interaction of stefin B with the Met-75 truncated form of cathepsin L in the nucleus was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in the living cells. Stefin B could thus play an important role in regulating the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L in the nucleus, protecting substrates such as transcription factors from its proteolytic processing.","Ceru, Slavko; Konjar, Spela; Maher, Katarina; Repnik, Urska; Krizaj, Igor; Bencina, Mojca; Renko, Miha; Nepveu, Alain; Zerovnik, Eva; Turk, Boris; Kopitar-Jerala, Natasa",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.034793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20075068/,1

To investigate predictive factors of well-being and obtain insights into work-life integration, the survey was conducted by letter mail in a sample of Japanese physicians. A total of 422 responses were collected from 846 physicians. The mean age was 47.9 years, males constituted 83.3% of the physicians, and 88.6% were considered to be well.

Using a machine learning model, physician well-being could be predicted. It seems to be influenced by multiple factors, such as career satisfaction, work hours per week, family support, gender, and power harassment.

93794,Pulmonary fibrosis: Where from and where to?,2021-08-01,"OBJECTIVE A previous study reported that glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is involved in mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of microRNAs (miRs) in mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis by targeting GRP94. MATERIALS AND METHODS Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide (PI) staining was conducted to evaluate the apoptosis of chondrocytes. The mRNA and protein expression levels were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. The targeted genes were predicted using a bioinformatics tool and further investigated via a luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS The results demonstrated that cyclic loading led to significant increases in GRP94 expression in chondrocytes; however, the expression levels of miR-150 were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis and a luciferase reporter assay indicated that GRP94 was a direct target of miR-150, as the expression of GRP94 was dysregulated following transfection with miR-150 mimics or inhibitors. In addition, mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis was suppressed by transfection with miR-150 mimics, while the protective effects of miR-150 mimics in this process were inhibited by GRP94 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS MiR-150 upregulation suppressed mechanical stress-induced chondrocyte apoptosis; the underlying molecular mechanism may be mediated, at least partially, via the inhibition of GRP94 expression.","Zhang, Z-Q; Wang, C-S; Yang, P; Wang, K-Z",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201909_18987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599403/,1

Each was in a ""hot spot"" where the outbreak overwhelmed the capacities of the hospitals. Professor Antonino Spinelli of Milan dealt with the sudden increase in COVID-19 patients that threatened to push all other emergencies and urgent cancer cases aside. Providers lacked the personal protective equipment to be adequately safe in the environment. In Madrid, Dr Julio Mayol recounted how 10%-15% of the workers in his hospital were incapacitated by the virus, many of them doctors providing direct care to patients. The disease is so prevalent that all emergency patients are treated as though they have the infection. Having practices in Saudi Arabia and Spain, Dr Delia Cortés-Guiral saw how the former country controlled the epidemic through a strict lockdown of travel and closure of holy pilgrimage sites and social gatherings. In contrast, upon her return to her native country, she experienced the near-breakdown of the health care system by the suddenness of the outbreak. ""There are now no specialists now, she says.""

93923,A novel diagnostic approach may reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections.,2014,"IMPORTANCE Many questions remain unanswered about the role of bariatric surgery for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). OBJECTIVE To determine feasibility of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and compare initial outcomes of bariatric surgery and a structured weight loss program for treating T2DM in participants with grades I and II obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 12-month, 3-arm RCT at a single center including 69 participants aged 25 to 55 years with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30 to 40 and T2DM. INTERVENTIONS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention (LWLI). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes in the intention-to-treat cohort were feasibility and effectiveness measured by weight loss and improvements in glycemic control. RESULTS Of 667 potential participants who underwent screening, 69 (10.3%) were randomized. Among the randomized participants, 30 (43%) had grade I obesity, and 56 (81%) were women. Mean (SD) age was 47.3 (6.4) years and hemoglobin A1c level, 7.9% (2.0%). After randomization, 7 participants (10%) refused to undergo their allocated intervention (3 RYGB, 1 LAGB, and 3 LWLI), and 1 RYGB participant was excluded for current smoking. Twenty participants underwent RYGB; 21, LAGB; and 20, LWLI, with 12-month retention rates of 90%, 86%, and 70%, respectively. In the intention-to-treat cohort with multiple imputation for missing data, RYGB participants had the greatest mean weight loss from baseline (27.0%; 95% CI, 30.8-23.3) compared with LAGB (17.3%; 95% CI, 21.1-13.5) and LWLI (10.2%; 95% CI, 14.8-5.61) (P < .001). Partial and complete remission of T2DM were 50% and 17%, respectively, in the RYGB group and 27% and 23%, respectively, in the LAGB group (P < .001 and P = .047 between groups for partial and complete remission), with no remission in the LWLI group. Significant reductions in use of antidiabetics occurred in both surgical groups. No deaths were noted. The 3 serious adverse events included 1 ulcer treated medically in the RYGB group and 2 rehospitalizations for dehydration in the LAGB group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study highlights several potential challenges to successful completion of a larger RCT for treatment of T2DM and obesity in patients with a body mass index of 30 to 40, including the difficulties associated with recruiting and randomizing patients to surgical vs nonsurgical interventions. Preliminary results show that RYGB was the most effective treatment, followed by LAGB for weight loss and T2DM outcomes at 1 year.

BACKGROUND The Global Health Security Index categorised the preparedness of 195 countries to face a biological threat on a variety of measures, producing an overall score. The United States of America and the United Kingdom were ranked 1st and 2nd most prepared in 2019. METHOD A cross-nation comparison of the top-36 countries ranked by Global Health Security score using a variety of online sources, including key data about each nation's expenditure on health and the nursing workforce, and compared these with mortality data for COVID-19. RESULTS The extent of a countries pandemic preparedness, expenditure on healthcare and magnitude of the nursing workforce does not appear to impact mortality rates at this stage of the pandemic which is something of a paradox. CONCLUSION It is important that arrangements for dealing with future global pandemics involve a range of agencies and experts in the field, including nurse leaders.

94436,The Combined Use of Intraluminal and Intrasaccular Flow Diversion for the Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms: Report of 25 Cases.,2018,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired lung infections characterized by hyperinflammation, antibiotic resistance, and high morbidity/mortality. Here, we show that the genetic ablation of one cAMP-phosphodiesterase 4 subtype, PDE4B, is sufficient to protect mice from acute lung injury induced by P aeruginosa infection as it reduces pulmonary and systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as pulmonary vascular leakage and mortality. Surprisingly, despite dampening immune responses, bacterial clearance in the lungs of PDE4B-KO mice is significantly improved compared to WT controls. In wildtypes, P aeruginosa-infection produces high systemic levels of several cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, that act as cryogens and render the animals hypothermic. This, in turn, diminishes their ability to clear the bacteria. Ablation of PDE4B curbs both the initial production of acute response cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as their downstream signaling, specifically the induction of the secondary-response cytokine IL-6. This synergistic action protects PDE4B-KO mice from the deleterious effects of the P aeruginosa-induced cytostorm, while concurrently improving bacterial clearance, rather than being immunosuppressive. These benefits of PDE4B ablation are in contrast to the effects resulting from treatment with PAN-PDE4 inhibitors, which have been shown to increase bacterial burden and dissemination. Thus, PDE4B represents a promising therapeutic target in settings of P aeruginosa lung infections.","Abou Saleh, Lina; Boyd, Abigail; Aragon, Ileana V; Koloteva, Anna; Spadafora, Domenico; Mneimneh, Wadad; Barrington, Robert A; Richter, Wito",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202100495r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383981/,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eligible adults residing in the area under study were chosen by simple random sampling and interviewed using a predesigned and pretested data collection schedule to assess awareness and perception. Based on their total awareness score, the participants were classified as having good awareness or poor awareness toward eye donation. RESULTS Among 423 participants, 52.0% were male, 34.0% were 18 to 30 years old, 38.3% were educated up to secondary level, and 85.6% had eye disease in their family. Of total participants, 70.2% had heard about eye donation, with 59.9% of this group having knowledge of eye donation only after death and 57.9% having knowledge that donation must occur within 6 hours of death. In addition, 52.9% were aware about donation from home, 30.6% said only the cornea is transplantable, and 52.2% knew it can be preserved. Participants with higher education, higher socioeconomic status, and outside of the house occupational engagement had significantly higher chance of good eye donation awareness. Of total participants, 32.0% said that COVID-19 could be transmitted through eye donation, with 58.2% of participants opining that the pandemic was not a suitable time to consider donation of eyes. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has had a negative impact on eye donation perceptions. Although most of our participants had heard about eye donation, their awareness regarding important aspects about eye donation were still lacking, thus calling for a more focused action plan and implementation of the same.","Gupta, Shibaji; Bhattacharya, Saikat; Kole, Seshadri; Guchhait, Debjani; Sinha Gupta, Sharmistha",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2021.0036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33952176/,1

Current therapy is expensive, associated with significant side effects, and often ineffective. Discovery of antiviral compounds against HCV traditionally involves a priori target identification followed by biochemical screening and confirmation in cell-based replicon assays. Typically, this results in the discovery of compounds that address a few predetermined targets and are prone to select for escape variants. To attempt to identify antiviral compounds with broad target specificity, we developed an unbiased cell-based screening system involving multiple rounds of infection in a 96-well format. Analysis of a publicly available library of 446 clinically approved drugs identified 33 compounds that targeted both known and previously unexplored aspects of HCV infection, including entry, replication, and assembly. Discovery of novel viral and cellular targets in this manner will broaden the therapeutic armamentarium against this virus, allowing for the development of drug mixtures that should reduce the likelihood of mutational escape.","Gastaminza, Pablo; Whitten-Bauer, Christina; Chisari, Francis V",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0912966107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19995961/,1
95400,Flow Diversion for Giant Intracranial Aneurysms: Problem or Panacea?,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS The second-generation Pillcam Colon Capsule Endoscope (PCCE-2; Given Imaging Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) is an ingestible capsule for visualization of the colon. We performed a multicenter pilot study to assess its safety and feasibility in evaluating the severity of Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS In a prospective study, 40 patients with active colonic CD underwent PCCE-2 and optical colonoscopy procedures. Using both techniques, we generated values for the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS), the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD, and global evaluation of lesion severity. In the first stage of the study, we calculated the correlation between PCCE-2 and optical colonoscopy scores. In the second stage, we performed interobserver agreement analysis for a random subset of 20 PCCE-2 recordings, graded in duplicate by 2 independent readers. RESULTS There was substantial agreement between PCCE-2 and optical colonoscopy in the measurement of the CDEIS (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.80). There was substantial interobserver agreement between 2 independent PCCE-2 readers for the CDEIS (ICC, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35-0.86) and the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (ICC, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.32-0.85). However, the PCCE-2 scoring systematically underestimated the severity of disease compared with optical colonoscopy; based on our results, PCCE-2 detected colonic ulcerations with 86% sensitivity and 40% specificity. No adverse events were observed and PCCE-2 was better tolerated than colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS PCCE-2 is feasible, safe, and well tolerated for the assessment of mucosal CD activity in selected populations. Larger studies are needed to assess its operating characteristics further.

The aim of the study was to assess treatment outcomes in patients with hereditary spherocytosis who underwent total or partial laparoscopic splenectomy. Fifteen patients aged 4-17 yr underwent laparoscopic splenectomy from 2009 to 2012. Partial and total splenectomies were performed (five and 10 children, respectively). Hematologic parameters, liver function tests, and splenic volume before and after the surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Total follow-up was 1-30 months. Hospitalization and operating time were similar in both groups. In partial splenectomy group, branches of splenic arteries gave better blood supply than short gastric vessels. In both groups, hematologic parameters were improved. Postoperative markedly elevated platelet count was maintained up to 6 months, and after that, platelet count gradually decreased to normal values. Bilirubin level was decreased in early postoperative period; however, it increased later to achieve levels lower than in preoperative period. No severe general infections were observed in both groups. Laboratory parameters (hemoglobin and bilirubin concentrations and RBC) after the surgery improved in all patients, and the effect was maintained during 12 months of follow-up. Platelet count increased significantly after the surgery and was maintained at high levels during the next 6 months. However, it returned to preoperative levels within a year after the surgery.

The compound 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) has high cholesterol complexation capacity and is currently under clinical investigation for the NPC treatment. However, due to its short blood half-life, high doses are required to produce a therapeutic effect. In this work, stable polymerized HPβCD is generated to investigate their in vitro mechanisms of action and in vivo effects. Crosslinked CDs (8-312 kDa) display a ninefold greater cholesterol complexation capacity than monomeric HPβCD but are taken up to a lower extent, resulting in an overall comparable in vitro effect. In vivo, the 19.3 kDa HPβCD exhibits a longer half-life than the monomeric HPβCD but it does not increase the life span of Npc1 mice, possibly due to reduced brain penetration. This is circumvented by the application of magnetic resonance imaging-guided low intensity-pulsed focused ultrasound (MRIg-FUS), which increases the brain penetration of the CD. In conclusion, stable polymerized HPβCDs can elucidate CDs' mechanism of action while the use of MRIg-FUS warrants further investigation, as it may be key to harnessing CDs full therapeutic potential in the NPC treatment.","Carradori, Dario; Chen, Hsintsung; Werner, Beat; Shah, Aagam S; Leonardi, Chiara; Usuelli, Mattia; Mezzenga, Raffaele; Platt, Frances; Leroux, Jean-Christophe",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202004735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079457/,1

Their biogenesis is unusual because each peptide is an 18-residue chimera formed by the head-to-tail splicing of nonapeptides derived from two separate precursors. θ-Defensins have multiple arginines and a ladder-like tridisulfide array spanning their two antiparallel β-strands. Human θ-defensin genes contain a premature stop codon that prevents effective translation of the needed precursors; consequently, these peptides are not present in human leukocytes. Synthetic θ-defensins with sequences that correspond to those encoded within the human pseudogenes are called retrocyclins. Retrocyclin-1 inhibits the cellular entry of HIV-1, HSV, and influenza A virus. The rhesus θ-defensin RTD-1 protects mice from an experimental severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, and retrocyclin-1 protects mice from infection by Bacillus anthracis spores. The small size, unique structure, and multiple host defense activities of θ-defensins make them intriguing potential therapeutic agents.","Lehrer, Robert I; Cole, Alex M; Selsted, Michael E",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.r112.346098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22700960/,1

CASE REPORT Clinical and radiographic data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and evaluated for COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration-approved reverse transcription-PCR assays. On radiographic examination, PET/CT was consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia not seen on prior imaging. Initial nasopharyngeal swab 2 days after PET/CT imaging was negative for COVID-19. Subsequent repeat swab 10 days later was positive for COVID-19, while the patient was febrile on screening assessment. The patient remained COVID-19-positive until 1 month after abnormal PET/CT imaging. CONCLUSION PET/CT can be sensitive for early COVID-19 detection, even in the setting of a negative confirmatory PCR test. This highlights the importance of continued patient surveillance and use of appropriate personal protective equipment to minimize COVID-19 transmission.","Mo, Allen; Brodin, N Patrik; Tomé, Wolfgang A; Garg, Madhur K; Kabarriti, Rafi",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.11961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503829/,1

In the presence of rats rendered incompetent to help through pharmacological treatment, rats were less likely to help due to a reduction in reinforcement rather than to a lack of initial interest. Only incompetent helpers of a strain familiar to the helper rat exerted a detrimental effect on helping; rats helped at near control levels in the presence of incompetent helpers from an unfamiliar strain. Duos and trios of potential helper rats helped at superadditive rates, demonstrating that rats act nonindependently with helping facilitated by the presence of competent-to-help bystanders. Furthermore, helping was facilitated in rats that had previously observed other rats' helping and were then tested individually. In sum, the influence of bystanders on helping behavior in rats features characteristics that closely resemble those observed in humans.","Havlik, John L; Vieira Sugano, Yuri Y; Jacobi, Maura Clement; Kukreja, Rahul R; Jacobi, John H Clement; Mason, Peggy",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb4205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923593/,1

100050,Highlight of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Development against COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-12,"By integrating mesoscale models for hydrodynamics and micromechanics, we examine the fluid-driven motion of pairs of capsules on a compliant, adhesive substrate. The capsules, modeled as fluid filled elastic shells, represent cells or polymeric microcapsules. We show that both the relative and the average velocities of two closely spaced, rolling capsules depends on the elasticity of the capsules, the adhesive interaction between the capsules and the substrate, and the compliance of the substrate. We first focused on a stiff surface and found that pairs of rigid capsules always separate from each other, while for deformable capsules, the dynamic behavior depends critically on the strength of the adhesive interaction. For strong adhesion to the substrate, the capsules again roll away from each other, while for a relatively weak adhesion, the capsules actually approach each other. In the case of soft substrates, any significant deformations of the surface that are caused by the capsules give rise to a force that propels the particles to move rapidly apart. Thus, in the case of strong adhesion between the capsules and the soft substrates, both rigid and flexible capsules are driven to separate. On the other hand, for weak adhesion, the elastic particles approach each other, similar to the behavior on stiff surfaces. These findings reveal that the interactions between the capsules are mediated by the nature of the underlying layer. We can harness this information to design surfaces that actively control the relative separation between the capsules. This could be utilized to regulate the motion of biological cells, as well as polymeric microcapsules, and thus, could prove to be useful in various biological assays or tissue engineering studies.","Alexeev, Alexander; Verberg, Rolf; Balazs, Anna C",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b602417c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680246/,1

In this retrospective study, archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-wax-embedded lung samples of 69 severe and lethal cases of pneumonia in cats were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the detection of nine selected infectious agents: Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma felis, M. gateae, Chlamydia felis, feline herpesvirus type 1, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. The intention was to elucidate their immediate involvement in pneumonia formation. Due to the cross-reactivity of the applied antibodies, a species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for both targeted Mycoplasma species was applied additionally. In the 42 cases (60.9%) positive for at least one pathogen, several agents were present in a high proportion of the samples (P. multocida - 34.8%, B. bronchiseptica - 29.0%), while others were present in a moderate (feline herpesvirus type 1 - 18.8%, M. gateae - 13.0%, M. felis - 10.1%) or low percentage (T. gondii - 1.4%). All samples were negative for C. felis, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus. Mixed infections of up to four pathogens were more frequent than single infections. Mycoplasma preferably colonised lung tissue damaged by other pathogens because they never occurred as single infections. Pasteurella multocida, B. bronchiseptica, M. felis, feline herpesvirus type 1 and T. gondii showed abundant replication within lung lesions, thus suggesting a prominent role in pneumonia formation.","Schmal-Filius, Eva; Nedorost, Nora; Weissenbacher-Lang, Christiane; Weissenböck, Herbert",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/004.2020.00037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33221738/,1

No drug effects have yet been reported on spontaneous trigeminal neuropathic pain. It has been proposed that the directed face grooming behavior that also develops following IoN-CCI offers a measure of spontaneous trigeminal neuropathic pain. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We examined the effects of a continuous 1-week infusion of 30 mg/day carbamazepine (the first-line drug treatment for trigeminal neuralgia), 1.06 mg/day baclofen, 4.18 mg/day clomipramine, and 5 mg/day morphine on spontaneous and mechanically evoked pain behavior (ie, directed face grooming and von Frey testing) in IoN-CCI rats. RESULTS Isolated face grooming was significantly reduced in rats receiving carbamazepine and baclofen but not in clomipramine- or morphine-treated rats. All drugs showed significant antiallodynic effects; carbamazepine showed the strongest effects, whereas clomipramine had only minor efficacy. CONCLUSION The tested drugs have differential effects in the IoN-CCI model, and different neuropathological mechanisms may underlie the different somatosensory symptoms in this model. A mechanism-based approach may be needed to treat (trigeminal) neuropathic pain. The present data support IoN-CCI as a model of trigeminal neuralgia in which isolated face grooming is used as a measure of spontaneous neuropathic pain.","Deseure, K; Hans, G H",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s124526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28184169/,1

These 90 to 120-minute simulations, e-Missions, are video-conferenced into classrooms, with companion websites providing pre-mission preparation, supplemental resources and teacher tutorials. e-Missions have been used more than 11,000 times at schools in 50 states and 22 nations. More than 310,000 elementary, middle and high school students have role-played STEM experts, and 10,000 teachers were trained to use technology and problem-based learning. Shorter live missions, e-Labs, were created to demonstrate science topics in 3-9 grade classrooms, and e-Labs Jr do the same for K-3. The simulations and e-Labs are developed with funding from agencies, foundations and corporations, and are maintained through payments by schools of $400 to $550 for each e-Mission, and $200 for e-Labs, often year after year as culminating events for relevant curricula. More than $5 million dollars have been earned over the last 20 years, supporting the sustained delivery of these innovative STEM experiences, and software and hardware updates.

On February 28, 2020 of Geneva time, the World Health Organization has raised global risk level to the very high level in view of outbreak of COVID-19. Since some patients' condition appeared to deteriorate rapidly after infection of this 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV), a variety of treatments should be considered. Holistic view and syndrome differentiation are the two characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome diffe-rentiation of TCM has achieved good effects in the treatment of COVID-19. This treatment mainly aimed at eliminating pathogens and strengthening overall health, regulating the balance of body and coordinating various of functions of Zangfu organs. In addition, modern medical proposes host-directed therapy(HDT), a strategy aims to interfere with host cell mechanism, enhance immune responses, and reduce exacerbated inflammation. To some extent, the combined application of HDT and antiviral therapy is highly consistent with the therapeutic concept of the holistic view of TCM. Therefore, under the guidance of the holistic view, syndrome differentiation of TCM uses treatments, such as clearing heat, detoxification, relieving asthma, clearing damp and phlegm, together with Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Maxing Shigan Decoction, and Haoqin Qingdan Decoction under the guidance of these therapeutic methods.

Qualitative data may contextualise existing knowledge surrounding perceptions of mHealth among AA women as part of formative work for designing a physical activity application (app). METHODS A convenience sample of 16 AA women completed an informatics survey prior to participating in focus groups exploring their use of mobile technology and health apps. Survey responses provided frequency data, while iterative transcript analysis of focus groups identified themes. RESULTS The majority of participants (mean age=62.1 years, SD=6.6) felt comfortable using a tablet/smartphone (75.0%). Most (68.8%) reported using health-related apps, primarily focused on physical activity and nutrition. Focus groups revealed four overarching concepts, including (1) user attachment, (2) technology adoption, (3) potential facilitators and (4) potential barriers. Important features which may serve as facilitators or barriers to future adoption of a mobile app for an mHealth intervention include individual app tailoring and software concerns, respectively. DISCUSSION Thematic analysis revealed high user attachment to smartphones and described participants' process for adopting new mHealth technology.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a promising therapeutic target for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the present study, we explored the effect of propofol on ACE2 expression in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs). METHODS HPAECs were treated with propofol in different concentrations (1, 10, 20, 40 or 50 µmol/l) for different lengths of time (6, 12, 18, 24 or 30 h) with or without transcription inhibitor actinomycin D or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. RESULTS Propofol increased the ACE2 mRNA level in a dose- and time-dependent manner within 24 h. Propofol treatment dose-dependently increased the ACE2 protein level and the cell membrane ACE2 activity. Transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the augmenting effect of propofol on the mRNA level of ACE2 in HPAECs. CONCLUSION Propofol enhances the ACE2 expression in HPAECs by increasing the transcription of ACE2 via a PI3K-dependent mechanism, which leads to increased ACE2 activity on the cell membrane. This study provides new insights into propofol's vascular protective effects as well as its therapeutic potential for pulmonary arterial hypertension.","Cao, Lijun; Xu, Linyong; Huang, Bosheng; Wu, Lixiang",Pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000338754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095677/,1

Medication interventions to improve patient education are essential for better outcomes. Medication interventions in our unit have not previously followed a systematic procedure. They have not been quantified and do not encompass all patients. This study aims to develop a simple tool that can significantly help the effective prioritisation of the workload among the Medicines Optimisation Team, ensuring patient-centred care is optimised. METHODS This is an observational case series study. A basic Excel spreadsheet was designed to capture the team's daily interventions focusing on four main areas: medicines reconciliation, admission, follow-up and discharge. We named it the Medicines Optimisation Interventions Tracking Tool (MOITT). RESULTS Analysis of the data showed a good number of patients receiving interventions: 122 (92%) medicines reconciliation, 77 (58%) admission interventions, 64 (48%) follow-up interventions and 28 (21%) interventions on discharge. This quantification of work revealed factors which prevent achieving a higher percentage of interventions. The criteria to complete the spreadsheet were modified accordingly to address these factors resulting in an improvement in the design of the tool and the protocol to follow to complete it. In addition, it was encouraging to see the team's hard work portrayed in figures for the first time. CONCLUSION The MOITT developed facilitates an efficient clinical prioritisation of work for the Medicines Optimisation Team. This study has shown that this novel way of working is advantageous to record and keep track of the Medicines Optimisation Team's daily interventions on an inpatient ward, helping to set daily objectives. Implementation of this tool increases targeted patient interventions and team productivity and influences changes in practice to adapt to the service needs.

The models that guide the management of these fisheries almost always assume reproduction is proportional to mass (isometry), when fecundity generally increases disproportionately to mass (hyperallometry). Judged against several management reference points, we show that assuming isometry overestimates the replenishment potential of exploited fish stocks by 22% (range: 2% to 78%) for 32 of the world's largest fisheries, risking systematic overharvesting. We calculate that target catches based on assumptions of isometry are more than double those based on assumptions of hyperallometry for most species, such that common reference points are set twice as high as they should be to maintain the target level of replenishment. We also show that hyperallometric reproduction provides opportunities for increasing the efficacy of tools that are underused in standard fisheries management, such as protected areas or harvest slot limits. Adopting management strategies that conserve large, hyperfecund fish may, in some instances, result in higher yields relative to traditional approaches. We recommend that future assessment of reference points and quotas include reproductive hyperallometry unless there is clear evidence that it does not occur in that species.","Marshall, Dustin J; Bode, Michael; Mangel, Marc; Arlinghaus, Robert; Dick, E J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100695118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400498/,1

Most traditional vision screening methods rely on human expert assessments based on a set of vision tests. As technology advances, new instruments and computerised tools are available for complementing vision screening. The scoping review based on this protocol aims to investigate current technologies for vision screening, what vision tests can be complemented by technologies, and how these can support vision screening by providing measurements. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The planned review will utilise the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) tool. Electronic search will be performed in databases, including Web of Science, MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, Engineering Village, Cochrane and Embase. We will perform a systematic search in selected reference databases without the limitation on publications dates, or country of studies. Reference management software, like EndNote and DistillerSR, will be used to remove duplicate entries. Two authors will independently analyse the studies for inclusion eligibility. Conflicts will be resolved by discussion. We will extract the types of technologies, types of vision tests they complement and the measurements for the included studies. Overall findings will be synthesised by thematic analysis and mapping to the logic model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this review, as it will only summarise existing published data. We will publish the findings in an open access, peer-reviewed journal. We expect that the review results will be useful for vision screening experts, developers, researchers, and policymakers.","Ali, Qasim; Heldal, Ilona; Helgesen, Carsten Gunnar; Krumina, Gunta; Tvedt, Marianne Nesbjørg",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475181/,1

A chronic polyneuropathy is described in a cohort of young Bengal cats. OBJECTIVE To characterize the clinical and histopathological features of a chronic-relapsing peripheral neuropathy in young Bengal cats. ANIMALS Thirty-seven young Bengal cats with clinical weakness consistent with peripheral neuropathy. METHODS Bengal cats were included in this study after a diagnosis of polyneuropathy was confirmed by muscle and peripheral nerve biopsy specimens. Pathological changes were characterized at the light and electron microscopic level and by morphometry. Clinical information and long-term outcome from case records of Bengal cats with histologically confirmed peripheral neuropathy were then assessed. RESULTS Nerve fiber loss within distal intramuscular nerve branches was a consistent finding in young Bengal cats with polyneuropathy. The most common abnormalities in peripheral nerve biopsies included inappropriately thin myelin sheaths and thinly myelinated fibers surrounded by supernumerary Schwann cell processes, indicative of repeated cycles of demyelination and remyelination. Recovery was common. Response to treatment could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE A chronic-relapsing form of polyneuropathy associated primarily with episodes of demyelination and remyelination was identified in young Bengal cats. The prognosis for recovery is good, although relapses are possible and there can be residual motor deficits.","Bensfield, A C; Evans, J; Pesayco, J P; Mizisin, A P; Shelton, G D",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0740.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21689154/,1

Are there structural features that make a fold amenable to functional innovation (innovability)? Do these features relate to robustness--the ability to readily accumulate sequence changes? We discuss several hypotheses regarding the relationship between the architecture of a protein and its evolutionary potential. We describe how, in a seemingly paradoxical manner, opposite properties, such as high stability and rigidity versus conformational plasticity and structural order versus disorder, promote robustness and/or innovability. We hypothesize that polarity--differentiation and low connectivity between a protein's scaffold and its active-site--is a key prerequisite for innovability.","Tóth-Petróczy, Agnes; Tawfik, Dan S",Current opinion in structural biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2014.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038399/,1

104733,Probiotics/ prebiotics in viral respiratory infections: implication for emerging pathogens.,2021-04-18,"BACKGROUND The type of fundoplication that should be performed in conjunction with Heller myotomy for esophageal achalasia is controversial. We prospectively compared anterior fundoplication (Dor) with partial posterior fundoplication (Toupet) in patients undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy. METHODS A multicenter, prospective, randomized-controlled trial was initiated to compare Dor versus Toupet fundoplication after laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Outcome measures were symptomatic GERD scores (0-4, five-point Likert scale questionnaire) and 24-h pH testing at 6-12 months after surgery. Data are mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was by Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and Freidman's test. RESULTS Sixty of 85 originally enrolled and randomized patients who underwent 36 Dor and 24 Toupet fundoplications had follow-up data per protocol for analysis. Dor and Toupet groups were similar in age (46.8 vs. 51.7 years) and gender (52.8 vs. 62.5% male). pH studies at 6-12 months in 43 patients (72%: Dor n = 24 and Toupet n = 19) showed total DeMeester scores and % time pH < 4 were not significant between the two groups. Abnormal acid reflux was present in 10 of 24 Dor group patients (41.7%) and in 4 of 19 Toupet patients (21.0%) (p = 0.152). Dysphagia and regurgitation symptom scores improved significantly in both groups compared to preoperative scores. No significant differences in any esophageal symptoms were noted between the two groups preoperatively or at follow-up. SF-36 quality-of-life measures changed significantly from pre- to postoperative for five of ten domains in the Dor group and seven of ten in the Toupet patients (not significant between groups). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic Heller myotomy provides significant improvement in dysphagia and regurgitation symptoms in achalasia patients regardless of the type of partial fundoplication. Although a higher percentage of patients in the Dor group had abnormal 24-h pH test results compared to those of patients who underwent Toupet, the differences were not statistically significant.","Rawlings, Arthur; Soper, Nathaniel J; Oelschlager, Brant; Swanstrom, Lee; Matthews, Brent D; Pellegrini, Carlos; Pierce, Richard A; Pryor, Aurora; Martin, Valeria; Frisella, Margaret M; Cassera, Maria; Brunt, L Michael",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1822-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789646/,1

The association between depression and anxiety, on the one hand, and the MetSyn as a cluster or its individual components, on the other hand, is equivocal. The categorical nature of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition might partly explain the inconsistent findings. METHODS In 2,433 Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety participants (mean age, 42.3 years; 33.1% male), three symptoms dimensions-lack of positive affect (PA, depression specific); negative affect (NA, aspecific); and somatic arousal (SA, anxiety specific)-were assessed by a shortened adaptation of the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. The association between symptom dimensions and MetSyn components (waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose, and mean blood pressure) was analyzed, using linear regression analysis. RESULTS The occurrence rate of the MetSyn was 20.1% (n = 490). SA, but not PA and NA, was strongly associated with four out of five MetSyn components, especially waist circumference, triglycerides, and blood pressure (β = 0.046, p = .01; β = 0.077, p < .001; and β = 0.069, p < .001, respectively), and with the total number of MetSyn components (β = 0.098, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate a strong association of most of the MetSyn components with the SA dimension, but not with the NA and PA scales.","Luppino, Floriana S; van Reedt Dortland, Arianne K B; Wardenaar, Klaas J; Bouvy, Paul F; Giltay, Erik J; Zitman, Frans G; Penninx, Brenda W J H",Psychosomatic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/psy.0b013e31820a59c0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21257975/,1
104979,Ischemic lesion growth in acute stroke: Water uptake quantification distinguishes between edema and tissue infarct.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES One-stage laparoscopic management for common bile duct stones in patients with gallbladder stones has gained wide acceptance. We developed a novel technique using a transcystic approach for common bile duct exploration as an alternative to the existing procedures. METHODS From April 2010 to June 2012, 9 consecutive patients diagnosed with cholelithiasis and common bile duct stones were enrolled in this study. The main inclusion criteria included no upper abdominal surgical history and the presence of a stone measuring <5 mm. After the gallbladder was dissected free from the liver connections in a retrograde fashion, the fundus of the gallbladder was extracted via the port incision in the right epigastrium. The choledochoscope was inserted into the gallbladder through the small opening in the fundus of the gallbladder extracorporeally and was advanced toward the common bile duct via the cystic duct under the guidance of both laparoscopic imaging and endoscopic imaging. After stones were retrieved under direct choledochoscopic vision, a drainage tube was placed in the subhepatic space. RESULTS Of 9 patients, 7 had successful transcystic common bile duct stone clearance. A narrow cystic duct and the unfavorable anatomy of the junction of the cystic duct and common bile duct resulted in losing access to the common bile duct. No bile leakage, hemobilia, or pancreatitis occurred. Wound infection occurred in 2 patients. Transient epigastric colic pain occurred in 2 patients and was relieved by use of anisodamine. A transient increase in the amylase level was observed in 3 patients. Short-term follow-up did not show any recurrence of common bile duct stones. CONCLUSION Our novel transcystic approach to laparoscopic common bile duct exploration is feasible and efficient.","Chen, Dawei; Fei, Zhewei; Huang, Xia; Wang, Xiaojun",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25516702/,1

Emergency departments (EDs) are more likely to come into contact with potential EVD patients. It is important for EDs to be prepared to care for suspected EVD patients. Our objective was to understand the perceived challenges experienced by Washington State ED medical directors in EVD preparedness. METHODS An anonymous, electronic survey was sent to a convenience sample of ED medical directors across Washington State between November and February of 2014-2015. The perceived challenges of and attitudes toward EVD preparations were assessed and reported as stratified proportions. RESULTS Of 85 medical directors contacted, 59 responses (69%) were received. This included EDs with annual patient volumes of 60,000 (12 hospitals, 20%). Among the perceived challenges in EVD preparations were spatial modifications (eg, building an anteroom for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment) and waste management planning. Ninety-five percent of respondents moderately or strongly agreed that it is important to have a predesignated hospital to care for EVD patients. CONCLUSIONS Washington State ED medical directors have faced significant challenges in ensuring their EDs are prepared to safely care for suspected EVD patients. Attitudes toward EVD preparations are mixed. Varying levels of perceived importance may represent an additional barrier to statewide EVD preparedness.

It is clear that the major mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is the airborne route, through inhalation of virus-infested aerosols and droplets. Several respiratory protection equipment (RPE), including masks, face shields/visors, and respirators, are available to obviate facial and conjunctival contamination by microbes. However, as their barrier value against microbial inhalation has not been evaluated, we systematically reviewed the data on the effectiveness and efficacy of facemasks and respirators, including protective eyewear, with particular emphasis on dental healthcare. MATERIAL AND METHODS PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched between 01January 1990 and 15 May 2020. RESULTS Of 310 identified English language records, 21 were included as per eligibility criteria. In clinical terms, wearing layered, face-fitting masks/respirators and protective-eyewear can limit the spread of infection among HCWs. Specifically, combined interventions such as a face mask and a face shield, better resist bioaerosol inhalation than either alone. The prolonged and over-extended use of surgical masks compromise their effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS In general, RPE is effective as a barrier protection against aerosolized microbes in healthcare settings. But their filtration efficacy is compromised by the (i) inhalant particle size, (ii) airflow dynamics, (iii) mask-fit factor, (iv) period of wear, (v) 'wetness' of the masks, and (vi) their fabrication quality. The macro-data presented here should inform policy formulation on RPE wear amongst HCWs.","Samaranayake, Lakshman Perera; Fakhruddin, Kausar Sadia; Ngo, Hien Chi; Chang, Jeffrey Wen Wei; Panduwawala, Chamila",Acta odontologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1080/00016357.2020.1810769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881590/,1

Many patients can be managed with medical treatment combined with supervised exercise alone.

During the past few years an endovascular-first approach has gained support from all vascular specialties. Today, even complex lesions can be treated successfully with an endovascular approach. Unfortunately, the unique bio-mechanical properties of this vascular segment have limited long-term patency rates and clinical value of the endovascular options.

In this study, we investigated the significance of prophylactic drain placement after LDG for gastric cancer. METHODS Seventy-eight consecutive patients with gastric cancer who underwent LDG in our department were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups according to the insertion of a prophylactic intra-abdominal drain following LDG. The 'drain group' comprised 45 patients with routine use of a prophylactic intra-abdominal drain, and the 'no-drain group' comprised 33 patients who did not undergo placement of an intra-abdominal drain. RESULTS There were no significant differences in terms of the mean age of the patients, male/female ratio, body mass index, and concurrent diseases between the drain group and the no-drain group. In addition, there were no significant differences in the tumor location, tumor diameter, depth of the tumor, nodal metastasis, and tumor stage between the two groups. All patients in each group were successfully treated with R0 surgery, and no patient required conversion to open surgery. Surgery-related factors, including lymph node dissection and operative time, were similar in the drain group and the no-drain group. A comparison of the amount of intraoperative blood loss between patients with and without postoperative complications revealed that patients who experienced postoperative complications had a significantly larger amount of blood loss than those without postoperative complications. A comparison of operative times between patients with and without surgery-related postoperative local complications revealed that patients who experienced surgery-related postoperative local complications had a significantly longer operative time than those without surgery-related postoperative local complications. Analysis of operative times in each group revealed that patients with surgery-related postoperative local complications had a significantly longer operative time than those without surgery-related postoperative local complications in the no-drain group. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative factors such as the operative time and the amount of intraoperative blood loss affected the occurrence of postoperative complications following LDG. A prophylactic drain may thus be useful in patients at higher risk and in those with a longer operative time or massive intraoperative bleeding.","Hirahara, Noriyuki; Matsubara, Takeshi; Hayashi, Hikota; Takai, Kiyoe; Fujii, Yusuke; Tajima, Yoshitsugu",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-015-0591-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962503/,1

BACKGROUND To prevent falls during patients' hospitalization, it is essential for them to accurately perceive their risk of falling. DESIGN This methodological study was performed to develop a fall risk perception questionnaire. METHODS After generating a preliminary questionnaire, two rounds of content validity testing were performed with nine experts. Following a pilot test, a convenience sample of 236 participants was recruited from an acute care hospital between May 2, 2018, and December 15, 2019. Construct, convergent, and known-group validity of the questionnaire were evaluated, and reliability was estimated by calculating the internal consistency reliability coefficients. The study adhered to STROBE guidelines. RESULTS Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution with 27 items. The questionnaire showed statistically significant positive correlation with the Korean Falls Efficacy Scale-International and the Morse Fall Scale, thus establishing convergent validity. For known-group comparison, Morse Fall Scale scores were categorized into two groups by cut-off score. The risk for falls group had a significantly higher perceived fall risk than the no risk for falls group, thus establishing known-group validity. Cronbach's alpha values indicated good to excellent reliability for the overall questionnaire with 27 items and for each of the three subfactors. CONCLUSIONS The fall risk perception questionnaire demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity in an acute care hospital setting. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Because understanding patients' perceptions of their fall risk is essential for preventing falls, it is necessary to regularly assess patients' fall risk perception using tools with established reliability and validity.","Choi, Jieun; Choi, Se Min; Lee, Jeong Sin; Seo, Soon Seok; Kim, Ja Yeon; Kim, Hye Young; Kim, Sung Reul",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141494/,1
107348,Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation with multiple electrodes for medium-sized hepatocellular carcinomas.,2012,"Apigenin, a flavonoid, is reported to act as an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist and inhibit aromatase enzyme. However, amentoflavone, a biflavonoid bearing two apigenin molecules, has not been evaluated for its endocrine modulatory effects. Besides, it is highly consumed by young people to build muscles, enhance mood and lose weight. In the present study, apigenin was used as a reference molecule and ER mediated as well as ER-independent estrogenic/antiestrogenic activity of amentoflavone was investigated. Antitumor activity of amentoflavone was also investigated in both ER positive (MCF-7 BUS) and triple-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells and its cytotoxicity was evaluated in human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Our data confirmed ER agonist, aromatase inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of apigenin in breast cancer cells, where no ER mediated estrogenic effect and physiologically irrelevant, slight, aromatase inhibition was found for amentoflavone. Although selective cytotoxicity of amentoflavone was found in MCF-7 BUS cells, it does not seem to be an alternative to the present cytotoxic drugs. Therefore, neither an adverse effect, mediated by an estrogenic/antiestrogenic effect of amentoflavone nor a therapeutical benefit would be expected from amentoflavone. Further studies could be performed to investigate its in vivo effects.","Aliyev, A T; Ozcan-Sezer, S; Akdemir, A; Gurer-Orhan, H",Human & experimental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0960327121999454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33678040/,1

A 73-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for rectosigmoid cancer directly invading the urinary bladder trigone without distant metastasis. We successfully performed complete resection by laparoscopic anterior pelvic exenteration while preserving the anus. After laparoscopic mobilization of the rectum, urinary bladder, and prostate, the urethra and urethral catheter were dissected to reveal the lower rectum. By pulling the urethral catheter toward the head, the prostate was excised retrogradely from the lower rectum anterior wall. The lower rectum was resected and anastomosed by the double stapling technique with a safe distal margin from the tumor.

107759,Isolation of primary human hepatocytes from normal and diseased liver tissue: a one hundred liver experience.,2011,"End-of-life (EOL) care is a key aspect of critical care medicine (CCM) training. The goal of this study was to survey CCM residents and program directors (PDs) across Canada to describe current EOL care education. Using a literature review, we created a self-administered survey encompassing 10 CCM national objectives of training to address: (1) curricular content and evaluation methods, (2) residents' preparedness to meet these objectives, and (3) opportunities for educational improvement. We performed pilot testing and clinical sensibility testing, then distributed it to all residents and PDs across the 13 Canadian CCM programs. Our response rate was 84.3% overall (77 [81.1%] for residents and 13 [100%] for PDs). Residents rated direct observation, informal advice, and self-reflection as both the top 3 most utilized and perceived most effective teaching modalities. Residents most commonly reported comfort with skills related to pain and symptom management (n = 67, 94.3%; score > 3 on 5-point Likert scale), and least commonly reported comfort with donation after cardiac death skills (n = 26-38; 44.8%-65.5%). Base specialty and time in CCM training were independently associated with comfort ratings for some, but not all, EOL skills. With respect to family meetings, residents infrequently received feedback; however, most PDs believed feedback on 6 to 10 meetings is required for competence. When PD perceptions of teaching effectiveness were compared with resident comfort ratings, differences were most apparent for skills related to pain and symptom management, cultural awareness, and ethical principles. By the end of their first subspecialty training year, PDs expect residents to be competent at most, but not all, EOL skills. In summary, trainees and programs rely on clinical activities to develop competency in EOL care, resulting in some educational gaps. Transitioning to competency-based medical education presents an opportunity to address some of these gaps, while other gaps will require more specific curricular intervention.","Arora, Samantha; Shaikh, Sameer; Karachi, Tim; Vanniyasingam, Thuva; Centofanti, John; Piquette, Dominique; Meade, Maureen; Boyle, Anne; Woods, Anne; Downar, James; Cook, Deborah",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620946316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912037/,1
108209,Intermixed Dimethyl-Sulfoxide-Based Nonadhesive Liquid Embolic Agents Delivered Serially via the Same Microcatheter for Cerebral AVM Treatment.,2020-03-12,"BACKGROUND Recruitment manoeuvres generate a transient increase in trans-pulmonary pressure that could open collapsed alveoli. Recruitment manoeuvres might generate very high inspiratory airflows. We evaluated whether recruitment manoeuvres could displace respiratory secretions towards the distal airways and impair gas exchange in a porcine model of bacterial pneumonia. METHODS We conducted a prospective randomised study in 10 mechanically ventilated pigs. Pneumonia was produced by direct intra-bronchial introduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four recruitment manoeuvres were applied randomly: extended sigh (ES), maximal recruitment strategy (MRS), sudden increase in driving pressure and PEEP (SI-PEEP), and sustained inflation (SI). Mucus transport was assessed by fluoroscopic tracking of radiopaque disks before and during each recruitment manoeuvre. The effects of each RM on gas exchange were assessed 15 min after the intervention. RESULTS Before recruitment manoeuvres, mucus always cleared towards the glottis. Conversely, mucus was displaced towards the distal airways in 28.6% ES applications and 50% of all other recruitment manoeuvres (P=0.053). Median mucus velocity was 1.26 mm min-1 [0.48-3.89] before each recruitment manoeuvre, but was reversed (P=0.007) during ES [0.10 mm min-1 [-0.04-1.00]], MRS [0.10 mm min-1 [-0.4-0.48]], SI-PEEP [0.02 mm min-1 [-0.14-0.34]], and SI [0.10 mm min-1 [-0.63-0.75]]. When PaO2 failed to improve after recruitment manoeuvre, mucus was displaced towards the distal airways in 68.7% of the cases, compared with 31.2% recruitment manoeuvres associated with improved PaO2 (odds ratio: 4.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-19.97). CONCLUSIONS Recruitment manoeuvres dislodge mucus distally, irrespective of airflow generated by different recruitment manoeuvres. Further investigation in humans is warranted to corroborate these pre clinical findings, as there may be limited benefits associated with lung recruitment in pneumonia.","Li Bassi, G; Comaru, T; Martí, D; Xiol, E A; Chiurazzi, C; Travierso, C; Carbonara, M; Ranzani, O T; Amaro, R; Frigola, G; Fuster, C; Saco, M A; Zanella, A; De Rosa, F; Rigol, M; Fernandez, L; Luque, N; Ramirez, J; Blasi, F; Suen, J; Fraser, J; Torres, A",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.07.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30686313/,1

Here, we focus on hunger reduction through international trade under alternative trade scenarios for a wide range of climate futures. Under the current level of trade integration, climate change would lead to up to 55 million people who are undernourished in 2050. Without adaptation through trade, the impacts of global climate change would increase to 73 million people who are undernourished (+33%). Reduction in tariffs as well as institutional and infrastructural barriers would decrease the negative impact to 20 million (-64%) people. We assess the adaptation effect of trade and climate-induced specialization patterns. The adaptation effect is strongest for hunger-affected import-dependent regions. However, in hunger-affected export-oriented regions, partial trade integration can lead to increased exports at the expense of domestic food availability. Although trade integration is a key component of adaptation, it needs sensitive implementation to benefit all regions.","Janssens, Charlotte; Havlík, Petr; Krisztin, Tamás; Baker, Justin; Frank, Stefan; Hasegawa, Tomoko; Leclère, David; Ohrel, Sara; Ragnauth, Shaun; Schmid, Erwin; Valin, Hugo; Van Lipzig, Nicole; Maertens, Miet",Nature climate change,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-020-0847-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564324/,1

109239,Proteomics of lung cell biology and pulmonary disease.,2007,"BACKGROUND Our goal was to provide measurements of the posterior cerebral circulation using non-invasive imaging and advanced software analysis tools. METHODS 100 consecutive patients aged ≥ 40 years (50 men and 50 women) who had undergone CT angiography (CTA) but had no vascular abnormality were analyzed. Specific software was used to make vessel measurements along the center line. The length of the intracranial vertebral artery (VA), the basilar artery (BA) and the distance from the mid-basilar artery to the posterior cerebral artery (mBA-PCA) was recorded. Vessel diameter was measured at the proximal and distal ends of these vessel lengths. Vessel taper was calculated as the change in diameter in millimeters per centimeter of length. RESULTS The mean lengths of the intracranial VA, the BA and the mBA-PCA were 40 ± 10.6 mm, 27.3 ± 5.7 mm and 25.6 ± 4.3 mm, respectively. The proximal and distal diameters were 3.9 ± 0.8 mm and 2.8 ± 0.6 mm for the VA and 3.6 ± 0.6 mm and 3.1 ± 0.5 mm for the BA, respectively. The mean mid-BA diameter and the proximal PCA diameter were 3.2 ± 0.5 mm and 2.2 ± 0.4 mm, respectively. There was a significant increase in arterial caliber in patients aged ≥ 60 years compared with those aged 40-59 years. Men also tended to have longer vessels with a larger diameter than women. CONCLUSIONS Advanced software and non-invasive imaging can be used to perform accurate vessel analysis. The posterior circulation measurements showed an increase in arterial caliber with age. This baseline information may be useful in planning neurovascular procedures and endovascular device development.","Rai, Ansaar T; Rodgers, Daniel; Williams, Eric A; Hogg, Jeffery P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178224/,1
110098,Pharmacotherapy for lower respiratory tract infections.,2014,"Community health workers (CHWs) are increasingly involved as members of health intervention research teams. Given that CHWs are engaged in a variety of research roles, there is a need for better understanding of the ways in which CHWs are incorporated in research and the potential benefits. This scoping review synthesizes evidence regarding the kinds of health research studies involving CHWs, CHWs' roles in implementing health intervention research, their positionality on research teams, and how their involvement benefits health intervention research. The scoping review includes peer-reviewed health intervention articles published between 2008-2018 in the U.S. A search of PubMed, Embase and CINAHL identified a total of 3,129 titles and abstracts, 266 of which met the inclusion criteria and underwent full text review. A total of 130 articles were identified for a primary analysis of the research and the level of CHWs involvement, and of these 23 articles were included in a secondary analysis in which CHWs participated in 5 or more intervention research phases. The scoping review found that CHWs are involved across the spectrum of research, including developing research questions, intervention design, participant recruitment, intervention implementation, data collection, data analysis, and results dissemination. CHW positionality as research partners varied greatly across studies, and they are not uniformly integrated within all stages of research. The majority of these studies employed a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and CBPR studies included CHWs as research partners in more phases of research relative to non-CBPR studies. This scoping review documents specific benefits from the inclusion of CHWs as partners in health intervention research and identifies strategies to engage CHWs as research partners and to ensure that CHW contributions to research are well-documented.","Coulter, Kiera; Ingram, Maia; McClelland, Deborah Jean; Lohr, Abby",Frontiers in public health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612967/,1
110330,"Parent artery occlusion in large, giant, or fusiform aneurysms of the carotid siphon: clinical and imaging results.",2015,"BACKGROUND Severe critical illness-induced immune suppression, termed immunoparalysis, is associated with longer duration of organ dysfunction in septic children. mRNA studies have suggested differential benefit of hydrocortisone in septic children based on their immune phenotype, but this has not been shown using a functional readout of the immune response. This study represents a secondary analysis of a prospectively conducted immunophenotyping study of pediatric severe sepsis to test the hypothesis that hydrocortisone will be differentially associated with clinical outcomes in children with or without immunoparalysis. METHODS Children with severe sepsis/septic shock underwent blood sampling within 48 h of sepsis onset. Immune function was measured by quantifying whole blood ex vivo LPS-induced TNFα production capacity, with a TNFα response < 200 pg/ml being diagnostic of immunoparalysis. The primary outcome measure was number of days in 14 with MODS. Univariate and multivariable negative binomial regression models were used to examine associations between hydrocortisone use, immune function, and duration of MODS. RESULTS One hundred two children were enrolled (age 75 [6-160] months, 60% male). Thirty-one subjects received hydrocortisone and were more likely to be older (106 [52-184] vs 38 [3-153] months, p = 0.04), to have baseline immunocompromise (32 vs 8%, p = 0.006), to have higher PRISM III (13 [8-18] vs 7 [5-13], p = 0.0003) and vasoactive inotrope scores (20 [10-35] vs 10 [3-15], p = 0.0002) scores, and to have more MODS days (3 [1-9] vs 1 [0-3], p = 0.002). Thirty-three subjects had immunoparalysis (TNFα response 78 [52-141] vs 641 [418-1047] pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Hydrocortisone use was associated with longer duration of MODS in children with immunoparalysis after adjusting for covariables (aRR 3.7 [1.8-7.9], p = 0.0006) whereas no association with MODS duration was seen in children without immunoparalysis (aRR 1.2 [0.6-2.3], p = 0.67). CONCLUSION Hydrocortisone use was independently associated with longer duration of MODS in septic children with immunoparalysis but not in those with more robust immune function. Prospective clinical trials using a priori immunophenotyping are needed to understand optimal hydrocortisone strategies in this population.","Bline, Katherine E; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Hensley, Josey; Steele, Lisa; Greathouse, Kristin; Anglim, Larissa; Hanson-Huber, Lisa; Nateri, Jyotsna; Muszynski, Jennifer A; Ramilo, Octavio; Hall, Mark W",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03266-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887651/,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this modality in a meta-analysis of the published literature. METHODS A comprehensive review protocol screened all reports in the literature. Strict selection criteria were applied to ensure consistency among the selected studies: human subjects, complete response data with time interval, resin microspheres, more than 5 patients, not a duplicate cohort, English language, and separate and complete data for resin-based (90)Y treatment of mNET if the study included multiple tumor and microsphere types. Selected studies were critically appraised on 50 study criteria, in accordance with the research reporting standards for radioembolization. Response data (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) were extracted and analyzed using both fixed and random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS One hundred fifty-six studies were screened; 12 were selected, totaling 435 procedures for response assessment. Funnel plots showed no evidence of publication bias (P = 0.841). Critical appraisal revealed a median of 75% of desired criteria included in selected studies. Very high between-study heterogeneity ruled out a fixed-effects model. The random-effects weighted average objective response rate (complete and partial responses, CR and PR, respectively) was 50% (95% confidence interval, 38%-62%), and weighted average disease control rate (CR, PR, and stable disease) was 86% (95% confidence interval, 78%-92%). The percentage of patients with pancreatic mNET was marginally associated with poorer response (P = 0.030), accounting for approximately 23% of the heterogeneity among studies. The percentage of CR and PR correlated with median survival (R = 0.85; P = 0.008). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis confirms radioembolization to be an effective treatment option for patients with hepatic mNET.

The overuse and the improper use of antibiotics in human medicine, food production, and the environment as a whole have unfortunately contributed to this issue. Many major international scientific, political, and social organizations have warned that the increase in AMR could cost the lives of millions of people if it is not addressed on a global scale. Although AMR is already a challenge in clinical practice today, it has taken on a new importance in the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While improved handwashing techniques, social distancing, and other interventional measures may positively influence AMR, the widespread use of antibiotics to treat or prevent bacterial coinfections, especially in unconfirmed cases of COVID-19, may have unintended negative implications with respect to AMR. Although the exact number of bacterial coinfections and the rate at which patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotic therapy remain to be accurately determined, the pandemic has revived the discussion on antibiotic overuse and AMR. This article describes why the COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of AMR and presents the immense global impact of AMR on society as a whole. Furthermore, an attempt is made to stress the importance of tackling AMR in the future and the role of the orthopaedic community in this worldwide effort.","Metsemakers, Willem-Jan; Zalavras, Charalampos; Schwarz, Edward M; Chen, Antonia F; Trampuz, Andrej; Moriarty, T Fintan",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the incision used for specimen extraction on the incidence of incisional hernia after laparoscopic colectomy. METHODS Patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy without stoma at a single university tertiary-care centre from 2003 to 2009 were identified from an operating room database. Patients were contacted by telephone for participation, and underwent physical examination ± ultrasonography for incisional hernia at the specimen extraction site and completed the Body Image Questionnaire. Specimen extraction incisions were classified into midline, transverse and Pfannenstiel groups. RESULTS Out of a total of 251 patients, 99 patients agreed to participate (68 midline, 7 transverse, 24 Pfannenstiel), while 73 patients refused consent and 79 patients could not be contacted. Patients who refused consent were older (69.8 vs 62.4 years, p = 0.001) but otherwise were similar to participants with respect to gender, malignant disease, postoperative complications and extraction site. Mean length of follow-up was 37.0 months. The overall incidence of incisional hernia was 21% (21/99), being 29 % (20/68) after midline incision compared with 14 % (1/7) after transverse and 0 % (0/24) after Pfannenstiel incisions (p = 0.002). Of patients with incisional hernia, 47 % (10/21) were symptomatic. Patients with incisional hernia had lower cosmetic score (14.4 vs 17.7, p = 0.02) compared with those without, but there was no difference in body image score. There were no differences in body image or cosmesis between the three incisions. CONCLUSIONS There is a high incidence of symptomatic incisional hernia after midline specimen extraction in laparoscopic colectomy, which negatively impacts cosmesis. The risk of hernia may be lower with the use of a transverse or Pfannenstiel incision for specimen extraction.","Lee, Lawrence; Mappin-Kasirer, Benjamin; Sender Liberman, Alexander; Stein, Barry; Charlebois, Patrick; Vassiliou, Melina; Fried, Gerald M; Feldman, Liane S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2311-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22580878/,1

METHODOLOGY Only patients who received chemotherapy and immunotherapy were selected and enrolled in the study. All patients (n=3,204) were divided into three groups, namely the first group (1st December 2017-31st May 2018, n=918), second group (1st December 2018-31st May 2019, n=1,147), and the pandemic period group (PPG) (1st December 2019-31st May 2020, n=1,139), according to the period during which they received anticancer treatment. The clinical and demographic characteristics and mortality rates of these three groups of patients were compared. RESULTS The median age of the total of 3,204 patients was 61 (53-69). In this study, 51.1% (n=1,636) were females and 48.9% were males. The mortality rates were 13.5% (n=124) in the first group, 13.4% (n=154) in the second group, and 13.0% (n=148) in the PPG, respectively. Overall mortality rates did not differ among patients with cancer in the three different six-month periods analysed (p = 0.931).

No increase in monthly mortality rates among patients receiving anti-cancer treatment were demonstrated during the pandemic period.","Demirci, Ayşe; Bilir, Cemil; Cakir, Emre; Gulbagci, Burcu; Hacibekiroglu, Ilhan; Varim, Ceyhun",Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,https://doi.org/10.29271/jcpsp.2021.01.s66; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650412/,1
111606,The effect of intracranial stent implantation on the curvature of the cerebrovasculature.,2012,"Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) were created in 1977 to address the high health care needs, limited provider access, and poor health outcomes of rural Americans. Although innovative at their inception, the provider-centric model of RHC cost-based reimbursement structures has not evolved, leaving limited opportunities for change; many have failed. Comprehensive, proactive change is needed. Registered nurses (RNs) working at the top of their practice scope are a neglected clinical resource that can improve access, quality, value, and satisfaction for rural patient communities. RHC reimbursement policy must evolve to sustain and support this significant RN role. RNs have demonstrated value in care continuity and disease management, but there is little research on the utilization of RNs using their enhanced skill set in RHCs. Using the Bardach and Patashnik's eight steps of policy analysis, the authors will describe the background and regulations of RHCs, identify current barriers to improving the health of America's rural residents, and then provide evidence to support a new policy option according to the Quadruple Aim framework. The result is a sustainable policy recommendation designed to best serve rural communities.","Switzer, Tina; Sawin, Erika Metzler; Eaton, Melody; Switzer, David; Lam, Christina; Robinson, Jamie; Elkins, Deborah","Policy, politics & nursing practice",https://doi.org/10.1177/15271544211011989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906510/,1

112030,Computational hemodynamics analysis of intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diverters: correlation with clinical outcomes.,2014,"The recent pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2, the last isolated human beta-coronavirus, has revolutionized modern knowledge of the pathogenesis of viral pneumonia. The lack of specific antiviral drugs and the need to develop adequate research for new antiviral drugs capable of treating this new form of the disease undertook three different research paths quickly. The first one is aimed to test antiviral molecules already present in therapeutic use, with a mechanism of an action directed towards viral proteins functional to replication or adsorption; the second one, it is the repositioning of molecules with known pharmacological activity for which various chemistry studies have been prepared in an attempt to find new and specific viral targets; the third, it is the search for molecules of natural origin for which to demonstrate a specific anti-coronavirus activity. Many databases of natural and synthetic substances have been used for the identification of potent inhibitors of various viral targets. The field of computer-aided drug design seems to be promising and useful for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors; hence, different structure- and ligand-based computational approaches have been used for their identification. This review analyzes in-depth and critically the most recent publications in the field of applied computational chemistry to find out molecules of natural origin with potent antiviral activity. Furthermore, a critical and functional selection of some molecules with the best hypothetical anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is made for further studies by biological tests.","Gentile, Davide; Patamia, Vincenzo; Fuochi, Virginia; Furneri, Pio M; Rescifina, Antonio",Current medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867328666210614114032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34126880/,1

112175,Treatment of poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage trial.,2015,"BACKGROUND There are many protocol variations in the whole-body 75SeHCAT retention test [whole-body retention (WBR)] for investigation of bile acid diarrhoea. The time between capsule consumption and first count, however, is widely taken, without debate, to be 3 h. In the Covid-19 era, it is desirable to limit the time patients spend in the department. We, therefore, questioned the need for a 3 h interval between capsule administration and the initial count. METHODS Using an uncollimated gamma camera, whole-body counting was performed at 5, 30 and 180 min after capsule ingestion in 24 patients with chronic diarrhoea. Geometric mean was taken of counts acquired from posterior and anterior projections. WBR was expressed as the ratio of 7 day-to-initial whole-body counts (%) to give WBR5, WBR30 and WBR180. A small meal was given at 60 min after capsule ingestion. RESULTS There was a close correlation between WBR30 and WBR180 (y = 1.0x - 0.29%; r = 0.99). For WBR180 values of <15% (lower limit of normal), there was close agreement between WBR30 and WBR180 (bias 0.03%; precision 0.7%). WBR5 overestimated WBR180. However, cWBR5, obtained by multiplication of WBR5 by 0.75, also correlated closely with WBR180 (y = 1.2x - 4.5%; r = 0.97), and there was close agreement between cWBR5 and WBR180 for WBR180 values <15% (bias 0.08%, precision 1.3%). CONCLUSION The first whole-body count in the 75SeHCAT test can be undertaken at 30 min postcapsule without loss of accuracy, or even 5 min if only subnormal values are considered relevant. No food is required after capsule consumption.","Soares, Sara; Heraghty, Neil; Gulliver, Nick; Peters, Adrien Michael",Nuclear medicine communications,https://doi.org/10.1097/mnm.0000000000001452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34100797/,1
112489,Prognostic significance of cachexia in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with pembrolizumab.,2021-06-27,"INTRODUCTION Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most important metabolic emergency in children. Children mimic many syndromes with a combination of nonspecific symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many syndromes are triggered by changes in children's body conditions. Reporting specific cases can improve the diagnosis process. The present study reports an 18-month-old paediatric case of COVID-19 who presented ketoacidosis (DKA) symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION The case is an 18-month-old child with fever and diarrhoea from 3 days before, who did not respond to outpatient treatment. On the day of the visit, he suffered from deep and abdominal breathing and decreased level of consciousness and sugar levels at admission of 420 mg/dl. He was then admitted with the initial diagnosis of DKA and had a positive PCR test result for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Considering the non-specific symptoms of COVID-19, general practitioners and paediatricians are recommended that special attention be paid to these symptoms, especially those that are similar to life-threatening syndromes. They also should not easily ignore these symptoms and follow up patients and their recovery status and, if patients do not recover, consider the risk of COVID-19 given the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Akbarizadeh, Majidreza; Naderifar, Mahin; Ghanizadegan, Parisa; Akbarizadeh, Mahshid","Pediatric endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism",https://doi.org/10.5114/pedm.2021.105299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008395/,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirty consecutive patients with inguinal hernias (including 20% with bilateral inguinal hernias) underwent a transumbilical, single-port, TEP laparoscopic hernia (LH) repair using a homemade port composed of a segment of corrugated anesthesia tube and a pair of surgical gloves. All operation procedures were done using conventional laparoscopic instruments with manually angled shafts in the same manner as standard multiple-port surgeries, but using the reverse hand technique. RESULTS All the procedures were completed uneventfully and did not require additional ports. Operation times averaged 98.3 ± 26.7 minutes for the unilateral LH and 121.4 ± 13.5 minutes for the bilateral LH. There were no perioperative complications except for 2 patients (7%) who developed wound seromas, which resolved after conservative treatment. No hernia recurred during the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION A transumbilical, single-port, TEP laparoscopic hernioplasty using a homemade port and a conventional instrument permitted nearly scarless surgery for the treatment of inguinal hernias. Further studies are necessary before this approach can be recommended as a standard procedure.","Shih, Tune-Yie; Wen, Kuo-Chang; Lin, Kai-Yuan; Uen, Yih-Huei",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

112938,Immunity-Boosting Spices and the Novel Coronavirus.,2020-05-26,"Recent work has shown that the carotid chemoreceptor (CC) contributes to sympathetic control of cardiovascular function during exercise, despite no evidence of increased circulating CC stimuli, suggesting enhanced CC activity/sensitivity. As interactions between metaboreceptors and chemoreceptors have been previously observed, the purpose of this study was to isolate the metaboreflex while acutely stimulating or inhibiting the CC to determine whether the metaboreflex increased CC activity/sensitivity. Fourteen young healthy men (height: 177.0 ± 2.1 cm, weight: 85.8 ± 5.5 kg, age: 24.6 ± 1.1 yr) performed three trials of 40% maximal voluntary contraction handgrip for 2 min, followed by 3 min of postexercise circulatory occlusion (PECO) to stimulate the metaboreflex. In random order, subjects either breathed room air, hypoxia (target SPo2 = 85%), or hyperoxia (FiO2 = 1.0) during the PECO to modulate the chemoreflex. After these trials, a resting hypoxia trial was conducted without handgrip or PECO. Ventilation (Ve), heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and muscle sympathetic nervous activity (MSNA) data were continuously obtained. Relative to normoxic PECO, inhibition of the CC during hyperoxic PECO resulted in lower MSNA (P = 0.038) and HR (P = 0.021). Relative to normoxic PECO, stimulation of the CC during hypoxic PECO resulted in higher HR (P < 0.001) and Ve (P < 0.001). The ventilatory and MSNA responses to hypoxic PECO were not greater than the sum of the responses to hypoxia and PECO individually, indicating that the CC are not sensitized during metaboreflex activation. These results demonstrate that stimulation of the metaboreflex activates, but does not sensitize the CC, and help explain the enhanced CC activity with exercise.","Edgell, H; Stickland, M K","American journal of physiology.

While pediatric intussusception is common and generally idiopathic, adult intussusception is exceedingly rare and is usually attributable to a pathologic lead point. PRESENTATION OF CASE 37-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain, and was preoperatively diagnosed with a colo-colonic intussusception. Intraoperatively, the lead point was found to be congenital bands, and there was no evidence of underlying malignancy. He underwent a laparoscopic-assisted extended right hemicolectomy with side-to-side ileo-colic anastomosis. DISCUSSION Colo-colonic intussusception is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction in adults. Patients generally present with subacute abdominal pain and obstructive symptoms, rendering the clinical diagnosis challenging. Computed tomography has been shown to be the most accurate diagnostic imaging modality. Due to the high incidence of underlying malignancy in adult colo-colonic intussusception, en-bloc resection of the involved bowel segment remains the standard of care. CONCLUSION Congenital bands can serve as a lead point in colo-colonic intussusception, particularly in younger adults. Prompt surgical intervention remains paramount to limit morbidity.","Wang, Yifan; Gowing, Stephen; Arena, Goffredo",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2016.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475114/,1
113234,Pathophysiologic mechanisms of cerebral endotheliopathy and stroke due to Sars-CoV-2.,2021-02-02,"OBJECTIVE To describe the recommendations of the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference for mechanical ventilation management of pediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN Consensus Conference of experts in pediatric acute lung injury. METHODS The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference experts developed and voted on a total of 27 recommendations focused on the optimal mechanical ventilation approach of the patient with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Topics included ventilator mode, tidal volume delivery, inspiratory plateau pressure, high-frequency ventilation, cuffed endotracheal tubes, and gas exchange goals. When experimental data were lacking, a modified Delphi approach emphasizing the strong professional agreement was used. RESULTS There were 17 recommendations with strong agreement and 10 recommendations with weak agreement. There were no recommendations with equipoise or disagreement. There was weak agreement on recommendations concerning approach to tidal volume and inspiratory pressure limitation (88% to 72% agreement, respectively), whereas strong agreement could be achieved for accepting permissive hypercapnia. Using positive end-expiratory pressure levels greater than 15 cm H2O in severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, under the condition that the markers of oxygen delivery, respiratory system compliance, and hemodynamics are closely monitored as positive end-expiratory pressure is increased, is strongly recommended. The concept of exploring the effects of careful recruitment maneuvers during conventional ventilation met an agreement level of 88%, whereas the use of recruitment maneuvers during rescue high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is highly recommended (strong agreement). CONCLUSIONS The Consensus Conference developed pediatric-specific recommendations regarding mechanical ventilation of the patient with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as future research priorities. These recommendations are intended to initiate discussion regarding optimal mechanical ventilation management for children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and identify areas of controversy requiring further investigation.","Rimensberger, Peter C; Cheifetz, Ira M",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26035364/,1

The dearth of evidence supporting the safety of laparoscopy for these patients led to a comparison of outcomes between LC and open colectomy (OC) for patients with American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classifications 3 and 4. METHODS Data for all ASA 3 and 4 patients who underwent elective LC were reviewed from a prospectively maintained laparoscopic database. The patients who underwent LC were matched with OC patients by age, gender, diagnosis, year, and type of surgery. Estimated blood loss, operation time, time to return of bowel function, length of hospital stay, readmission rate, and 30-day complication and mortality rates were compared using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon tests as appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In this study, 231 LCs were matched with 231 OCs. The median age of the patients was 68 years, and 234 (51%) of the patients were male. There were 44 (19%) conversions from LC to OC. More patients in the OC group had undergone previous major laparotomy (5 vs. 15%; p < 0.001). Estimated blood loss, return of bowel function, length of hospital stay, and total direct costs were decreased in the LC group. Wound infection was significantly greater with OC (p = 0.02). When patients with previous major laparotomy were excluded, the two groups had similar overall morbidity. The other benefits of LC, however, persisted. CONCLUSION The findings show that LC is a safe option for patients with a high ASA classification. The LC approach is associated with faster postoperative recovery, lower morbidity rates, and lower hospital costs than the OC approach.","da Luz Moreira, Andre; Kiran, Ravi P; Kirat, Hasan T; Remzi, Feza H; Geisler, Daniel P; Church, James M; Garofalo, Thomas; Fazio, Victor W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0761-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20033728/,1

The aim of this study is to evaluate the operative and postoperative results of hybrid right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal robotic-assisted anastomosis for adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon compared with the standard extracorporeal anastomosis in a case control study. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-eight right hemicolectomies for cancer (2009-2012) with laparoscopic medial to lateral dissection, vascular ligation, bowel transection, and robotic-assisted intracorporeal anastomosis with specimen extraction through a Pfannestiel incision (robotic group [RG]) were compared with 48 laparoscopic hemicolectomies (2009-2011) with extracorporeal anastomosis (laparoscopic group [LG]). RESULTS The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, stage of cancer, and body mass index. Surgery time was significantly longer in RG patients (RG, 266±41 minutes; LG, 223±51 minutes; P<.05). Operative results were similar in the two groups. Recovery of bowel function (day of first bowel movement: RG, 3.0±1.0 days; LG, 4.0±1.2 days; P<.05) and hospital stay (RG, 7.5±2.0 days; LG, 9.0±3.2 days; P<.05) were quicker and shorter, respectively, in RG. There were four anastomotic complications and four incisional hernias in LG and none in RG (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS There are fewer anastomotic and wound complications in RG patients. Intracorporeal robotic-assisted ileocolic anastomosis allows a faster recovery compared with extracorporeal anastomosis.","Morpurgo, Emilio; Contardo, Tania; Molaro, Roberta; Zerbinati, Antonio; Orsini, Camillo; D'Annibale, Annibale",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Patients received remifentanil target-controlled infusion using the Minto model during total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol. From 56 patients, 275 arterial blood samples were drawn before, during and after bypass to determine the plasma concentration of remifentanil, and the predicted concentrations were recorded at each time. For pooled data, the median prediction error and median absolute prediction error were 21.3% and 21.8%, respectively, and 22.1% and 22.3% during bypass. Both were 148.4% during hypothermic circulatory arrest and measured concentrations were more than three times greater than predicted (26.9 (17.0) vs. 7.1 (1.6) ng.ml-1 ). The Minto model showed considerable bias but overall acceptable precision during bypass. The target concentration of remifentanil should be reduced when using the Minto model during hypothermic circulatory arrest.","Cho, Y J; Jo, W Y; Oh, H; Koo, C-H; Oh, J; Cho, J-Y; Yu, K-S; Jeon, Y; Kim, T K",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.14019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891056/,1

This makes relationships with caregivers particularly important to quality of life. Without intervention, social interactions may be limited and ineffective, affecting relationships with caregivers and thus quality of life for individuals with DD. Training may improve interactions between caregivers and individuals with DD. Training content and methods, however, are heterogenous. A review was conducted to identify common elements and methods and analyze variables shown to be most effective in improving outcomes for caregivers and individuals with DD. In general, studies of professional caregiver training (e.g. teachers, staff members) focused primarily on increasing positive interactions or praise, while parent training studies focused more broadly on parenting skills, of which positive interaction was one facet. Training methods differed, but there was some evidence to suggest that those studies that included some element of in situ practice and feedback yielded more robust effects. While caregiver acceptability and/or satisfaction surveys were administered in the majority of studies, fewer studies attempted to measure the satisfaction of individuals with DD.

114115,Stent-Assisted Coil Embolization of Intracranial Aneurysms: Complications in Acutely Ruptured versus Unruptured Aneurysms.,2016,"Introduction Emergency medicine (EM) physicians must recognize emergent cutaneous disorders (CDs) in patients of all skin tones. In other medical specialties, images of CDs in light-skinned individuals (LSI) are published more frequently than images of CDs in dark-skinned individuals (DSI). This study aims to determine the representation of LSI versus DSI in images of emergent CDs published in top EM journals. Methods This is a cross-sectional analysis of CD images published from 2015 to 2020 in the six most influential EM journals as determined by Eigenfactor. The 2016 Model of the Clinical Practice of Emergency Medicine (EM Model) by the American Board of Emergency Medicine was used to classify CDs as ""emergent,"" ""nonemergent,"" or ""not listed."" The Fitzpatrick skin tone scale was used to classify skin tone as light, dark, or indeterminate. Two blinded reviewers classified each image; for disagreements, a third blinded reviewer determined the final classification. Descriptive statistics and chi-square were used to analyze the data. A kappa coefficient was used to determine reviewer agreement (LSI vs. DSI), and a weighted kappa coefficient was used for agreement between individual Fitzpatrick categories. Results There were 314 images of CDs. Forty images were indeterminate, and one image was excluded, leaving 273. Of the 273 images analyzed, 44.0% were emergent, 8.0% were nonemergent, and 48.0% were not listed in the EM Model. DSI comprised 13.6% of images. For emergent CDs, 85.0% were LSI versus 15.0% DSI. For nonemergent CDs, 27.3% were DSI, and for CDs not listed in the EM Model, 9.9% were DSI. The kappa coefficient for reviewer agreement between LSI and DSI was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65 to 0.87) and the weighted kappa coefficient for agreement between Fitzpatrick categories was 0.70 (95% CI = 0.64 to 0.76), showing substantial agreement. Conclusion For emergent and nonemergent CDs, images of LSI were published more than those of DSI in top EM journals.","Bell, Geovonni; Holmes, Sherita; Gillespie, Scott; Wood, Anna; Murray, Brittany L",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616977/,1

114491,Safety and efficacy of an open-cell stent and double-balloon protection for unstable plaques: analysis of 184 consecutive carotid artery stentings.,2019-11-12,"BACKGROUND Enabling people with dementia to 'live well' is a policy and research priority in many countries. However, instruments for measuring outcomes of psychosocial interventions designed to promote well-being in dementia are often derived from a symptom-focused, loss/deficit approach, or from broad quality of life concepts. A pan-European dementia working group called for research on the development of an alternative asset/strengths-based conceptual framework of well-being in dementia. This paper takes forward this recommendation by developing such a framework and using this to map relevant self-report outcome measures. METHODS Three scoping reviews of published studies were conducted iteratively. First, we examined the literature on lived experiences of well-being and quality of life in people with dementia and then the wider dementia literature for application of well-being constructs. The synthesised findings generated conceptual domains of well-being in people with dementia. Corresponding self-report instruments used in dementia research were scoped, categorised within the conceptual framework and their potential value in measuring outcomes for people with dementia was examined. FINDINGS Six conceptual domains for the measurement of well-being and 35 self-report instruments that have been used with people with dementia were identified. Six instruments were developed specifically for people with dementia, five were derived from the gerontological literature and 24 from the well-being literature. Fifteen instruments and one sub-scale have been examined for psychometric properties amongst people with dementia. To date, 20 have been used as outcome measures, with seven measuring change over time. A number of identified instruments utilise traditional retrospective Likert-scaling response formats, limiting their potential for use with some groups of people with dementia. CONCLUSION An assets/strengths-based framework is presented, outlining structural domains for selecting self-report measures of well-being in people with dementia.

METHODS Searches (from 2012) in July 2018 included databases, trials registers, reference lists, and contact with experts. Co-primary outcomes were dependence and disability. Dichotomous data were synthesized using risk ratios (RR) and continuous data using standardized mean differences (SMD). Quality was appraised using Cochrane risk of bias methods. Sensitivity analyses explored influence of study quality. RESULTS The searches identified 3414 references of which 499 full texts were assessed for eligibility. Six new completed RCTs (n = 3710) were eligible, and were added to the seven trials identified in a 2012 Cochrane review (total: 13 trials, n = 4145). There was no difference in the proportion independent (3 trials, n = 3249, 36.6% fluoxetine vs. 36.7% control; RR 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.09, p = 0.99, I2 = 78%) nor in disability (7 trials n = 3404, SMD 0.05, -0.02 to 0.12 p = 0.15, I2 = 81%) at end of treatment. Fluoxetine was associated with better neurological scores and less depression. Among the four (n = 3283) high-quality RCTs, the only difference between groups was lower depression scores with fluoxetine. CONCLUSION This class I evidence demonstrates that fluoxetine does not reduce disability and dependency after stroke but improves depression.","Mead, Gillian E; Legg, Lynn; Tilney, Russel; Hsieh, Cheng Fang; Wu, Simiao; Lundström, Erik; Rudberg, Ann Sofie; Kutlubaev, Mansur; Dennis, Martin S; Soleimani, Babak; Barugh, Amanda; Hackett, Maree L; Hankey, Graeme J",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493019879655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619137/,1

Here, we provide a critical view on selected surface markers, transcriptional and translational pathways commonly used to identify MDSC by specific, their developmental origin and new possibilities by transcriptional or proteomic profiling. Discrimination of MDSC from their non-suppressive counterparts is a prerequisite for the development of successful therapies. Understanding the switch mechanisms that direct granulocytic and monocytic development into a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory direction will be crucial for therapeutic strategies. Manipulation of these myeloid checkpoints are exploited by tumors and pathogens, such as M. tuberculosis (Mtb), HIV or SARS-CoV-2, that induce MDSC for immune evasion. Thus, specific markers for MDSC identification may reveal also novel molecular candidates for therapeutic intervention at the level of MDSC.","Lutz, Manfred B; Eckert, Ina N",Cellular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2021.104347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838447/,1

Accessibility to an evidence-based treatment program is a cornerstone to support patients with BPD and part of broader suicide prevention efforts as well as improving their quality of life. AIMS In this article, the authors aim to discuss and review available dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and DBT-informed services of selected countries in the Asia-Pacific Rim, namely Singapore, Malaysia, and Mexico. MATERIALS & METHODS We contacted providers of different services and gathered information on the process of setting up the service and adapting the treatment, in addition to reviewing the available literature published in the countries. RESULTS To date, there have been a pair of DBT-informed services in Singapore, four in Malaysia, and several in Mexico with a few of them offering standard DBT. Different efforts have been put in place to increase the accessibility to training and also the number of DBT practitioners. DISCUSSION Important considerations during the process of setting up new services include the use of domestic examples and local language that are contextually appropriate for the local community. Selected challenges faced in common include shortage of workforce, affordability of training programs, and the need for language adaptation with or without translation. CONCLUSION Further long-term evaluation of locally adapted DBT-informed mental health services will help to elucidate the effectiveness and efficacy of the program which will potentially serve as a guide for other resource-scarce regions.","Loo, Jiann Lin; Keng, Shian-Ling; Ramírez-Espinosa, Iizax Gisela; Nor Hadi, Noor Melissa; Ramírez-Gutiérrez, José Angel; Shoesmith, Wendy",Asia-Pacific psychiatry : official journal of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33188568/,1
115740,Improving outcomes for lung disease in Africa.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND For a long time, DC conductance has been the most important parameter in electrodermal routine measurements. However, DC current flow polarizes the electrodes, electrolyzes the skin, disturbs the measurement of conductance by possible varying electromotive forces (EMFs) in the circuit, and impedes the registration of the skin endosomatic DC potential. METHODS We therefore present a measuring system where DC current was replaced by a small AC current in a monopolar system, enabling the DC potential and AC conductance to be measured simultaneously at the same skin site. RESULTS We have also found examples of skin potential (SP) response waveforms with diphasic sharp edges not appearing in the conductance waveforms. The potential responses were found to be more robust with respect to movement artifacts, and the instrumentation could discern whether the indifferent electrode actually was on an inactive skin site. CONCLUSION In order to study the generating mechanisms of EDA in detail, the SP must be measured without DC current flow and compared with AC conductance results.","Grimnes, Sverre; Jabbari, Azar; Martinsen, Ørjan G; Tronstad, Christian",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0846.2010.00459.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20923453/,1

Even at 5% HPC level, the tablet tensile strength achieved up to 3.5 MPa. A minimum of 10% HPC was required for the process robustness. However, 20% HPC led to tabletability loss, attributable to the high mechanical strength of APAP granules. The over-granulated APAP granules had thick connected HPC scaffold and low porosity. Consequently, these granules were so strong that they underwent a lower degree of fracture under compression and higher elastic recovery during decompression. HPC was enriched on the surface of APAP extrudates at all HPC levels. Amorphous APAP was also observed on the extrudate surface at 20% HPC level, and it recrystallized within 24 h storage. To achieve a robust process and optimal improvement in APAP tabletability, the preferred HPC level was 10 to 15%.","Liu, Tongzhou; Paul, Shubhajit; Beeson, Brian T; Alexander, Johnny; Yang, Fengyuan; Bi, Vivian; Durig, Thomas; Sun, Changquan Calvin; Zhang, Feng",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01785-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839891/,1

METHODS Patients with gastric cancer who underwent total gastrectomy with curative intent in three Korean tertiary hospitals between January 2003 and December 2010 were included in this multicentre, retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the association between operation method and survival. RESULTS A total of 753 patients with early gastric cancer were included in the study. There were no significant differences in the matched cohort for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) for laparoscopy-assisted versus open total gastrectomy 0.96, 95 per cent c.i. 0.57 to 1.65) or recurrence-free survival (HR 2.20, 0.51 to 9.52). The patterns of recurrence were no different between the two groups. The severity of complications, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, was similar in both groups. The most common complications were anastomosis-related in the laparoscopy-assisted group (8.0 per cent versus 4.2 per cent in the open group; P = 0.015) and wound-related in the open group (1.6 versus 5.6 per cent respectively; P = 0.003). Postoperative death was more common in the laparoscopy-assisted group (1.6 versus 0.2 per cent; P = 0.045). CONCLUSION Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for early gastric cancer is feasible in terms of long-term results, including survival and recurrence. However, a higher postoperative mortality rate and an increased risk of anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic-assisted total gastrectomy are of concern.","Lee, J H; Nam, B-H; Ryu, K W; Ryu, S Y; Park, Y K; Kim, S; Kim, Y W",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26398912/,1

Despite two randomized trials that did not show a benefit of renal-artery stenting with respect to kidney function, the usefulness of stenting for the prevention of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events is uncertain. METHODS We randomly assigned 947 participants who had atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and either systolic hypertension while taking two or more antihypertensive drugs or chronic kidney disease to medical therapy plus renal-artery stenting or medical therapy alone. Participants were followed for the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular and renal events (a composite end point of death from cardiovascular or renal causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency, or the need for renal-replacement therapy). RESULTS Over a median follow-up period of 43 months (interquartile range, 31 to 55), the rate of the primary composite end point did not differ significantly between participants who underwent stenting in addition to receiving medical therapy and those who received medical therapy alone (35.1% and 35.8%, respectively; hazard ratio with stenting, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.17; P=0.58). There were also no significant differences between the treatment groups in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality. During follow-up, there was a consistent modest difference in systolic blood pressure favoring the stent group (-2.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.4 to -0.2; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS Renal-artery stenting did not confer a significant benefit with respect to the prevention of clinical events when added to comprehensive, multifactorial medical therapy in people with atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis and hypertension or chronic kidney disease.

117113,Optical inhibition of striatal neurons promotes focal neurogenesis and neurobehavioral recovery in mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion.,2017,"Cigarette smoking is a major lifestyle factor leading to different human diseases. The DNA repair gene, thymine DNA glycosylase, is important to cell survival because it stops cells from becoming cancerous protecting/preventing DNA. Exposure to CS may induce genetic changes such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele distributions of four TDG SNPs with only smoking behavior in normal patients. Four TDG SNPs-rs4135066 (C/T), rs3751209 (A/G), rs1866074 (C/T), and rs1882018 (C/T) were analyzed by genotyping 235 and 239 blood samples collected from cigarette smokers and non-smokers, among the Saudi population. The results showed that TDG rs4135066 has a significant susceptibility effect observed in long-term smokers (>5 years; OR = 4.53; P = 0.0347) but not in short-term smokers (≤5 years) in contrast with non-smokers. Also, in smokers aged less than 29 years, the ""CT,"" ""TT,"" and ""CT+TT"" alleles of rs1882018 increased the risk of developing all diseases related to smoking by approximately 6, 4, and 5 times, respectively, in contrast with the ancestral ""CC"" homozygous allele. A comparison of the allele distributions of TDG SNPs in a Saudi population with those in other populations represented in the HapMap project showed that the genetic makeup of the Saudi Arabian population appears to differ from that of other ethnicities. Exceptions include the Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria; those of Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California; the Luhya population in Webuye, Kenya; Gujarati Indians in Houston, Texas; and the Tuscan population in Italy, which showed similar allelic frequencies for rs3751209 compared to our Saudi population. In this ethnic, we have found a high variation in the distribution of the alleles and genotype frequencies on TDG gene. This variation on TDG SNP's with smoking could lead to increase the susceptibility to many diseases related to smoking habits in this population.","Almutairi, Mikhlid; Rouabhia, Mahmoud; Sahab Almutairi, Mohammed; Al-Zahrani, Mohammed; Al-Numair, Nouf S; Mohammad Alhadeq, Abdullah; Reddy Parine, Narasimha; Semlali, Abdelhabib",Gene,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.145092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916247/,1
117158,Season of birth and primary central nervous system tumors: a systematic review of the literature with critical appraisal of underlying mechanisms.,2017,"IMPORTANCE Comorbidities are common in COPD, but quantifying their burden is difficult. Currently there is a COPD-specific comorbidity index to predict mortality and another to predict general quality of life. We sought to develop and validate a COPD-specific comorbidity score that reflects comorbidity burden on patient-centered outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using the COPDGene study (GOLD II-IV COPD), we developed comorbidity scores to describe patient-centered outcomes employing three techniques: 1) simple count, 2) weighted score, and 3) weighted score based upon statistical selection procedure. We tested associations, area under the Curve (AUC) and calibration statistics to validate scores internally with outcomes of respiratory disease-specific quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), six minute walk distance (6MWD), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score and exacerbation risk, ultimately choosing one score for external validation in SPIROMICS. RESULTS Associations between comorbidities and all outcomes were comparable across the three scores. All scores added predictive ability to models including age, gender, race, current smoking status, pack-years smoked and FEV1 (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Area under the curve (AUC) was similar between all three scores across outcomes: SGRQ (range 0·7624-0·7676), MMRC (0·7590-0·7644), 6MWD (0·7531-0·7560) and exacerbation risk (0·6831-0·6919). Because of similar performance, the comorbidity count was used for external validation. In the SPIROMICS cohort, the comorbidity count performed well to predict SGRQ (AUC 0·7891), MMRC (AUC 0·7611), 6MWD (AUC 0·7086), and exacerbation risk (AUC 0·7341). CONCLUSIONS Quantifying comorbidity provides a more thorough understanding of the risk for patient-centered outcomes in COPD.

METHODS In May 2020, we conducted an online survey of 19 carceral systems that provided methadone and/or buprenorphine treatment for incarcerated populations before COVID-19. Eleven survey items examined challenges and changes to these programs as a result of the pandemic. Sixteen of 19 programs (84%) responded to the survey. RESULTS Ten out of 16 systems reported downsizing their OAT programs. Seven of 16 systems made changes to medication dispensation processes. Half of systems report challenges implementing physical distancing (n = 8), and/or obtaining personal protective equipment (n = 8). In 13 out of 16 systems some OAT program participants were released early due to COVID-19 infection risk. CONCLUSIONS Jails and prisons with existing OAT programs have curtailed their operations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the robust evidence base around OAT for treating opioid use disorder and averting overdose deaths, guidance is needed on maintaining and ramping up medication access as carceral facilities grapple with implementing COVID-19 mitigation.","Bandara, Sachini; Kennedy-Hendricks, Alene; Merritt, Sydney; Barry, Colleen L; Saloner, Brendan",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868681/,1

Although unlikely necessary for all patients, the criteria for utilizing ciNPWT in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain poorly defined. This study's purpose was to compare the incidence of incisional wound complications, non-incisional complications (ie, dressing reactions), reoperations, and periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) among a group of high-risk primary TKA patients treated with ciNPWT vs an occlusive silver impregnated dressing. METHODS One hundred thirty high-risk primary TKA patients treated with ciNPWT were 1:1 propensity matched and compared to a historical control group treated with an occlusive silver impregnated dressing. High-risk criteria included the following: active tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, body mass index >35 kg/m2, autoimmune disease, chronic kidney disease, Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization, and non-aspirin anticoagulation. RESULTS Age, gender, and risk factor profile were comparable between cohorts. The ciNPWT cohort had significantly fewer incisional wound complications (6.9% vs 16.2%; P = .031) and significantly more non-incisional complications (16.9% vs 1.5%; P < .001). No dressing reactions required clinical intervention. There were no differences in reoperations or periprosthetic joint infections (P = 1.000). In multivariate analysis, occlusive silver impregnated dressings (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3-6.8, P = .012) and non-aspirin anticoagulation (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6, P = .028) were associated with the development of incisional wound complications. CONCLUSION Among high-risk patients undergoing primary TKA, ciNPWT decreased incisional wound complications when compared to occlusive silver impregnated dressings, particularly among those receiving non-aspirin anticoagulation. Although an increase in dressing reactions was observed, the clinical impact was minimal.","Doman, David M; Young, Allison M; Buller, Leonard T; Deckard, Evan R; Meneghini, R Michael",The Journal of arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2021.05.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140207/,1

In addition, high-titer IGs (hyperimmune) against a specific pathogen can be obtained from vaccinated or convalescing donors. Currently, IGs can be used for the treatment of a variety of infections for which no specific therapy exists or that remain difficult to treat. Moreover, the recent pathogen outbreaks for which there is no approved treatment have renewed attention to the role of convalescent plasma and IGs. Areas covered: In this review, a historical perspective of the use of sera and IGs in humans as anti-infective agents (any viral, bacterial, parasitic infection), excluding immunodeficient patients, is presented from early development to the latest clinical studies. A Medline search was conducted to examine the peer-reviewed literature, with no date limits.

118690,"Seasonality of reported tuberculosis cases from 2006 to 2010 in Wuhan, China.",2014,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) can be debilitating and lead to significant morbidity. Cerebral venous sinus lesions, such as venous sinus stenosis, diverticula, and high-riding jugular bulb, are uncommon causes of PT, for which there is no standard treatment. Endovascular interventions have shown promising results for PT secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and may be a valid therapeutic option for isolated venous PT. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review on the outcome and safety of endovascular treatment for patients with isolated, debilitating venous PT. The venous lesion characteristics, endovascular techniques, complications, and clinical outcomes were assessed. In addition, an illustrative case of endovascular stenting for PT caused by venous sinus stenosis was included. RESULTS A total of 41 patients (90.2% female) from 26 papers were included. The median age was 46 years (IQR 23; range 25-72 years). Focal venous sinus stenosis (20 patients) and sinus diverticula (14 patients) were the most common culprit lesions. Endovascular treatment included venous sinus stenting in 35 patients, 11 of whom had adjuvant coil embolization, and coil embolization alone in six patients. Complete resolution of the tinnitus was achieved in 95.1% of patients. There was one complication of cerebellar infarct, and no procedure-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS In patients with debilitating PT secondary to venous sinus lesions, endovascular treatment by stenting and/or coil embolization appears to be safe and effective. Prospective randomized studies with objective outcome assessments are needed to confirm the treatment benefits.","Yang, I-Hsiao; Pereira, Vitor M; Lenck, Stephanie; Nicholson, Patrick; Orru, Emanuele; Klostranec, Jesse M; Krings, Timo; Tsang, Anderson Chun On",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2019-014725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872352/,1

Here, we show that hemin impairs inactivation of K+ channels formed by Kv3.4 α subunits as well as that induced by the subunits Kvβ1.1, Kvβ1.2, and Kvβ3.1 when coexpressed with α subunits of the Kv1 subfamily. In Kvβ1.1, hemin interacts with cysteine and histidine residues in the N terminus (C7 and H10) with high affinity (EC50 100 nM). Similarly, rapid inactivation of Kv4.2 channels induced by the dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein DPP6a is also sensitive to hemin, and the DPP6a mutation C13S eliminates this dependence. The results suggest a common mechanism for a dynamic regulation of Kv channel inactivation by heme/hemin in N-terminal ball domains of Kv α and auxiliary β subunits. Free intracellular heme therefore has the potential to regulate cellular excitability via modulation of Kv channel inactivation.","Coburger, Ina; Yang, Kefan; Bernert, Alisa; Wiesel, Eric; Sahoo, Nirakar; Swain, Sandip M; Hoshi, Toshinori; Schönherr, Roland; Heinemann, Stefan H",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-020-02386-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388729/,1
119079,Stent-Assisted Coil Embolization of a Transverse-Sigmoid Sinus Diverticulum Presenting with Pulsatile Tinnitus.,2016,"Cerebral aneurysms are pathological focal evaginations of the arterial wall at and around the junctions of the circle of Willis. Their tenuous walls predispose aneurysms to leak or rupture leading to hemorrhagic strokes with high morbidity and mortality rates. The endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms currently includes the implantation of fine-mesh stents, called flow diverters, within the parent artery bearing the aneurysm. By mitigating flow velocities within the aneurysmal sac, the devices preferentially induce thrombus formation in the aneurysm within hours to days. In response to the foreign implant, an endothelialized arterial layer covers the luminal surface of the device over a period of days to months. Organization of the intraneurysmal thrombus leads to resorption and shrinkage of the aneurysm wall and contents, eventually leading to beneficial remodeling of the pathological site to a near-physiological state. The devices' primary function of reducing flow activity within aneurysms is corollary to their mesh structure. Complete specification of the device mesh structure, or alternately device permeability, necessarily involves the quantification of two variables commonly used to characterize porous media-mesh porosity and mesh pore density. We evaluated the flow alteration induced by five commercial neurovascular devices of varying porosity and pore density (stents: Neuroform, Enterprise, and LVIS; flow diverters: Pipeline and FRED) in an idealized sidewall aneurysm model. As can be expected in such a model, all devices substantially reduced intraneurysmal kinetic energy as compared to the nonstented case with the coarse-mesh stents inducing a 65-80% reduction whereas the fine-mesh flow diverters induced a near-complete flow stagnation (∼98% reduction). We also note a trend toward greater device efficacy (lower intraneurysmal flow) with decreasing device porosity and increasing device pore density. Several such flow studies have been and are being conducted in idealized as well as patient-derived geometries with the overarching goals of improving device design, facilitating treatment planning (what is the optimal device for a specific aneurysm), and predicting treatment outcome (will a specific aneurysm treated with a specific device successfully occlude over the long term). While the results are generally encouraging, there is poor standardization of study variables between different research groups, and any consensus will only be reached after standardized studies are conducted on collectively large datasets. Biochemical variables may have to be incorporated into these studies to maximize predictive values.","Dholakia, Ronak; Sadasivan, Chander; Fiorella, David J; Woo, Henry H; Lieber, Baruch B",Journal of biomechanical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4034932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27727400/,1

In Australia, MATES in Construction was developed as an occupational health initiative to prevent suicides in the industry. The program has recently been applied to the energy industry; however, little is known regarding exposure to suicide and suicide prevention interventions in this sector. The study aimed to examine the effectiveness of MATES in Energy general awareness training (GAT), and estimate the prevalence of recent suicidal ideation and exposure to suicidal behaviors in workers. A before and after design was used to examine the effectiveness of GAT training. Data were collected from 4887 participants undertaking GAT training at energy sites across Queensland, Australia. In total, 2% (97) of participants reported recent suicidal thoughts, 65% of participants reported they had known someone who had attempted suicide, and 69% had known someone who died by suicide. Significant improvements were found on all suicide literacy items after GAT training. Younger people were more likely to be positively affected by the intervention. The results indicate that the MATES in Energy program is successfully transitioning from the construction industry, and offers the first empirically supported suicide intervention tailored to the energy sector.","Ross, Victoria; Caton, Neil; Mathieu, Sharna; Gullestrup, Jorgen; Kõlves, Kairi",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899257/,1

Here, we inhibit centriole formation and/or remove PCNT-CDK5RAP2 in RPE1 cells to address their relative contributions to spindle formation. While CDK5RAP2 and PCNT are normally dispensable for spindle formation, they become essential when centrioles are absent. Acentriolar spindle assembly is accompanied by the formation of foci containing PCNT and CDK5RAP2 via a microtubule and Polo-like kinase 1-dependent process. Foci formation and spindle assembly require PCNT-CDK5RAP2-dependent matrix assembly and the ability of CDK5RAP2 to recruit γ-tubulin complexes. Thus, the PCM matrix can self-organize independently of centrioles to generate microtubules for spindle assembly; conversely, an alternative centriole-anchored mechanism supports spindle assembly when the PCM matrix is absent. Extension to three cancer cell lines revealed similar results in HeLa cells, whereas DLD1 and U2OS cells could assemble spindles in the absence of centrioles and PCNT-CDK5RAP2, suggesting cell type variation in spindle assembly mechanisms.","Watanabe, Sadanori; Meitinger, Franz; Shiau, Andrew K; Oegema, Karen; Desai, Arshad",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202006010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33170211/,1

While understanding of the unique needs of COVID-19 survivors is developing, components of the evidence-based Transitional Care Model provide a framework for taking a more immediate, holistic response to caring for these individuals as they moved back into the community. These components include: increasing screening, building trusting relationships, improving patient engagement, promoting collaboration across care teams, undertaking symptom management, increasing family caregiver care/education, coordinating health and social services, and improving care continuity. Evidence generated from rigorous testing of these components reveal the need for federal and state policy solutions to support the following: employment/redeployment of nurses, social workers, and community health workers; training and reimbursement of family caregivers; widespread access to research-based transitional care tools; and coordinated local efforts to address structural barriers to effective transitions.

119966,Evaluation of the Risk of Laboratory Microbial Contamination during Routine Testing in Automated Clinical Chemistry and Microbiology Laboratories.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Hemodialysis (HD) patients frequently suffer from severe anemia caused by various hemorrhagic disorders in addition to renal anemia. Intradialytic blood transfusion is sometimes performed; however, the cerebral oxygenation changes associated with this procedure remain unclear. METHODS Sixteen HD patients with severe anemia who required intradialytic blood transfusion were included (12 men and 4 women; mean age, 64.8 ± 9.8 years). Cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) was monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy, and cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) was calculated before and after HD. Twenty-five HD patients with well-maintained hemoglobin (Hb) levels were included as a control group. RESULTS Cerebral rSO2 values were significantly lower in HD patients with severe anemia than in the control group (42.4 ± 9.9 vs. 52.5 ± 8.5%, p = 0.001). Following intradialytic blood transfusion (385 ± 140 mL of concentrated red blood cells), Hb levels significantly increased (from 7.2 ± 0.9 to 9.1 ± 1.1 g/dL, p < 0.001), and cerebral rSO2 values significantly improved after HD (from 42.4 ± 9.9 to 46.3 ± 9.0%, p < 0.001). Cerebral FOE values before HD in patients with severe anemia were significantly higher than those in the control group (severe anemia, 0.56 ± 0.10; controls, 0.45 ± 0.08; p < 0.001). After HD with intradialytic blood transfusion, these values significantly decreased (0.52 ± 0.09 after HD versus 0.56 ± 0.10 before HD, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION HD patients with severe anemia represented cerebral oxygen metabolism deterioration, which could be significantly improved by intradialytic blood transfusion.","Ito, Kiyonori; Ookawara, Susumu; Ueda, Yuichiro; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Kofuji, Masaya; Hayasaka, Hideyuki; Uchida, Takayuki; Yanai, Katsunori; Ishii, Hiroki; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Kitano, Taisuke; Hirai, Keiji; Kaku, Yoshio; Hoshino, Taro; Tabei, Kaoru; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",Nephron extra,https://doi.org/10.1159/000471812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28559914/,1

We do not know if tracheostomy will improve their care. Given the paucity of data on this topic, the optimal surgical approach has yet to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal surgical strategy for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. DESIGN Cohort study of 143 ventilator dependent COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheostomy at an academic medical center from April 15 to May 15, 2020, with follow up until June 1, 2020. SETTING A New York City (NYC) academic quaternary referral center during its peak of COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS Adult patients admitted to a NYC medical center with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation for greater than 2 weeks who were unable to be extubated and determined to have reasonable chance of recovery and fit defined tracheostomy candidate criteria. EXPOSURE Patients had either a percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) or open surgical tracheostomy (ST) performed by one of three surgical services. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and results of tracheostomy for both patients with COVID-19 and the surgeons performing the tracheostomy. Specifically, tracheostomy complications, inpatient mortality, disposition of patients, and transmission of COVID-19 to surgeons were measured. RESULTS 143 patients underwent tracheostomy, 58 (41%) via a ST, and 85 (59%) via a PT. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups, except that more patients who had a history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) underwent PT (11% vs 2%, p=0.049). There were no statistical differences observed between the PT and ST groups with regard to bleeding complications (3.5% vs 10.3%, p=0.099), tracheostomy related complications (5.9% vs 8.6%, p=0.528), inpatient death (12% vs 5%, p=0.178), discharge from hospital (39% vs 36%,p=0.751) or surgeon illness (0% v 0%, p=1). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The rapid formation of a multi-disciplinary team allows for the efficient evaluation and performance of a large volume of tracheostomies in a resource-limited setting. Bedside tracheostomy in COVID-19 does not cause additional harm to patients if performed after 2 weeks from intubation. It also appears to be safe for proceduralists to perform in this timeframe. The manner of tracheostomy does not change outcomes significantly if it is performed safely and efficiently.","Krishnamoorthy, Subhash; Polanco, Antonio; Coleman, Natasha; Prigoff, Jake; Sturm, Joshua; Blitzer, David; Erwin, Clinton; D'Ovidio, Frank; Lemaitre, Philippe; Troob, Scott; Hills, Susannah; Stanifer, Bryan Payne",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214455/,1

There is widespread usage of garlic supplements. The common cold is associated with significant morbidity and economic consequences. On average, children have six to eight colds per year, and adults have two to four. OBJECTIVES To determine whether garlic (allium sativum) is effective for either the prevention or treatment of the common cold, when compared to placebo, no treatment or other treatments. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register; OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); MEDLINE (January 1966 to March Week 3, 2009); EMBASE (1974 to March 2009); and AMED (1985 to March 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials of common cold prevention and treatment comparing garlic with placebo, no treatment or standard treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently reviewed and selected trials from searches, assessed and rated study quality, and extracted relevant data. MAIN RESULTS Of the five trials identified as potentially relevant from our searches, only one trial met the inclusion criteria. This trial randomly assigned 146 volunteer participants to either a garlic supplement (with 180 mg of allicin content) or a placebo (once daily) for 12 weeks. The trial reported 65 occurrences of the common cold in the placebo group compared with 24 in the garlic intervention group (P < 0.001). The number of days of illness was lower in the garlic group compared with the placebo group (111 versus 366). The number of days to recovery was similar in both groups (4.63 versus 5.63). Because only one trial met the inclusion criteria, limited conclusions can be drawn. The trial relied on self-reported episodes of the common cold, but was of reasonable quality in terms of randomisation and allocation concealment. Adverse effects included rash and odour. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is insufficient clinical trial evidence regarding the effects of garlic in preventing or treating the common cold. A single trial suggested that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold, but more studies are needed to validate this finding. Claims of effectiveness appear to rely largely on poor quality evidence.","Lissiman, Elizabeth; Bhasale, Alice L; Cohen, Marc",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006206.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19588383/,1

Endoscopic instruments such as stapler cartridges are essential for VATS procedures. In this study, we investigated the factors that affect the number of stapler cartridges used in VATS lobectomy. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients who underwent complete VATS lobectomy for NSCLC from January 2013 to December 2015. Results In total, 596 patients underwent complete VATS lobectomy. The average number of stapler cartridges used for VATS lobectomy was 5.3±1.9. The number of stapler cartridges used for VATS lobectomy was higher in men (5.5±1.9 vs. 5.0±18, p=0.006), those aged older than 70 years (5.5±2.1 vs. 5.1±1.7, p=0.038), those who underwent upper or middle lobectomy procedures (5.7±1.9 vs. 4.1±1.2, p<0.001), those with a higher fissure sum average (p<0.001), and those in whom surgery was performed by a surgeon with a preference for staplers (5.6±2.0 vs. 4.9±1.6, p<0.001). Conclusion The number of stapler cartridges required to perform VATS lobectomy in NSCLC patients appears to be influenced by sex, age, the location of the tumor, the degree of fissure development, and the surgeon's preference.","Yang, Young Ho; Lee, Seokkee; Lee, Chang Young; Kim, Dae Joon; Lee, Jin Gu; Chung, Kyung-Young",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.5090/kjtcs.2020.53.2.53; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309203/,1

We aimed to compare systemic and cerebral hemodynamic variables and cough incidence in neurosurgery patients emerging from general anesthesia with the standard procedure (endotracheal tube [ETT] extubation) or after replacement of the ETT with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-two patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy under general anesthesia were included in a randomized open-label parallel trial. Patients were randomized (sealed envelopes labeled with software-generated randomized numbers) to awaken with the ETT in place or after its replacement with a ProSeal LMA. We recorded mean arterial pressure as the primary endpoint and heart rate, middle cerebral artery flow velocity, regional cerebral oxygen saturation, norepinephrine plasma concentrations, and coughing. RESULTS No differences were found between groups at baseline. All hemodynamic variables increased significantly from baseline in both groups during emergence. The ETT group had significantly higher mean arterial pressure (11.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-21.8 mm Hg) (P=0.017), heart rate (7.2 beats/min; 95% CI, 0.7-13.7 beats/min) (P=0.03), and rate-pressure product (1045.4; 95% CI, 440.8-1650) (P=0.001). Antihypertensive medication was administered to more ETT-group patients than LMA-group patients (9 [42.9%] vs. 3 [14.3%] patients, respectively; P=0.04). The percent increase in regional cerebral oxygen saturation was greater in the ETT group by 26.1% (95% CI, 9.1%-43.2%) (P=0.002), but no between-group differences were found in MCA flow velocity. Norepinephrine plasma concentrations rose in both groups between baseline and the end of emergence: LMA: from 87.5±7.1 to 125.6±17.3 pg/mL; and ETT: from 118.1±14.1 to 158.1±24.7 pg/mL (P=0.007). The differences between groups were not significant. The incidence of cough was higher in the ETT group (87.5%) than in the LMA group (9.5%) (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Replacing the ETT with the LMA before neurosurgical patients emerge from anesthesia results in a more favorable hemodynamic profile, less cerebral hyperemia, and a lower incidence of cough.","Perelló-Cerdà, Laura; Fàbregas, Neus; López, Ana M; Rios, José; Tercero, Javier; Carrero, Enrique; Hurtado, Paola; Hervías, Adriana; Gracia, Isabel; Caral, Luis; de Riva, Nicolás; Valero, Ricard",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25121397/,1

OBJECTIVES To explore ACP knowledge, experiences, views, facilitators, and barriers among older adults of Turkish origin in Belgium. METHODS This qualitative study was based on constant comparative analysis of semi-structured interview content. Participants were 33 older adults (aged 65-84 years; mean, 71.7 years; median, 74.5 years) of Turkish origin living in Belgium. RESULTS Despite unfamiliarity with the term ACP in this sample, several participants had engaged in some ACP behaviors. Respondents considered ACP to be useful and were ready to engage in conversations about it. The most commonly mentioned facilitator was the provision of tailored information about ACP. Other facilitators included concerns about future care needs, increasing awareness among respondents' children about the advantages of ACP, and respondents' desire to avoid ""burdening"" their children. The most commonly mentioned barrier was respondents' lack of knowledge about ACP. Other barriers were language issues, a lack of urgency about ACP discussion, reliance on familial support, and older adults' fear of triggering negative emotions in themselves and their children.

METHOD This is a scoping review developed in six stages. The sixth stage was developed with registered nurses who work in the Brazil Organ Donation System. To consolidate the information and prepare all assumptions, the legislation in force in Brazil was followed. RESULTS Recommendations from 19 articles identified in the literature were analyzed; additionally, 52 professionals who work at Brazil Organ Donation System participated in the research. Four care assumptions were formed: investigation of community transmission, investigation of clinical situations, screening for COVID-19 signs and symptoms, and investigation of alterations presented in the physical examination. Such assumptions are formed by 34 care guidelines. DISCUSSION Care assumptions were prepared to guide and support registered nurses during assessment and validation of potential organ and tissue donors. From this perspective, assumptions certainly promote safety, effectiveness and quality in the service offered during the organ and tissue donation process in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to empowering registered nurses in this scenario. Quality and bio-surveillance through the donation stages have been discussed extensively in recent times, to improve donation and transplantations by valuing care, safety, and quality of life of recipients. CONCLUSION The care assumptions presented in this study support and subsidize the daily practice of registered nurses who work in assessing and validating potential organ and tissue donors, enabling these professionals to make decisions based on secure information.","da Silva-Knihs, Neide; Erbs-Pessoa, João Luis; Pestana-Magalhães, Aline Lima; Schuantes-Paim, Sibele Maria; Fischer-Wachholz, Laísa; Lima-Silva, Elza; de Aguiar-Roza, Bartira",Enfermeria intensiva,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfi.2021.02.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083129/,1

Here, we focus on the distribution of viral replicons in host organisms, their morphological features, and the evolution of highly conserved protein and nucleic acid structures. The apparent inability of RNA viral replicons to infect contemporary akaryotic species suggests an early origin of RNA viruses and their subsequent loss in akaryotes. A census of virion morphotypes reveals that advanced forms were unique to viruses infecting a specific supergroup, while simpler forms were observed in viruses infecting organisms in all forms of cellular life. Results hint toward an ancient origin of viruses from an ancestral virus harboring either filamentous or spherical virions. Finally, phylogenetic trees built from protein domain and tRNA structures in thousands of genomes suggest that viruses evolved via reductive evolution from ancient cells. The analysis presents a complete account of the evolutionary history of cells and viruses and identifies viruses as crucial agents influencing cellular evolution.","Nasir, Arshan; Sun, Feng-Jie; Kim, Kyung Mo; Caetano-Anollés, Gustavo",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25758413/,1
124637,Treatment of Distal Anterior Circulation Aneurysms With the Pipeline Embolization Device: A US Multicenter Experience.,2016,"BACKGROUND Future shortages in platelet supply are expected in Germany due to demographic changes. A rising cancer incidence will lead to an increasing demand for platelet concentrates (PCs) while the number of potential donors will decrease. Pathogen inactivation (PI) aims to inactivate various infectious agents including emerging pathogens to extend the shelf-life of PCs and reduce the frequency of acute transfusion reactions (ATRs). In this context, the clinical and economic impact of PI on platelet transfusion was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Model calculations were conducted for 2 scenarios considering different production settings. Frequencies of ATRs were based on literature analyses, platelet and ATR costs on cost analyses. RESULTS The estimated average costs for ATRs of grade 1 and 2, irrespective of origin, and grade 3 (allergic) were € 104, € 238, and € 1,200, respectively. Approximately 400 PC-related ATRs per 10(5) transfusions can be avoided, with estimated savings amounting to € 77,000. The total cost increase was calculated to approximately € 30-50 per PI-treated PC. CONCLUSION PI potentially saves plasma, prolongs shelf-life, decreases donor deferral, and reduces ATRs. Model calculations considering clinical and safety benefits of PI show a rational cost increase. The impact of PI should be further evaluated from a societal perspective regarding future blood supply and infectious disease globalization.","Berger, Karin; Bauer, Matthaeus; Schopohl, Dorothee; Henschler, Reinhard; Ostermann, Helmut",Onkologie,https://doi.org/10.1159/000346309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23429333/,1

However, the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on T cell responses to common cold coronaviruses remain unknown. In this study, we analyzed CD4+ T cell responses to spike peptides from SARS-CoV-2 and 3 common cold coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) before and after study participants received Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) or Moderna (mRNA-1273) mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine recipients made broad T cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and we identified 23 distinct targeted peptides in 9 participants including one peptide that was targeted by 6 individuals. Only 4 out of these 23 targeted peptides would potentially be affected by mutations in the UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (B.1.351) variants and CD4+ T cells from vaccine recipients recognized the 2 variant spike proteins as effectively as the spike protein from the ancestral virus. Interestingly, we saw a 3-fold increase in the CD4+ T cell responses to HCoV-NL63 spike peptides post-vaccination. Our results suggest that T cell responses elicited or enhanced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines may be able to control SARS-CoV-2 variants and lead to cross-protection from some endemic coronaviruses.","Woldemeskel, Bezawit A; Garliss, Caroline C; Blankson, Joel N",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci149335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822770/,1
125046,Needlescopy-assisted resection of pulmonary nodule after dual localisation.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To investigate patient characteristics and factors that increase the risk of being admitted to intensive care and that influence survival in cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS One-hundred and ninety-one SARS-CoV-2 patients were admitted to the ""Fondazione Poliambulanza di Brescia"" Hospital (Brescia, Lombardy, Italy) in the period 1st March 2020 to 11th April 2020. Data on demographics, clinical presentation at admission, co-morbidities, pharmacological treatment, admission to intensive care and death was recorded. Logistic regression and survival analysis were carried out to investigate the risk of being admitted to intensive care and the risk of death. RESULTS The mean age of the study cohort was 64.6±9.9 years (range 20-88). Median BMI was 28.5±5 kg/m2. Fever (81%) and dyspnea (65%) were the most common symptoms on admission. Most of patients (63%) had at least one co-existing disease. The 157 (82%) patients admitted to intensive care were more likely to be of intermediate age (60-69 years; OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.32-8.38), overweight (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.02-7.07) or obese (OR 5.63, 95% CI 1.73-21.09) and with lymphocytopenia (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.17-6.89) than the 34 patients admitted to the ordinary ward. During intensive care, 50% of patients died and their death was associated with older age (HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.07-3.97), obesity (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.15-4.35) and male gender (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.02-3.57). CONCLUSIONS We found that admission to intensive care and poor survival were associated with advanced age and higher body mass index, albeit with differences in statistical significance. Pre-existing diseases and symptoms on admission were not associated with different clinical outcomes. Interestingly, male gender was more prevalent among SARS-CoV-2 patients and was related negatively to survival, but it was not associated with more frequent admission to intensive care.","Baronio, M; Freni-Sterrantino, A; Pinelli, M; Natalini, G; Tonini, G; Marri, M; Baglivo, M; Sabatini, T; Maltese, P E; Chiurazzi, P; Michelini, S; Morreale, G; Ascione, A; Notaro, P; Bertelli, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202009_23061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015815/,1

Although structural competency has become an increasingly accepted framework for training and teaching, it usually has not addressed nursing students and has not included marginalized patients as trainers. METHOD This article analyzes a structural competency training model for nursing students that includes five components: Theory, Observations, Learning from patients, Engagement, and Research (the TOLERance model). RESULTS The TOLERance model increases the understanding of the interrelation between the individual clinical level and the sociopolitical structural level. It encourages nursing students to actively engage in social, political, and policy issues that affect their patients' health and to advocate for policy change. CONCLUSION The moral and professional commitment of nurses to their patients demands that they do not ignore the structural forces that are detrimental to their patients' health. The TOLERance model provides nursing students with skills and competencies that help them to fulfill this commitment.

A membranous obstruction of the caudal vena cava at the cranial aspect of the liver was identified via CT angiography. CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination findings included a markedly distended abdomen and panting. Testing for circulating FIV antibody and FeLV antigen, a PCR assay for feline coronavirus performed on a sample of peritoneal fluid, and fecal flotation yielded negative results. A diagnosis of Budd-Chiari-like syndrome secondary to a membranous obstruction of the caudal vena cava was made. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME The cat was anesthetized, and the subhepatic portion of the caudal vena cava was identified and accessed via median celiotomy and direct venipuncture. A 6F 8 × 24-mm balloon-expandable nitinol biliary stent was placed across the stenotic area under fluoroscopic guidance. The patient remained free of clinical signs at the last follow-up 13 months following the procedure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Budd-Chiari-like syndrome is a rare phenomenon in veterinary medicine, and congenital malformations should be considered in young feline patients with ascites. Computed tomography angiography proved to be a helpful adjunctive imaging technique to establish a diagnosis in this case. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of successful treatment of a congenital caudal vena cava obstruction by means of stent placement in a juvenile cat.","Hoehne, Sabrina N; Milovancev, Milan; Hyde, Aleshia J; deMorais, Helio A; Scollan, Kate F; Nemanic, Sarah",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.245.4.414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075825/,1

This study assesses the incidence and degree of chronic pain and discomfort after primary inguinal hernia repair performed in our hospital and aims to clarify its relationship to the type of mesh placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted of 334 patients (378 lesions) who underwent primary inguinal hernia using the Lichtenstein (onlay mesh), Ultrapro Plug (UPP; onlay plus plug mesh), modified Kugel Patch (onlay and underlay mesh), or laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP; underlay mesh) procedure. Postoperative pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale at postoperative 2-3 wk, 3 mo, and 6 mo. Postoperative discomfort was assessed 6 mo afterward. RESULTS Questionnaire responses were received for 378 lesions (100%) after 2-3 wk, 229 (60.6%) after 3 mo, and 249 (65.9%) after 6 mo. The majority of chronic pain experienced was mild, and no patient suffered from severe pain. The level of pain tended to be less for the TAPP procedure than for other methods. Discomfort at rest was significantly less for TAPP versus Ultrapro Plug (P < 0.01), and discomfort with movement was significantly less for TAPP versus modified Kugel (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Onlay mesh appears to be a risk factor in chronic pain and discomfort. The lower level of chronic pain and discomfort with underlay mesh placement is considered to result from the reduced risk of nerve damage in this procedure than in the onlay mesh placement procedure.","Takata, Hideyuki; Matsutani, Takeshi; Hagiwara, Nobutoshi; Ueda, Junji; Arai, Hiroki; Yokoyama, Yasuyuki; Nomura, Tsutomu; Uchida, Eiji",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2016.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27884334/,1

The pathogenesis of virus infection and virus-host interactions are still not well elucidated. In this paper, we investigated the expression changes for cellular proteins in DF-1 cells infected with ALV-J. Comparative analyses revealed that the majority of the altered proteins in DF-1 cells appeared at 6-12h after ALV-J infection. Mass spectrometry identified 74 altered cellular proteins, including 30 up-regulated proteins and 44 down-regulated proteins. Some of these proteins are involved in cell cytoskeleton, metabolic processes, response to stimulus and immune responses. Other proteins, such as DJ-1, UCHL1, VDAC1 and HMGB1, have some relationship to apoptosis or oncogenesis. The changes in the transcriptional profile of DJ-1, UCHL1, VDAC1 and HMGB1 in infected as compared to uninfected DF-1 cells were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR.

In this study, the COE and LTB-COE genes were engineered into the Lactobacillus -Escherichia coli shuttle vectors pSAPG1 (surface-displaying) and pSAPG2 (secreting) followed by electrotransformation into Lactobacillus casei (Lc) to yield the following recombinant strains: Lc:PG1-LTB-COE, Lc:PG2-LTB-COE, Lc:PG1-COE, and Lc:PG2-COE. Our results showed that mice immunized orogastrically with L. casei expressing COE or LTB-COE produced secretory immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G with the ability to neutralize PEDV in sera and mucus. Moreover, higher levels of interleukin-4 and gamma interferon were also exhibited compared with negative control. These data displayed the tendency of Lc:PG2-LTB-COE > Lc:PG1-LTB-COE > Lc:PG2-COE > Lc:PG1-COE at the same time point.

Fifteen wheelchair tennis and 15 able-bodied tennis players enrolled. Electromagnetic system and trial-axial accelerometers were used to measure the difference in the kinematic parameters of the upper extremity and the impact vibration transferred across the wrist joint. The results indicated that wheelchair players demonstrated unique elbow and wrist kinematics, especially shorter total swing time, greater elbow flexion at preparation, lower wrist extension acceleration before impact, and smaller racket vibration at impact. Comparing to able-bodied players in standing, wheelchair players and players in sitting demonstrated significantly greater elbow joint flexion/extension angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration during extension, and wrist joint flexion angle. Wheelchair players also differ significantly with the players in sitting regarding elbow joint angular velocity and acceleration, and wrist joint flexion velocity. These adaptations and adjustments can be attributed to the missing lower extremity function and deficient trunk kinetic chain. The differences between wheelchair tennis players and able-bodied players in sitting could represent the progress as the wheelchair players moving from novices to experts.","Ju, Yan-Ying; Chu, Wan-Ting; Shieh, Wann-Yun; Cheng, Hsin-Yi Kathy",Sports biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14763141.2020.1862903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594959/,1

The advantage of nephron-sparing surgery lies in preservation of parenchyma and hence renal function. However, this advantage is counterbalanced with increased surgical risk. In recent years with the popularization of minimally invasive partial nephrectomy (laparoscopic and robotic), the contemporary role of open PN (OPN) has changed. OPN has several advantages, particularly in complex patients such as those with a solitary kidney, multi-focal tumors, and significant surgical history, as well as providing improved application of renoprotective measures.

Serum levels of antibodies specific for NP and RBD of SARS-CoV2 were also determined in both groups of subjects with ELISA. RESULTS Our results revealed significant differences in anti-NP (P<0.0001) and anti-RBD (P<0.0001) IgG levels between patients and healthy controls. While the levels of rubella- and mumps specific IgG were not different in the two groups of subjects, measles-specific IgG was significantly higher in patients (P<0.01). The serum titer of anti-tetanus antibody, however, was significantly lower in patients compared to healthy individuals (P<0.01).

Improvements or worsening in diet quality (IDQ or WDQ) were verified using an exploratory online survey which investigated whether participants (n = 4780) increased or decreased their consumption of food subgroups that mark positive or negative food patterns. Respondents also agreed or disagreed with their beliefs about food safety, cooking skills, family support, home characterization, feelings and behaviors. All factors of influence on the IDQ or WDQ groups were always compared against the general participants (who did not change their diet sufficiently to be classified into these groups). Individuals from the IDQ group spent more time on food (81.4% versus 62.0%), started to cook more often (91.4%), were more confident with their cooking skills (p<0.01) and positive feelings were at least 2.5 times more prevalent. Adjusted analysis showed the chance to improve diet was 1.39 higher among those who did not feel overworked and increased 1.07 in each additional cooking chore shared between household members. For each additional positive feeling, the odds were 1.41 to IDQ and 0.67 to WDQ. Moreover, for each additional negative feeling the chances for WDQ were 1.21 and 0.90 for IDQ. Those in the WDQ group were more unaware of issues related to contagion during meals, they were not afraid of eating food prepared outside their home and agreed that industrialized food is safer (OR= 1.85).

CONCLUSION the Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology (BSSO) suggests a script for coping with oncological treatment, remembering that the impoundment in the assistance of these cases, can configure a new wave of overload in health systems.","Pinheiro, Rodrigo Nascimento; Coimbra, Felipe J F; Costa-Jr, Wilson Luiz DA; Ribeiro, Heber Salvador DE Castro; Ribeiro, Reitan; Wainstein, Alberto Julius Alves; Laporte, Gustavo Andreazza; Coelho-Jr, Manoel Jesus Pinheiro; Fernandes, Paulo Henrique DE Sousa; Cordeiro, Eduardo Zanella; Sarmento, Bruno JosÉ Queiroz; Guimaraes-Filho, Marco Antonio C; Anghinoni, Marciano; Baiocchi, Glauco; Oliveira, Alexandre Ferreira",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-6991e-20202601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32638914/,1
127990,Final infarct volume is a stronger predictor of outcome than recanalization in patients with proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion treated with endovascular therapy.,2012,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is gaining wide acceptance as a single surgical treatment for obesity. The reported morbidity and mortality rates are low. We herein report the results of LSG performed in a high-volume center by an experienced team. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of all bariatric surgery (BS) was performed between May 2006 and December 2014. Data inspected included operative time, length of hospital stay (LOS), comorbidity resolution, re-operation, percent excess weight loss (%EWL), and 30-day morbidity and mortality. RESULTS In the study period, 3003 patients underwent BS (1901 (63 %) female). Mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 43 years (range 14-73) and 42.8 kg/m(2) (range 35-73), respectively. %EWL at 1 year was 72 % (n = 937; 57 % follow-up rate). There was 1 perioperative mortality due to bleeding (0.03 %). Comorbidity improvement and resolution were 98 % for obstructive sleep apnea, 79 % for diabetes mellitus, 87 % for dyslipidemia, and 85 % for hypertension. Mean operative time and LOS were 50 min (range 32-94) and 2.2 days (range 1-38), respectively. Of the patients, 132 had complications (4.4 %), 25 leaks (0.83 %), 63 bleeding (2.1 %), 1 intra-abdominal abscesses (0.03 %), 3 sleeve strictures (0.1 %), 2 mesenteric vein thromboses (0.06 %), 10 trocar site hernias (0.3 %), and 78 symptomatic cholelithiasis (2.6 %). Re-operation was needed in 13 patients (0.43 %).

128011,Comparison of combination therapies in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma: transarterial chemoembolization with radiofrequency ablation versus microwave ablation.,2015,"PURPOSE A persistent seroma located posterior to a mesh (PPS) remains a little known complication after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). The aim of this large case series was to analyse the prevalence and clinical course as well as identify related factors and independent predictors of PPS. METHODS All 1288 adult patients who underwent a LVHR with an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (ePTFE) between January 2003 and July 2014 were reviewed. Those who underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan more than 3 months afterwards (n = 166) were included and their scans were analysed. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of a PPS and its characteristics. The secondary outcome measures were identification of significantly related factors and independent predictors of PPS. RESULTS A PPS was observed in 14 of 166 analysed CT scans (8.4%). Eleven patients were symptomatic; conservative treatment (wait-and-see policy) was successful in eight. Three underwent relaparoscopy with removal of a thick neoperitoneum. Several instances of tack and/or mesh detachment were identified on CT scans and during relaparoscopy. Independent predictors were: > 3 trocars (RR 5.0, 95% CI 1.6-15.8) and use of a mesh larger than > 300 cm2 (RR 9.9, 95% CI 1.9-51.2). CONCLUSIONS A PPS is a relatively common complication after LVHR with an ePTFE mesh of usually larger hernias. A ""wait-and-see"" approach seems justified in most cases. Some require laparoscopic excision of the thick neoperitoneum. A PPS can cause tack and mesh detachment but the clinical consequences are unclear. Recurrences have not been observed in this series.","Stirler, V M A; de Haas, R J; Raymakers, J T F J; Rakic, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-017-1722-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29335909/,1
128073,Select wisely: the ethical challenge of defining large core with perfusion in the early time window.,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND Mean arterial pressure (MAP) below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with complications after cardiac surgery. However, simply raising empiric MAP targets during CPB might result in MAP above the upper limit of autoregulation (ULA), causing cerebral hyperperfusion in some patients and predisposing them to cerebral dysfunction after surgery. We hypothesized that MAP above an ULA during CPB is associated with postoperative delirium. METHODS Autoregulation during CPB was monitored continuously in 491 patients with the cerebral oximetry index (COx) in this prospective observational study. COx represents Pearson's correlation coefficient between low-frequency changes in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (measured with near-infrared spectroscopy) and MAP. Delirium was defined throughout the postoperative hospitalization based on clinical detection with prospectively defined methods. RESULTS Delirium was observed in 45 (9.2%) patients. Mechanical ventilation for >48 h [odds ratio (OR), 3.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.72-9.03], preoperative antidepressant use (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.29-6.96), prior stroke (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.12-6.96), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.28-5.62), the product of the magnitude and duration of MAP above an ULA (mm Hg h; OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15), and age (per year of age; OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) were independently associated with postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS Excursions of MAP above the upper limit of cerebral autoregulation during CPB are associated with risk for delirium. Optimizing MAP during CPB to remain within the cerebral autoregulation range might reduce risk of delirium.

METHODS All patients with incident invasive cancer in Ireland (1994-2016 inclusive), excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, who attended a cancer centre and died in 2016 were identified from cancer registry data. Patients were categorised based on a diagnosis code 'Encounter for palliative care' from linked hospital episode data. Place of death was categorised from death certificate data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, χ2 tests and logistic regression. RESULTS Of n=4103 decedents identified, 62% had a hospital-based palliative care encounter in the year preceding death. Age (p<0.001), marital status (p=0.017), deprivation index (p<0.001) and health board region (p=0.008) were independent predictors of having a palliative care encounter. Place of death differed by palliative care encounter group: 45% of those with an encounter died in hospital versus 50% without an encounter, 33% vs 16% died in a hospice and 18% vs 28% died at home (p<0.001). CONCLUSION Almost two-thirds of patients with cancer who attended a cancer centre and died in 2016 had a palliative care encounter. They were younger, less likely to be married and more likely to be from deprived areas. Having accounted for sociodemographic factors, there was evidence of regional variation in receiving care. Demographic and clinical factors and the provision of health services in a region need to be considered together when assessing end-of-life care.","Kelly, Maria; O'Brien, Katie M; Hannigan, Ailish",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917655/,1
128276,Treatment of cavernous sinus aneurysms with flow diversion: results in 44 patients.,2014,"Background Altered molecular signaling pathways in ameloblastoma have been identified to play a pivotal role in the mechanism of oncogenesis, differentiation, and tumor progression. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway is one of the signaling pathways that are associated with the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) controls cell migration and proliferation. It monitors the level of the Akt and maintains cellular integrity. The present study was aimed to study the immunoexpression of PTEN in ameloblastoma to understand its role in the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma. Materials and Methods Twenty cases of ameloblastoma and ten cases of normal tooth germ were subjected to immunohistochemical staining against PTEN. Results Strong PTEN immunopositivity was seen in the tooth germs, while weak positivity was seen in the ameloblastoma. The immunoscore for PTEN was calculated by adding the percentage score and the intensity score. Seventeen cases showed the reduced PTEN expression in the epithelial component of ameloblastoma. The unpaired t-test showed a statistically significant difference in the mean PTEN immunoscore in tooth germ and ameloblastoma. Conclusion The study showed reduced PTEN immunoreactivity, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of ameloblastoma, through Akt pathway.","Narayan, Bhaskar; Urs, Aadithya B; Augustine, Jeyaseelan; Singh, Hanspal",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_528_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719259/,1

RECENT FINDINGS Preoperative IVIg is not needed to prevent myasthenic crisis in stable myasthenia gravis patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, based on controlled data. Rituximab, if initiated early in new-onset myasthenia gravis, can lead to faster and more sustained remission even without immunotherapies in 35% of patients at 2 years. Biomarkers determining the timing for follow-up infusions in Rituximab-responding AChR-positive patients are discussed. Most patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia gravis treated with Rituximab have sustained long-term remission with persistent reduction of IgG4 anti-MuSK antibodies. Eculizumb in the extension REGAIN study showed sustained long-term pharmacological remissions and reduced exacerbations. Three new biologic agents showed promising results in phase-II controlled myasthenia gravis trials: Zilucoplan, a subcutaneous macrocyclic peptide inhibiting complement C5; Efgartigimod, an IgG1-derived Fc fragment binding to neonatal FcRn receptor; and Rozanolixizumab, a high-affinity anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody. Finally, the safety of ongoing myasthenia gravis immunotherapies during COVID19 pandemic is discussed. SUMMARY New biologics against B cells, complement and FcRn receptor, are bringing us closer to successful targeted immunotherapies in the chronic management of myasthenia gravis promising an exciting future for antibody-mediated neurological diseases.","Dalakas, Marinos C",Current opinion in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833750/,1
128641,[Results of deconstructive endovascular surgery in treatment of large and giant intracranial aneurysms].,2016,"Viral proteins can have multiple effects on host cell biology. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is a good example of this. During the virus life cycle, NS1 can act as an antagonist of host type I and III interferon production and signaling, inhibit apoptosis, suppress dendritic cell maturation, control protein stability, and regulate transcription of host cell mRNAs, among other functions. It is likely that NS1 performs these different roles through interactions with multiple host cell proteins. To investigate this and identify cellular proteins that could interact with NS1, we used quantitative proteomics in combination with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-trap immunoprecipitation and bioinformatic analysis. This analysis identified 221 proteins that were potentially part of complexes that could interact with NS1, with many of these associated with transcriptional regulation as part of the mediator complex, cell cycle regulation, and other functions previously assigned to NS1. Specific immunoprecipitation using the GFP trap was used to confirm the ability of selected cellular proteins to interact individually with NS1. Infection of A549 cells with recombinant viruses deficient in the expression of NS1 and overexpression analysis both demonstrated that NS1 was necessary and sufficient for the enrichment of cells in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle.","Wu, Weining; Tran, Kim C; Teng, Michael N; Heesom, Kate J; Matthews, David A; Barr, John N; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00460-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22593156/,1

Characterization of films using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and various microscopies shows that the films obtained through the two different routes vary in their retained BDBA proportion, crystal size and macroscale morphology. Gas adsorption measurements give specific surface areas of 579 ± 7 m2/g and 739 ± 11 m2/g respectively, suggesting that the average porosity of these films is competitive with bulk-synthesized COF-1 particles. The films have a stratified structure, with a dense, thin top layer and a thicker, sponge-like base layer. Using nanoindentation, we measured the Young's modulus at the top surface of the SVA and SA films to be 3.64 ± 1.20 GPa and 3.33 ± 0.12 GPa respectively, with the smaller uncertainty for the SA film attributed to a more uniform morphology. These measurements provide useful experimental data pertaining to COF-1 mechanical properties, furnishing information relevant to the use of these free-standing membranes in applications such as gas filtration or storage.","Turangan, Nikka; Xu, Yanan; Spratt, Henry; Rintoul, Llew; Bottle, Steven; MacLeod, Jennifer",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/abb903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937612/,1
129580,How to WEB: a practical review of methodology for the use of the Woven EndoBridge.,2020-01-31,"Background: Respiratory viral illnesses account for many hospitalizations and inappropriate antibiotic use. Respiratory viral panels by polymerase chain reaction (RVP-PCR) provide a reliable means of diagnosis. In 2015, the RVP-PCR assay at our institution was switched from respiratory viral panel (RVP) to rapid respiratory panel (rapid RP), which has a faster turnaround time (24 hours vs 12 hours, respectively). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of RVP-PCR tests on duration of antibiotic use and length of stay (LOS) in hospitalized patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who had a RVP-PCR ordered within a 1-year time period before and after the assay switch. Patients who were pregnant, had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to admission, were not discharged, or had not completed antibiotics by end of study period were excluded. Results: Data were obtained from a total of 140 patients (70 in each group). Of these, 25 (35.7%) in the RVP group and 28 (40.0%) in the rapid RP group had a positive result. The median LOS was 4.5 days (IQR, 3-9 days) in the RVP group and 5 days (IQR, 3-9 days) in the rapid RP group (P = .78). The median duration of antibiotic use was 4 days (IQR, 2-7 days) in the RVP group and 5 days (IQR, 1-7 days) in the rapid RP group (P = .8). Conclusion: Despite faster turnaround time, there was no significant difference in duration of antibiotic use, or LOS between the RVP and rapid RP groups.","Choi, Sebastian; Kabir, Rubiya; Gautam-Goyal, Pranisha; Malhotra, Prashant",Hospital pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1177/0018578717731573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29276302/,1

Food availability was predominantly assessed for a seven days period and from a single data measurement. Other variables were also observed in the studies, such as socio-demographic data and expenditure on food. Among the limitations to assess the food availability at home, we can highlight the difficulty in measuring the food distribution among family members and the lack of information on the variability of this availability. Such assessment can be improved by investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the instruments for greater detail and accuracy of the information.

However, the risk of experiencing clinically overt infections following exposure to pluvial floodwater is poorly estimated. A retrospective cross-sectional survey was performed to quantify the occurrence of self-reported gastrointestinal, influenza-like illness (ILI) and dermatological complaints, and the frequency of visits to the general practitioner (GP), during a 4-week observation period following pluvial flooding at seven locations in The Netherlands. Questionnaires were sent to 817 flooded households, 149 (17%) of which returned the questionnaire reporting information for 199 participants. Contact with floodwater was significantly associated with increased occurrence of gastrointestinal [odds ratio (OR 4·44)], ILI (OR 2·75) and dermatological (OR 6·67) complaints, and GP visits (OR 2·72). Having hand contact with floodwater was associated with gastrointestinal and dermatological complaints, whereas ILI complaints were associated with being engaged in post-flooding cleaning operations and having walked/cycled through floodwater. This study shows that floodwater-associated diseases occur in urban settings following extreme rainfall events in a high-income country. As pluvial floods are expected to escalate in the future due to global climate change, further research is warranted to determine the disease burden of pluvial flooding and to assess the effect of different interventions, including raising awareness among stakeholders.","DE Man, H; Mughini Gras, L; Schimmer, B; Friesema, I H M; DE Roda Husman, A M; VAN Pelt, W",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268815002654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26554647/,1

The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, self-reported preventive behaviors and risk perception among Iranian medical students within the first week after the onset of the outbreak in Iran. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted from 26th to 28th of February, 2020. Participants were Iranian medical students (5th-7th year) whose knowledge, preventive behaviors and risk perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions including 15 items about COVID-19 related knowledge, 9 items regarding preventive measures and 2 items about COVID-19 risk perception. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were shown to be satisfactory. RESULTS A total of 240 medical students completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 23.67 years. The average of correct answers of knowledge was 86.96%; and 79.60% had high level of related knowledge. The average rate of practicing preventive behaviors was 94.47%; and 94.2% had high level of performance in preventive behaviors. The cumulative score of risk perception was 4.08 out of 8 which was in moderate range. Risk perception was significantly different between stagers and interns and between those being trained in emergency room (ER) and non-ER wards.

130457,Radiofrequency ablation of an unusual vertebral body osteoid osteoma contiguous with the intervertebral disc.,2013,"During a pandemic, primary care is the first line of defense. It is able to reinforce public health messages, help patients manage at home, and identify those in need of hospital care. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care scrambled to rapidly transform itself and protect clinicians, staff, and patients while remaining connected to patients. Using the established public health framework for addressing a pandemic, we describe the actions primary care needs to take in a pandemic. Recommended actions are based on observed experiences of the authors' primary care practices and networks. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, tasks focused on promoting physical distancing and encouraging patients with suspected illness or exposure to self-quarantine. Testing was not available and contract tracing was not possible. As the pandemic spread, in-person care was converted to virtual care using telehealth. Practices remained connected to patients using registries to reach out to those at risk for infection, with uncontrolled chronic conditions, or were socially vulnerable. Practices managed most patients with suspected COVID-19 at home. As the pandemic decelerates, practices are now preparing to address the direct and indirect consequences-complications from COVID-19 infections, missed treatment for acute problems, inadequate prevention, uncontrolled chronic disease, mental illness, and greater social needs. Throughout, practices bore tremendous financial burden, laying off staff or even closing at a time when most needed. Primary care must learn from this experience and be ready for the next pandemic. Policymakers and payers cannot fail primary care during their next time of need.","Krist, Alex H; DeVoe, Jennifer E; Cheng, Anthony; Ehrlich, Thomas; Jones, Samuel M",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661037/,1

The preparation was realized by a simple two-step temperature-programmed process without heating operation. The obtained polymeric sub-microsphere exhibited monodisperse and regular spherical structure with uniform particle size distribution of 220-320 nm accounting for 94%. The prominent adsorption capacity of the polymeric sub-microsphere for antioxidants was demonstrated and attributed to the synergistic effect of the cladding interaction with the π-electron rich cavity and hydrophilic interaction with terminal hydroxyl on pillar[5]arene. Then the pillar[5]arene sub-microsphere was packed into a micro-column to realize effective on-line enrichment of antioxidants coupling with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The flow rate of extraction and desorption solvent, clean-up and desorption volume were assessed to optimize the method. The method showed wide linear ranges with R2 greater than 0.9926, low limits of detection (0.030-0.20 μg/L) and limits of quantification (0.10-0.67 μg/L).

Correspondingly, the present burden of diabetes among patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty is significant and rising. Diabetes as a chronic condition is a well-established risk factor for complication after total joint arthroplasty. A growing body of evidence also indicates that hyperglycemia in the perioperative period, and not the diagnosis of diabetes alone, is similarly associated with increased complication risk. As a result, a coordinated approach to preoperative screening and optimization, combined with judicious perioperative glycemic control, may present an opportunity to improve outcomes, reduce complications, and avoid complication-related costs for patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty.","Stryker, Louis S",The Journal of arthroplasty,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2016.02.084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27118352/,1

In response, the Association of Postdoctoral Programs in Clinical Neuropsychology (APPCN) launched a multisite didactic initiative (MDI). This manuscript describes the development and implementation of the MDI and presents findings from a recently conducted online survey concerning MDI participation.Methods: Faculty and trainees at APPCN member programs were recruited to complete the MDI survey, administered using the Qualtrics platform, through email announcements and via website link and on-screen quick response code shared at online didactic sessions. The MDI survey instrument was designed to capture basic demographics and professional role; information regarding level of site participation, benefits of participation, barriers to participation, online conference platform(s) used, and interest in continued participation; as well as anxiety and work engagement ratings.Results: The response rate was estimated to be 21-29%. Transition to videoconferencing for didactics was noted by 80% due to Covid-19, with 17% of respondents experiencing cancellation or reduction in didactic activities. About 79% endorsed that participation in MDI activities was always or nearly always beneficial. Barriers to participation included not having time, difficulty accessing didactic information, and not knowing about the MDI. Interestingly, trainees at nonparticipating sites reported greater anxiety than trainees at participating sites.Conclusion: It is hoped that these findings will inform future efforts to develop and implement online training activities. The benefits reported by respondents suggest that this work is warranted, while reported barriers to participation identify areas for improvement.","Domen, Christopher H; Collins, Robert L; Davis, Jeremy J",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1785013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615854/,1

The present article describes a situational assessment of public health nutrition practice in Canada that will be used to guide future workforce development efforts. METHODS A situational assessment is a planning approach that considers strengths and opportunities as well as needs and challenges, and emphasizes stakeholder participation. This situational assessment consisted of four components: a systematic review of literature on public health nutrition workforce issues; key informant interviews; a PEEST (political, economic, environmental, social, technological) factor analysis; and a consensus meeting. FINDINGS Information gathered from these sources identified key nutrition and health concerns of the population; the need to define public health nutrition practice, roles and functions; demand for increased training, education and leadership opportunities; inconsistent qualification requirements across the country; and the desire for a common vision among practitioners. CONCLUSIONS Findings of the situational assessment were used to create a three-year public health nutrition workforce development strategy. Specific objectives of the strategy are to define public health nutrition practice in Canada, develop competencies, collaborate with other disciplines, and begin to establish a new professional group or leadership structure to promote and enhance public health nutrition practice. The process of conducting the situational assessment not only provided valuable information for planning purposes, but also served as an effective mechanism for engaging stakeholders and building consensus.","Fox, Ann; Chenhall, Cathy; Traynor, Marie; Scythes, Cindy; Bellman, Jane",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980007001516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18194588/,1

Both diagnoses are associated with sleep problems. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates overlaps and distinctions in objective sleep parameters based on diagnosis (PTD-only, PTD + ADHD, and ADHD-only). METHODS Databases were searched to identify studies with objective sleep measures in each population. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random effects model. RESULTS Polysomnography was the only measure included in all three groups. Twenty studies met final inclusion criteria, combining PTD-only (N = 108), PTD + ADHD (N = 79), and ADHD-only (N = 316). Compared to controls (N = 336), PTD-only and PTD + ADHD groups had significantly lower sleep efficiency and higher sleep onset latency. PTD + ADHD also had significantly increased time in bed and total sleep time. No significant differences were observed between ADHD-only groups and controls. DISCUSSION Different sleep profiles appear to characterise each population. PTD + ADHD was associated with more pronounced differences. Further research is required to elucidate disorder-specific sleep problems, ensuring appropriate identification and monitoring of sleep in clinical settings.","Keenan, Lisa; Sherlock, Clara; Bramham, Jessica; Downes, Michelle",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33766675/,1

132884,Controversies in nephrologic covidology.,2020-12-31,"OBJECTIVES Essential workers in the United States need access to health care services for preventive care and for diagnosis and treatment of illnesses (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] or other infectious or chronic diseases) to remain healthy and continue working during a pandemic. This study evaluated access to health care services among selected essential workers. METHODS We used the most recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2017-2018, to estimate the prevalence of 4 measures of health care access (having health insurance, being able to afford to see a doctor when needed, having a personal health care provider, and having a routine checkup in the past year) by broad and detailed occupation group among 189 208 adults aged 18-64. RESULTS Of all occupations studied, workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations were most likely to have no health insurance (46.4%). Personal care aides were most likely to have been unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost (29.3%). Construction laborers were most likely to lack a personal health care provider (51.1%) and to have not had a routine physical checkup in the past year (50.6%). Compared with workers in general, workers in 3 broad occupation groups-food preparation and serving; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; and construction trades-had significantly lower levels of health care access for all 4 measures. CONCLUSION Lack of health insurance and underinsurance were common among subsets of essential workers. Limited access to health care might decrease essential workers' access to medical testing and needed care and hinder their ability to address underlying conditions, thereby increasing their risk of severe outcomes from some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Improving access to health care for all workers, including essential workers, is critical to ensure workers' health and workforce stability.","Boal, Winifred L; Li, Jia; Silver, Sharon R",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354921996688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33715502/,1
132995,Inhibition of CX3C receptor 1-mediated autophagy in macrophages alleviates pulmonary fibrosis in hyperoxic lung injury.,2020-08-15,"BACKGROUND Disparities in access to colorectal cancer care are multifactorial and are affected by socioeconomic elements. Uninsured and Medicaid patients present with advanced stage disease and have worse outcomes compared with similar privately insured patients. Safety net hospitals are a major care provider to this vulnerable population. Few studies have evaluated outcomes for safety net hospitals compared with private institutions in colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare demographics, screening rates, presentation stage, and survival rates between a safety net hospital and a tertiary care center. DESIGN Comparative review of patients at 2 institutions in the same metropolitan area were conducted. SETTINGS The study included colorectal cancer care delivered either at 1 safety net hospital or 1 private tertiary care center in the same city from 2010 to 2016. PATIENTS A total of 350 patients with colorectal cancer from each hospital were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Overall survival across hospital systems was measured. RESULTS The safety net hospital had significantly more uninsured and Medicaid patients (46% vs 13%; p < 0.001) and a significantly lower median household income than the tertiary care center ($39,299 vs $49,741; p < 0.0001). At initial presentation, a similar percentage of patients at each hospital presented with stage IV disease (26% vs 20%; p = 0.06). For those undergoing resection, final pathologic stage distribution was similar across groups (p = 0.10). After a comparable median follow-up period (26.6 mo for safety net hospital vs 29.2 mo for tertiary care center), log-rank test for overall survival favored the safety net hospital (p = 0.05); disease-free survival was similar between hospitals (p = 0.40). LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective review, reporting from medical charts. CONCLUSIONS Our results support the value of safety net hospitals for providing quality colorectal cancer care, with survival and recurrence outcomes equivalent or improved compared with a local tertiary care center. Because safety net hospitals can provide equivalent outcomes despite socioeconomic inequalities and financial constraints, emphasis should be focused on ensuring that adequate funding for these institutions continues.

METHODS A cross-sectional study in the waiting room area of PED at Santo Antonio Children's Hospital, Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil. The room air samples were collected with a portable cyclone sampler (Coriolis®), twice a day (8 a.m. and 8 p.m.), during 5 consecutive weekdays, during two seasons, fall and spring (20 samples), in 2016. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human adenovirus, human bocavirus, and Bordetella pertussis. The PED provides care to an average of 6000 patients per month and the age of patients ranges from 1 month to 17 years old. It is waiting area has 645 ft square. RESULTS Genetic material from pathogens was detected in 12 out of 20 samples (60%). In 5 samples, more than one pathogen of respiratory virus was identified. Human adenovirus was the most frequent pathogen (n = 9/52%), followed by Bordetella pertussis (n = 4/24%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2/12%) and human bocavirus (n = 2/12%). Season and number of people in the waiting room were not associated with the presence of genetic material from pathogens.

Data were lacking on the clinical characteristics of the infections caused by this virus. METHODS Using medical charts, we collected data on 111 patients with laboratory-confirmed avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) infection through May 10, 2013. RESULTS Of the 111 patients we studied, 76.6% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 27.0% died. The median age was 61 years, and 42.3% were 65 years of age or older; 31.5% were female. A total of 61.3% of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition. Fever and cough were the most common presenting symptoms. On admission, 108 patients (97.3%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidation were the typical radiologic findings. Lymphocytopenia was observed in 88.3% of patients, and thrombocytopenia in 73.0%. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in 108 patients (97.3%) at a median of 7 days after the onset of illness. The median times from the onset of illness and from the initiation of antiviral therapy to a negative viral test result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay were 11 days (interquartile range, 9 to 16) and 6 days (interquartile range, 4 to 7), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of a coexisting medical condition was the only independent risk factor for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (odds ratio, 3.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 9.70; P=0.02).

In immune cells, this response is characterized, amongst others, by the synthesis of restriction factors, a class of proteins whose role is to inhibit viral replication. Among them, the proteins of the APOBEC3 (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing Enzyme Catalytic polypeptide-like 3 or A3) family are major antiviral factors that target a wide range of viruses. One of their targets is the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1): the deaminase activity of some A3 proteins converts a fraction of cytidines of the viral genome into uridines, impairing its expression. Nevertheless, HIV-1 counteracts A3 proteins thanks to its Vif protein, which inhibits them by hijacking several cellular mechanisms. Besides, APOBEC3 proteins help maintaining the genome integrity by inhibiting retroelements but they also contribute to carcinogenesis, as it is the case for A3A and A3B, two major factors in this process. The large range of A3 activities, combined with recent studies showing their implication in the regulation of emerging viruses (Zika, SARS-CoV-2), allow A3 and their viral partners to be considered as therapeutic areas.","Verriez, Cédric; Marquet, Roland; Paillart, Jean-Christophe; Stupfler, Benjamin",Virologie,https://doi.org/10.1684/vir.2020.0870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441290/,1

135624,Adjunctive use of eptifibatide for complication management during elective neuroendovascular procedures.,2013,"While COVID-19 vaccine distribution has addressed vulnerabilities related to age and co-morbidities, there is a need to ensure vaccination of cancer patients receiving experimental and routine treatment, where interruption of treatment by infection is likely to result in inferior outcomes. Among cancer patients, those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or adjuvant chemotherapy (Adj chemo) for early breast cancer (EBC) are at particularly high risk for inferior outcomes, in part because optimal timing of chemotherapy is essential for promoting distant disease-free survival (DDFS). COVID-19 data from the ongoing multicenter I-SPY 2 trial of NAC for EBC provides a window into the magnitude of the problem of treatment interruption, not only for the trial itself but also for routine Adj chemo. In the I-SPY 2 trial 4.5% of patients had disruption of therapy by COVID-19 prior to wide vaccine availability, suggesting that nationally up to 5,700 EBC patients were at risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection in 2020. To address this problem, vaccine education and public engagement are essential to overcome hesitancy, while equity of distribution is needed to address access. To accomplish these goals, health care organizations (HCOs) need to not only call out disinformation but engage the public with vaccine education and find common ground for vaccine acceptance, while partnering with state/local governments to improve efficiency of vaccine distribution. These approaches are important to improving trial access and to reducing susceptibility to COVID-19, as the pandemic could continue to impact access to clinical trials and routine cancer treatment.","Potter, David A; Thomas, Alexandra; Rugo, Hope S",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-21-1133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34108186/,1

135888,Application of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma.,2017,"BACKGROUND Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a potential life-threatening complication. Therefore, early identification and treatment of patients at risk is essential. CHS can be predicted by a doubling of postoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD)-derived mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity (V(mean)) compared to preoperative values. However, in approximately 15% of CEA patients, an adequate TCD signal cannot be obtained due to an insufficient temporal bone window. Moreover, the use of TCD requires specifically skilled personnel. An alternative and promising technique of noninvasive cerebral monitoring is relative frontal lobe oxygenation (rSO(2)) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which offers on-line information about cerebral oxygenation without the need for specialized personnel. In this study, we assess whether NIRS and perioperative TCD are related to the onset CHS following CEA. METHODS Patients who underwent CEA under general anesthesia and had a sufficient TCD window were prospectively included. The V(mean) and rSO(2) measured before induction of anesthesia were compared to measurements performed in the first postoperative hour (ΔV(mean), ΔrSO(2), respectively). Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between ΔV and ΔrSO(2) and the occurrence of CHS. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values. Diagnostic values were shown as positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV). RESULTS In total, 151 patients were included, of which 7 patients developed CHS. The ΔV(mean) and ΔrSO(2) differed between CHS and non-CHS patients (median, interquartile range), i.e. 74% (67-103) versus 16% (-2 to 41), p = 0.001, and 7% (4-15) versus 1% (-6 to 7), p = 0.009, respectively. The mean arterial blood pressure did not change. Postoperative ΔV(mean) and ΔrSO(2) were significantly related to the occurrence of CHS [odds ratio (OR) 1.40 (95% CI 1.02-1.93) per 30% increase in V(mean) and OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.11-2.99) per 5% increase in rSO(2)]. ROC curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.88 (p = 0.001) for ΔV(mean) and an optimal cutoff value of 67% increase (PPV 38% and NPV 99%), and an area under the curve of 0.79 (p = 0.009) for ΔrSO(2) and an optimal cutoff value of 3% rSO(2) increase (PPV 11% and NPV 100%). The combination of both monitoring techniques provided a PPV of 58% and an NPV of 99%. CONCLUSIONS Both TCD and NIRS measurements can be used to safely identify patients not at risk of developing CHS. It appears that NIRS is a good alternative when a TCD signal cannot be obtained.","Pennekamp, C W A; Immink, R V; den Ruijter, H M; Kappelle, L J; Ferrier, C M; Bots, M L; Buhre, W F; Moll, F L; de Borst, G J",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000343229; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23146912/,1

135913,Radiofrequency ablation of non-small-cell carcinoma of the lung under real-time FDG PET CT guidance.,2011,"Although river restoration has been increasingly implemented to restore water quality in ecosystems, its effect on the removal of emerging pollutant antibiotics, and their resultant influence on microbial community structure and functions in river water is still unclear. This study investigated the changes of antibiotics, antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), microbial communities, and their spatial distributions in a megacity river before and after river restoration. Results indicated that although the restoration activities including riverbed dredging, riverbank hardening, sewage and storm water separation and re-pipelining improved water quality such as by decreasing total phosphorus (TP) content from 4.60 ± 6.38 mg/L in 2018 to 0.98 ± 0.44 mg/L in 2020, the antibiotic concentrations in river water increased. Total antibiotic concentrations in the water samples were higher in 2020 (506.89-6952.50 ng/L) than those in 2018 (137.93-1751.51 ng/L), likely caused by increased usage of antibiotics in 2020 for COVID-19 treatment. The spatial distributions of antibiotics were less varied likely as a result of less retardation and fast mixing during antibiotic transport. The result also found that the abundance of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, and their correlations with ARGs increased. The spatial distributions of ARGs and microbial communities became less varied in the river water, consistent with the antibiotic variations before and after river restoration. Physicochemical changes such as decreased TP and dissolved organic carbon content may also be a factor. The results indicated that the current river restoration efforts were not effective in removing antibiotics, and implied that further studies are needed to investigate their subsequent transformation and transport, and to assess their risks to the health of ecosystems.","Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Cheng; Lian, Keting; Ke, Dongfang; Xie, Ting; Liu, Chongxuan",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34134371/,1
135958,"A Real-World Study Comparing Various Antimicrobial Regimens for Bloodstream Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Gram-Negative Bacilli in a Tertiary Hospital, Shanghai, China, from 2010 to 2017.",2020,"BACKGROUND The long incubation period and asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 present considerable challenges for health-care institutions. The identification of infected individuals is vital to prevent the spread of illness to staff and other patients as well as to identify those who may be at risk for disease-related complications. This is particularly relevant with the resumption of elective orthopaedic surgery around the world. We report the results of a universal testing protocol for COVID-19 in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the coronavirus pandemic and to describe the postoperative course of asymptomatic patients who were positive for COVID-19. METHODS A retrospective review of adult operative cases between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, at an orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City was performed. Initially, a screening questionnaire consisting of relevant signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) or exposure dictated the need for nasopharyngeal swab real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for all admitted patients. An institutional policy change occurred on April 5, 2020, that indicated nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing for all orthopaedic admissions. Screening and testing data for COVID-19 as well as relevant imaging, laboratory values, and postoperative complications were reviewed for all patients. RESULTS From April 5, 2020, to April 24, 2020, 99 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 prior to their planned orthopaedic surgical procedure. Of the 12.1% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 58.3% were asymptomatic. Three asymptomatic patients developed postoperative hypoxia, with 2 requiring intubation. The negative predictive value of using the signs and symptoms of disease to predict a negative test result was 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.0% to 97.1%). Including a positive chest radiographic finding as a screening criterion did not improve the negative predictive value of screening (92.5% [95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%]). CONCLUSIONS A protocol for universal testing of all orthopaedic surgery admissions at 1 hospital in New York City during a 3-week period revealed a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Importantly, the majority of these patients were asymptomatic. Using chest radiography did not significantly improve the negative predictive value of screening. These results have important implications as hospitals anticipate the resumption of elective surgical procedures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level IV.

136255,Impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on the management of other communicable diseases.,2020-05-01,"As one of the earliest surgeries applying knotless barbed suture, the minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (MIRP) was reported to have various effects on the patients and the surgeons. This study reviewed the available evidence about the efficacy and safety of barbed sutures in MIRP. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Register of Clinical Studies, PubMed, and Embase to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies addressing the application of barbed sutures and conventional sutures in MIRP (until August 2016). Quality assessment was performed according to Cochrane recommendations. The data were analyzed using Review Manager (Version 5.3), and sensitivity analysis was performed by sequentially omitting each study. A total of 12 studies, including three RCTs (low to moderate risk of bias, 211 patients) and nine cohort studies (low to moderate risk of bias, 698 patients), fulfilled the study criteria. The pooling of trials did not show statistical difference. Pooling data of cohort studies showed that suture time [mean difference (MD) = -8.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -12.60 to -4.43, p < 0.0001] and length of hospital stay (MD = -0.96, 95% CI = -1.80 to -0.11, p = 0.03) were significantly shorter in the barbed group. Results of continence rate varied according to different studies. Subgroup analysis by type of MIRP suggested that patients who underwent barbed suture during robot-assisted surgeries had a shorter hospital stay (MD = -1.13, 95% CI = -1.82 to -0.45, p = 0.001). During the laparoscopic surgery, patients in the barbed suture group had fewer postoperative complications [odds ratio = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.08-0.98, p = 0.05). However, more evidence is needed to validate this state-of-the-art technology.","Lin, Yi-Fei; Lai, Si-Ke; Liu, Qin-Yu; Liao, Bang-Hua; Huang, Jin; Du, Liang; Wang, Kun-Jie; Li, Hong",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kjms.2016.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28254112/,1

Haemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal disorder which has symptoms of bleeding, prolapse, pain, thrombosis, mucus discharge, and pruritus. Haemorrhoidectomy is one of most frequently performed anorectal operation worldwide. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the LigaSure tissue sealing device, Harmonic Scalpel and conventional MM open haemorrhoidectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty-nine patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic grade three or grade four haemorrhoidal disease, from July 2011 to December 2011 were recruited for the study. Patients were prospectively randomized to LigaSure, Harmonic Scalpel and conventional haemorrhoidectomy. Patients were evaluated on the basis of the mean operative time, postoperative pain, day of discharge, early and late complications. RESULTS Each group has twenty-three patients. Ten (14.5 %) were female and fifty-nine (85.5 %) were male. Mean age were 44.5 ± 10.8 for LigaSure group, 39.5±14.4 for Harmonic Scalpel group and 39.8 ± 13.6 for conventional haemorrhoidectomy group. Mean operative time was 12.6 ± 2.9 for LigaSure group, 12.6 ± 2.5 for Harmonic Scalpel group and 22.3 ± 4.5 for conventional haemorrhoidectomy group. Postoperative pain and required analgesic dose were significantly lower for conventional haemorrhoidectomy. Wound healing was also more rapid in conventional haemorrhoidectomy than both LigaSure and Harmonic Scalpel. CONCLUSIONS Lateral heat dissipation of energy based cautery such as Harmonel Scalpel and LigaSure is considerably high when compared with conventional methods. More thermal damage which is generated on tissue seems to be the reason for increased degree of postoperative pain and delay in wound healing.","Peker, Kemal; Inal, Abdullah; Güllü, Huriye; Gül, Düriye; Sahin, Murat; Ozcan, Ayca Dumanli; Kılıç, Kemal",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,https://doi.org/10.5812/ircmj.10180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24349747/,1

We combine an online panel survey with mobile tracking data to measure the actual usage of Germany's official contact tracing app and reveal higher uptake rates among respondents with an increased risk of severe illness, but lower rates among those with a heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19. Using a randomized intervention, we show that informative and motivational video messages have very limited effect on uptake. However, findings from a second intervention suggest that even small monetary incentives can strongly increase uptake and help make digital contact tracing a more effective tool.","Munzert, Simon; Selb, Peter; Gohdes, Anita; Stoetzer, Lukas F; Lowe, Will",Nature human behaviour,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-01044-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479505/,1

METHODS Retrospective analysis of electronic notes of children referred through NHSP from 2016 to 2019. Key points in the assessment pathway from referral to switch-on were assessed. RESULTS Of the 46 referrals, 44 went on to have CI surgery. Median age at CI surgery was 15 months (interquartile range (IQR) 13 to 17 months). Only 5% of referrals were implanted before the age of 12 months. Delayed referral and the presence of otitis media with effusion (OME) were associated with delayed implantation. The median period of monitoring for OME was 48 days (IQR 20 to 93 days), with a natural resolution rate of only 11%. The median time from surgery to switch-on was 5 weeks (IQR 4.1 to 5.4 weeks). CONCLUSION Achieving implantation prior to the age of 12 months for NHSP referrals can be challenging for a variety of reasons. The delays in the system and the steps that our implant programme has taken to address these will be highlighted.","Mathew, Rajeev; Bajo, Fernando Rodriguez; Hatton, Nicola; Buttfield, Louise; Gowrnishankar, Shravan; Vickers, Deborah; Donnelly, Neil; Tysome, James; Bance, Manohar; Axon, Patrick",Cochlear implants international,https://doi.org/10.1080/14670100.2021.1948163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232110/,1

In this work, three ionic paraffin emulsions (IPEs) (i.e., anionic paraffin emulsion (APE), cationic paraffin emulsion (CPE), and non-ionic paraffin emulsion (NPE), respectively) were prepared. The effects of incorporation of IPEs into cement-based materials on hydrophobicity improvement were investigated by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission and reflection polarizing microscope (TRPM) tests and correlation analyses, as well as by compressive strength, impermeability, and apparent contact angle tests. Finally, the optimal type and the recommended dose of IPEs were suggested. Results reveal that the impermeability pressure and apparent contact angle value of cement-based materials incorporated with IPEs are significantly higher than those of the control group. Thus, the hydrophobicity of cement-based materials is significantly improved. However, IPEs adversely affect the compressive strength of cement-based materials. The apparent contact angle mainly affects impermeability. These three IPEs impart hydrophobicity to cement-based materials. In addition, the optimal NPE dose can significantly improve the hydrophobicity of cement-based materials.","Huo, Jinyang; Wang, Zhenjun; Guo, Haoyan; Wei, Yongfeng",Materials,https://doi.org/10.3390/ma13143230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698442/,1

BACKGROUND DATA Earlier studies on cytokines in GCF in RA patients have not given clear results. METHODS In a population-based cross-sectional study of patients ≥61 years of age, 233 RA patients were identified. 132 (57%) dentate RA patients participated. All participants received rheumatological and dental examinations, and had a panoramic radiograph taken. GCF was sampled on each patient. Interleukins 1-β (IL-1β), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and chemokines RANTES/CCL5, eotaxin and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) were analyzed in GCF. These cytokines were stratified for periodontitis, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) status. Binary logistic regression analyses with periodontitis as outcome were performed adjusting for the above mentioned confounding factors including anti-rheumatic medication, disease duration and the cytokine in question. RESULTS Periodontitis was diagnosed in 80/132 (61%) of study participants. The 110 RA patients not participating were older, had a higher mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), had a higher mean DAS28ESR (Disease Activity Score 28 using ESR) and were less often on biologic treatment. Only RANTES was associated with periodontitis (p = .049, OR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.002) in the binary logistic regression analyses.

Now is a critical moment to ask how health promotion might become more responsive to and representative of people's daily realities. Also how it can become a more inclusive partner in, and collaborative conduit of, knowledge-one capable of both informing intellects and transforming hearts. It needs to feel the pulse of the ""fierce urgency of now,"" and perhaps nothing can reveal this pulse more than the creative power of art-especially poetry. Drawing from critical and Black feminist theory, I use commentary in prose to conceptualize and call for an epistemically just health promotion guided by poetry as praxis-not just as method. I posit that, as praxis rooted in lived realities, poetry becomes experiential excavation and illumination; a practice of community, communion, and solidarity; a site and source of healing; and a space to create new narratives of health to forge new paths toward its promotion. I accordingly suggest a need to view and value poetry as a critical scholarship format to advance health promotion knowledge, discourse, and action toward a more humanized pursuit-and narrative-of health equity.","Petteway, Ryan J",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839921999048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942645/,1
138715,Spirometry: A practical lifespan predictor of global health and chronic respiratory and non-respiratory diseases.,2021-05-17,"INTRODUCTION Approximately 400 000 Americans and 36 000 Canadians undergo cardiac surgery annually, and up to 56% will develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). The primary aim of this study is to explore the association of pain-related beliefs and gender-based pain expectations on the development of CPSP. Secondary goals are to: (A) explore risk factors for poor functional status and patient-level cost of illness from a societal perspective up to 12 months following cardiac surgery; and (B) determine the impact of CPSP on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) borne by cardiac surgery, in addition to the incremental cost for one additional QALY gained, among those who develop CPSP compared with those who do not. METHODS AND ANALYSES In this prospective cohort study, 1250 adults undergoing cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting and open-heart procedures, will be recruited over a 3-year period. Putative risk factors for CPSP will be captured prior to surgery, at postoperative day 3 (in hospital) and day 30 (at home). Outcome data will be collected via telephone interview at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. We will employ generalised estimating equations to model the primary (CPSP) and secondary outcomes (function and cost) while adjusting for prespecified model covariates. QALYs will be estimated by converting data from the Short Form-12 (version 2) to a utility score. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This protocol has been approved by the responsible bodies at each of the hospital sites, and study enrolment began May 2015. We will disseminate our results through CardiacPain.Net, a web-based knowledge dissemination platform, presentation at international conferences and publications in scientific journals.

139320,Minimising the environmental impact of inhaled therapies.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUNDS/AIMS Postoperative diaphragmatic hernia, following liver resection, is a rare complication. METHODS Data of patients who underwent major hepatectomy for liver tumors, between 2011 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The literature was searched for studies reporting the occurrence of diaphragmatic hernia following liver resection. RESULTS Diaphragmatic hernia developed in 2.3% of patients (3/131) with a median delay of 14 months (4-31 months). One patient underwent emergency laparotomy for bowel obstruction and two patients underwent elective diaphragmatic hernia repair. At last follow-up, no recurrences were observed. Fourteen studies including 28 patients were identified in the literature search (donor hepatectomy, n=11: hepatectomy for liver tumors, n=17). Diaphragmatic hernia was repaired emergently in 42.9% of cases and digestive resection was necessary in 28.5% of the cases. One patient died 3 months after hepatectomy, secondary to sepsis, from a segment of small bowel that perforated into the diaphragmatic hernia. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, diaphragmatic hernia should be considered as an important complication, especially in living donor liver transplant patients. Diaphragmatic hernia should be repaired surgically, even for asymptomatic patients.","Esposito, Francesco; Lim, Chetana; Salloum, Chady; Osseis, Michael; Lahat, Eylon; Compagnon, Philippe; Azoulay, Daniel",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,https://doi.org/10.14701/ahbps.2017.21.3.114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28989997/,1

This study focuses on external validity, clinical relevance, and the patients' perspective. Accordingly, the single-incision multiport/single port laparoscopic abdominal surgery (SILAP) study will supplement the existing evidence, which does not currently allow evidence-based surgical decision making. METHODS The SILAP study is an international prospective multicenter observational quality study. Mortality, morbidity, complications during surgery, complications postoperatively, patient characteristics, and technical aspects will be monitored. We expect more than 100 surgical centers to participate with 5000 patients with abdominal single-incision surgery during the study period. RESULTS Funding was obtained in 2012. Enrollment began on January 01, 2013, and will be completed on December 31, 2018. As of January 2016, 2119 patients have been included, 106 German centers are registered, and 27 centers are very active (>5 patients per year). CONCLUSIONS This prospective multicenter observational quality study will provide a relevant dataset reflecting the feasibility and safety of single-incision surgery. An international enlargement and recruitment of centers outside of Germany is meaningful.

140350,Alternative diets among adolescents: facts or fads?,2021-02-16,"Understanding infection dynamics in animal hosts is fundamental to managing spillover and emergence of zoonotic infections. Hendra virus is endemic in Australian pteropodid bat populations and can be lethal to horses and humans. However, we know little about the factors driving Hendra virus prevalence in resevoir bat populations, making spillover difficult to predict. We use Hendra virus prevalence data collected from 13 000 pooled bat urine samples across space and time to determine if pulses of prevalence are periodic and synchronized across sites. We also test whether site-specific precipitation and temperature affect the amplitude of the largest annual prevalence pulses. We found little evidence for a periodic signal in Hendra virus prevalence. Although the largest amplitude pulses tended to occur over winter, pulses could also occur in other seasons. We found that Hendra virus prevalence was weakly synchronized across sites over short distances, suggesting that prevalence is driven by local-scale effects. Finally, we found that drier conditions in previous seasons and the abundance of Pteropus alecto were positively correlated with the peak annual values of Hendra virus prevalence. Our results suggest that in addition to seasonal effects, bat density and local climatic conditions interact to drive Hendra virus infection dynamics.","Páez, D J; Giles, J; McCallum, H; Field, H; Jordan, D; Peel, A J; Plowright, R K",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268817002138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28942750/,1
140509,"Safety and efficacy of aneurysm treatment with WEB in the cumulative population of three prospective, multicenter series.",2018,"Objectives To evaluate the role of hospital setting on outcomes in open airway surgery by comparing patients who underwent surgery (cricotracheal resection [CTR] or tracheal resection [TR]) at a publicly funded county hospital vs a private university hospital. Methods Retrospective chart review of patients undergoing CTR or TR at two institutions; a private university hospital and a publicly funded county hospital from September 2014 to September 2019. Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, total time to discharge, minor and major complications were the primary endpoints. Significance was defined as a P-value less than .05. Results There were a total of 43 patients (17 county, 26 university) who had CTR or TR during the study period. Length of stay outcomes was reported as mean length of stay ± SD. There was a significant difference in ICU stay at the county hospital (7.17 (±5.36 days) compared to the university hospital (2.52 ± 1.85 days, P < .003) and a nearly significant total length of stay difference at the county hospital (12.4 ± 9.06 days) compared to the university hospital (7.84 ± 4 days, P < .072) There was overall a low incidence of complications but slightly more in the county compared to the university population. Conclusion Patients who underwent open airway surgery at the county hospital were more likely to have a longer ICU stay and slight increase in complications despite having a lower ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) classification and younger age. These outcomes are multifactorial and may be related to poorer access to primary care preoperatively leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment, poorly controlled or undiagnosed medical comorbidities, and differences in hospital resources.

However, the conventional synthetic approaches suffer from low yields, complex procedures, and toxic chemicals. In this work, we demonstrate a one-step microwave-assisted approach to prepare CsPbX3 NCs. The homogeneous heating and rapid temperature increment of microwave preparation facilitate the growth of CsPbX3 NCs, producing the NCs with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 90%, narrow emission full-width at half-maximum, and emission color tunable from blue to red. By optimizing the preparation conditions of the microwave-assisted approach, CsPbX3 NCs with cation- and halide anion-controlled emission properties, tunable reaction rate, and enhanced stability are prepared. Light-emitting diode (LED) prototypes are further fabricated by employing the as-prepared CsPbX3 NCs as the color conversion materials on commercially available 365 nm GaN LED chips.","Liu, Huiwen; Wu, Zhennan; Gao, Hang; Shao, Jieren; Zou, Haoyang; Yao, Dong; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Hao; Yang, Bai",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b14677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200265/,1

We describe a previously unreported case of a large, irregular, carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm that was treated with a Willis covered stent. An immediate angiogram after the procedure showed complete occlusion of the aneurysm. However, a six-month follow-up angiogram demonstrated contrast media filling of the aneurysm neck. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a recurrent aneurysm treated with a Willis covered stent because of a membrane partially isolated with the stent. This case suggests that an aneurysm that is treated with a Willis covered stent might recanalise, and the risk of aneurysm rupture persists when the membrane of the stent is isolated with the stent. Therefore, follow-up angiography is necessary, even if an immediate angiogram shows complete aneurysm occlusion. Long-term follow-up is required, and the final outcome of such a case is still unknown.","Tian, Zhongbin; Mu, Shiqing; Li, Wenqiang; Zhu, Wei; Zhang, Ying; Yang, Xinjian; Liu, Jian","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919854184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159630/,1
140864,Flow-diversion for ophthalmic segment aneurysms.,2015,"Continuous electronic monitoring of patient respiratory status frequently includes PetCO2 (end tidal CO2), RR (respiration rate), SpO2 (arterial oxygen saturation), and PR (pulse rate). Interpreting and integrating these vital signs as numbers or waveforms is routinely done by anesthesiologists and intensivists but is challenging for clinicians in low acuity areas such as medical wards, where continuous electronic respiratory monitoring is becoming more common place. We describe a heuristic algorithm that simplifies the interpretation of these four parameters in assessing a patient's respiratory status, the Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI). The IPI algorithm is a mathematical model combining SpO2, RR, PR, and PetCO2 into a single value between 1 and 10 that summarizes the adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation at that point in time. The algorithm was designed using a fuzzy logic inference model to incorporate expert clinical opinions. The algorithm was verified by comparison to experts' scoring of clinical scenarios. The validity of the index was tested in a retrospective analysis of continuous SpO2, RR, PR, and PetCO2 readings obtained from 523 patients in a variety of clinical settings. IPI correlated well with expert interpretation of the continuous respiratory data (R = 0.83, p <<< 0.001), with agreement of -0.5 ± 1.4. Receiver operating curves analysis resulted in high levels of sensitivity (ranging from 0.83 to 1.00), and corresponding specificity (ranging from 0.96 to 0.74), based on IPI thresholds 3-6. The IPI reliably interpreted the respiratory status of patients in multiple areas of care using off-line continuous respiratory data. Further prospective studies are required to evaluate IPI in real time in clinical settings.","Ronen, M; Weissbrod, R; Overdyk, F J; Ajizian, S",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9851-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26961501/,1

The hierarchical structure of the fibrous paper, modified with the synthesized Au@Ag core-shells (Au@Ag) gave strong SERS signalling, enabling us to evaluate the community-wide prevalence of methamphetamine in wastewater treatment plants within Beijing. We show that, when normalized for the daily flow of the wastewater treatment plants and for population density, higher mass loads of drugs are generally found in sewage influent from urban areas, implying greater local methamphetamine usage than that in less populated areas. The user-friendly and disposable paper sensors demonstrate the applicability of rapid on-site illicit drug detection, illustrating the application to wastewater-based epidemiology, which has the potential to inform government agencies regarding societal interventions.","Mao, Kang; Yang, Zhugen; Zhang, Hua; Li, Xiqing; Cooper, Jonathan M",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161329/,1

We conducted a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene of Brazilian (BR) IBV isolates from a routinely vaccinated commercial flock of broiler breeders, obtained from clinical IB episodes that occurred in 24-, 46- and 62-week-old chickens. We also characterized the antigenicity, pathogenesis, tissue tropism and spreading of three IBV isolates by experimental infection of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and contact sentinel birds. The results reveal that the three IBV isolates mainly exhibited mutations in the hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the S1 gene and protein, but were phylogenetically and serologically closely related, belonging to lineage 11 of the GI genotype, the former BR genotype I. All three isolates caused persistent infection in broiler breeders reared in the field, despite high systemic anti-IBV antibody titres, and exhibited tropism and pathogenicity for the trachea and kidney after experimental infection in SPF chickens and contact birds. In conclusion, BR genotype I isolates of IBV evolve continuously during the productive cycle of persistently infected broiler breeders, causing outbreaks that are not impaired by the current vaccination programme with Massachusetts vaccine strains. In addition, the genetic alterations in the S1 gene of these isolates were not able to change their tissue tropism and pathogenicity, but did seem to negatively influence the effectiveness of the host immune responses against these viruses, and favour viral persistence.","Santos Fernando, Filipe; Coelho Kasmanas, Thaiane; Diniz Lopes, Priscila; da Silva Montassier, Maria de Fátima; Zanella Mores, Marcos Antônio; Casagrande Mariguela, Viviane; Pavani, Caren; Moreira Dos Santos, Romeu; Assayag, Mário Sérgio; Montassier, Helio José",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28895517/,1

142039,Reducing risks from coronavirus transmission in the home-the role of viral load.,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Alpha-2 agonists offer useful effects that make these drugs an interesting alternative for pharmacological premedication. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind study, effects of clonidine (150 microg orally), midazolam (7.5 mg orally) and placebo administered 60-90 min prior to estimated anaesthesia induction time were investigated in 60 healthy ASA I or II patients. All patients received dipotassiumchlorazepate the evening before surgery. At predefined time points, effects of premedication on bispectral index, sedation score and visual analogue scales for anxiety and pain, cognitive function and stress hormones were determined. RESULTS Administration of low-dose clonidine was associated with slightly lower bispectral index scores than a standard dose of midazolam or placebo. There were no significant differences in sedation score, visual analogue scale for anxiety and pain and cognitive function between treatment regimens. Clonidine, but not midazolam, reduced anaesthetic requirements for induction of anaesthesia and prevented an increase in heart rate as well as an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels during the preoperative period (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Clonidine administration did not delay postoperative recovery. CONCLUSION Clonidine augmented haemodynamic stability and partially blunted stress responses as determined by adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels. In addition, clonidine did not delay postoperative recovery. Therefore, surrogate parameters indicate that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine may be superior to midazolam in healthy individuals. Further studies have to confirm these results with regard to outcome parameters.","Paris, Andrea; Kaufmann, Markus; Tonner, Peter H; Renz, Philipp; Lemke, Thees; Ledowski, Thomas; Scholz, Jens; Bein, Berthold",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0b013e32832a0c7c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19367170/,1

This study (i) analyzes the impact of conventional wrist-ankle vs segmental technology and standing vs supine position on BIA equations and (ii) compares BIA validation against magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). SUBJECTS/METHODS One hundred and thirty-six healthy Caucasian adults (70 men, 66 women; age 40±12 years) were measured by a phase-sensitive multifrequency BIA (seca medical body composition analyzers 515 and 525). Multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to generate prediction equations. Accuracy was tested vs MRI or DXA in an independent multiethnic population. RESULTS Variance explained by segmental BIA equations ranged between 97% for total SMMMRI, 91-94% for limb SMMMRI and 80-81% for VAT with no differences between supine and standing position. When compared with segmental measurements using conventional wrist-ankle technology. the relationship between measured and predicted SMM was slightly deteriorated (r=0.98 vs r=0.99, P<0.05). Although BIA results correctly identified ethnic differences in muscularity and visceral adiposity, the comparison of bias revealed some ethnical effects on the accuracy of BIA equations. The differences between LSTDXA and SMMMRI at the arms and legs were sizeable and increased with increasing body mass index. CONCLUSIONS A high accuracy of phase-sensitive BIA was observed with no difference in goodness of fit between different positions but an improved prediction with segmental compared with conventional wrist-ankle measurement. A correction factor for certain ethnicities may be required. When compared with DXA MRI-based BIA equations are more accurate for predicting muscle mass.","Bosy-Westphal, A; Jensen, B; Braun, W; Pourhassan, M; Gallagher, D; Müller, M J",European journal of clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2017.27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327564/,1

More than 20% of myasthenic patients are refractory to conventional treatments (plasma exchange, IVIg, steroids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil). Rituximab (B-lymphocyte-depleting anti-CD20) and apheresis (double-filtration plasmapheresis [DFPP] and immunoadsorption [IA]) are interesting therapeutic alternatives. METHODS This monocentric pilot study included nine refractory myasthenic patients (March 2018 to May 2020) treated by DFPP and/or IA associated with rituximab (375 mg/m2 ). Clinical responses were assessed using the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) score. RESULTS Average age of patients was 53 ± 17 years. Gender ratio (M/F) was 3:6. The combination of apheresis and rituximab reduced median MGFA score from IV to II after 12 months of follow-up. Clinical improvement assessed by MGFA score was sustained in the long-term for all patients, during an average follow-up of 14 ± 9 months, allowing them to be self-sufficient and out sick-leave. The median number of apheresis sessions was 7 (5-30). The dose of prednisolone was reduced in two patients from 40 mg/d and 30 mg/d to 7.5 mg/d and 10 mg/d, respectively. It was stopped in a patient who was taking 30 mg/d. No infectious, bleeding, or thrombosis complications were noted.

142243,Periprocedural safety of aneurysm embolization with the Medina Coil System: the early human experience.,2016,"This study examined the contribution of muscle fiber orientation at different knee angles to regional activation identified with high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG). Monopolar HDsEMG signals were collected using a grid of 13 × 5 electrodes placed over the vastus medialis (VM). Intramuscular electrical stimulation was used to selectively activate two regions within VM. The distribution of EMG responses to stimulation was obtained by calculating the amplitude of the compound action potential for each channel; the position of the peak amplitude was tracked across knee angles to describe shifts of the active muscle regions under the electrodes. In a separate experiment, regional activation was investigated in 10 knee flexion-extension movements against a fixed resistance. Intramuscular stimulation of different VM regions resulted in clear differences in amplitude distribution along the columns of the electrode grid (P < 0.001); changes in knee angle resulted in consistent shifts along the rows (P < 0.01) and negligible shifts along the columns of the electrode grid. Regional VM activation was identified in dynamic movement, with distal shifts of the EMG distribution in the eccentric phase of the movement (P < 0.05) and at more flexed knee angles (P < 0.05). HDsEMG was used to describe regional activation across the VM that was not attributable to anatomic factors. Changes in muscle fiber orientation associated with knee joint angle mainly influence the amplitude distribution along the fiber direction. Future studies are needed to understand possible functional roles for regional activation within the VM in dynamic tasks.","Gallina, Alessio; Ivanova, Tanya D; Garland, S Jayne",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00050.2016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27365281/,1

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of LSG patients at the Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC). Data was collected from digitalized database. RESULTS Nine hundred eighty-four LSG cases were performed by three surgeons. Seventy-eight complications were observed (7.9%): 44 mild (4.5%) and 34 severe (3.4%). Over-sewing of staple line was performed in 689 cases (76.2%), and no SLR in 217 cases (24.0%) without significant impact on mild or severe early morbidity. Bougie size 36 Fr or smaller was used in 635 cases (73.0%) without significant differences in early complications compared to 235 cases (27.0%) with larger bougie. LSG, as revision bariatric surgery, was performed in 273 cases (27.7%). Concomitant removal of a gastric band was performed in 199 of these cases (72.9%). History of silastic ring vertical gastroplasty (SRVG) was recorded in 10 cases (1.0%). Previous bariatric surgery was a significant risk factor for early mild complications (OR = 1.14, p value = 0.02), but not for severe ones (OR = 0.79, p value = 0.09).

However, it has not been investigated extensively during anesthesia induction. The aim of the study is to evaluate tissue microcirculation during anesthesia induction. We hypothesized that during anesthesia induction, tissue microcirculation measured by vascular occlusion test might be enhanced with peripheral vasodilation during anesthesia induction. We conducted a prospective observational study of 50 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. During anesthesia induction, we measured and analyzed tissue oxygen saturation, vascular occlusion test, cerebral oximetry, forearm-minus-fingertip skin temperature gradients and hemodynamic data in order to evaluate microcirculation as related to alterations in peripheral vasodilation as reflected by increased Tforearm-finger thermal gradients. During anesthesia induction, recovery slope during vascular occlusion test and cerebral oxygen saturation increased from 4.0 (1.5) to 4.7 (1.3) % s(-1) (p = 0.02) and 64.0 (10.2) to 74.2 (9.2) % (p < 0.001), respectively. Forearm-minus-fingertip skin temperature gradients decreased from 1.9 (2.9) to -1.4 (2.2) °C (p < 0.001). There was an inverse correlation between changes in the skin temperature gradients and changes in cerebral oximetry (r = 0.33; p = 0.02). During anesthesia induction, blood pressure and forearm-minus-fingertip skin temperature gradients decrease while cerebral oximetry and vascular occlusion test recovery slope increase. These findings suggest that anesthesia induction increases tissue microcirculation with peripheral vasodilation.","Kim, Tae Kyong; Cho, Youn Joung; Min, Jeong Jin; Murkin, John M; Bahk, Jae-Hyon; Hong, Deok Man; Jeon, Yunseok",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9679-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25750016/,1
142541,A new era for stroke therapy: Integrating neurovascular protection with optimal reperfusion.,2018,"Leishmania donovani is the major cause of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), now recognized as the parasitic disease with the highest level of mortality second only to malaria. No human vaccine is currently available. A 36 kDa L. donovani nucleoside hydrolase (LdNH36) surface protein has been previously identified as a potential vaccine candidate antigen. Here we present data on the expression of LdNH36 in Pichia pastoris and its purification at the 20 L scale to establish suitability for future pilot scale manufacturing. To improve efficiency of process development and ensure reproducibility, 4 N-linked glycosylation sites shown to contribute to heterogeneous high-mannose glycosylation were mutated to glutamine residues. The mutant LdNH36 (LdNH36-dg2) was expressed and purified to homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography and light scattering demonstrated that LdNH36-dg2 existed as a tetramer in solution, similar to the wild-type recombinant L. major nucleoside hydrolase. The amino acid mutations do not affect the tetrameric interface as confirmed by theoretical modeling, and the mutated amino acids are located outside the major immunogenic domain. Immunogenic properties of the LdNH36-dg2 recombinant protein were evaluated in BALB/c mice using formulations that included a synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, together with a microparticle delivery platform (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)). Mice exhibited high levels of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies that were reactive to both LdNH36-dg2 and LdNH36 wild-type. While the point mutations did affect the hydrolase activity of the enzyme, the IgG antibodies elicited by LdNH36-dg2 were shown to inhibit the hydrolase activity of the wild-type LdNH36. The results indicate that LdNH36-dg2 as expressed in and purified from P. pastoris is suitable for further scale-up, manufacturing, and testing in support of future first-in-humans phase 1 clinical trials.","Hudspeth, Elissa M; Wang, Qian; Seid, Christopher A; Hammond, Molly; Wei, Junfei; Liu, Zhuyun; Zhan, Bin; Pollet, Jeroen; Heffernan, Michael J; McAtee, C Patrick; Engler, David A; Matsunami, Risë K; Strych, Ulrich; Asojo, Oluwatoyin A; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2016.1139254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26839079/,1
142759,Endovascular treatment of intracranial infectious aneurysms.,2016,"The administration of medicines by the oral route is the most used approach for being very convenient. Although it is the most popular, this route also has absorption, and consequently, bioavailability limitations. In this sense, several pharmacotechnical strategies have been used to improve drug absorption, one of which is the use of permeation promoters. Papain is a very versatile plant enzyme that can be used as a permeation promoter of various active compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of papain and the formulation of native papain minitablets to promote in vitro permeation of furosemide through an innovative biomimetic triple co-culture model of Caco-2, HT29-MTX, and Raji cells. Regarding permeation, furosemide and metaprolol concentrations are determined with HPLC; those are used to calculate Papp. Monolayer integrity was evaluated using TEER and Lucifer Yellow. In the presence of papain, TEER decreased two-fold and the Papp of furosemide increased six-fold. The results suggest that native papain minitablets can be used as therapeutic adjuvants to enhance the permeation of drugs significantly improving bioavailability.","Corazza, Fúlvio G; Ernesto, Julia V; Nambu, Felipe A N; Calixto, Leandro A; Varca, Gustavo H C; Vieira, Daniel P; Leite-Silva, Vânia R; Andréo-Filho, Newton; Lopes, Patricia S",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01796-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888072/,1

143324,Volume versus standard coils in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.,2016,"BACKGROUND Sympathetic tone is one of the main determinants of blood pressure (BP) variability and treatment-resistant hypertension. The aim of our study was to assess changes in BP variability after renal denervation (RDN). In addition, on an exploratory basis, we investigated whether baseline BP variability predicted the BP changes after RDN. METHODS We analyzed 24-h BP recordings obtained at baseline and 6 months after RDN in 167 treatment-resistant hypertension patients (40% women; age, 56.7 years; mean 24-h BP, 152/90 mmHg) recruited at 11 expert centers. BP variability was assessed by weighted SD [SD over time weighted for the time interval between consecutive readings (SDiw)], average real variability (ARV), coefficient of variation, and variability independent of the mean (VIM). RESULTS Mean office and 24-h BP fell by 15.4/6.6 and 5.5/3.7 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, systolic/diastolic SDiw and VIM for 24-h SBP/DBP decreased by 1.18/0.63 mmHg (P ≤ 0.01) and 0.86/0.42 mmHg (P ≤ 0.05), respectively, whereas no significant changes in ARV or coefficient of variation occurred. Furthermore, baseline SDiw (P = 0.0006), ARV (P = 0.01), and VIM (P = 0.04) predicted the decrease in 24-h DBP but not 24-h SBP after RDN. CONCLUSION RDN was associated with a decrease in BP variability independent of the BP level, suggesting that responders may derive benefits from the reduction in BP variability as well. Furthermore, baseline DBP variability estimates significantly correlated with mean DBP decrease after RDN. If confirmed in younger patients with less arterial damage, in the absence of the confounding effect of drugs and drug adherence, baseline BP variability may prove a good predictor of BP response to RDN.","Persu, Alexandre; Gordin, Daniel; Jacobs, Lotte; Thijs, Lutgarde; Bots, Michiel L; Spiering, Wilko; Miroslawska, Atena; Spaak, Jonas; Rosa, Ján; de Jong, Mark R; Berra, Elena; Fadl Elmula, Fadl Elmula M; Wuerzner, Gregoire; Taylor, Alison H M; Olszanecka, Agnieszka; Czarnecka, Danuta; Mark, Patrick B; Burnier, Michel; Renkin, Jean; Kjeldsen, Sverre E; Widimský, Jiří; Elvan, Arif; Kahan, Thomas; Steigen, Terje K; Blankestijn, Peter J; Tikkanen, Ilkka; Staessen, Jan A",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000001582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045339/,1

However, there are few studies addressing the influence of nurses' perceived patient safety culture on adverse nurse outcomes as quality of care. PURPOSE This study was to identify the relationship between nurses' perceptions of patient safety culture and adverse nurse outcomes in Korea. METHODS This cross-sectional study was included 299 nurses at two tertiary hospitals. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine the impact of patient safety culture on adverse nurse outcomes among hospital nurses. RESULTS The mean score of patient safety culture and adverse nurse outcomes were 3.50 out of 5 points and 3.07 out of 4 points respectively. In hierarchical linear regression, hospital work environment, the attitude of supervisor/manager, and hospital climate/culture of patient safety culture predicted adverse nurse outcomes after adjusting for general characteristics. CONCLUSIONS It is crucial for healthcare facilities to assess or evaluate their current patient safety culture perceptions on a regular basis. Furthermore, provision workshops and staff training on changing behaviors and perceptions regarding patient safety activities can improve nursing performance in clinical settings.","Choi, Eun Wha; Kim, Gi Yon; Shim, Jae Lan; Son, Youn-Jung",Research and theory for nursing practice,https://doi.org/10.1891/1541-6577.33.2.134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123159/,1

144411,Prediction of Local Tumor Progression after Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Assessment of Ablative Margin Using Pre-RFA MRI and Post-RFA CT Registration.,2018,"Infectious bronchitis is one of the most common diseases in the poultry industry in many countries, especially in the regions with a dense poultry farming industry. Gammacoronavirus is the etiologic agent of this disease, with the chickens and poultries as the natural reservoirs of the virus. Various strains of infectious bronchitis virus have been reported in poultry around the world. In terms of pathogenicity, this virus can induce a spectrum of diseases ranging from the moderate respiratory tract to kidney and reproductive diseases. The serotypes of this virus do not cause cross-immunity against each other. This issue makes it difficult to control the disease. Based on the analysis of the highly variable region of the glycoprotein S1 gene, the isolated strains in Iran were classified into seven different phylogenetic groups, including Massachusetts, QX, IS-720, IS-1494, 793/B, IR-1, and IR-2. The D1466 genotype has not been reported in the country; however, the killed vaccine is used in broiler breeder farms. In this study, tissue specimens were collected from 700 farms (i.e., broiler, egg-laying, and broiler breeder farms) suspected of infectious bronchitis within 2013-2017. The samples were examined using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The D1466 genotype was not detected in any of the studied specimens. Due to the lack of immunity of the D1466 serotype against the dominant types in the country, one has to be careful in choosing the right vaccine. It is necessary to perform continuous monitoring of the circulation status of the various serotypes of viruses in the country to identify the dominant and possible new serotypes for the utilization of the appropriate vaccine.","Khaltabadi Farahani, R; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, A; Fallah Mehrabadi, M H; Ghafouri, S A; Maghsoudloo, H",Archives of Razi Institute,https://doi.org/10.22092/ari.2018.121512.1214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32621444/,1

Positional change and neck movement typically displace an ETT and change the intracuff pressure. The aim of the current study was to compare the ETT cuff pressure in the TaperGuard ETT vs the conventional ETT after a change from the supine, neutral position to the extension of the neck and semi-Fowler position for thyroid surgery. METHODS This prospective, randomized clinical trial included 50 patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the 2 groups: tracheal intubation with the TaperGuard ETT or with a conventional ETT. The ETT cuff was inflated with air and the ETT cuff pressure was set initially at 20 cmH2O using a calibrated cuff manometer. ETT cuff pressure and distance from carina to ETT tip were measured at supine and semi-Fowler positions with neck extension. RESULTS After the position change, the ETT tip migrated cephalad and cuff pressure increased in the majority of cases. ETT cuff pressure was significantly higher in the TaperGuard group than the conventional group (28.0 ± 6.6 cmH2O and 22.8 ± 4.5 cmH2O, respectively, P = .001). The degree of cephalad displacement of the ETT tip was comparable between the 2 groups (19.4 ± 6.31 mm in TaperGuard group and 21.9 ± 6.9 mm in conventional group, P = .12). CONCLUSIONS After the position change from supine to hyperextension of the neck, the ETT cuff pressure was higher in the TaperGuard ETT than in the conventional ETT, although the extent of displacement of the ETT was comparable between the 2 groups.","Park, Ji-Hoon; Lee, Hyo-Jin; Lee, Sou Hyun; Kim, Ji Seob",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398020/,1

One of the key markers associated with OSA is repetitive reductions in airflow (RRiA). A real-time pulse oximeter saturation pattern recognition algorithm (OxiMax SPD™ intended for adult in-hospital use only) designed to detect specific signatures in the SpO(2) trend associated with RRiA may provide caregivers early indication of its presence so they can treat the patient appropriately. The purpose of our study was to test the performance of saturation pattern detection (SPD) in a clinical study targeting subjects with a high prevalence of RRiA. METHODS Overnight polysomnograph (PSG) recordings were collected on 104 sleep lab patients. RRiA was defined in terms of specific criteria from four PSG signals, evaluated in consecutive 10 min epochs. PSG scoring was conducted blind to calculation of SPD. Statistical measures of sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated for the detection of RRiA by SPD. RESULTS Data were analyzed for 92 valid sets of patient recordings, encompassing 3,917 epochs. At the highest available SPD alert setting, the sensitivity was 80.2% (95% C.I. = 76.8-83.3%), the specificity was 88.3% (87.2-89.3). Area under the ROC curve was 0.87 (0.84-0.89). CONCLUSIONS The real-time SPD algorithm was able to detect episodes of RRiA in sleep lab patients with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.","Batchelder, Keith A; Mannheimer, Paul D; Mecca, Roger S; Ojile, Joseph M",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-011-9321-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101501/,1
144733,Simplifying LR-HSQC spectra using a triple-quantum filter: The LR-HTQC experiment.,2021-01-01,"Remote triage (RT) allows interprofessional teams (e.g., nurses and physicians) to assess patients and make clinical decisions remotely. RT use has developed widespread interest due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has future potential to address the needs of a rapidly aging population, improve access to care, facilitate interprofessional team care, and ensure appropriate use of resources. However, despite rapid and increasing interest in implementation of RT, there is little research concerning practices for successful implementation. We conducted a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis of practices that impact the implementation of RT for adults seeking clinical care advice. We searched MEDLINE®, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception through July 2018. We included 32 studies in this review. Our review identified four themes impacting the implementation of RT: characteristics of staff who use RT, influence of RT on staff, considerations in selecting RT tools, and environmental and contextual factors impacting RT. The findings of our systemic review underscore the need for a careful consideration of (a) organizational and stakeholder buy-in before launch, (b) physical and psychological workplace environment, (c) staff training and ongoing support, and (d) optimal metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of implementation. Our findings indicate that preimplementation planning, as well as evaluating RT by collecting data during and after implementation, is essential to ensuring successful implementation and continued adoption of RT in a health care system.","Lewinski, Allison A; Rushton, Sharron; Van Voorhees, Elizabeth; Boggan, Joel C; Whited, John D; Shoup, John P; Tabriz, Amir A; Adam, Soheir; Fulton, Jessica; Gordon, Adelaide M; Ear, Belinda; Williams, John W; Goldstein, Karen M; Van Noord, Megan G; Gierisch, Jennifer M",Research in nursing & health,https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.22093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33319411/,1

BACKGROUND Treatment of peripheral arterial disease is challenged by restenosis, requiring revascularization procedures to maintain patency. DCBs are designed to deliver an anti-proliferative drug to the vessel wall to diminish smooth muscle cell proliferation and maintain patency. METHODS This prospective, single-arm, multicenter study enrolled 50 patients with 58 lesions in the first cohort that required pre-dilatation with an uncoated angioplasty balloon prior to inflation of the DCB. The primary effectiveness endpoint was 6-month late lumen loss (LLL). The major secondary endpoint was major adverse event (MAE) rate at 6 months, defined as cardiovascular death, amputation, and/or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization. RESULTS The mean lesion length was 7.2 cm and baseline stenosis was 75.1%. Calcification was present in 62.1% of lesions and 12.1% were occluded. Both endpoints met their prespecified performance goals; at 6 months, the MAE rate was 4% and the mean LLL was 0.54 mm. The primary patency rate was 89.5% at 12 months and 80.3% at 24 months. The freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization rate, per Kaplan-Meier estimate, was 90.0% at 12 months and 85.8% at 24 months. Additionally, there were no amputations or cardiovascular deaths reported through 24 months.

We retrospectively report the outcome of 1-port laparoscopic placement PD catheters in our institution. METHODS A total of 263 patients with end-stage renal disease who underwent single-trocar laparoscopic PD catheter insertion during a recent 6-year period were reviewed. Laparoscopic technique involves introducing a PD catheter over a stiff guidewire into the abdominal cavity through a 10-mm laparoscopic port. Pertinent clinical variables, procedural complications, and follow-up outcome were analyzed. RESULTS There were 182 men and 81 women. The mean age was 56 years. Technical success was 95.8%. Catheter occlusion was the most common early complications (<6 months) that occurred in 4 (1.5%) patients. Late complications (> 6 months) including catheter occlusion, cuff extrusion, catheter leakage, catheter migration, infection, and hernia occurred in 5 patients (1.9%), 2 patients (0.8%), 3 patients (1.1%), 3 patients (1.1%), 6 patients (2.3%), and 4 patients (1.5), respectively. Mean follow-up time was 39 ± 18 months. Catheter survival rate at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was 96%, 94%, 90%, 85%, and 82%, respectively.

Autorefraction (AR) is the most common examination performed prior to prescribing glasses. As technology advances, so has the accuracy and number of portable autorefractors available. Portable technology has become acutely important with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the conversion of in-person clinical evaluations to remote telemedicine encounters. Patients and providers want to do as much as possible remotely. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of the accuracy and effectiveness of available portable automated refractors compared to the current standard of care, subjective refraction (SR). METHODS A literature search of PubMED, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov 97 unique publications in English on portable autorefractors. Twelve studies comparing a portable AR device to at least one form of SR were systematically included in this review. RESULTS There were four portable autorefractors (Netra, Quicksee, Retinomax and SVOne) studied against SR. There was high patient acceptance of glasses prescriptions by the Quicksee alone, with 87% subjects seeing the same or better than SR. Quicksee was more accurate than Netra and Retinomax. SVOne was preferred over Netra and outperformed Retinomax in multiple measures, despite Retinomax being the fastest test. DISCUSSION There are numerous portable autorefractors available, but few were compared against SR. Quicksee and SVOne are the most accurate and patient-preferred devices.

Here we review evidence that childhood onsets of bipolar disorder are more common in the US than in Europe, treatment delays are longer, and illness course is more adverse and difficult. Epidemiological data and studies of offspring at high risk also support these findings. In our cohort of outpatients with bipolar disorder, two of the major vulnerability factors for early onset - genetics and environmental adversity in childhood - were also greater in the US than in Europe. An increased familial loading for multiple psychiatric disorders was apparent in 4 generations of the family members of the patients from the US, and that familial burden was linked to early onset bipolar disorder. Since both early onset and treatment delay are risk factors for a poor outcome in adulthood, new clinical, research, and public health initiatives are needed to begin to address and ameliorate this ongoing and potentially devastating clinical situation.","Post, Robert M; Altshuler, Lori L; Kupka, Ralph; McElroy, Susan L; Frye, Mark A; Rowe, Michael; Grunze, Heinz; Suppes, Trisha; Keck, Paul E; Leverich, Gabriele S; Nolen, Willem A",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.01.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119069/,1

We determined the case fatality rate between age groups and clinical factors associated with mortality. RESULTS A total of 52.5% (n = 5145) were women, and with an average age of 70.21 ± 8.37 years. The fatality rate was 11.9%, with a higher rate in men (14.4%) compared with women (9.8%). The fatality rate increased with age. The most common manifestations were fever (n = 4926; 50.2%), cough (n = 5737; 58.5%), headache (n = 1980; 20.2%) and fatigue (n = 2022; 20.6%). The most prevalent comorbidities were diabetes (n = 1528; 5.6%), cardiovascular disease (n = 1528; 15.6%) and systemic arterial hypertension (n = 597; 6.1%). The factors associated with mortality were male sex (OR 1.54), age ≥75 years (OR 2.40), dyspnea (OR 2.92), diabetes (OR 2.33), hypertension (OR 1.53) and chronic kidney disease (OR 2.02). CONCLUSIONS The profile and the risk factors evidenced show the need to adopt mechanisms to protect the elderly population.","de Souza, Carlos Df; de Arruda Magalhães, Amanda J; Lima, Ayara Jpd; Nunes, Danielle N; de Fátima Machado Soares, Érika; de Castro Silva, Louryanne; Santos, Lucas G; Dos Santos Cardoso, Vitória I; Nobre, Yasmin Vs; do Carmo, Rodrigo F",Geriatrics & gerontology international,https://doi.org/10.1111/ggi.14061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111433/,1

While it is possible to record some physiological variables for free-living animals using animal-attached logging devices, including inertial-measurement, heart-rate and temperature loggers, the field is still in its infancy. In this opinion piece, we review the most important future research directions for advancing the field of 'physiologging' in wild animals, including the technological development that we anticipate will be required, and the fiscal and ethical challenges that must be overcome. Non-invasive, multi-sensor miniature devices are ubiquitous in the world of human health and fitness monitoring, creating invaluable opportunities for animal and human physiologging to drive synergistic advances. We argue that by capitalizing on the research efforts and advancements made in the development of human wearables, it will be possible to design the non-invasive loggers needed by ecophysiologists to collect accurate physiological data from free-ranging animals ethically and with an absolute minimum of impact. In turn, findings have the capacity to foster transformative advances in human health monitoring. Thus, we invite biomedical engineers and researchers to collaborate with the animal-tagging community to drive forward the advancements necessary to realize the full potential of both fields.

Current techniques to medialize the fascial edges in open abdomens entail several trips to the operating room and could result in fascial damage. We conducted a pilot study to investigate a novel non-invasive device for gradual reapproximation of the abdominal wall fascia in the open abdomen. Methods Mechanically ventilated patients ≥16 years of age with the abdominal fascia deliberately left open after a midline laparotomy for trauma and acute care surgery were randomized into two groups. Control group patients underwent standard care with negative pressure therapy only. Device group patients were treated with negative pressure therapy in conjunction with the new device for fascial reapproximation. Exclusion criteria: pregnancy, traumatic hernias, pre-existing ventral hernias, burns, and body mass index ≥40 kg/m2. The primary outcome was successful fascial closure by direct suture of the fascia without mesh or component separation. Secondary outcomes were abdominal wall complications. Results Thirty-eight patients were investigated, 20 in the device group and 18 in the control group. Primary closure of the fascia by direct suture without mesh or component separation was achieved in 17 patients (85%) in the device group and only 10 patients (55.6%) in the control group (p=0.0457). Device group patients were 53% more likely to experience primary fascial closure by direct suture than control group patients. Device group showed gradual reduction (p<0.005) in the size of the fascial defects; not seen in control group. There were no complications related to the device. Conclusions The new device applied externally on the abdominal wall promoted reapproximation of the fascia in the midline, preserved the integrity of the fascia, and improved primary fascial closure rate compared with negative pressure therapy system only.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of stress hyperglycaemia in acute pulmonary embolism, providing new insights into the presumed embolus size and localization, clinical parameters (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index, PESI), and in-hospital mortality. Design and Methods. Among a total of 95,454 patients referred to the Emergency Department of the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Centre between 2014 and 2016, all patients with acute pulmonary embolism were included into this observational cohort study. The study group consisted of 190 patients aged 25-96. Relevant patient history, clinical data, and laboratory findings were collected during the entire hospitalization period. Data were analyzed for the entire group of patients, as well as separately for patients without diabetes, using the Fisher exact test and logistic regression. Results Analysis of embolus localization as an indirect parameter of embolus size showed that patients with stress hyperglycaemia more often had emboli located in proximal parts of the pulmonary circulation (i.e., main artery or lobar branches) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, stress hyperglycaemia correlated with PESI score and diabetes (p < 0.05) in the entire patient group. Stress hyperglycaemia showed independent association with in-hospital mortality in patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion Stress hyperglycaemia in patients with acute pulmonary embolism is associated with embolus localization in larger arteries of the pulmonary circulation and higher PESI score and therefore could serve as an independent in-hospital mortality predictor.","Altabas, Velimir; Pukec, Lucija; Mlinarić, Stella; Pintarić, Hrvoje; Šikić, Aljoša",International journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3606757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724305/,1

147706,Henipavirus pathogenesis and antiviral approaches.,2015,"OBJECTIVE The presence of respiratory information within the pulse oximeter signal (PPG) is a well-documented phenomenon. However, extracting this information for the purpose of continuously monitoring respiratory rate requires: (1) the recognition of the multi-faceted manifestations of respiratory modulation components within the PPG and the complex interactions among them; (2) the implementation of appropriate advanced signal processing techniques to take full advantage of this information; and (3) the post-processing infrastructure to deliver a clinically useful reported respiratory rate to the end user. A holistic algorithmic approach to the problem is therefore required. We have developed the RR(OXI) algorithm based on this principle and its performance on healthy subject trial data is described herein. METHODS Finger PPGs were collected from a cohort of 139 healthy adult volunteers monitored during free breathing over an 8-min period. These were subsequently processed using a novel in-house algorithm based on continuous wavelet transform technology within an infrastructure incorporating weighted averaging and logical decision making processes. The computed oximeter respiratory rates (RR(oxi)) were then compared to an end-tidal CO2 reference rate RR(ETCO2). RESULTS RR(ETCO2) ranged from a lowest recorded value of 2.97 breaths per min (br/min) to a highest value of 28.02 br/min. The mean rate was 14.49 br/min with standard deviation of 4.36 br/min. Excellent agreement was found between RR(oxi) and RR(ETCO2), with a mean difference of -0.23 br/min and standard deviation of 1.14 br/min. The two measures are tightly spread around the line of agreement with a strong correlation observable between them (R2 = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that RR(oxi) represents a viable technology for the measurement of respiratory rate of healthy individuals.","Addison, Paul S; Watson, James N; Mestek, Michael L; Mecca, Roger S",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-011-9332-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22231359/,1
147853,Acute embolization of ruptured brain arteriovenous malformations.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF WORK Lung microwave ablation (MWA) is considered an alternative treatment in high-risk patients, not suitable for surgery. The aim of our study is to compare MWA and pulmonary lobectomy in high-risk, lung cancer patients. METHODS This was a single-center, propensity score--weighted cohort study. All adult patients who underwent CT guided MWA for stage I NSCLC between June 2009-October 2014 were included in the study and were compared with a cohort of patients submitted to lung lobectomy in the same period of time. Outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS 32 patients underwent MWA, and 35 high-risk patients submitted to lung lobectomy in the same period were selected. Median follow-up time was 51.1 months (95% CI: 43.8-62.3). Overall survival was 43.8 (95% CI: 26.1-55) and 55.8 months (95% CI: 49.9-76.8) in the MWA group and Lobectomy group, respectively. Negative prognostic factors were MWA procedure (HR:2.25, 95% CI: 1.20-4.21, p= 0.0109) and nodule diameter (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.07; p= 0.007) for OS, while MWA procedure (HR: 5.2; 95% CI: 2.1-12.8: p < 0.001), ECOG 3 (HR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.6-15.6; p = 0.006) and nodule diameter (HR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.0-1.1; p = 0.003) for DFS. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated a high percentage of local relapse in the MWA group but a comparable overall survival. Although lung lobectomy remains the gold standard treatment for stage I NSCLC, we can consider the MWA procedure as valid alternative local treatment in high-risk patients for stage I NSCLC.","Mendogni, Paolo; Daffrè, Elisa; Rosso, Lorenzo; Palleschi, Alessandro; Righi, Ilaria; Carrinola, Rosaria; Damarco, Francesco; Polli, Federico; Ierardi, Annamaria; Arrichiello, Antonio; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Nosotti, Mario; Tosi, Davide",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i10-s.10342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245066/,1

147907,Intracranial Serpentine Aneurysms: Spontaneous Changes of Angiographic Filling Pattern.,2018,"BACKGROUND Children undergoing cardiac surgery may exhibit a pronounced inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Inflammation is recognized as an important pathophysiologic process leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 with AKI and other adverse outcomes in children after CPB surgery. METHODS This is a sub-study of the Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints in AKI (TRIBE-AKI) cohort, including 106 children ranging in age from 1 month to 18 years undergoing CPB. Plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were measured preoperatively and postoperatively [day 1 (within 6 h after surgery) and day 3]. RESULTS Stage 2/3 AKI, defined by at least a doubling of the baseline serum creatinine concentration or dialysis, was diagnosed in 24 (23%) patients. The preoperative IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in patients with stage 2/3 AKI [median 2.6 pg/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 2.6 0.6-4.9 pg/mL] than in those without stage 2/3 AKI (median 0.6 pg/mL, IQR 0.6-2.2 pg/mL) (p = 0.03). After adjustment for clinical and demographic variables, the highest preoperative IL-6 tertile was associated with a sixfold increased risk for stage 2/3 AKI compared with the lowest tertile (adjusted odds ratio 6.41, 95 % confidence interval 1.16-35.35). IL-6 and IL-10 levels increased significantly after surgery, peaking postoperatively on day 1. First postoperative IL-6 and IL-10 measurements did not significantly differ between patients with stage 2/3 AKI and those without stage 2/3 AKI. The elevated IL-6 level on day 3 was associated with longer hospital stay (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative plasma IL-6 concentration is associated with the development of stage 2/3 AKI and may be prognostic of resource utilization.","Greenberg, Jason H; Whitlock, Richard; Zhang, William R; Thiessen-Philbrook, Heather R; Zappitelli, Michael; Devarajan, Prasad; Eikelboom, John; Kavsak, Peter A; Devereaux, P J; Shortt, Colleen; Garg, Amit X; Parikh, Chirag R",Pediatric nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00467-015-3088-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25877915/,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 24th, 2020 and March 5th, 2020, 103 patients were studied. Among these, 32 were patients in the isolation ward of the Infectious Disease Department in Baoding Second Hospital with suspected 2019-nCoV, and 71 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV were in the Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital. Of the 103 patients included, 97 cases were observed in isolation. Using a self-control study design, each patient's anxiety was scored on a self-rating anxiety scale before receiving the psychological intervention (on the 7th day of isolation) and after receiving the intervention (on the 14th day of isolation). The severity of anxiety was evaluated based on the anxiety score before receiving the intervention. The anxiety scores before and after receiving the intervention were then compared using the paired t-test, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS After receiving the psychological intervention once or twice a week, the anxiety of the patients improved significantly after one week. CONCLUSIONS The anxiety of patients with 2019-nCoV in isolation wards can be alleviated through psychological intervention. By alleviating patient anxiety, this intervention also helps patients maintain their psychological wellbeing, which promotes rehabilitation and helps with the control of 2019-nCoV.","Sun, P; Fan, D-J; He, T; Li, H-Z; Wang, G; Zhang, X-Z; Wu, Y-Q; Dai, Y-H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202101_24421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506941/,1

Although the prevalence of gout has been rising over the past several decades, adherence to urate lowering therapy continues to be suboptimal. Recent studies have underscored the potential success of guideline-directed therapy. RECENT FINDINGS Adherence to gout treatment continues to be suboptimal according to multinational metaanalyses. Moreover, studies measuring adherence are prone to overestimation and each methodologic approach has intrinsic limitations. Adherence may be analyzed from the perspective of patient adherence to taking a medication, or provider adherence to treatment guidelines. In addition to considering traditional risk factors, adherence should be viewed through the lens of healthcare disparities. The RAmP-Up trail and Nottingham Gout Treatment trial demonstrate the success of protocolized gout treatment using existing guidelines for reference. SUMMARY Standardized gout treatment protocols should be established for all primary care and specialty practices. Two successful methods of improving adherence include using nonphysician providers to coordinate urate lowering therapy titration and monitoring serum urate. Having more frequent outpatient visits to focus on direct patient care and education has also been successful.","Ho, Gary H; Pillinger, Michael H; Toprover, Michael",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332889/,1

ANIMALS 8 healthy dogs. PROCEDURES In a crossover study, each dog received SS (10 mL) IV, and HRM was performed during oral administration of 10 boluses (5 mL each) of water or 10 boluses (5 g each) of canned food. Cisapride (1 mg/kg in 60 mL of SS) was subsequently administered IV to 7 dogs; HRM and bolus administration procedures were repeated. Two to 4 weeks later, HRM was repeated following administration of SS and water and food boluses in 4 dogs. Pressure profile data were obtained for all swallows, and 11 outcome variables were statistically analyzed. RESULTS After SS administration, predicted means for the esophageal contractile integral were 850.4 cm/mm Hg/s for food boluses and 660.3 cm/mm Hg/s for water boluses. Predicted means for esophageal contraction front velocity were 6.2 cm/s for water boluses and 5.6 cm/s for food boluses after SS administration. Predicted means for residual LES pressure were significantly higher following cisapride administration. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results indicated that HRM was feasible and repeatable in awake healthy dogs of various breeds and sizes. Stronger esophageal contractions and faster esophageal contraction velocity occurred during solid bolus and liquid bolus swallows, respectively. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure increased significantly following cisapride administration. Esophageal contractions and bolus transit latency should be further evaluated by HRM in clinically dysphagic dogs.","Ullal, Tarini V; Kass, Philip H; Conklin, Jeffrey L; Belafsky, Peter C; Marks, Stanley L",American journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.77.8.818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27463544/,1

DESIGN quantitative survey of aggregated data for each Region and overall for Italy relating to screening tests carried out in the period January-May 2020 compared to those of the same period of 2019; estimate of diagnostic delays starting from the calculation of the average detection rate of the last 3 years available (specific by Region). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Italian mass screening programmes. Data on the tests carried out in the target population of the breast (women 50-69 years old), cervix (women 25-64 years old), and colorectal (women and men 50-69 years old) cancer screening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the cumulative delay (in absolute numbers and as a percentage) in the period January-May 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, by Region; the difference of screening tests (in absolute number and in percentage) performed in May 2020 compared to May 2019; the estimate of the fewer lesions diagnosed in 2020 compared with 2019 with relative 95% confidence intervals (95%CI); the 'standard months' of delay (proportion of fewer tests carried out from January to May 2020 for the corresponding number of months). RESULTS 20 Regions out of 21 participated. In the period January-May 2020, the fewer screening tests performed in comparison with the same period of 2019 were: 472,389 (equal to 53.8%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for mammography screening; 585,287 (equal to 54.9%) with an average delay of standard months of 2.7 for colorectal screening; 371,273 (equal to 55.3%) with an average delay of 2.8 standard months for cervical screening. The estimated number of undiagnosed lesions is 2,201 (95%CI 2,173-2,220) breast cancers; 645 (95%CI 632-661) colorectal carcinomas; 3,890 (95%CI 3,855-3,924) advanced colorectal adenomas and 1,497 (95%CI 1,413-1,586) CIN2 or more serious lesions. CONCLUSIONS mass screenings need to be restarted as quickly as possible. In order to make up for the delay that is accumulating, it is necessary to provide for wider delivery times, greater resources, and new organizational approaches. It will also be essential to develop communication strategies suitable for promoting participation during this emergency.","Mantellini, Paola; Battisti, Francesca; Armaroli, Paola; Giubilato, Pamela; Ventura, Leonardo; Zorzi, Manuel; Battagello, Jessica; Sassoli de Bianchi, Priscilla; Senore, Carlo; Zappa, Marco",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412828/,1
148875,Use of the microangiographic fluoroscope for coiling of intracranial aneurysms.,2011,"Pincer molecules are of increasing interest due to the modular nature of modification and range of reactivity observed when coordinated to metal ions. A subset within the family of pincer molecules use a pyridine group to bridge the outer two arms as well as provide a N-donor atom for metal binding. While the arm appendages have been studied extensively, little research has been conducted on the electronic effects of the central, substituted pyridine systems. Therefore, a series of NNN pincer-type ligands with substitution on the 4-position of the pyridine ring with -OH, -OBn, -H, -Cl, and -NO2 functional groups were synthesized and characterized through NMR spectroscopy and ESI-HRMS. Each pincer was metalated with Cu(ii) salts and evaluated through X-ray diffraction analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory analysis. The results indicate that the relatively unstudied -OBn group demonstrates both electron-withdrawing (XRD bond lengths) and electron-donating (NMR spectroscopy) properties. The -NO2 pincer ligand shows a redox event within experimental windows evaluated, in contrast to the other congeners studied. In addition, electron-donating groups increase the electron density around the Cu(ii) center based on DFT studies and cyclic voltammetry. These findings can be applied to other pyridine-based pincer systems when considering ligand design and warrants future characterization of 4-position substituted pyridines.","Schwartz, Timothy M; Burnett, Marianne E; Green, Kayla N",Dalton transactions,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9dt04714j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32022045/,1

149476,"WEB intrasaccular flow disruptor-prospective, multicenter experience in 83 patients with 85 aneurysms.",2014,"Verbal communication relies heavily upon mutual understanding, or common ground. Inferring the intentional states of our interaction partners is crucial in achieving this, and social neuroscience has begun elucidating the intra- and inter-personal neural processes supporting such inferences. Typically, however, neuroscientific paradigms lack the reciprocal to-and-fro characteristic of social communication, offering little insight into the way these processes operate online during real-world interaction. In the present study, we overcame this by developing a ""hyperscanning"" paradigm in which pairs of interactants could communicate verbally with one another in a joint-action task whilst both undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously. Successful performance on this task required both interlocutors to predict their partner's upcoming utterance in order to converge on the same word as each other over recursive exchanges, based only on one another's prior verbal expressions. By applying various levels of analysis to behavioural and neuroimaging data acquired from 20 dyads, three principle findings emerged: First, interlocutors converged frequently within the same semantic space, suggesting that mutual understanding had been established. Second, assessing the brain responses of each interlocutor as they planned their upcoming utterances on the basis of their co-player's previous word revealed the engagement of the temporo-parietal junctional (TPJ), precuneus and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex. Moreover, responses in the precuneus were modulated positively by the degree of semantic convergence achieved on each round. Second, effective connectivity among these regions indicates the crucial role of the right TPJ in this process, consistent with the Nexus model. Third, neural signals within certain nodes of this network became aligned between interacting interlocutors. We suggest this reflects an interpersonal neural process through which interactants infer and align to one another's intentional states whilst they establish a common ground.","Salazar, M; Shaw, D J; Gajdoš, M; Mareček, R; Czekóová, K; Mikl, M; Brázdil, M",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385556/,1

Play material is often offered for distraction and comfort. We explored how contact with social robot PLEO could positively affect a child's well-being. To this end, we performed a multiple case study on the paediatric ward of two hospitals. Child life specialists offered PLEO as a therapeutic activity to children in a personalised way for a well-being related purpose in three to five play like activity sessions during hospital visits/stay. Robot-child interaction was observed; care professionals, children and parents were interviewed. Applying direct content analysis revealed six categories of interest: interaction with PLEO, role of the adults, preferences for PLEO, PLEO as buddy, attainment of predetermined goal(s) and deployment of PLEO. Four girls and five boys, aged 4-13, had PLEO offered as a relief from stress or boredom or for physical stimulation. All but one started interacting with PLEO and showed behaviours like hugging, caring or technical exploration, promoting relaxation, activation and/or making contact. Interaction with PLEO contributed to achieving the well-being related purpose for six of them. PLEO was perceived as attractive to elicit play. Although data are limited, promising results emerge that the well-being of hospitalised children might be fostered by a personalised PLEO offer.","Moerman, Clara J; Jansens, Rianne Ml",Journal of child health care : for professionals working with children in the hospital and community,https://doi.org/10.1177/1367493520947503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840383/,1

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 1118 consecutive RARPs performed by one surgeon between July 2005 and July 2011. Cases that included concurrent hernia repair were compared with a group of patients matched 1:1 for age, body mass index, and year of surgery, who underwent RARP alone (controls). RESULTS A total of 91 patients underwent 113 concurrent inguinal hernia repairs during RARP. Twenty-two patients (24%) underwent bilateral repair. Of the 69 patients undergoing unilateral repair, 41 (45%) underwent left-sided repair, and 29 (31%) underwent right-sided repair. Thirty-five (38%) patients had previous inguinal hernia repair. Body mass index of cases and controls were 27.5 ± 3.4 and 27.8 ± 3.1 kg/m(2), respectively. Mean operative time in cases was 185 ± 28 minutes vs 168 ± 31 minutes in controls (P <.001). Estimated blood loss was 170 ± 61 mL for cases vs 194 ± 82 mL for controls (P = .03). No differences were observed in length of stay or prevalence of postoperative complications. There was 1 hernia recurrence, which necessitated repeat repair 1 year after surgery. No mesh infections or other complications related to hernia repairs were observed. CONCLUSION Inguinal hernias are a common intraoperative finding during RARP. Concurrent repair appears safe and effective with only a slight increase in operative time, and no increase in morbidity.","Lee, Daniel K; Montgomery, Daniel P; Porter, James R",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2013.08.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24139357/,1

150142,Extracranial internal carotid artery vasospasm during thrombectomy.,2018,"Plant canopy interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) drives carbon dioxide (CO2), water and energy cycling in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Quantifying intercepted PAR requires accurate measurements of total incident PAR above canopies and direct beam and diffuse PAR components. While some regional data sets include these data, e.g. from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program sites, they are not often applicable to local research sites because of the variable nature (spatial and temporal) of environmental variables that influence incoming PAR. Currently available instrumentation that measures diffuse and direct beam radiation separately can be cost prohibitive and require frequent adjustments. Alternatively, generalized empirical relationships that relate atmospheric variables and radiation components can be used but require assumptions that increase the potential for error. Our goal here was to construct and test a cheaper, highly portable instrument alternative that could be used at remote field sites to measure total, diffuse and direct beam PAR for extended time periods without supervision. The apparatus tested here uses a fabricated, solar powered rotating shadowband and other commercially available parts to collect continuous hourly PAR data. Measurements of total incident PAR had nearly a one-to-one relationship with total incident radiation measurements taken at the same research site by an unobstructed point quantum sensor. Additionally, measurements of diffuse PAR compared favorably with modeled estimates from previously published data, but displayed significant differences that were attributed to the important influence of rapidly changing local environmental conditions. The cost of the system is about 50% less than comparable commercially available systems that require periodic, but not continual adjustments. Overall, the data produced using this apparatus indicates that this instrumentation has the potential to support ecological research via a relatively inexpensive method to collect continuous measurements of total, direct beam and diffuse PAR in remote locations.","Cruse, Michael J; Kucharik, Christopher J; Norman, John M",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25668208/,1

An online anonymous questionnaire was developed in Chinese, including the individual background information, the perception of the epidemic, and level of anxiety and depression through Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). The respondents were divided into ORTHO group, TMD group and Control group. Descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression modelling were performed. In total, 1241 valid questionnaires were collected, covering 587 orthodontic patients and 220 TMD patients. It is shown that the overall mental health is not quite optimistic during the COVID-19 pandemic with the mean score of K10 being 18.65. TMD patients have higher level of anxiety and depression than orthodontic patients as well as the general population. Younger age, female gender, having close contact with individuals from Hubei province, higher self-rated infection possibility, concern about psychological barriers and distrust are negatively affecting patients' psychological status.

This work focused on the development of high-affinity, hydrophilic, antagonistic, bombesin-based imaging agents for PET and SPECT. The bombesin antagonist analog d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 ([d-Phe(6),Sta(13),Leu(14)]bombesin[6-14]) was synthesized and conjugated to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N',N″-triacetic acid (NOTA) via a diethylene glycol (PEG2) linker. The resulting conjugate, NOTA-PEG2-[d-Phe(6),Sta(13),Leu(14)]bombesin[6-14] (NOTA-P2-RM26), was labeled with (68)Ga (T1/2 = 68 min, positron emitter) and (111)In (T1/2 = 2.8 days, gamma emitter). The labeling stability, specificity, inhibition efficiency (IC50), and dissociation constant (KD) of both labeled compounds as well as their cellular retention and internalization were investigated. The pharmacokinetics of the dual isotope ((111)In/(68)Ga)-labeled peptide in both normal NMRI mice and PC-3 tumor-bearing Balb/c nu/nu mice was also studied. NOTA-P2-RM26 was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga at a radiochemical yield of >98%. Both conjugates were shown to have high specificity and binding affinity for GRPR. The KD value was determined to be 23 ± 13 pM for the (111)In-labeled compound in a saturation binding experiment. In addition, (nat)In- and (nat)Ga-NOTA-P2-RM26 showed low nanomolar binding inhibition concentrations (IC50 = 1.24 ± 0.29 nM and 0.91 ± 0.19 nM, respectively) in a competitive binding assay. The internalization rate of the radiolabeled conjugates was slow. The radiometal-labeled tracers demonstrated rapid blood clearance via the kidney and GRPR-specific uptake in the pancreas in normal mice. Tumor targeting and biodistribution studies in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts displayed high and specific uptake in tumors (8.1 ± 0.4%ID/g for (68)Ga and 5.7 ± 0.3%ID/g for (111)In) and high tumor-to-background ratios (tumor/blood: 12 ± 1 for (68)Ga and 10 ± 1 for (111)In) after only 1 h p.i. of 45 pmol of peptide. The xenografts were visualized by gamma and microPET cameras shortly after injection. In conclusion, the antagonistic bombesin analog NOTA-PEG2-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (NOTA-P2-RM26) is a promisindg candidate for prostate cancer imaging using PET and SPECT/CT.","Varasteh, Zohreh; Velikyan, Irina; Lindeberg, Gunnar; Sörensen, Jens; Larhed, Mats; Sandström, Mattias; Selvaraju, Ram Kumar; Malmberg, Jennie; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Orlova, Anna",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc300659k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23763444/,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between February 2009 and March 2010, 141 lesions of 121 hepatocellular carcinoma patients were treated by percutaneous RF ablation, and 22 tumor residues were detected in 22 patients by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. These 22 patients were examined by conventional US, Sonazoid-enhanced US (0.5 mL/body of Sonazoid, intravenous administration), and CO2-enhanced US (10 mL of CO2, hepatic arterial administration). RESULTS Tumor residue was confirmed by CO2-enhanced US in all the 22 patients (sensitivity: 100%) in 19 of the 22 patients by Sonazoid-enhanced US (sensitivity: 86%; 3 lesions that were not detected by this modality were located deeper than the sonographic depth (p=0.0109)), and in 17 of the 22 patients by conventional US (sensitivity: 77%; 5 lesions that were not detected by this modality were smaller in terms of the sonographic tumor size (p=0.0278)).

150948,A Reappraisal of Anterior Communicating Artery Aneurysms: A Case for Stent-Assisted Embolization.,2016,"PURPOSE In open inguinal hernia repair self-gripping meshes are currently commonly employed. Assumed benefits are saving of time, ease of handling and omission of fixation. Self-gripping meshes are, however, not as easy to handle and position as commonly stated. We describe a newly developed way of intra-operative mesh preparation and implantation and compare it to the conventional technique of insertion of self-gripping meshes. METHODS A two-armed, randomized trial with 64 patients was performed. For implantation of the self-gripping, light weight and partially absorbable mesh we used either a newly described rolling technique (group 1: n = 32) or the conventional way of insertion (group 2: n = 32). Primary endpoints of the study were feasibility with regard to actual implantation time and surgeons' satisfaction with the methods. Secondary endpoints were total operating time, length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, duration of pain medication intake and postoperative morbidity. In addition all patients were prospectively followed up according to the Hernia Med® registry's standards. RESULTS Implantation time (seconds) 140 ± 74 vs. 187 ± 84, p = 0.008, duration of pain medication intake (days) 3.6 ± 2.8 vs. 4.8 ± 2.6; p = 0.046 and postoperative morbidity 2 (6%) vs. 8 (25%) was significantly beneficial in group 1 (rolling technique) compared to group 2 (conventional method). Blinded questionnaire revealed that rolling the mesh is generally easier with less repositioning maneuvers than conventional placement. Neither overall procedure time, length of stay nor postoperative pain scores differed significantly between groups. CONCLUSION The newly introduced rolling technique for the actual placement of self-gripping meshes in open inguinal hernia repair is technically less demanding and therefore significantly faster when compared to the conventional way of insertion of the same product. In addition the rolling technique has shown to be safe for the patients and to also provide higher surgeons' satisfaction.","Lechner, M N; Jäger, T; Buchner, S; Köhler, G; Öfner, D; Mayer, F",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-015-1389-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25989726/,1

In developing countries including Ethiopia, about half of children are estimated to be anemic. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the pooled prevalence of anemia and its predictor factors among children in Ethiopia. Method The studies were identified through explicit and exhaustive search of reputable databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Science Direct, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and the hand search of reference lists of previous prevalence studies to retrieve more related articles. Thirty-nine studies were selected based on a comprehensive list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized and pre-tested data extraction checklist, and the analysis was done using STATA 14 statistical software. To assess heterogeneity, the Cochrane Q test statistic and I2 tests were used. In our analysis, considerable heterogeneity was observed. Therefore, a random effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of anemia. Moreover, the predictor factors of anemia were examined. Results The forest plot of 39 included studies revealed that the overall pooled prevalence of anemia among children in Ethiopia was 34.4% (95% CI: 29.1, 39.7%). Sub-group analysis showed that the highest anemia prevalence was observed in Somali Region with a prevalence of 49.4 % (95% CI: 20.9, 77.8). Also, anemia in children was found to be highest in the age group of less than five years (45.2, 95% CI: 39.6,50.8). Low literacy of families: 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.7), low family socioeconomic status: 1.9 (95% CI: 1.1,3.01.3), having housewife mothers or with no job: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4, 1.9) and rural residence: 3.3 (95% CI: 1.7,6.1) were found to be predictors of anemia among children. Conclusion In this study, one in three children were anemic in Ethiopia. It is a moderate public health problem in children in this study. Low literacy, low socioeconomic status as well as rural residence of the families and helminthic infection of the children were found to be predictors of anemia in the children.

151104,Preexisting and post-COVID-19 immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in cancer patients.,2021-05-19,"Many healthcare workers were infected while looking after the SARS patients on the medical wards in 2003. The high infectivity of the SARS coronavirus with peak viral load on day 10 of illness when patients were ill, overcrowding of the old medical wards with low air changes/hr (ACH), and aerosol-generating procedures while resuscitating the patients were the major factors. Procedures reported to present an increased risk of SARS transmission include tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation before intubation whereas oxygen therapy and bed distance <1 m were also implicated. Studies based on laser visualization technique with smoke particles as smokers in the human patient simulator has shown that oxygen therapy via Hudson mask and nasal cannula could disperse exhaled air of patients to 0.4 and 1 m respectively whereas jet nebulizer could disperse exhaled air >0.8 m from the patient. Bigger isolation rooms with 16 ACH are more effective than smaller isolation rooms with 12 ACH in removing exhaled air and preventing room contamination but at the expense of more noise and electricity consumption. Non-invasive ventilation via face masks and single circuit can disperse exhaled air from 0.4 to 1 m. Both higher inspiratory pressures and use of whisper swivel device (to facilitate carbon dioxide removal) could increase the exhaled air leakage and isolation room contamination during on-invasive ventilation. Addition of a viral-bacterial filter during manual ventilation by bagging may reduce the exhaled air leakage forward and yet increase the sideway leakage. N95 mask was more effective than surgical mask in preventing expelled air leakage during patient's coughing but there was still significant sideway leakage to 15 cm. Clinicians should be aware of air leakage from the various face masks and adopt strict infection control measures during resuscitation of patients with severe respiratory infections. Carefully designed clinical trials are required to determine the optimal timing and dosage of any antiviral agents, convalescent plasma, and immuno-modulating agents in the treatment of the possibly immune-mediated lung injury in SARS and newly emerged infection such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.","Hui, David S",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2013.06.18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23977432/,1

This project was initiated by PATH with the support from Resolve to Save Lives from January 2019 to February 2020. The study included hypertensive patients attending 164 private practices in Mumbai, India; practitioners screened all adults visiting their clinic during the project period. Among 13 184 hypertensive patients registered, the mean age was 53 years (SD = 12.38) and 52% were female. Among the 11 544 patients that provided phone numbers and gave consent for follow-up calls, 9528 responded to phone calls at least once and 5250 patients followed up at least once. Of the 5250 patients, 82% visited the clinic for follow-up visit within one month after receiving the phone call. The blood pressure control rate among those who answered phone calls and who did not answer phone calls increased from 23.6% to 48.8% (P <.001) and 21.0% to 44.3% (P <.001), respectively. The blood pressure control rate at follow-up was significantly associated with phone calls (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.34 - 1.71).

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and methodology of SPA-HALS for benign large adnexal tumors and to compare the surgical outcomes of SPA-HALS and SPA-PLS performed by a single surgeon (H.-J. R.). METHODS Between March 2009 and February 2011, 139 patients underwent SPA adnexal surgery. The SPA-PLS procedure was performed for 96 candidates for conventional laparoscopic adnexal surgery, whereas SPA-HALS was performed for 43 patients with large adnexal tumors. The patient demographics and surgical outcomes of these two groups were compared. RESULTS The median adnexal tumor size was larger in the patients who underwent SPA-HALS than in those who underwent SPA-PLS (10.9 vs. 6.3 cm; p < 0.001). Spillage occurred for four patients in the SPA-HALS group (10.3%) compared with 33 patients in the SPA-PLS group (31.3%) (p = 0.005). The relative risk of spillage was 4.43 times higher in the SPA-PLS than in the SPA-HALS group (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-13.53). Adnexa-conserving surgery was significantly more frequent in the SPA-HALS group than in the SPA-PLS group (76.7% vs. 43.8%; p < 0.001). Additional procedures were less frequent in the SPA-HALS group (16.3% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.043). The median estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the SPA-HALS group (50 vs. 105 ml; p = 0.001). The two groups did not differ significantly in median operation time (75 vs. 70 min), complication rate (0% vs. 3.1%), or postoperative hospital stay (2 vs. 2 days). CONCLUSION The findings showed that SPA-HALS extracorporeal adnexal surgery allows for thorough evaluation of peritoneal structure and complete surgery of benign large adnexal tumors while retaining the advantages of SPA adnexal surgery. Furthermore, this technique may reduce the intraperitoneal spillage rate for benign large adnexal tumors.","Roh, Hyun-Jin; Lee, Soo-Jeong; Ahn, Jun-Woo; Kwon, Yong-Soon; Cho, Hyun-Jin; Kim, Dae-Yeon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1939-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22038160/,1

A total of 831 American adults who lost a loved one to COVID-19 responded to validated measures of dysfunctional grief and functional impairment, as well as items assessing unique complications associated with the pandemic (e.g. resentment toward doctors, social isolation). In combination, circumstantial risk factors accounted for 59% of the variance in social impairment and fully 71% of the variance in pandemic grief, leading to the development of an inventory of Pandemic Grief Risk Factors (PGRF), which displayed a unified factor structure, high reliability and strong convergent validity. Implications for psychological screening and intervention for those bereaved by COVID-19 are briefly noted.","Neimeyer, Robert A; Lee, Sherman A",Death studies,https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2021.1896459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019471/,1

152357,Mandating influenza vaccine for Hajj pilgrims.,2016,"Melioidosis, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a serious infectious disease with diverse clinical manifestations. The morbidity and mortality of melioidosis is high in Southeast Asia and no licensed vaccines currently exist. This study was aimed at evaluating human cellular and humoral immune responses in Thai adults against four melioidosis vaccine candidate antigens. Blood samples from 91 melioidosis patients and 100 healthy donors from northeast Thailand were examined for immune responses against B. pseudomallei Hcp1, AhpC, TssM and LolC using a variety of cellular and humoral immune assays including IFN-γ ELISpot assays, flow cytometry and ELISA. PHA and a CPI peptide pool were also used as control stimuli in the ELISpot assays. Hcp1 and TssM stimulated strong IFN-γ secreting T cell responses in acute melioidosis patients which correlated with survival. High IFN-γ secreting CD4+ T cell responses were observed during acute melioidosis. Interestingly, while T cell responses of melioidosis patients against the CPI peptide pool were low at the time of enrollment, the levels increased to the same as in healthy donors by day 28. Although high IgG levels against Hcp1 and AhpC were detected in acute melioidosis patients, no significant differences between survivors and non-survivors were observed. Collectively, these studies help to further our understanding of immunity against disease following natural exposure of humans to B. pseudomallei as well as provide important insights for the selection of candidate antigens for use in the development of safe and effective melioidosis subunit vaccines.","Sengyee, Sineenart; Yarasai, Atchara; Janon, Rachan; Morakot, Chumpol; Ottiwet, Orawan; Schmidt, Lindsey K; West, T Eoin; Burtnick, Mary N; Chantratita, Narisara; Brett, Paul J",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.698303; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394091/,1

Methods: Cross-sectional online surveys were posted on seven professional Listservs from May 2020 to June 2020. Data were summarized descriptively and with semantic content analyses. Results: N = 207 surveys were completed by pediatric palliative program representatives from 80 cities, inclusive of physicians, nurses, child life, social workers, chaplains, and psychologists. Teams consulted on <20% of potential or presumed COVID-19 cases in their centers. Sixty percent of personnel were deemed ""essential"" during the pandemic. One-third of personnel remained in their usual work locale, with some shifting to support adult palliative services and others working remotely. Over 60% reported a sense of team ""distance"" compared with ""close"" team cohesion, associated with physical location of team members (p < 0.01) and frequency of team counseling, education, or support meetings (p < 0.02). All programs adopted a form of telehealth for patient care, although 41% did not receive telehealth training and 73% perceived unequal care quality with virtual care. Absence of pediatric patients' family members due to visitation policies, missing human presence and physical touch, concern for personal and colleague health, and fear of financial sustainability for programs were notable stressors. Conclusions: While the number of children diagnosed with COVID-19 receiving hands-on care from pediatric palliative care teams was reportedly low, the coronavirus pandemic vastly impacted pediatric palliative care team structure, daily services, and communication models warranting attentiveness to lessons learned and future direction.","Weaver, Meaghann S; Rosenberg, Abby R; Fry, Abigail; Shostrom, Valerie; Wiener, Lori",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350874/,1

At the peak of the crisis, consults for palliative care increased four- to sevenfold at NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP), an academic health care system with 10 campuses throughout New York City. We share our challenges, solutions, and lessons learned to help peer institutions meet increased palliative care demands during future crises and address pre-existing palliative care subspecialist shortages during nonpandemic times. Methods: In response to the increased demand, palliative care physician and administrative leadership at NYP piloted multiple creative care models to expand access to palliative care outpatient and inpatient services. The care models included virtual outpatient management of existing patients, embedded palliative care staff, education for providers, multidisciplinary family support, hospice units (which allowed for family visitation), and team expansion through training other disciplines (primarily psychiatry) and deploying an ePalliative Care service (staffed by out-of-state volunteers). Conclusion: Our comprehensive response successfully expanded the palliative care team's reach, and, at the height of the pandemic, allowed our teams to meet the increased demand for palliative care consults. We learned that flexibility and adaptability were critical to responding to a rapidly evolving crisis. Physician and family feedback and preliminary data suggest that virtual outpatient visits, embedded staff, hospice units, and team expansion through training other disciplines and deploying ePalliative Care services were impactful interventions.","Blinderman, Craig D; Adelman, Ronald; Kumaraiah, Deepa; Pan, Cynthia X; Palathra, Brigit C; Kaley, Kate; Trongone, Noelle; Spillane, Kristen",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264065/,1
153641,Flow diversion versus traditional endovascular coiling therapy: design of the prospective LARGE aneurysm randomized trial.,2014,"INTRODUCTION In case of massive splenomegaly, laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) becomes challenging, uncomfortable and risky both for the surgeon and for the patient. As a consequence of ongoing research to obtain efficient and cheaper ""scarless surgery"", single-port technique and hand-assisted devices were developed and improved in this field. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present the clinical case of a patient affected by idiopathic myelofibrosis (MF) and splenomegaly who was admitted to our Department to perform a splenectomy for a suspected 5-cm splenic lesion. DISCUSSION The splenic longitudinal diameter measured 26 cm. The patient underwent splenectomy by laparoscopy, combining a single-port access and a gel-port device. The operation was completed laparoscopically. The operating time was 220 min and the estimate blood loss was 100 ml. The patient was discharged at 11 post-operative day in overall good conditions. Upon pathological analysis the splenic lesion was a localization of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma in the context of MF. CONCLUSION this novel ""hybrid technique"" of splenectomy, combining the advantages of reduced number of abdominal incisions of the single-port technique to those of the hand assistance, is feasible in massive splenomegaly with good results. Furthermore, the use of the sovrapubic retrieval incision as the introduction site for the hand assisted device is convincing, since it's useful for both tasks. Further studies with large casuistries are necessary to confirm the effectiveness of the technique.","Casaccia, Marco; Palombo, Denise; Fornaro, Rosario; Razzore, Andrea; Soriero, Domenico; Frascio, Marco",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2018.08.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153611/,1

The relative frequency of GBS among ED patients was higher in COVID (0.15‰) than non-COVID(0.02‰) patients (OR=6.30, 95%CI=3.18-12.5) as was the standardized incidence (9.44 and 0.69 cases/100,000-year, respectively, OR=13.5; 95%CI=9.87-18.4). Regarding clinical characteristics, olfactory-gustatory disorders were more frequent in COVID-GBS than non-COVID-GBS (OR=27.59, 95%CI=1.296-587) and COVID-non-GBS (OR=7.875, 95%CI=1.587-39.09) patients. Although COVID-GBS patients were more frequently admitted to intensive care, mortality was not increased versus control groups.

154048,Dual mechanism of action of T2 inhibitor therapies in virally induced exacerbations of asthma: evidence for a beneficial counter-regulation.,2019,"PURPOSE To propose a preprocessing technique that increases the compressibility in reversible compressions of thin-section chest computed tomographic (CT) images and to measure the increase in compression ratio (CR) in Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 2000 two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) compressions. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study had institutional review board approval, with waiver of informed patient consent. A preprocessing technique that automatically segments pixels outside the body region and replaces their values with a constant value to maximize data redundancy was developed. One hundred CT studies (50 standard-radiation dose and 50 low-radiation dose studies) were preprocessed by using the technique and then reversibly compressed by using the JPEG2000 2D and 3D compression methods. The CRs (defined as the original data size divided by the compressed data size) with and those without use of the preprocessing technique were compared by using paired t tests. The percentage increase in the CR was measured. RESULTS The CR increased significantly (without vs with preprocessing) in JPEG2000 2D (mean CR, 2.40 vs 3.80) and 3D (mean CR, 2.61 vs 3.99) compressions for the standard-dose studies and in JPEG2000 2D (mean CR, 2.38 vs 3.36) and 3D (mean CR, 2.54 vs 3.55) compressions for the low-dose studies (P < .001 for all). The mean percentage increases in CR with preprocessing were 58.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.1%, 63.4%) and 52.4% (95% CI: 47.5%, 57.2%) in JPEG2000 2D and 3D compressions, respectively, for the standard-dose studies and 41.1% (95% CI: 38.8%, 43.4%) and 39.4% (95% CI: 37.4%, 41.7%) in JPEG2000 2D and 3D compressions, respectively, for the low-dose studies. CONCLUSION The described preprocessing technique considerably increases CRs for reversible compressions of thin-section chest CT studies.","Kim, Kil Joong; Lee, Kyoung Ho; Kim, Bohyoung; Richter, Thomas; Yun, Il Dong; Lee, Sang Uk; Bae, Kyongtae Ty; Shim, Hackjoon",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.10100722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21325033/,1

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of CPV and CECoV in dogs presenting with severe diarrhoea to PDSA PetAid hospitals throughout the UK. A total of 355 samples were collected from the PDSA between 2006 and 2008. All samples were tested for CPV using a long range PCR and for CECoV using RT-PCR. The prevalence of CPV was 58 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 52 to 63 per cent), with some evidence for regional variation. The prevalence of CECoV was 7.9 per cent (95 per cent CI 5.1 to 10.7 per cent). Analysis showed that animals with no history of vaccination were more likely to be CPV positive, with greatest effect in younger animals. CPV-positive animals were more likely to present with depression/lethargy than CPV-negative cases. The volume of diarrhoea and the presence of haemorrhage did not appear to be associated with the likelihood of detecting CPV. This study shows that CPV is a common finding in dogs presenting to PDSA hospitals with severe diarrhoea, and that CECoV is a less common but still potentially important pathogen. It also confirms that young and unvaccinated animals appear to be more at risk of presenting with CPV.","Godsall, S A; Clegg, S R; Stavisky, J H; Radford, A D; Pinchbeck, G",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.c3095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20693502/,1

To find alternative candidates, here we evaluated two serologically distinct novel viral envelopes derived from Chandipura (CNV-G) and Piry (PRV-G) vesiculoviruses. Both permitted generation of high titer psuedotyped lentiviral vectors with a capacity for high efficiency gene transfer into various cell types from different species. In human lymphoid and hematopoietic stem cells, their transduction efficiency was significantly lower than that of VSV-G. However, both novel envelopes were found to be more resistant to inactivation by human serum complement compared to VSV-G. Thus CNV-G and PRV-G envelopes can be harnessed for multiple uses in the future based on the cell type that needs to be gene transduced and possibly for in vivo gene transfer.","Hu, Shuang; Mohan Kumar, Dipu; Sax, Chelsea; Schuler, Clayton; Akkina, Ramesh",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26650691/,1
154509,Cerebral Perfusion Pressure is Maintained in Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage: A CT Perfusion Study.,2016,"Biological agents such as omalizumab and monoclonal antibodies that inhibit type 2 immunity significantly reduce exacerbations, which are mainly due to viral infections, when added to inhaled corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma. The mechanisms for the therapeutic benefit of type 2 inhibitors in reducing virally-induced exacerbations, however, remain to be fully elucidated. Preclinical and clinical evidence supports the existence of a close counter-regulation of the high-affinity IgE receptor and interferon pathways, and a potential dual mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit for omalizumab and other type 2 inhibitors that inhibit IgE activity, which may enhance the prevention and treatment of virally-induced asthma exacerbations. Similar evidence regarding some novel type 2 inhibitor therapies, including biological and small molecule inhibitors, suggest that such a dual mechanism of action with enhancement of interferon production working through non-IgE pathways, might also exist. The specific mechanisms for this dual effect could be related to the close counter-regulation between type 2 and type 1 immune pathways and potential key underlying mechanisms are discussed. Further basic research and better understanding of these underlying counter-regulatory mechanisms could provide novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of virally-induced asthma exacerbations, as well as type 2 and non-type 2 driven asthma. Future clinical research should examine the effects of type 2 inhibitors on interferon responses and other type 1 immune pathways, in addition to any effects on the frequency and severity of viral and other infections and related exacerbations in patients with asthma as a priority.","Efthimiou, John; Poll, Chris; Barnes, Peter J",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02390-2018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31000674/,1

This study used the Concerns Based Adoption Model (CBAM) to explore how faculty responded to a change in the approach to assessment from focus on grades toward focus on feedback. METHOD This qualitative study used an inductive approach to analyze data from semistructured interviews with teaching faculty and education leaders at University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine 6 months following the elimination of traditional tiered clerkship grades. Participants were recruited in 2019 using purposive sampling. Interview questions addressed participants' perceptions of the new approach to assessment and grading that emphasizes assessment for learning, including advantages and concerns. The authors analyzed data using thematic analysis informed by sensitizing concepts from CBAM. RESULTS Nineteen faculty participated (11 medicine, 8 surgery). Faculty expressed optimism about the impact of the change on their clinical educator roles and sought faculty development to enhance feedback and assessment skills. Perceived benefits to students addressed learning and wellness, with concern for students' motivation and professional development. Faculty shared uncertainty about their roles and larger systemic consequences involving the residency match and institutional reputation. Participants acknowledged that traditional grading is imperfect, yet felt a departure from this system represented significant culture change. CONCLUSIONS Faculty perceptions of the assessment and grade change in two large departments demonstrate tensions around grading. Their descriptions of change as an ongoing process align with CBAM and require them to consider new approaches and perspectives. While discourse about assessment and grading frequently focuses on learners, these findings support institutional consideration of the impact of changes in assessment on teaching faculty.","McDonald, Jordan A; Lai, Cindy J; Lin, Matthew Y C; O'Sullivan, Patricia S; Hauer, Karen E",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909998/,1

Patients from four short-term trials and de novo patients were enrolled; all had confirmed MDD and a current major depressive episode lasting 2-24 months. Patients were treated with an established ADT for ≥8 weeks before receiving sublingual, adjunctive BUP/SAM 2/2 mg for up to 52 weeks. Safety (primary objective) was assessed via adverse events (AEs), the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, and the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS).

In both stages, numerous specialized metabolites are produced that have roles in symbiosis and virulence3,4. Although regulators have been implicated in the regulation of these specialized metabolites3,4, how small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are involved in this process is not clear. Here, we show that the Hfq-dependent sRNA, ArcZ, is required for specialized metabolite production in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus. We discovered that ArcZ directly base-pairs with the mRNA encoding HexA, which represses the expression of specialized metabolite gene clusters. In addition to specialized metabolite genes, we show that the ArcZ regulon affects approximately 15% of all transcripts in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus. Thus, the ArcZ sRNA is crucial for specialized metabolite production in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus species and could become a useful tool for metabolic engineering and identification of commercially relevant natural products.","Neubacher, Nick; Tobias, Nicholas J; Huber, Michaela; Cai, Xiaofeng; Glatter, Timo; Pidot, Sacha J; Stinear, Timothy P; Lütticke, Anna Lena; Papenfort, Kai; Bode, Helge B",Nature microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-00797-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139881/,1

To-date, trials of interventions to prevent or treat delirium report heterogenous outcomes. To develop international consensus among key stakeholders for a core outcome set for future trials of interventions to prevent and/or treat delirium in critically ill adults. DESIGN Core outcome set development, as recommended by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Handbook. Methods of generating items for the core outcome set included a systematic review and qualitative interviews with ICU survivors and family members. Consensus methods include a two-round web-based Delphi process and a face-to-face meeting using nominal group technique methods. SUBJECTS International representatives from three stakeholder groups: 1) clinical researchers, 2) ICU interprofessional clinicians, and 3) ICU survivors and family members. SETTING Telephone interviews, web-based surveys, and a face-to-face consensus meeting held at the 2019 European Delirium Association's annual meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland. INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Qualitative interviews with 24 ICU survivors and family members identified 36 potential outcomes; six were additional to the 97 identified from the systematic review. After item reduction, 32 outcomes were presented in Delphi Round 1; 179 experts participated, 38 ICU survivors/family members (21%), 100 clinicians (56%), 41 researchers (23%). Three additional outcomes were added to Round 2; 134 Round 1 participants (75%) completed it.

The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST-PC©) is a virtual simulator that was developed as a computerized version of the pattern cutting (PC) task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system. To establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PC©, we assessed trainees' learning curves using the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method and compared them with those on the FLS. METHODS Twenty-four medical students were randomly assigned to an FLS training group, a VBLaST training group, or a control group. Fifteen training sessions, 30 min in duration per session per day, were conducted over 3 weeks. All subjects completed pretest, posttest, and retention test (2 weeks after posttest) on both the FLS and VBLaST© simulators. Performance data, including time, error, FLS score, learning rate, learning plateau, and CUSUM score, were analyzed. RESULTS The learning curve for all trained subjects demonstrated increasing performance and a performance plateau. CUSUM analyses showed that five of the seven subjects reached the intermediate proficiency level but none reached the expert proficiency level after 150 practice trials. Performance was significantly improved after simulation training, but only in the assigned simulator. No significant decay of skills after 2 weeks of disuse was observed. Control subjects did not show any learning on the FLS simulator, but improved continually in the VBLaST simulator. CONCLUSIONS Although VBLaST©- and FLS-trained subjects demonstrated similar learning rates and plateaus, the majority of subjects required more than 150 trials to achieve proficiency. Trained subjects demonstrated improved performance in only the assigned simulator, indicating specificity of training. The virtual simulator may provide better opportunities for learning, especially with limited training exposure.","Linsk, Ali M; Monden, Kimberley R; Sankaranarayanan, Ganesh; Ahn, Woojin; Jones, Daniel B; De, Suvranu; Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Cao, Caroline G L",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5895-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29052071/,1

154945,Transforming essential services for tuberculosis during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from New York City.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Cancer is a global disease that affects all populations, including Muslims. Psychological and spiritual care of Muslim patients with cancer includes psychosocial and spiritual techniques that help to improve their mental health and spiritual well-being. Although these techniques are available to cancer patients worldwide, they are poorly studied among Muslim patients. This review aims to integrate the literature on the psychosocial-spiritual outcomes and perspectives of Muslim patients with cancer who have undergone psychotherapy. METHOD We used the Whittemore and Knafl five-step methodology. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO using relevant keywords. Studies that focused on adult patients with cancer and on published evidence of using psychosocial and spiritual interventions among Muslim patients were included. Each study was reviewed, evaluated, and integrated. RESULTS A systematic search produced 18 studies that were thematically analyzed. Results showed different psychosocial and spiritual approaches currently used to care for Muslim patients with cancer that target mainly patients' mental health, quality of life, and spiritual well-being. Four major themes emerged: (1) Treating Psychological Distress Without Psychopharmacologic Agents, (2) Improving Knowledge of Cancer for Improving QOL, (3) Depending on Faith for Spiritual Well-being, and (4) Relying on Religious and Spiritual Sources: Letting Go, Letting God. CONCLUSIONS The rigor of psychosocial and spiritual studies that target psychosocial-spiritual outcomes of Muslim cancer patients needs to be improved to reach conclusive evidence about their efficacy in this population.","Abu Khait, Abdallah; Lazenby, Mark",BMC palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-021-00746-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781246/,1

Solar radiation exposure has diurnal effects on thermoregulatory responses during high-intensity exercise in the heat outdoors. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-This study investigated the diurnal effects of variations in solar radiation associated with changing solar elevation angle on thermoregulatory responses during high-intensity exercise in the heat outdoors. Ten male high school soccer players completed two 2-hour soccer training sessions under a clear sky in the heat of summer. These sessions were commenced at 0900 hours (AM) and 1600 hours (PM) on separate days. Solar radiation and elevation angle were higher in AM (820-1,070 W·m and 45-69°) than PM (620-110 W·m and 34-10°: both p < 0.001). Neither ambient temperature (AM 29-32° C; PM 31-31° C) nor wet-bulb globe temperature was different between trials. Although mean skin temperature was not different between trials, infrared tympanic temperature was higher at the end of exercise in AM than PM (p < 0.001). Heart rate (p < 0.01) and body heat gain from the sun (p < 0.001) were greater during exercise in AM than PM. Dry heat loss was smaller, but evaporative heat loss was greater in AM than PM (both p < 0.001). Thermal sensation and rating of perceived exertion were similar between trials, but GPS measurements showed a less total distance and distance covered by walking, jogging, and running in AM than PM (p < 0.01). This study demonstrates a greater thermoregulatory strain in AM than PM during 2-hour high-intensity soccer training in the heat under a clear sky. This observation is accompanied by a progressive increase in environmental heat stress with rising solar radiation and elevation angle in AM and a greater body heat gain from the sun in AM compared with PM.","Otani, Hidenori; Goto, Takayuki; Goto, Heita; Hosokawa, Yuri; Shirato, Minayuki",Journal of strength and conditioning research,https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000003260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31361730/,1

Up to 80% success rates with 4% ethanol sclerosing have been documented while the remainder require operational removal of the painful nerve. We sought to evaluate the histological characteristics of Morton's neuromas treated with either 4% ethanol sclerosing injection versus steroid injection alone from patients who required removal of the nerve for pain relief. METHODS A retrospective histologic review was performed on 24 consecutive patients who were treated with either sclerosing injection versus non-sclerosing injection and underwent nerve removal between 2012 to 2015. RESULTS 19 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 8 patients received sclerosing injections and 11 patients received non-sclerosing injections. Intraneural fibrosis was seen higher in the non-sclerosing injection group (p = 0.008).

156482,Myositis autoantibodies: recent perspectives.,2020-09-02,"We are currently faced with a global infectious disease crisis which has been anticipated for decades. While many promising biotherapeutics are being tested, the search for a small molecule has yet to deliver an approved drug or therapeutic for the Ebola or similar filoviruses that cause haemorrhagic fever. Two recent high throughput screens published in 2013 did however identify several hits that progressed to animal studies that are FDA approved drugs used for other indications. The current computational analysis uses these molecules from two different structural classes to construct a common features pharmacophore. This ligand-based pharmacophore implicates a possible common target or mechanism that could be further explored. A recent structure based design project yielded nine co-crystal structures of pyrrolidinone inhibitors bound to the viral protein 35 (VP35). When receptor-ligand pharmacophores based on the analogs of these molecules and the protein structures were constructed, the molecular features partially overlapped with the common features of solely ligand-based pharmacophore models based on FDA approved drugs. These previously identified FDA approved drugs with activity against Ebola were therefore docked into this protein. The antimalarials chloroquine and amodiaquine docked favorably in VP35. We propose that these drugs identified to date as inhibitors of the Ebola virus may be targeting VP35. These computational models may provide preliminary insights into the molecular features that are responsible for their activity against Ebola virus in vitro and in vivo and we propose that this hypothesis could be readily tested.","Ekins, Sean; Freundlich, Joel S; Coffee, Megan",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.5741.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25653841/,1

METHODS Airway management (need for LM repositioning, orotracheal intubation because of failed LM insertion), anticipated difficult airway, and airway complications were registered. Statistics were compared between groups with the t test or the χ test, as appropriate. RESULTS A total of 358 cases were reviewed from 2008 to 2013. Tracheal intubation was performed in 108 patients and LM was chosen for 250 patients (69.8%). Intubated patients had a higher mean age and rate of anticipated difficult airway; duration of surgery was longer (P<0.001, all comparisons). LM insertion and anesthetic induction proved effective in 97.2% of the LM-ventilated patients; 7 patients (2.8%) were intubated because of persistent leakage. Incidences with airway management were resolved without compromising patient safety. CONCLUSION LM airway management during lumbar neurosurgery in knee-chest position is feasible for selected patients when the anesthetist is experienced.","Hurtado, Paola; Fàbregas, Neus; Forero, Carolina; Tercero, Javier; Carrero, Enrique; de Riva, Nicolas; Gracia, Isabel; Lopez, Anna M; Valero, Ricard",Journal of neurosurgical anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ana.0000000000000277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807696/,1
157314,The role of ibuprofen in the treatment of coronavirus infection,2020-12-13,"Importance Composite grafting in nasal reconstruction involves transplanting auricular chondrocutaneous grafts, but the optimal design of these grafts is unknown. Objectives To investigate the ideal ratio of skin to cartilage as well as study the importance of the perichondrial attachment for graft survival. Design, Setting, and Participants A New England white rabbit model was used in this study, performed at the Laboratory for Animal Research at University of Kansas Medical Center from January 25 to March 18, 2016. Four varying designs of chondrocutaneous auricular grafts were transplanted to dorsal back defects, with a total of 10 grafts per treatment arm completed. The following 4 chondrocutaneous circular grafts were designed: group A, 1.5-cm diameter graft of equal skin to cartilage ratio; group B, 2.0-cm diameter skin and 1.5-cm diameter cartilage; group C, 1.5-cm diameter skin and 2.0-cm diameter cartilage; and group D, 1.5-cm diameter skin and cartilage separated and placed back together in a layered fashion. Grafts were observed until postoperative day 21, harvested, and evaluated with visual observation as well as histopathologic assessment. Main Outcomes and Measures Visually graded areas of survival were marked by 2 blinded academic facial plastic surgeons and calculated for approximate survival. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained, paraffin-embedded 5-μm slides were evaluated for overall survival rate, rate of cartilage necrosis, and mean vessel density per high-power field. In both cases, observers were blinded as to the study group. Results Visual assessments of the 5 female rabbits showed significant agreement between surgeons and consistency, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.84 and an intraclass correlation of 0.98. Group D (skin and cartilage separation) was visually graded to have significantly decreased mean survival (45.4%; 95% CI, 23.3%-67.4%) compared with group A (mean survival, 97.4%; 95% CI, 94.8%-99.9%; P < .001), group B (mean survival, 87.6%; 95% CI, 69.9%-100%; P = .004), and group C (mean survival, 82.1%; 95% CI, 66.0%-98.1%; P = .008). Histopathologic assessment revealed that group D again showed significantly inferior overall survival, increased cartilage necrosis, and decreased mean vessel density compared with group A. Group C additionally showed significantly decreased cartilage survival compared with group A (65% vs 0%; P < .001) and group B (65% vs 35%; P = .02). Conclusions and Relevance These results represent preliminary evidence that the attachment of skin to perichondrium in a composite graft plays an important role for graft survival. Clinicians performing nasal reconstruction with chondrocutaneous composite grafts should consider preserving attachments at this junction to improve graft survival.

This study involved the comparison of the full S1 sequences of five IB viruses, namely two Massachusetts and three 793/B serotypes, isolated from IB outbreaks during 2001-2002, with all other Iranian and foreign 793/B isolates and 10 known serotypes. Analysis of S1 subunit showed three unique amino acid changes at positions 349 (V to L), 392 (T to N), and 393 (Q or R to T or K or S) for the Iranian 793/B isolates, compared to those of the foreign 793/B isolates reported before 2006 (onset of vaccination with 793/B vaccine in Iran). They were used as amino acid markers for the differentiation of Iranian 793/B isolates for years. Sequence alignment of the Iranian isolates with those of the foreign ones reported after 2006 demonstrated that amino acids 392 and 393 were no longer considered as amino acid markers, and only the change in amino acid 349 still remained specific to the Iranian 793/B isolates. Phylogenetic tree sequence analysis revealed that the Iranian 793/B isolates were closely related indicating that they came from a single source, more probably from France. There was a very close correlation between the first detection of 793/B serotype and the time of French chicken meat importation. Moreover, it was shown that one of the Massachusetts isolates was completely identical with the H120 vaccine strain. Furthermore, the other Massachusetts isolate with two amino acid changes at positions 64 (G to E) and 95 (S to R) was very similar to this vaccine strain. It seems that the latter isolate is a passaged chicken H120 vaccine strain.","Toroghi, R; Salarpour, A; Momayez, R",Archives of Razi Institute,https://doi.org/10.22092/ari.2019.123468.1254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31013004/,1

The meeting shared regional update on situation and responses, and COVID-19 related experiences of selected WHO CCs, followed by discussions on opportunities for enhancing collaboration between WPRO and WHO CCs. Priorities of WPROs support to countries included a health systems approach rather than single intervention. On behalf of WHO CCs in Japan, the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) delivered a presentation on the results of a survey about COVID-19 related activities of these WHO CCs. These activities were categorized into collaboration with WHO, research and development, public health responses, and clinical services. Collaboration with WHO included sending consultants through the scheme of GOARN, strengthening of COVID-19 testing, and contribution to development of WPRO guidelines. Research and development involved establishment of a nationwide registry of COVID-19 clinical data. Following the meeting, NCGM further enhanced its activities as WHO CC. Since WHO CCs in the country have a wide range of expertise that could contribute to health system strengthening, it is worthwhile for the WHO CCs to consider amending existing work plans for supporting countries in the region to incorporate a health systems approach as part of COVID-19 response strategies.","Fujita, Masami; Umeda, Tamami; Fujita, Noriko; Nishioka, Tomoko; Iwamoto, Azusa; Ohmagari, Norio; Ishikane, Masahiro; Akashi, Hidechika; Kokudo, Norihiro",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937576/,1

We herein describe the systematic development process of a campaign aimed to increase stroke awareness and preparedness. METHODS Campaign development followed Intervention Mapping (IM), a theory- and evidence-based tool, and was articulated in two phases: needs assessment and intervention development. In phase 1, two cross-sectional surveys were performed, one aiming to measure stroke awareness in the target population and the other to analyze the behavioral determinants of prehospital delay. In phase 2, a matrix of proximal program objectives was developed, theory-based intervention methods and practical strategies were selected and program components and materials produced. RESULTS In phase 1, the survey on 202 citizens highlighted underestimation of symptom severity, as in only 44% of stroke situations respondents would choose to call the emergency service (EMS). In the survey on 393 consecutive patients, 55% presented over 2 hours after symptom onset; major determinants were deciding to call the general practitioner first and the reaction of the first person the patient called. In phase 2, adult individuals were identified as the target of the intervention, both as potential ""patients"" and witnesses of stroke. The low educational level found in the patient survey called for a narrative approach in cartoon form. The family setting was chosen for the message because 42% of patients who presented within 2 hours had been advised by a family member to call EMS. To act on people's tendency to view stroke as an untreatable disease, it was decided to avoid fear-arousal appeals and use a positive message providing instructions and hope. Focus groups were used to test educational products and identify the most suitable sites for message dissemination. CONCLUSIONS The IM approach allowed to develop a stroke campaign integrating theories, scientific evidence and information collected from the target population, and enabled to provide clear explanations for the reasons behind key decisions during the intervention development process.

157992,On Flow Diversion: The Changing Landscape of Intracerebral Aneurysm Management.,2019,"Coacervates are condensed liquid-like droplets formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of molecules through multiple weak associative interactions. In recent years it has emerged that not only long polymers, but also short peptides are capable of forming simple and complex coacervates. The coacervate droplets they form act as compartments that sequester and concentrate a wide range of solutes, and their spontaneous formation make coacervates attractive protocell models. The main advantage of peptides as building blocks lies in the functional diversity of the amino acid residues, which allows for tailoring of the peptide's phase separation propensity, their selectivity in guest molecule uptake and the physicochemical and catalytic properties of the compartments. The aim of this tutorial review is to illustrate the recent developments in the field of peptide-based coacervates in a systematic way and to deduce the basic requirements for both simple and complex coacervation of peptides. We review a selection of peptide coacervates that illustrates the essentials of phase separation, the limitations, and the properties that make peptide coacervates biomimetic protocells. Finally, we provide some perspectives of this novel research field in the direction of active droplets, moving away from thermodynamic equilibrium.","Abbas, Manzar; Lipiński, Wojciech P; Wang, Jiahua; Spruijt, Evan",Chemical Society reviews,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cs00307g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616129/,1

Computer-based auditory training programs are under development for reducing the cost and time. The aim of this study is to develop a computer-based auditory training program and to evaluate the usability of the program by applying it to adults with normal hearing indifferent age groups and professions. The developed auditory training program consists of nine modules: identification, discrimination, recognition, auditory closure, comprehension, auditory sequencing, phonological awareness, auditory memory, and attention. Forty adults (age ranges of 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, and 55-65 years), nine audiologists, and one software engineer were included in this study. The computer-based auditory training program was applied to all individuals. An evaluation form was filled out by the participants to evaluate the usability of and satisfaction with the program, and the average performances of the individuals were calculated for each module. The form measures five usability subscales: ease of use, comprehensibility, design, satisfaction, and motivation. The professionals evaluated the program and found it to be quite positive in terms of design, ease of use, motivation, and comprehensibility, and positive in terms of the satisfaction subscale. The participants evaluated all factors and found them to be quite positive. There were no statistically significant differences between the gender, age, and computer use groups in terms of the average performance value of the modules (p > 0.05). However, a significant difference was found in the average performance for the auditory sequencing module considering the educational status of individuals (p = 0.019). Furthermore, it was determined that computer experience (> 5 years) and having a personal computer have a significant effect on auditory memory (p = 0.049) and identification (p = 0.027). These results show that the instructions and information used in the program are clear and understandable, the colors and texts used in the program are readable, the program is easy to use, and the individuals are not disturbed by the sounds used in the program.

METHODS We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science. We identified randomized controlled trials that compared HFNC to conventional oxygen therapy. We pooled data and report summary estimates of effect using relative risk for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference or standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane tool and certainty in pooled effect estimates using GRADE methods. RESULTS We included 9 RCTs (n = 2093 patients). We found no difference in mortality in patients treated with HFNC (relative risk [RR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-1.31, moderate certainty) compared to conventional oxygen therapy. We found a decreased risk of requiring intubation (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99) or escalation of oxygen therapy (defined as crossover to HFNC in the control group, or initiation of non-invasive ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation in either group) favouring HFNC-treated patients (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.98), although certainty in both outcomes was low due to imprecision and issues related to risk of bias. HFNC had no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (mean difference [MD] 1.38 days more, 95% CI 0.90 days fewer to 3.66 days more, low certainty), hospital length of stay (MD 0.85 days fewer, 95% CI 2.07 days fewer to 0.37 days more, moderate certainty), patient reported comfort (SMD 0.12 lower, 95% CI 0.61 lower to 0.37 higher, very low certainty) or patient reported dyspnea (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.16 lower, 95% CI 1.10 lower to 1.42 higher, low certainty). Complications of treatment were variably reported amongst included studies, but little harm was associated with HFNC use. CONCLUSION In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC may decrease the need for tracheal intubation without impacting mortality.","Rochwerg, B; Granton, D; Wang, D X; Helviz, Y; Einav, S; Frat, J P; Mekontso-Dessap, A; Schreiber, A; Azoulay, E; Mercat, A; Demoule, A; Lemiale, V; Pesenti, A; Riviello, E D; Mauri, T; Mancebo, J; Brochard, L; Burns, K",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-019-05590-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30888444/,1

Future directions to create a transplant workforce that reflects the diversity of the US population are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS Representation of women and racial and ethnic minorities among transplant surgeons is minimal. Although recent data shows an improvement in the number of Black transplant surgeons from 2% to 5.5% and an increase in women to 12%, the White to Non-White transplant workforce ratio has increased 35% from 2000 to 2013. Transplant surgeons report an average of 4.3 call nights per week and less than five leisure days a month. Transplant ranks 1st among surgical sub-specialties in the prevalence of three well-studied facets of burnout. Concerns about lifestyle may contribute to the decreasing demand for advanced training in abdominal transplantation by US graduates. SUMMARY Minimal improvements have been made in transplant surgery workforce diversity. Sustained and intentional recruitment and promotion efforts are needed to improve the representation of women and minority physicians and advanced practice providers in the field.","Valbuena, Valeria S M; Obayemi, Joy E; Purnell, Tanjala S; Scantlebury, Velma P; Olthoff, Kim M; Martins, Paulo N; Higgins, Robert S; Blackstock, Daryle M; Dick, André A S; Watkins, Anthony C; Englesbe, Michael J; Simpson, Dinee C",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524181/,1

The challenges faced by residents because of lack of exposure as a result of working-time directives-and now the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic limiting nonurgent and elective operating-reinforce the need for evidence-based simulation training. Although a wide range of training platforms have been developed, very few have shown transfer of skills. Simulation is thought to enhance the initial phase of the procedural learning curve; however, this hypothesis is yet to be tested in a high-quality study. Nevertheless, in light of the current evidence, simulation-based procedural curricula should be developed using the strengths of multiple different training platforms while incorporating the essential concept of nontechnical skills.","Iqbal, Mohammed Husnain; Khan, Omeair; Aydın, Abdullatif",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33673956/,1

Remarkably, recent studies have shown that acute cardiovascular exercise can improve motor memory, but the cortical mechanisms are not completely understood. We investigated whether an acute bout of lower-limb high-intensity interval (HIT) exercise could promote motor memory formation in humans through changes in cortical inhibition within the hand region of the primary motor cortex. We used TMS to assess the input-output relationship, along with inhibition involving GABAA and GABAB receptors. Measures were obtained before and after a 20-min session of HIT cycling (exercise group) or rest (control group). We then had the same participants learn a new visuomotor skill and perform a retention test 5 hr later in the absence of sleep. No differences were found in corticomotor excitability or GABAB inhibition; however, synaptic GABAA inhibition was significantly reduced for the exercise group but not the control group. HIT exercise was found to enhance motor skill consolidation. These findings link modification of GABA to improved motor memory consolidation after HIT exercise and suggest that the beneficial effects of exercise on consolidation might not be dependent on sleep.","Stavrinos, Ellen L; Coxon, James P",Journal of cognitive neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27897671/,1
159075,Targets for antiviral therapy of hepatitis C.,2014,"ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to cause significant medical quality enhancements and cost-saving improvements in ophthalmology. Although there has been a rapid growth of studies on AI in the recent years, real-world adoption of AI is still rare. One reason may be because the data derived from economic evaluations of AI in health care, which policy makers used for adopting new technology, have been fragmented and scarce. Most data on economics of AI in ophthalmology are from diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Few studies classified costs of AI software, which has been considered as a medical device, into direct medical costs. These costs of AI are composed of initial and maintenance costs. The initial costs may include investment in research and development, and costs for validation of different datasets. Meanwhile, the maintenance costs include costs for algorithms upgrade and hardware maintenance in the long run. The cost of AI should be balanced between manufacturing price and reimbursements since it may pose significant challenges and barriers to providers. Evidence from cost-effectiveness analyses showed that AI, either standalone or used with humans, was more cost-effective than manual DR screening. Notably, economic evaluation of AI for DR screening can be used as a model for AI to other ophthalmic diseases.","Ruamviboonsuk, Paisan; Chantra, Somporn; Seresirikachorn, Kasem; Ruamviboonsuk, Varis; Sangroongruangsri, Sermsiri",Asia-Pacific journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/apo.0000000000000403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34261102/,1

Washington was one of the first U.S. states to report cases of COVID-19. Public health surveillance shows that 31% of Washington cases are Latinx, despite being only 13% of the state population. Unjust policies related to immigration, labor, housing, transportation, and education have contributed to both past and existing inequities. Approximately 20% of Latinx are uninsured, leading to delays in testing and medical care for COVID-19, and early reports indicated critical shortages in professional interpreters and multilingual telehealth options. Washington State is taking action to address some of these inequities. Applying a health equity framework, we describe key factors contributing to COVID-19-related health inequities among Latinx populations, and how Washington State has aimed to address these inequities.

Here, we propose a concerted mechanism of associative and dissociative routes for ammonia synthesis over a cobalt-loaded nitride catalyst. Isotope exchange experiments reveal that the adsorbed N2 can be activated on both Co metal and the nitride support, which leads to superior low-temperature catalytic performance. The cooperation of the surface low work function (2.6 eV) feature and the formation of surface nitrogen vacancies on the CeN support gives rise to a dual pathway for N2 activation with much reduced activation energy (45 kJ·mol-1) over that of Co-based catalysts reported so far, which results in efficient ammonia synthesis under mild conditions.","Ye, Tian-Nan; Park, Sang-Won; Lu, Yangfan; Li, Jiang; Wu, Jiazhen; Sasase, Masato; Kitano, Masaaki; Hosono, Hideo",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c06657; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369762/,1

The toll from COVID-19 is also inevitably surpassing hepatitis toll by the beginning of 2021. Moreover, it should be noted that COVID-19 has seriously impacted health services for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, hypertension, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. The most common reasons for the disruption of health services are cancellations of scheduled treatments, a paucity in public transport and a lack of staff due to reassignment of a number of health professionals to COVID-19 works.

The aim of this study was to assess the short-term and mid-term effects of neurorehabilitation via hippotherapy on the contractile properties of two key postural muscles during functional sitting in such patients. Thirty-minute hippotherapy sessions were conducted biweekly for 12 weeks in 18 patients (18.1 ± 5.7 years old). Surface electromyography (EMG) was implemented bilaterally in rectus abdominis and adductor magnus. We quantitatively analyzed the amplitude of EMG signals in the time domain and its spectral characteristics in the frequency domain. EMGs were recorded at the beginning and end of each session on day one and at week six and week twelve. Statistical analysis revealed a substantial inter-day reliability of the EMG signals for both muscles, validating the methodological approach. To a lesser extent, while beyond the scope of the current study, quantitative changes suggested a more selective recruitment/contractile properties' shift of the examined muscles. Exploring postural control during functional activities would contribute to understanding the relationship between structural impairment, activity performance and patient capabilities, allowing the design of neurorehabilitation programs aimed at improving postural and functional skills according to each individual's needs. The present study provides basic quantitative data supporting the body of scientific evidence making hippotherapy an approach of choice for CP neurorehabilitation.","Viruega, Hélène; Gaillard, Inès; Briatte, Laura; Gaviria, Manuel",Brain sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10050281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384678/,1

Therefore, we hypothesize that a MUC1 VNTR TACA-conjugate can be successfully formulated into a liposome-based anticancer vaccine. The immunogenicity of the vaccine should be further augmented by incorporating surface-displayed l-rhamnose (Rha) epitopes onto the liposomes to take advantage of a natural antibody-dependent antigen uptake mechanism. To validate our hypothesis, we synthesized a 20-amino-acid MUC1 glycopeptide containing a GalNAc-O-Thr (Tn) TACA by SPPS and conjugated it to a functionalized Toll-like receptor ligand (TLRL). An l-Rha-cholesterol conjugate was prepared using tetra(ethylene glycol) (TEG) as a linker. The liposome-based anticancer vaccine was formulated by the extrusion method using TLRL-MUC1-Tn conjugate, Rha-TEG-cholesterol, and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) in a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The stability, homogeneity, and size characterization of the liposomes was evaluated by SEM and DLS measurements. The formulated liposomes demonstrated positive binding with both anti-Rha and mouse anti-human MUC1 antibodies. Groups of female BALB/c mice were immunized and boosted with a rhamnose-Ficoll (Rha-Ficoll) conjugate formulated with alum as adjuvant to generate the appropriate concentration of anti-Rha antibodies in the mice. Anti-Rha antibody titers were >25-fold higher in the groups of mice immunized with the Rha-Ficoll conjugate than the nonimmunized control groups. The mice were then immunized with the TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomal vaccine formulated either with or without the surface displaying Rha epitopes. Sera collected from the groups of mice initially immunized with Rha-Ficoll and later vaccinated with the Rha-displaying TLRL-MUC1-Tn liposomes showed a >8-fold increase in both anti-MUC1-Tn and anti-Tn antibody titers in comparison to the groups of mice that did not receive Rha-Ficoll. T-cells from BALB/c mice primed with a MUC1-Tn peptide demonstrated increased proliferation to the Rha-liposomal vaccine in the presence of antibodies isolated from Rha-Ficoll immunized mice compared to nonimmune mice, supporting the proposed effect on antigen presentation. The anti-MUC1-Tn antibodies in the vaccinated mice serum recognized MUC1 on human leukemia U266 cells. Because this vaccine uses separate rhamnose and antigenic epitope components, the vaccine can easily be targeted to different antigens or epitopes by changing the peptide without having to change the other components.","Sarkar, Sourav; Salyer, Alex C D; Wall, Katherine A; Sucheck, Steven J",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc300422a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23444835/,1

The choice of experimental models, timeframe and approaches for evaluating drugs and vaccines under development is crucial for the development of effective measures to prevent and control this disease.The purpose of this review was to summarize the relevant data concerning the susceptibility of laboratory animals to SARS-CoV-2. This paper describes the most virus-susceptible animal species that can be used to reproduce coronavirus infection, stressing the main advantages and disadvantages of each of them.According to the latest data, small rodents (Rodentia) and non-human primates (Strepsirrhini) are commonly used in the scientific community to model coronavirus infection. The viral load in the upper and lower parts of the respiratory system, clinical symptoms of infection (weight loss, body temperature and general health status), pathomorphological picture in target organs and the production of antibodies after infection are considered to the main markers of pathology. Despite the vast amount of data, none of the described models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be considered a gold standard, since they do not reproduce all spectrum of morphological and pathogenetic mechanisms of infection, and do not fully reflect the clinical picture observed in patients in human population.Based on the analyzed literature data, we suppose that Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and mice (Muridae) expressing the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) are the most suitable animal species for their use in experiments with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The development of neutralizing antibodies makes it possible to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines, while the course and severity of symptoms infection makes the use of mice and hamsters especially popular for screening pharmacological substances with antiviral mechanism of action, when their administration can prevent or slow the disease progression.","Petrova, N V; Ganina, K K; Tarasov, S A",Voprosy virusologii,https://doi.org/10.36233/0507-4088-47; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993680/,1

This systematic review (SR) gives an updated approach to this health issue. SUMMARY We searched 6 databases. We ultimately included 11 publications: 4 cohort studies, 1 case-crossover study, 2 community case-control studies, and 4 SRs. Overall, 1 SR described studies already included; 3 studies reported a 2- to 4-fold overall increase in risk; 1 study reported an increased risk of suicide among epilepsy patients on AEDs with high risk of depression; 1study showed a protective effect among epilepsy patients; 2 studies were conducted with patients with bipolar disorder (1 showed a protective effect, whereas the other showed a 3-fold increase in risk of suicide), and the other 3 studies reported results for single AEDs. Several biases affected the published results. KEY MESSAGES There is no clear evidence of an association between the use of AEDs and an increased risk of suicide because of the heterogeneity in the studies at the clinical and methodological level.

AREAS COVERED In this Expert Review, we first discuss the scope of the economic costs of SU to society and the methods used to estimate them. In general, cost studies should not be limited to SUDs, but should also include costs related to the consequences of any type of SU to achieve a comprehensive picture of the societal burden. Further, estimating potentially avoidable costs will increase the value of cost studies. Importantly, methodologically sound cost studies shed light on the magnitude of societal problems related to SU and can be used as a reference point to evaluate regulatory policies and other preventive measures. The area of estimating potential economic benefits of SU is understudied and lacks a theoretical and methodological framework. EXPERT OPINION Overall, economic studies on the impact of SU and SUDs can strongly contribute to better-informed decision-making in the creation of regulatory and control policies. The least developed area of research refers to a consensus methodology that could be used in studies which compare economic costs to potential economic benefits.","Manthey, Jakob; Hassan, Syed Ahmed; Carr, Sinclair; Kilian, Carolin; Kuitunen-Paul, Sören; Rehm, Jürgen",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737167.2021.1916470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899647/,1
162162,Post-Transplant Hepatic Artery Pseudoaneurysm Treated with the Pipeline Flow-Diverting Stent.,2015,"BACKGROUND The Lotrach endotracheal tube has a unique low-volume, low-pressure (LVLP) cuff, which has been designed to prevent pressure injury to the tracheal wall. We aimed to estimate the pressure exerted on the tracheal wall by the LVLP cuff and a conventional cuff in a bench-top, clinical and radiological study. METHOD In the bench-top study, a model trachea was intubated with the LVLP cuff and the conventional cuff. The cuff pressure was controlled using a constant pressure device. We assessed the pressure exerted on the tracheal wall by measuring the ability of the cuffs to support a column of water using a standard protocol. In the clinical study, we tested the ability of both cuffs to prevent air leak during a staged recruitment manoeuvre. In the radiological study, we recorded the degree of anatomical distortion of the trachea from both cuffs in the antero-posterior (AP) and transverse tracheal diameters. We performed statistical analysis using non-inferiority tests. RESULTS In the bench-top study, the LVLP cuff achieved a plateau at a mean height of 25.2 cmH2O (SD 0.34). In contrast, the conventional cuff failed to maintain any water above the cuff and a plateau could not be measured. In the clinical study, the mean pressure at which air leak occurred was 30.0 +/- 0.8 cmH2O (SD 3.8) using the LVLP cuff and 32.4 +/- 0.7 cmH2O (SD 3.0) using the conventional cuff. In the radiological study, the mean degree of anatomical distortion of the trachea in AP and transverse tracheal diameter was 2.9 +/- 2.2 mm (SD 2.1) and 1.8 +/- 1.4 mm (SD 1.4) using the LVLP cuff and 4.4 +/- 1.3 mm (SD 1.4) and 2.6 +/- 1.5 mm (SD 1.6) using the conventional cuff. CONCLUSIONS The bench-top and clinical studies both demonstrated that the LVLP cuff exerted approximately 30 cmH2O of pressure on the tracheal wall. These results are supported by our radiological study. We conclude that the LVLP cuff exerts an acceptable amount of pressure on the tracheal wall when it is operated at the recommended intracuff pressure.","Doyle, Alex; Santhirapala, Ramai; Crowe, Martin; Blunt, Mark; Young, Peter",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2253-10-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21143882/,1
162364,Conceptual approaches to finding effective treatment for a new coronavirus infection at different stages,2021,"The internet of things (IoT) and deep learning are emerging technologies in diverse research fields, including the provision of IT services in medical domains. In the COVID-19 era, intelligent medication behavior monitoring systems for stable patient monitoring are further required, because many patients cannot easily visit hospitals. Several previous studies made use of wearable devices to detect medication behaviors of patients. However, the wearable devices cause inconvenience while equipping the devices. In addition, they suffer from inconsistency problems due to errors of measured values. We devise a medication behavior monitoring system that uses the IoT and deep learning to avoid sensing errors and improve user experiences by effectively detecting various activities of patients. Based on the real-time operation of our proposed IoT device, the proposed solution processes captured images of patents via OpenPose to check medication situations. The proposed system identifies medication status on time by using a human activity recognition scheme and provides various notifications to patients' mobile devices. To support reliable communication between our system and doctors, we employ MQTT protocol with periodic data transmissions. Thus, the measured information of patient's medication status is transmitted to the doctors so that they can periodically perform remote treatments. Experimental results show that all medication behaviors are accurately detected and notified to the doctor efficiently, improving the accuracy of monitoring the patient's medication behavior.","Roh, Hyeji; Shin, Seulgi; Han, Jinseo; Lim, Sangsoon",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757196/,1

The COVID-19 crisis is changing this situation dramatically, creating a high demand for highly interactive formats and fostering exchange between conversation partners about the course content. Systems are required that are able to communicate with students verbally, to answer their questions, and to check the students’ knowledge. While technological advances have made such systems possible in principle, the game stopper is the large amount of manual work and knowledge that must be put into designing such a system and feeding it the right content. In this publication, we present a first system to overcome the aforementioned drawback by automatically generating a corresponding dialog system from slide-based presentations, such as PowerPoint, OpenOffice, or Keynote, which can be dynamically adapted to the respective students and their needs. Our first experiments confirm the proof of concept and reveal that such a system can be very handy for both respective groups, learners and lecturers, alike.

170450,"Cumulative effects of particulate matter pollution and meteorological variables on the risk of influenza-like illness in Bialystok, Poland",2021-01-20,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide a decision support tool to deal with the problem of seting priorites among patients competing for limited health care resources. Limited resources and unlimited demands prevent health-care services to be provided to all those in need. This became publicity evident with the current Covid-19 pandemic. Although controversial, health care rationing has always existed and is now inevitable. Setting priorities becomes then inevitable. How to define those priorities is a complex and yet irresolvable issue mainly because it involves several and conflicting criteria, translated into efficiency and equity considerations. This is why multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was introduced to health care as an appropriate decision-support framework for solving complex problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes the application of two combined approaches – analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and AHP-VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), as decision support tools to rank patients with competing needs in a more effective and equitable way. A rationing scenario involving four patients, differentiated by personal characteristics and health conditions, is used to illustrate, test and compare the applicability of both approaches. After extraction of the relative weights of the prioritization criteria involved in the hypothetical scenario from paired wise comparison methods, TOPSIS and VIKOR priority setting methods were designed. Findings: Results suggest that patients ranking from both combination approaches are similar and in accordance with the order made directly by health-care professionals. Therefore, the relative weights computed by AHP in combination with TOPSIS and/or VIKOR methods could be used with suitable applicability by health-care decision-makers. Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to apply a combination of MCDA methods to patients’ prioritization context and the first to cross previous studies to deepen and consolidate the research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Pinho, M.; Moura, A.",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jstpm-01-2021-0008,1
171750,Viral infections in lung transplantation,2021,"Purpose Pandemics are a serious challenge for humanity, as their social and economic impacts can be tremendous. This study aims to understand how innovation based in the sharing economy (SE) business models can contribute to overcoming the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach Following a netnographic approach, the authors studied the computer-mediated social interactions of internet-based virtual innovation communities. Findings This study found that the SE business models contribute to overcome the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic by redistributing idle resources to lessen the impacts of confinement. This was achieved through process innovations and an innovative use of the network, which enabled fast-open and decentralized innovation processes, and quick implementation of innovations. This innovation process is based on a decentralized decision-making approach, clear rules, informal relationship among community members and open communication channels, as well as in evasive strategies to avoid facing challenges, institutional restrictions and barriers in the adoption of innovations. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to a virtual innovation community of highly specialized and educated experts and nine community projects focused on institutional contexts of a developed country. Future research should focus on the institutional contexts of less specialized communities and developing countries and study other community innovation projects in pandemics to understand the processes of fast-open, decentralized and evasive innovation and the importance of relational capabilities for innovation in digital contexts. Practical implications The findings can guide innovation managers and public policymakers in implementing effective strategies and policies to overcome pandemic challenges using SE business models. This research also provides important insights into the types and processes of innovation in organizations that create solutions to overcome social and business challenges during pandemics. In addition, this study highlights the contributions of netnographic approaches to conducting research on innovation and in pandemic periods when measures of confinement are in place. Originality/value This study uses an innovative framework to map the types of innovation and highlights two different types of innovation processes.","Belezas, F.; Daniel, A.",Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jstpm-10-2020-0147,1

Unfortunately, many users, especially older adults who are more likely to experience ability changes, are not aware of these features or do not know which combination to use. In this paper, we first quantify this problem via a survey with 100 participants, demonstrating that very few people are aware of built-in accessibility features on their phones. These observations led us to investigate accessibility recommendation as a way to increase awareness and adoption. We developed four prototype recommenders that span different accessibility categories, which we used to collect insights from 20 older adults. Our work demonstrates the need to increase awareness of existing accessibility features on mobile devices, and shows that automated recommendation could help people find beneficial accessibility features.","Wu, Jason; Reyes, Gabriel; White, Sam C.; Zhang, Xiaoyi; Bigham, Jeffrey P.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01734v1.pdf,1

This study explored the psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). An online survey was carried out among a sample of 78 expatriate residents. While most of the respondents recognized and highly valued the measures taken by the UAE government to support and deal with the pandemic, intense stress and uncertainty was reported. It was found that the Asian community was more anxious concerning the negative consequences of the pandemic than Arab or Western residents. The worry among older people was also found to be more intense. Anxiety over health consequences, fear of job loss, and constraints for international travels were the most overwhelming concerns.

177951,Frequent suboptimal thermocycler ramp rate usage negatively impacts MTBDRsl performance for second-line drug resistant tuberculosis diagnosis,2021-05-19,"Pseudouridine (Ψ) is the most common non-canonical ribonucleoside present on mammalian non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including rRNAs, tRNAs and snRNAs, where it contributes ∼7% of the total uridine level. However, Ψ constitutes only ∼0.1% of the uridines present on mRNAs and its effect on mRNA function remains unclear. Ψ residues have been shown to inhibit the detection of exogenous RNA transcripts by host innate immune factors, thus raising the possibility that viruses might have subverted the addition of Ψ residues to mRNAs by host pseudouridine synthase (PUS) enzymes as a way to inhibit antiviral responses in infected cells. Here, we describe and validate a novel antibody-based Ψ mapping technique called photo-crosslinking assisted Ψ sequencing (PA-Ψ-seq) and use it to map Ψ residues on not only multiple cellular RNAs but also on the mRNAs and genomic RNA encoded by HIV-1. We describe several 293T-derived cell lines in which human PUS enzymes previously reported to add Ψ residues to human mRNAs, specifically PUS1, PUS7 and TRUB1/PUS4, were inactivated by gene editing. Surprisingly, while this allowed us to assign several sites of Ψ addition on cellular mRNAs to each of these three PUS enzymes, the Ψ sites present on HIV-1 transcripts remained unaffected. Moreover, loss of PUS1, PUS7 or TRUB1 function did not significantly reduce the level of Ψ residues detected on total human mRNA below the ∼0.1% level seen in wild type cells, thus implying that the PUS enzyme(s) that adds the bulk of Ψ residues to human mRNAs remains to be defined.","Campos, Cecilia Martinez; Tsai, Kevin; Courtney, David G.; Bogerd, Hal P.; Holley, Christopher L.; Cullen, Bryan R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.442255,1

When combined with programmable toehold switch-based RNA sensors, these systems can be used to detect arbitrary RNAs and freeze-dried for room temperature transport to the point-of-need. These sensors, however, have been implemented using reconstituted PURE cell-free protein expression systems that are difficult to source in the Global South due to their high commercial cost and cold-chain shipping requirements. Here, we describe the implementation of RNA toehold switch-based sensors using E. coli cell lysate-based cell-free protein expression systems, which can be produced locally and reduce the cost of sensors by two orders of magnitude. We then demonstrate that these in-house cell lysates provide sensor performance comparable to commercial PURE cell-free systems. We further optimize use of these lysates with a CRISPRi strategy to enhance the stability of linear DNAs, enabling the direct use of PCR products for fast screening of new designs. As a proof-of-concept, we develop novel toehold sensors for the plant pathogen Potato Virus Y (PVY), which dramatically reduces the yield of this important staple crop. The local implementation of low-cost cell-free toehold sensors could enable biosensing capacity at the regional level and lead to more decentralized models for global surveillance of infectious disease.","Arce, Anibal; Chavez, Fernando Guzman; Gandini, Chiara; Puig, Juan; Matute, Tamara; Haseloff, Jim; Dalchau, Neil; Molloy, Jenny; Pardee, Keith; Federici, Fernán",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.29.446205,1

It has been proposed that psychiatric disorders may be risk factors and/or consequences of COVID-19 infection. However, observational studies could be affected by confounding bias. Methods We performed bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate causal relationships between liability to COVID-19 (and severe/critical infection) and a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders or traits. We employed the latest GWAS summary statistics from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. A variety of MR methods including those accounting for horizontal pleiotropy were used. Results Overall we observed evidence that liability to COVID-19 or severe infection may be causally associated with higher risks of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder (BD) (especially BD II), schizophrenia (SCZ), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal thought (ST) when compared to the general population. On the other hand, liability to a few psychiatric traits/disorders, for example ADHD, alcohol and opioid use disorders may be causally associated with higher risks of COVID-19 infection or severe disease. In genetic correlation analysis, cannabis use disorder, ADHD, and anxiety showed significant and positive genetic correlation with critical or hospitalized infection. All the above findings passed multiple testing correction at a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05. For pneumonia, in general we observed a different pattern of associations, with bi-directional positive associations with depression- and anxiety-related phenotypes. Conclusions In summary, this study provides evidence for tentative bi-directional causal associations between liability to COVID-19 (and severe infection) and a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.

184017,Coronaviruses and multiple sclerosis.,1982,"Background: SARS-CoV2 infection and COVID-19 associated pneumonia are associated to a dysregulated inflammatory response known as cytokine storm and the use of cytokine inhibitors, especially those targeting IL-6, has been proposed as a therapeutic alternative in these patients. Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors in combination to the antiviral Remdesivir have shown evidence of reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with COVID-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation1. Objectives: To describe the outcomes associated with the use of Tocilizumab (TCZ) and Baricitinib (Bari) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods: Descriptive study nested in a cohort. Patients from the General Hospital of Cuernavaca who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 associated pneumonia and/or respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen or invasive/ non-invasive assisted mechanical ventilation (AMV) were analyzed. All patients had a positive RT-PCR upon hospital admission, sampled under standardized conditions. The clinical and demographic data of the patients upon hospitalization were obtained from the instrument on a specific platform (SISVER) used on a national basis. Severe disease was considered as the need for any type of AMV. TCZ was used at 400-600 mg in two infusions (baseline and at 72 hours), Bari at 4 mg daily for 14 days. The outcomes were the need for AMV, death, or discharge. A p≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Data from 404 SARS-CoV2 positive patients were analyzed. 269 (65.9%) were men. The mean age of the patients was 57.5 years (18-94;SD 15.3). 59.6% of the patients had one or more comorbidities (Diabetes and Hypertension in most cases [31.8%]). 22.8% of the patients had a history of current or previous smoking. Mean hospital stay was 7.4 days (1-36;SD 5.9). 15.9% of the patients required invasive or non-invasive AMV. 11 patients were treated with TCZ and 30 patients received treatment with Baricitinib. 5 of the 11 patients with TCZ required AMV (all but one were intubated), but only 6 of the 30 (20%) with Bari required AMV (all except one received CPAP). The use of Baricitinib was correlated with a reduction in the use of AMV (p 0.01). 6 patients with TCZ were discharged due to improvement and 5 died. In the case of Bari, 19 improved and were discharged and 11 died, significantly correlating with lower mortality (p 0.05). The use TCZ was not associated with a reduced hospitalization (50% remained hospitalized for more than 10 days) but patients receiving Baricitinib had significantly shorter hospital stays (86.6% had a hospital stay of less than 10 days) than those receiving TCZ (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The patients that were treated with Baricitinib and required AMV most often improved with non-invasive CPAP while the majority of the patients under AMV receiving TCZ were treated with an invasive mode, although this was due in part to the fact that TCZ can be employed intravenously and is more practical for intubated patients in whom oral drug administration is limited. Baricitinib was significantly associated with a better outcome (hospital discharge due to improvement) and a significantly shorter hospital stay.","Xibille Friedmann, D. X.; Carrillo Vazquez, S.

Methods: A total of 266 patients who had positive results on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 between March 2020 and June 2020 at our region were investigated for the study. Results: A total of 266 patients was included in this study, 92 (34.6%) patients were male and 174 (65.4%) were female. The mean ± standard deviation age of the patients was 49.2 ± 18.69 (range: 18-96 years). During clinical examination, 5 (1.9%) patients demonstrated skin lesions that might be associated with COVID-19 infection. These lesions consisted of urticaria in three patients and vesicular eruption in two patients.

I the current study we followed up with a subsample of our previous sero-survey participants to assess whether natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a reduced risk of re-infection. We conducted telephonic interview of a total of 3038 participants, out of which 2238 participants responded and 5 participants were found to be not alive, as conveyed by their close relatives. There was a non-response rate of 26.1%. Out of the 2238 participants, 1170 were sero-positive and 1068 were sero-negative for antibody against COVID-19. Our survey found that only 3 individuals in the sero-positive group got infected with COVID-19 whereas 127 individuals reported contracting the infection the sero-negative group. Interestingly, from the 127 sero-negative individuals who later contracted COVID-19 infection, 30 needed hospitalization, out of which 12 were on oxygen therapy, four in ICU and one was on ventilator. At the other hand, from the 3 sero-positives re-infected with COVID-19, one had hospitalization, but didnnot require oxygen support or critical care. These findings reinforce the strong plausibility that development of antibody following natural infection not only protects against re-infection by the virus to a great extent, but also safeguards against progression to severe COVID-19 disease.","MISHRA, B.

Host ‘omic profiles offer insights into the host response to infection and inflammation, with the interrogation of multiple ‘omic levels in parallel providing a more comprehensive picture. We used differential abundance analysis, pathway analysis, clustering and classification techniques to explore whether the host response in KD is more similar to the response to bacterial or viral infection at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels through comparison of ‘omic profiles from children with KD to those with bacterial and viral infections. Pathways activated in patients with KD included those involved in anti-viral and anti-bacterial responses. Unsupervised clustering showed that the majority of KD patients clustered with bacterial patients on both ‘omic levels, whilst application of diagnostic signatures specific for bacterial and viral infections revealed that many transcriptomic KD samples had low probabilities of having bacterial or viral infections, suggesting that KD may be triggered by a different process not typical of either common bacterial or viral infections. Clustering based on the transcriptomic and proteomic responses during KD revealed three clusters of KD patients on both ‘omic levels, suggesting heterogeneity within the inflammatory response during KD. The observed heterogeneity may reflect differences in the host response to a common trigger, or variation dependent on different triggers of the condition.","Jackson, Heather; Menikou, Stephanie; Hamilton, Shea; McArdle, Andrew; Shimizu, Chisato; Galassini, Rachel; Huang, Honglei; Kim, Jihoon; Tremoulet, Adriana; de Jonge, Marien; Kuijpers, Taco; Wright, Victoria; Burns, Jane; Casals-Pascual, Climent; Herberg, Jethro; Levin, Mike; Kaforou, Myrsini",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.435948,1

Air pollution contributes to critical environmental problems in various towns and cities. With the emergence of the smart city concept, appropriate methods to curb exposure to pollutants must be part of an appropriate urban development policy. This study presents a technologically driven air quality solution for smart cities that advertises energy-efficient and cleaner sequestration in these areas. It attempts to explore how to incorporate data-driven approaches and citizen participation into effective public sector pollution management in smart cities as a major component of the smart city definition. The smart city idea was developed as cities became more widespread through communication devices. This study addresses the technical criteria for implementing a framework that public administration can use to prepare for renovation of public buildings, minimizing energy use and costs and linking smart police stations to monitor air pollution as a part of an integrated city. Such a digital transition in resource management will increase public governance energy performance and provide a higher standard for operations and a healthier environment. The study results indicate that complex processes lead to efficient and sustainable smart cities. This research discovered an interpretive pattern in how public agencies, private enterprises, and community members think and what they do in these regional contexts. It concludes that economic and social benefits could be realized by exploiting data-driven smart city development for its social and spatial complexities. © 2021 by the authors.

186120,IP-10 Is Elevated in Virus-Induced Acute Exacerbations in Childhood Asthma.,2016,"The monomer of influenza haemagglutinin is synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor that during maturation is cleaved by proteases into two active subunits. Other studies have demonstrated that the human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave the HA of human seasonal influenza viruses. Consequently, we have investigated the use of human Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 to produce high titre influenza haemmagglutinin (HA) lentiviral pseudotypes from Group 2 influenza viruses. Such pseudotypes represent powerful and safe tools to study viral entry and immune responses. Influenza pseudotype particles are obtained by co-transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells using plasmids coding for the influenza HA, HIV gag-pol and a lentiviral vector incorporating firefly luciferase. However, in order to produce Group 2 pseudotypes, it was necessary to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the TMPRSS2 endoprotease, to achieve the necessary HA cleavage for infective particle generation. These lentiviral pseudotypes were shown to transduce HEK293T/17 cells with high efficiency. This demonstrates that TMPRSS2 is necessary for the functional activation, in vitro, of both the HA of human seasonal influenza and other Group 2 HA influenza strains. Additionally, we show that the Group 2 influenza pseudotype particles can be used as surrogate antigens in neutralization assays and are efficiently neutralized by corresponding influenza virus reference sera. These data demonstrate that the viral pseudotype system is a powerful method for serological surveillance of a wide range of influenza viruses.","Ferrara, Francesca; Molesti, Eleonora; Böttcher-Friebertshäuser, Eva; Cattoli, Giovanni; Corti, Davide; Scott, Simon D; Temperton, Nigel J",J Mol Genet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614188/,1

N95 respirators are the most common respirators used in the health care system and negligence in using them may cause health problems. Hence, more emphasis should be on ergonomic aspects of this mask. This study aimed to develop a tool for ergonomic evaluation of these respirators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After reviewing previous studies and employees’ problems in the use of the N95 respirators, 50 questionnaires were designed and their validity was assessed. Then, the questionnaire was completed by 290 staff members of Masih Daneshvari Hospital and its internal consistency and reproducibility were investigated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and test-retest method, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess its consistency and internal consistency (construct validity). RESULTS: With the confirmation of the face and content validities, internal consistency (0.89) calculated by the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and reproducibility of the questionnaire (0.997; p<0.001) assessed by using the ICC Index, were approved. Following examining internal consistency and stability, the questionnaire convergent construct validity was also confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire contained 42 items and it is beneficial to use it in the health care system to evaluate the ergonomic problems of the respirators and to have optimal choice in this respect. Also, it can be used in the promotion of the staffs’ behavior in wearing these respirators when necessary.","Jazani, Reza Khani; Seyedmehdi, Seyed Mohammad; Kavousi, Amir; Javazm, Somaye Tahernezhad",Tanaffos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6534796/,1

However, its accuracy is not well documented. METHODS We evaluated the agreement of non-contact infrared forehead temperature (NIFT) measurement by comparing NIFT readings with tympanic temperatures taken in children (1 mth to 18 yrs) admitted to the general paediatric wards of Kwong Wah Hospital, Hong Kong. RESULTS A total of 567 patients were recruited and 1000 pairs of readings were obtained. The incidence of fever, defined as tympanic temperature (in rectal model) >38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), was 12.3%. The mean difference between NIFT and tympanic temperature was 2.34 degrees C (4.21 degrees F) and the 95% limit of agreement between NIFT and tympanic temperature was 0.26-4.42 degrees C (0.47-7.96 degrees F). NIFT was significantly lower than tympanic temperature readings. The optimal cut-off point of NIFT derived from the receiver-operator characteristics curve for fever definition was 35.1 degrees C (95.2 degrees F). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of this cut-off point for fever screening were 89.4%, 75.4%, 33.7% and 98.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS NIFT measurement has a reasonable accuracy in detecting tympanic fever in children. However, one should be aware of the high false-positive rate of fever screening using NIFT.","Ng, Daniel K; Chan, Chung-Hong; Lee, Robert S; Leung, Lettie C",Annals of tropical paediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297301/,1

188139,[Carcinoid syndrome].,1977,"In order to verify a commonly held assumption that only Massachusetts (Mass) serotype of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was prevalent in the United States between the 1930s (when IBV was first isolated) and the 1950s (when the use of commercial IBV vaccines began), we examined 40 IBV field isolates from the 1940s. Thirty-eight of those isolates were recognized as Mass serotype viruses based on their reactivity to Mass-specific monoclonal antibody (Mab) and neutralization by Mass-specific chicken serum. The remaining two isolates, N-M24 and N-M39, that did not react with Mass-specific Mab, resisted neutralization by Mass-specific chicken serum, and were neutralized only by homologous chicken antibody were identified as non-Mass IBV. When the first 900 nucleotides (nt) from the 5'-end of the spike (S1) glycoprotein gene and their deduced amino acid (aa) sequences were compared, the two non-Mass isolates differed from each other by 24% and 28%, respectively. In a similar comparison, the non-Mass viruses N-M24 and N-M39 differed from M28, a Mass-type isolate from the 1940s, by 21% and 22% (nt) and 28% and 27% (aa), respectively. These data indicate that antigenic and genetic diversity among IBV isolates existed even in the 1940s. Interestingly, when the N-terminal region of the S1 of M28 was compared to that of M41, a prototype Mass virus that has undergone countless number of in vivo and in vitro host passages, the two viruses differed by only 2% (nt) and 4% (aa). This finding suggests that frequent genetic changes are not inherent in all IBV genomes.","Jia, Wei; Mondal, S P; Naqi, S A",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12061655/,1

In order to assess the performance of such a device in critically ill patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation, we simulated 16 patients using a human patient simulator, measuring fractional inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and work of breathing at three oxygen flow rates. Oxygen concentration was dependent on peak inspiratory flow rate, tidal volume and oxygen flow rate. Rebreathing, as indicated by inspired carbon dioxide concentration, was greatest at high respiratory rates and low tidal volumes. Imposed inspiratory work of breathing was relatively high (mean 0.88 J.l(-1)[SD 0.30]). We conclude that this method of oxygen delivery is only suitable for patients in whom rapid extubation is anticipated.","So, C Y; Gomersall, C D; Chui, P T; Chan, M T V",Anaesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15200546/,1

The occurrence of CRAT and other clinical parameters were documented in these patients. Results A total of 28 patients (mean [SD] age 51 [15.2] years; females 17 [60.7%]) were included in the study. CRAT was observed in 5 (17.9%) patients. There was no difference in mean age in patients with or without thrombus (48±13.02 vs 51.61 ± 15.78 years; p = 0.61). History of diabetes and hypertension was present in 2 and all 5 patients respectively. There was no significant difference in the period the THC was in place in patients with or without CRAT (13±7.8 months vs 10.57±5.66 months; p = 0.54). There was no association between catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) and CRAT (p= 0.29). Conclusion The incidence of CRAT in patients with THC for MHD was 17.9%.

In response to the proposed legislation, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc., (APIC) have developed this joint position statement. Both organizations are dedicated to combating health care-associated infections with a wide array of methods, including the use of active surveillance cultures in appropriate circumstances. This position statement reviews the proposed legislation and the rationale for use of active surveillance cultures, examines the scientific evidence supporting the use of this strategy, and discusses a number of unresolved issues surrounding legislation mandating use of active surveillance cultures. The following 5 consensus points are offered. (1) Although reducing the burden of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), is of preeminent importance, the APIC and the SHEA do not support legislation to mandate use of active surveillance cultures to screen for MRSA, VRE, or other antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. (2) The SHEA and the APIC support the continued development, validation, and application of efficacious and cost-effective strategies for the prevention of infections caused by MRSA, VRE, and other antimicrobial-resistant and antimicrobial-susceptible pathogens. (3) The APIC and the SHEA welcome efforts by health care consumers, together with private, local, state, and federal policy makers, to focus attention on and formulate solutions for the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance and health care-associated infections. (4) The SHEA and the APIC support ongoing additional research to determine and optimize the appropriateness, utility, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of using active surveillance cultures to screen both lower-risk and high-risk populations.

190103,"Non-small cell lung cancer, version 2.2013.",2013,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) is nowadays an established bariatric procedure. Although preoperative gastroscopy is recommended to rule out severe pathologies, there is little evidence about the role of routine histopathologic examination of resected specimens.We sought to identify the prevalence of histopathological relevant findings in patients undergoing LSG and to evaluate their impact in clinical practice. METHODS A retrospective analysis on a prospectively collected dataset on patients undergoing LSG between 08/2009-05/2018 in two bariatric centers was performed. Demographic and clinical data and histopathological results were analyzed. RESULTS Sixhundred-thrirteen patients were identified, mean age was 43.1years (14-75), average body mass index was 44.8kg/m2(34.4-73.9). Histoptahology revealed abnormal findings in 47.97% of the patients, most common pathology was chronic non-active or minimally to moderate active gastritis (n = 202;32.95%). Among others, Helicobacter-associated gastritis (n = 33;5.38%), intestinal metaplasia (n = 13;2.12%), micronodular enterochromaffine-like cell hyperplasia (n = 2;0.33%) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (n = 6;0.98%) were present. No malignancies were found. Histopathological results required a change in the postoperative management in 48 patients (7.83%).The costs of histopathological assessment ranged between 0.77%-2.55% of per-case payment. CONCLUSION A wide range of histopathological findings occur in specimens after LSG, requiring a relevant number of patients additional therapies or surveillance. Therefore, routine histopathological examination after LSG is recommendable.","Taha-Mehlitz, Stephanie; Mongelli, Francesco; Sykora, Martin; Scheiwiller, Andreas; Diebold, Joachim; Metzger, Jürg; Gass, Jörn-Markus",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644013/,1

Using the RIF-1 cell line, photodynamic efficacy was shown to be related to cellular uptake. The cationic phthalocyanine (PPC, pyridinium zinc [II] phthalocyanine) had improved activity over the other two phthalocyanines and slightly improved activity over PHP and m-THPC. The initial subcellular localization of each photosensitizer was dependent upon the hydrophobicity and plasma protein binding. The phthalocyanines had a punctate distribution indicative of lysosomes, whereas m-THPC and PHP had a more diffuse cytoplasmic localization. A relocalization of phthalocyanine fluorescence was observed in some cases following low-level light exposure, and this was charge dependent. The anionic phthalocyanine (TGly, tetraglycine zinc [II] phthalocyanine) relocalized to the nuclear area, the localization of the hydrophobic phthalocyanine (TDOPc, tetradioctylamine zinc [II] phthalocyanine) was unchanged, whereas the distribution of the cationic phthalocyanine (PPC) became more cytoplasmic. This suggests that relocalization following low-level irradiation is a critical factor governing efficacy, and a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution may be a determinant of good photodynamic activity.","Ball, D J; Mayhew, S; Wood, S R; Griffiths, J; Vernon, D I; Brown, S B",Photochemistry and photobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232957/,1
190427,Current treatment for acute viral bronchiolitis in infants.,2003,"To investigate the involvement of various cellular and humoral aspects of immunity in the clearance of rabies virus from the central nervous system, (CNS), we studied the development of clinical signs and virus clearance from the CNS in knockout mice lacking either B and T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, B cells, alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptors, IFN-gamma receptors, or complement components C3 and C4. Following intranasal infection with the attenuated rabies virus CVS-F3, normal adult mice of different genetic backgrounds developed a transient disease characterized by loss of body weight and appetite depression which peaked at 13 days postinfection (p.i.). While these animals had completely recovered by day 21 p.i., mice lacking either B and T cells or B cells alone developed a progressive disease and succumbed to infection. Mice lacking either CD8+ T cells, IFN receptors, or complement components C3 and C4 showed no significant differences in the development of clinical signs by comparison with intact counterparts having the same genetic background. However, while infectious virus and viral RNA could be detected in normal control mice only until day 8 p.i., in all of the gene knockout mice studied except those lacking C3 and C4, virus infection persisted through day 21 p.i. Analysis of rabies virus-specific antibody production together with histological assessment of brain inflammation in infected animals revealed that clearance of CVS-F3 by 21 days p.i. correlated with both a strong inflammatory response in the CNS early in the infection (day 8 p.i.), and the rapid (day 10 p.i.) production of significant levels of virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA). These studies confirm that rabies VNA is an absolute requirement for clearance of an established rabies virus infection. However, for the latter to occur in a timely fashion, collaboration between VNA and inflammatory mechanisms is necessary.","Hooper, D C; Morimoto, K; Bette, M; Weihe, E; Koprowski, H; Dietzschold, B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9557653/,1

This study aims to examine the psychological impact of SARS on general practitioners (GPs) and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners in Singapore. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two months after the SARS outbreak, all the GPs and TCM practitioners in Singapore were mailed a set of self-reported questionnaires, which included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the Impact of Event Scale-R (IES-R), and a questionnaire to measure the perception of stigma. RESULTS A total of 721 (29%) GPs and 329 (22%) TCM practitioners responded to the survey. Significantly more GPs had worked in SARS affected facilities and had been directly involved in the care of patients with SARS than the TCM practitioners (P <0.001). Those GPs who were directly involved in the care of patients with SARS were significantly more likely to be GHQ case as compared to those not involved in the care of patients with SARS (P = 0.02; OR = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.3). The mean score of the GHQ somatic, anxiety and social dysfunction subscales were significantly higher in GPs as compared to TCM Practitioners (P <0.001). The GHQ total score as well as the subscales was significantly correlated with the IES-R and stigma subscales (P <0.05). CONCLUSION The fear, uncertainty and stigma caused by SARS are associated with psychological distress among some of the primary healthcare providers in Singapore.","Verma, S; Mythily, S; Chan, Y H; Deslypere, J P; Teo, E K; Chong, S A","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15608831/,1

Ninety-nine diarrheic and 114 normal fecal samples from calves in Hokkaido Prefecture and 38 diarrheic fecal samples from calves in 10 other prefectures were examined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with primers designed in the spike (S) gene for the presence of BoTV. The specimens were also examined for the presence of other enteric pathogens, bovine rotavirus, coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. BoTV RNA was detected in 15 (15.2%) of the 99 diarrheic samples from Hokkaido and in 9 (23.7%) of the 38 diarrheic samples from the other prefectures. The incidence of BoTV in control specimens was 7.0%. In 11 of the 15 BoTV-positive specimens from Hokkaido, BoTV was the only pathogen detected among those examined, and 11 BoTV-positive specimens were obtained from calves less than 2 weeks of age. Rotavirus was confirmed to be associated with calf diarrhea, but coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. were not. Nucleotide sequences of 17 different BoTV RT-PCR products were determined. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences revealed that Japanese BoTVs could be classified into at least two groups. This study showed that BoTV is a common virus in fecal specimens of calves with diarrhea in Japan and may be an important pathogen of cattle, principally in young calves less than 2 weeks of age.","Kirisawa, Rikio; Takeyama, Ai; Koiwa, Masateru; Iwai, Hiroshi",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17551218/,1

To examine the distribution of viral antigens within this infected central nervous system (CNS) tissue, we used the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method to detect monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies bound to JHM structural proteins; in addition we used the Western blot technique to detect viral proteins. Our study demonstrated the following characteristics: Infected neuronal and glial cells produced viral nucleocapsid and E2 glycoprotein. The synthesis of these viral structural proteins was not restricted to cells in any particular part of the central nervous system. While JHM E2 proteins could be detected in individual cells of JHM-infected CNS tissue, the relative level of detectable E2 protein in the total CNS tissue of infected rats was reduced by more than 13-fold compared with JHM-infected tissue culture cells. Hippocampus neuronal cells provided a sensitive indication of JHM infection. These cells invariably contained antigens in both acutely and chronically infected animals. The distribution of cells containing viral antigens differed markedly for JHM-induced acute encephalitis and chronic demyelinating disease. Acutely infected brains had large lesions containing low levels of viral antigen scattered throughout the brain. One percent to ten percent of histologically normal cells in many parts of the brain contained viral antigens; in addition, more neuronal cells than glial cells were observed to be antigen-positive. The hippocampus appeared normal with hematoxylin-eosin staining; however, a scattered infection of neuronal cells was apparent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Parham, D; Tereba, A; Talbot, P J; Jackson, D P; Morris, V L",Archives of neurology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3015091/,1

The following specimens were also collected: nasopharyngeal swabs for viral, bacteriological, mycoplasmal and chlamydial studies, blood for serology and blood culture. The children were then followed-up on days 3, 7 and 14. Specific infecting organisms were identified in a total of 853 (92.6%) out of 921 patients (398 cases of pneumonia and 523 cases of bronchitis) including 205 with mixed infection as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 252 (274%) patients; respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, 188 (20.4%); influenza A virus, 110 (11.9%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 95 (10.3%); Haemophilus influenzae, 90 (9.8%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 35 (3.8%); Staphylococcus aureus, 29 (3.1%); adenovirus, 27 (2.9%); Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 (1.3%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 7 (0.8%); Chlamydia pneumoniae, 6 (0.7%); and other agents, 2 (0.2%). Mycoplasma infections were seen even in patients less than 5 years and RS and influenza A virus infections in patients more than 5 years of age. The importance of M. pneumoniae and RS virus in the etiology of lower respiratory infections in Japanese children was confirmed.","Numazaki, Kei; Chiba, Shunzo; Umetsu, Masao; Tanaka, Toru; Yoshimura, Hideatsu; Kuniya, Yoshinori; Miura, Junichi; Adachi, Noriaki; Ukae, Susumu; Mori, Toshihiko; Ueda, Daisuke; Hotsubo, Tomoyuki; Sato, Toshiya",In vivo,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15011754/,1

The input of the MuSiC system consists of a set of protein/DNA/RNA sequences and a set of user-specified constraints, each with a fragment of residue/nucleotide that (approximately) appears in all input sequences. The output of MuSiC is a constrained multiple sequence alignment in which the fragments of the input sequences whose residues/nucleotides exhibit a given degree of similarity to a constraint are aligned together. The current MuSiC system is implemented in Java language and can be accessed via a simple web interface.

193783,Infection control of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in hospitals - a logistic challenge.,2010,"The specificity of JHM virus (JHMV) tropism for rat oligodendrocytes, as one of the primary host cells in the central nervous system, is maintained after explanation (S. Beushausen and S. Dales, Virology 141:89-101, 1985). The temporal correlation between onset of resistance to JHMV infection in vivo, completion of myelination, and maturation of the central nervous system can be simulated in vitro by inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation (Beushausen and Dales, Virology, 1985). Stimulation of differentiation through the elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels suggests a possible connection between activation of the adenylate cyclase system and coronavirus expression. Chromatographic analysis of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in cytosol extracts prepared from astrocytes or oligodendrocytes revealed that both glial cell types were deficient in protein kinase I, indicating that expression of coronavirus in differentiated cells was not contingent upon the presence of protein kinase I. However, treatment with N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dbcAMP) resulted in a severalfold enhancement of the free regulatory subunit (RI) in oligodendrocytes but not in astrocytes. The RII subunit in both neural cell types was relatively unaffected. Rapid increase in RI due to dbcAMP treatment was correlated with inhibition of JHMV expression. Other differentiation inducers, including 8-Br cAMP and forskolin which, by contrast, caused a decrease in detectable RI, also blocked JHMV expression. This apparent anomaly can be attributed to an increased turnover of RI due to destabilization of the molecule which occurs upon site-specific binding of the cyclic nucleotides. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that the state of oligodendrocyte differentiation manifested with the modulation of RI regulates JHMV expression. The differentiation process did not affect either virus adsorption or sequestration but appeared to inhibit the expression of viral RNA and proteins, implying that replication was inhibited at some step between penetration and initiation of genomic functions, perhaps at the stage of uncoating. We therefore examined the possibility that protein kinases and phosphatases, which influence cellular regulation during cAMP-induced differentiation, may be responsible for the phenomenon of coronavirus suppression in oligodendrocytes. Evidence was obtained indicating that normal processing of the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein is inhibited in differentiated oligodendrocytes, consistent with the notion that JHMV replication might be arrested during uncoating.","Beushausen, S; Narindrasorasak, S; Sanwal, B D; Dales, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2824815/,1

194324,"Meeting highlights of the European Respiratory Society annual congress 02-06 September 2006, Munich, Germany.",2007,"Feline calicivirus (FCV) is responsible for an acute upper respiratory tract disease in cats. The FCV capsid protein is synthesized as a precursor (76 kDa) that is post-translationally processed into the mature 62 kDa capsid protein by removal of the N-terminal 124 amino acids. Our previous studies have also detected a 40 kDa protein, related to the FCV capsid protein, produced during infection. Here we demonstrate that cleavage of the FCV capsid protein, during infection of cells in culture, was prevented by caspase inhibitors. In addition, caspase-2, -3 and -7 were activated during FCV infection, as shown by pro-form processing, an increase in N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage activity and in situ poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Caspase activation coincided with the induction of apoptosis and capsid cleavage to the 40 kDa fragment. An in vitro cleavage assay, using recombinant human caspases and in vitro-derived FCV capsid protein, revealed that caspase-2, and to a lesser extent caspase-6, cleaved the capsid protein to generate a 40 kDa fragment. Taken together, these results suggest that FCV triggers apoptosis within infected cells and that caspase-induced capsid cleavage occurs concomitantly with apoptosis. The possible role of capsid cleavage in the pathogenesis of FCV infection is discussed.","Al-Molawi, Naema; Beardmore, Victoria A; Carter, Michael J; Kass, George E N; Roberts, Lisa O",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12692289/,1
194440,Increasing importance of viruses in acute otitis media.,2000,"Distinctive patterns in the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been recently reported. We conducted a systematic review to identify case reports and case series characterizing cutaneous manifestations of confirmed COVID-19. Key demographic and clinical data from each case were extracted and analyzed. The primary outcome measure was risk factor analysis of skin related outcomes for severe COVID-19 disease. Seventy-one case reports and series comprising 144 cases of cutaneous involvement in COVID-19 were included. The most frequently occurring morphologies were: morbilliform (30.6%), varicelliform (18.8%), urticarial (13.2%), chilblains-like (12.5%), and acro-ischemic (9%). The median age of patients was 51 years (mean: 45.9, range: 0 to 91). Patients with chilblains-like eruptions had lower frequencies of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (5/18, 27.8%, P<0.05) and were less likely to have severe COVID-19 disease (2/18, 11%, 95% CI 1.4% to 34.7%, P=0.02). Patients with livedoid and acro-ischemic morphologies had severe COVID-19 more frequently than those with other morphologies (17/21, 81%, 95% CI 58.0% to 94.5%, P<0.0001). The most frequently observed cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 (morbilliform, varicelliform, and urticarial) are well-described patterns of viral exanthems. However, chilblains-like, livedoid, and acro-ischemic morphologies are not traditionally associated with viral infections and were significantly associated with severity of COVID-19 disease.","Lee, David S; Mirmirani, Paradi; McCleskey, Patrick E; Mehrpouya, Majid; Gorouhi, Farzam",Dermatology online journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423412/,1

One is the major virion surface envelope protein (E), which is recognized by antibody, whereas the other is a secreted, heavily glycosylated non-structural protein (NS1). Inoculation with either protein can give rise to a protective immune response, as can the passive transfer of E and NS1 monospecific monoclonal antibodies. Experiments reported here demonstrate that the secreted form of NS1, whether from cells infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) or from cells infected with a defective recombinant adenovirus containing the NS1 gene, occurs chiefly as a pentamer or hexamer and occasionally as a decamer or dodecamer. Intracellular forms of this protein however occur only as dimers. The higher M(r) forms secreted from the cell are exquisitely sensitive to detergent, suggesting they are held together by hydrophobic bonds. Both intracellular and extracellular forms of the dimer can be dissociated by heat, but at different temperatures. Unlike similar proteins from mosquito-borne viruses. NS1 from TBEV-infected cells cannot be dissociated at ambient temperatures by extremes of pH. Studies on the antigenic structure of this protein show it to have several highly conserved epitopes, confirming similar earlier conclusions from amino acid sequence analyses.","Crooks, A J; Lee, J M; Easterbrook, L M; Timofeev, A V; Stephenson, J R",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7527836/,1

DESIGN Questionnaire survey. SETTING Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS All hospital staff were given a questionnaire; administrative staff who had not had any patient contact served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Levels of contact with patients who had severe acute respiratory syndrome were measured and correlated with anxiety levels as determined by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. RESULTS Of 4252 questionnaires distributed between May and June 2003, 2040 (48.0%) were returned and 1926 (45.3%) were valid for analysis. Overall, 534 (27.7%) respondents had had contact with patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Anxiety scores ranged from 20 to 80, and mean (standard deviation) scores were higher among staff who had had contact with patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome than among those who had not (52.6 [10.5] versus 49.8 [10.1], respectively; P<0.01). Mean anxiety levels were higher among workmen, health care assistants, and nurses than among administrative staff controls or doctors (P<0.01). Anxiety scores were correlated with burnout scores (Pearson's correlation coefficient, 0.52-0.59) and with discomfort from wearing protective gear (0.21-0.32). CONCLUSION Severe acute respiratory syndrome has likely stressed the public health care system. Prediction and early identification of adverse factors in a crisis situation would allow early implementation of interventions to reduce and counteract the impact of this stress.","Poon, E; Liu, K S; Cheong, D L; Lee, C K; Yam, L Y C; Tang, W N",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15479961/,1

Mounting evidence also indicates that autophagy equips cells to deliver cytosolic Ags to the MHC class II pathway.

196063,Kawasaki syndrome in Denmark.,2007,"BACKGROUND Although antihistamines are prescribed in large quantities for the common cold, there is little evidence to whether these drugs are effective. OBJECTIVES To assess in patients with a common cold the effects of antihistamines in alleviating nasal symptoms, or in shortening of illness duration. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register and EMBASE up to December 2002; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE up to February 2003. We also followed up references in identified papers. We appealed for further articles at a major international conference on Acute Respiratory Infections (1997). We corresponded with experts and got in touch with pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised, placebo-controlled trials on treatment of common cold with antihistamines, used either singly or in combination, in adults or children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted by two reviewers and authors were contacted for further data. Trials were subdivided into monotherapy and combination therapy. Data on general recovery, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and side-effects were extracted and summarized in a systematic review. MAIN RESULTS We included thirty two papers describing 35 comparisons; 22 trials studied monotherapy, 13 trials a combination of antihistamines with other medication. A total of 8930 people suffering from the common cold were included. There were large differences in study designs, participants, interventions, and outcomes. There was no evidence of any clinically significant effect - in children or in adults - on general recovery of antihistamines in monotherapy. First generation - but not non-sedating - antihistamines have a small effect on rhinorrhea and sneezing. In trials with first generation antihistamines the incidence of side effects (especially sedation) is significantly higher with active treatment. Two trials, studying a combination of antihistamines with decongestives in small children, both failed to show any effect. Of the eleven trials on older children and adults, the majority show an effect on general recovery and on nasal symptom severity. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS Antihistamines in monotherapy - in children as well as in adults - do not alleviate to a clinical extend nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and sneezing, or subjective improvement of the common cold. First generation antihistamines also cause more side-effects than placebo, in particular they increase sedation in cold sufferers. Combinations of antihistamines with decongestives are not effective in small children. In older children and adults most trials show a beneficial effect on general recovery as well as on nasal symptoms. It is however not clear whether these effects are clinically significant.","Sutter, A I M; Lemiengre, M; Campbell, H; Mackinnon, H F",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12917904/,1

PLWH participated in an online survey exploring demographic and clinical data, physical symptoms, contact history, knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures and additional information about COVID-19 during the first phase of the pandemic in Italy. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) (identifying the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific traumatic life event) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) also formed part of the survey. Out of 98 participants, 45% revealed from mild to severe psychological impact from COVID-19 according to IES-R. A lower percentage, instead, complained of significant levels of depression (14%), anxiety (11%) or stress (6%) according to DASS-21. Higher education, being unemployed, number of perceived COVID-19 physical symptoms, concerns about risk of contracting COVID-19 and the pandemic situation in Italy, and needing additional information to prevent COVID-19 infection were positively associated to a higher risk of negative psychological impact. Moreover, among the participants, female gender, age, fewer years from HIV diagnosis and not being aware of their own viremia were associated to a higher risk of negative psychological outcomes. Almost half of our PLWH sample experienced significant levels of distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, elderly patients and those with recent HIV diagnosis appear to be the more psychologically fragile subgroups. Our findings could help identify patients most in need of psychological interventions to improve the wellbeing of PLWH.","Delle Donne, Valentina; Ciccarelli, Nicoletta; Massaroni, Valentina; Lombardi, Francesca; Lamonica, Silvia; Borghetti, Alberto; Fabbiani, Massimiliano; Cauda, Roberto; Di Giambenedetto, Simona",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664173/,1

Prevalence patterns demonstrated no statistically significant differences among the individual cultural groups, nor among subgroups compared on the basis of age, sex, or weight of specimen tested.

For validation, we tested a MERS-CoV strain (hCoVEMC), clinical specimens from patients with fever in Shanghai, and specimens from the first imported MERS case in China. The detection limit of the novel multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays was 10 PFU of MERS-CoV per ml, the same as that in monoplex real-time RT-PCR assays based on upE or N2. The detection was specific for MERS-CoV. In validation using clinical samples, pharyngeal swabs from Shanghai patients were detected as negative, while swabs from the first imported MERS case in China were detected as positive. Using whole blood samples from a MERS case, better detection results were obtained with N2 as the target than upE.

We investigated the use of CURB-65, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) prediction scores to identify the CAP population from the PROWESS placebo arm at the greatest mortality risk. METHODS Patients were classified as having CAP if the lung was the primary infection site and the patient originated from home. The abilities of CURB-65, PSI, and APACHE II scores to determine the 28-day and in-hospital mortality were compared using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and the associated areas under the curve. RESULTS PROWESS enrolled 278 patients with CAP in the placebo arm. The areas under the ROC curves for PSI = 5, CURB-65 ≥ 3, and APACHE II ≥ 25 for predicting 28-day (c = 0.65, 0.66, and 0.64, respectively) and in-hospital mortality (c = 0.65, 0.65, and 0.64, respectively) were not statistically different from each other. The 28-day mortality of patients with a PSI score of 5, CURB-65 ≥ 3, and APACHE II ≥ 25 was 41.6%, 37.9%, and 43.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Despite early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy, conventionally treated CAP with PSI = 5, CURB-65 3, or APACHE II 25 has an unacceptably high mortality. In this study, PSI, CURB-65, and APACHE II scoring systems perform similarly in predicting the 28-day and in-hospital mortality; however, differences in the categorization of severe CAP were observed and there was a significant mortality in patients with a CURB-65 <3 and PSI <5.","Richards, Guy; Levy, Howard; Laterre, Pierre-Francois; Feldman, Charles; Woodward, Brad; Bates, Becky M; Qualy, Rebecca L",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21341394/,1

The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to analyze the association between social isolation and severe arterial hypertension (systolic = 160 mmHg and / or diastolic = 100 mmHg) in the Emergency Service of the Hospital Universitario Fundación Favaloro. The study included patients older than 21 years, during the three months following (3/20/2020- 6/25/2020) and prior (12/13/2019 - 03/19/2020) to the implementation of the isolation and the respective interannual comparators: (21/03/2019 - 06/27/2019 and 12/14/2018 - 03/20/2019). The frequency of severe arterial hypertension was compared between the different periods by chi-square test. The association between isolation and severe arterial hypertension was analyzed using simple and multivariate logistic regression. The population studied consisted of 12 144 patients 57.4 ± 17 years old, 45.4% women. During the period after the lockdown implementation, 1634 patients were admitted, 53.8% less than in the pre-lockdown implementation period; 23.9%, in the post-lockdown period, registered severe arterial hypertension, significantly more than in the pre-lockdown period (15.5%) and in the interannual comparator (17.6%). Consultation during the lockdown period was associated with severe arterial hypertension in the simple model (odds ratio 1.58) and in the multivariate model (adjusted odds ratio 1.37). In conclusion, social isolation was associated with an increase in severe arterial hypertension in the Emergency Service, independently of biological factors (age, sex) and other potential confounders.","Fosco, Matías J; Silva, Paula; Taborda, Guillermo A; Ahumada, Lucca",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481729/,1

198004,Viral respiratory disease in pregnancy.,2007,"The role of a novel ""small round virus"" (SRV) isolated from poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) cases in inducing PEMS and associated immune alterations was examined in this study. Specific-pathogen-free and conventional poults were orally challenged with SRV and/or turkey coronavirus and monitored for clinical signs. Intestines, thymus, bursa, and spleens were examined for SRV antigen at various days postinoculation (DPI). Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), thymocytes, and splenic lymphocytes from inoculated poults or lymphocytes isolated from healthy poults after incubation with SRV in vitro were examined for lymphoproliferative potential against concanavalin A (Con A). The incidence of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood and thymic lymphocytes of SRV-challenged poults was examined by flow cytometry. The results of these studies showed that the SRV challenge induced diarrhea, growth suppression, and atrophy of thymus and bursa resembling those of PEMS in field and/or experimental infections. The SRV antigen was detected in intestinal tissues soon after infection (i.e., at 2 and 4 DPI), whereas lymphoid tissues such as thymus, bursa, and spleen were positive for SRV antigen starting at 4 DPI until 8 DPI, suggesting virus translocation to lymphoid organs. The responsiveness of PBLs to Con A at 2 DPI was significantly reduced in all virus challenge groups (e.g., 28% and 22% in the SRV-alone group in studies 1 and 2, respectively) below the uninfected group. However, this suppressed response was no longer evident in the SRV group by 7 DPI. The SRV incubation with normal thymocytes and splenocytes in vitro resulted in significantly reduced lymphoproliferative response against Con A (41.2% and 10.49% reductions at 1:50 SRV dilution vs. controls in thymocytes and splenocytes, respectively). Flow cytometry analysis revealed a sudden decline at 2 DPI in the numbers of CD4- CD8+ lymphocyte subset in PBLs of SRV-infected poults. However, by 8 DPI, SRV-challenged poults had relatively higher CD4- CD8+ lymphocytes in PBLs. On the contrary, thymocytes had higher percentages of CD4- CD8+ lymphocytes at 2 and 4 DPI and reached comparable levels at 8 DPI in controls and SRV-infected poults. No differences were observed in CD4+ CD8- lymphocyte numbers in controls vs. SRV-infected poults. The findings of these studies imply that SRV may be a promising primary etiologic agent of PEMS. Furthermore, the SRV infection may compromise the lymphocyte-mediated immune defenses by reducing lymphoproliferation and the CD4- CD8+ (presumably T-cytotoxic cells) lymphocytes during the acute stage of SRV infection.","Qureshi, M A; Yu, M; Saif, Y M",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10879906/,1
198126,Office pediatrics: current issues in lower respiratory infections in children.,2005,"In a case-control study of the infectious agents associated with natural outbreaks of respiratory disease in pheasants, 28 batches of birds from sites affected by disease and eight batches of birds from unaffected sites were examined by six veterinary laboratories in England, Wales and Scotland, and tested for mycoplasmas, other bacteria and viruses. Sinusitis was the commonest sign of disease and was associated with Mycoplasma gallisepticum as detected by PCR in the trachea (P < 0.05) and conjunctiva (P < 0.01). Sinusitis was also associated with pasteurella cultured from the sinus (P < 0.05), antibody to avian pneumovirus (APV) (P < 0.01) and avian coronaviruses as detected by reverse-transcriptase PCR (P < 0.05); there was no association between disease and APV as detected by PCR. Avian coronaviruses were the most common infectious agents detected. They were genetically close to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) but differed in their gene sequence from all the serotypes of IBV previously identified in domestic fowl, and serological tests with six known IBV types showed little cross reactivity. Mycoplasma species other than M gallisepticum were cultured in 18 batches of pheasants but, with the exception of Mycoplasma gallinaceum, were not associated with disease.","Welchman, D de B; Bradbury, J M; Cavanagh, D; Aebischer, N J",The Veterinary record,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12054135/,1

The prevalence of diabetic patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two-to-threefold higher than that observed in non-diabetic patients and a risk of progressing to critical or fatal disease is increased by a factor of 3 to 4 in patients with diabetes. Multiple mechanisms link diabetes as a risk factor of severe COVID-19, including both diabetes-related (such as hyperglycaemia) and diabetes-associated (such as immune dysfunction, obesity and hypertension) components. Optimising glycaemic control to reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 appears important but challenging and the best choice of antidiabetic treatment remains to be established, even if an early introduction of insulin in type 2 diabetes patients with COVID-19 is encouraged upon admission to the hospital. Future investigations are necessary to improve both the management and the prognosis in these very high risk patients.","Paquot, N; Radermecker, R P",Revue medicale de Liege,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211437/,1
198529,Role of viruses and atypical bacteria in asthma exacerbations among children in Oporto (Portugal).,2007,"The aim of this study was to develop a rapid, sensitive and robust procedure for the qualitative detection of SARS coronavirus RNA. Three unique detection formats were developed for real-time RNA amplification assays: a post amplification detection step with a virus-specific internal capture probe based on Taqman (RT-PCR TaqMan assay), hybridization probe (RT-PCR hybridization probe assay) and a real-time assay with virus-specific molecular beacon probes (NASBA-Beacon assay). The analytical sensitivity or reproducibility of the test results among those three assays was compared. All assays yielded results by detecting SARS coronavirus targeting the BNI-1 region in less than 2 hours. RNA detection by all the formats was unaffected by the presence of human sputum. The limits of detection were at least 10 copies of input RNA for both RT-PCR formats (RT-PCR TaqMan and RT-PCR hybridization probe assays), while the NASBA-Beacon assay could detect as little as 1 copy per reaction, with high reproducibility of the coefficient of variation (CV) of <10. These results demonstrate that real-time NASBA provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for the routine qualitative assay of sputum for SARS corona viral RNA detection.","Chantratita, Wasun; Pongtanapisit, Wiroj; Piroj, Wantanich; Srichunrasmi, Chutatip; Seesuai, Somying",The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15689078/,1

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure are the most common events observed in severe cases and can be fatal. Cytokine storm syndrome emerges as one of the possibilities for the development of ARDS and multiorgan failure in severe cases of COVID-19. This case report describes a case of a 53-year-old male patient who has been diagnosed with COVID-19. Further evaluation in this patient showed that there was a marked increase in IL-6 level in blood accompanied with hyperferritinemia, which was in accordance with the characteristic of cytokine storm syndrome. Patient was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody and is an antagonist to IL-6 receptor. The binding between tocilizumab and IL-6 receptors effectively inhibit and manage cytokine storm syndrome. Although this case report reported the efficacy of tocilizumab in managing cytokine storm syndrome, tocilizumab has several adverse effects requiring close monitoring. Further clinical randomized control trial is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab administration in participants with various clinical characteristics and greater number of subjects.","Syam, Ari Fahrial; Pitoyo, Ceva W; Suhendro, Suhendro; Zulkarnain, Benny; Indrasari, Nuri D; Aditianingsih, Dita; Irawan, Cosphiadi; Susilo, Adityo; Rumende, Cleopas M; Wijaya, Ika P; Ibrahim, Fera; Rasmin, Menaldi; Alwi, Idrus; Makmun, Dadang",Acta medica Indonesiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251348/,1

A phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide sequences of HVR I of all the IBV showed that they were classified into 5 distinct Clusters. 16 out of 22 IBV isolates were grouped into Cluster I, and had higher homology with pigeon coronavirus isolates but lower homology with the Massachusetts (Mass) type vaccine strains. There were 4 and 3 amino-acid residues inserted at the sites of 33-34 and 34-35 respectively within HVR I in 15 isolates, except in isolate GX-NN6 there had 4 amino-acid residues inserted at the both sites; isolates GX-YL1 and GX-NN2 had close relationship with Mass type vaccine strains, and they shared Cluster II; isolates GX-G and GX-XD of Cluster III had close relationship with the Japanese strain JP Miyazaki 89 which was isolated at the same period; isolates GX-YL6 and GX-NN7 of Cluster V had close relationship with the European strain 4/91. The results showed that there were high phylogenetic diversity among the IBVs prevailed in the field in Guangxi resulting from the commonly occurred mutation or insertion within the S1 gene HVR I of the viruses, and majority of the isolates had lower homology with the commonly used Mass type vaccine strains. There was much higher homology among viruses isolated in the same period of time, but without distinct difference in geographical origins.","Wei, Zheng-Ji; Wei, Ping; Mo, Mei-Lan; Li, Meng; Wei, Tian-Chao; Li, Kang-Ran",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18533344/,1

Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing problem because the quantity and the rate at which it is generated has increased exponentially in the last 5 years. The rapid changes or upgradation in technologies, IT requirements for working or learning from home during COVID-19, manufacturers releasing new electronic gadgets and devices that serves the consumers comfort and a declension in services has contributed to an increase in the e-waste or waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) generation rates. The current status of e-waste generation, handling procedures and regulatory directives in USA, EU, China, India, Vietnam and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries are presented in this review. The recent developments in e-waste recycling methods/recovery of base and precious metals, the advantages and limitations of hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy, biohydrometallurgy and pyrolysis are discussed. Considering the impediments in the present technologies, the extraction of valuable resources, i.e. precious metals, from e-waste using suitable biocatalysts shows promising applications. This review also stresses on the research needs to assess the economic effects of involving different unit operations/process industries for resource recovery, reuse and recycling.","Rene, Eldon R; Sethurajan, Manivannan; Kumar Ponnusamy, Vinoth; Kumar, Gopalakrishnan; Bao Dung, Thi Ngoc; Brindhadevi, Kathirvel; Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan",J Hazard Mater,,1
210798,Robust Antibody and T Cell Responses in COVID-19 Patients Six Months After Infection (preprint),2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress and its associated factors among cancer survivors in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous Internet-based study was conducted between 23 April and 26 June 2020. During the study period, the country underwent phase 3 and phase 4 of the Movement Control Order (MCO), Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO), and Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO). Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a 14-item self-assessment scale for measuring distress (total HADS score; HADS-T) with two subscales, namely, anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Perceived threat of infection was measured based on the health belief model. RESULTS: From a total of 631 responses received, the proportion of participants with anxiety and depression symptoms (above threshold score of 8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) was 29.0 and 20.9%, respectively. Psychological distress (HADS-T > 16) was reported in 22.3% of the respondents. A total of 16.5% had combined anxiety and depression symptoms. The highest HADS-A (6.10; 95% CI 5.64-6.56), HADS-D (5.61; 95% CI 5.14-6.08), and HADS-T (11.71; 95% CI 10.84-12.58) scores were reported among respondents during phase 4 of the MCO. Partial least square-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) revealed that self-perceived health status, perceived susceptibility, and severity of COVID-19 have the greatest effect, leading to higher HADS-A, HADS-D, and HADS-T scores. CONCLUSION: Heightened psychological distress was evident in cancer survivors particularly during the enforcement of the MCO over COVID-19. Providing support to address cancer survivors' psychological and emotional needs during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.","Wong, Li Ping; Lai, Lee Lee; See, Mee Hoong; Alias, Haridah; Danaee, Mahmoud; Ting, Chuo Yew; Tok, Peter Seah Keng",Support. care cancer,,1

This meta-analysis analyses the prevalence of post-COVID-19 symptoms in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients recovered from COVID-19 . METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases, as well as medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers were searched up to March 15, 2021. Peer-reviewed studies or preprints reporting data on post-COVID-19 symptoms collected by personal, telephonic or electronic interview were included. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We used a random-effects models for meta-analytical pooled prevalence of each post-COVID-19 symptom, and I² statistics for heterogeneity. Data synthesis was categorized at 30, 60, and &#8805;90 days after . RESULTS: From 15,577 studies identified, 29 peer-reviewed studies and 4 preprints met inclusion criteria. The sample included 15,244 hospitalized and 9011 non-hospitalized patients. The methodological quality of most studies was fair. The results showed that 63.2, 71.9 and 45.9% of the sample exhibited &#8805;one post-COVID-19 symptom at 30, 60, or &#8805;90days after onset/hospitalization. Fatigue and dyspnea were the most prevalent symptoms with a pooled prevalence ranging from 35 to 60% depending on the follow-up. Other post-COVID-19 symptoms included cough (20-25%), anosmia (10-20%), ageusia (15-20%) or joint pain (15-20%). Time trend analysis revealed a decreased prevalence 30days after with an increase after 60days . CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that post-COVID-19 symptoms are present in more than 60% of patients infected by SARS-CoV­2. Fatigue and dyspnea were the most prevalent post-COVID-19 symptoms, particularly 60 and &#8805;90 days after.","Fernández-de-Las-Peñas, César; Palacios-Ceña, Domingo; Gómez-Mayordomo, Víctor; Florencio, Lidiane L; Cuadrado, María L; Plaza-Manzano, Gustavo; Navarro-Santana, Marcos",Eur. j. intern. med,,1
212998,Imaging of Oxford/AstraZeneca® COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia,2021,"The tempo-spatial patterns of Covid-19 infections are a result of nested personal, societal, and political decisions that involve complicated epidemiological dynamics across overlapping spatial scales. High infection ""hotspots"" interspersed within regions where infections remained sporadic were ubiquitous early in the outbreak, but the spatial signature of the infection evolved to affect most regions equally, albeit with distinct temporal patterns. The sparseness of Covid-19 infections in the United States was analyzed at scales spanning from 10 to 2,600 km (county to continental scale). Spatial evolution of Covid-19 cases in the United States followed multifractal scaling. A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population. Instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, a kernel-modulated approach is developed to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. Multiphase Covid-19 epidemics were reasonably reproduced by the proposed kernel-modulated susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. The work explained the fact that while the reproduction number was reduced due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, social distancing, etc.), subsequent multiple epidemic waves still occurred; this was due to an increase in susceptible population flow following a relaxation of travel restrictions and corollary stay-at-home orders. This study provides an original interpretation of Covid-19 spread together with a pragmatic approach that can be imminently used to capture the spatial intermittency at all epidemiologically relevant scales while preserving the ""disordered"" spatial pattern of infectious cases.","Geng, Xiaolong; Katul, Gabriel G; Gerges, Firas; Bou-Zeid, Elie; Nassif, Hani; Boufadel, Michel C",Proc.

As viral disease emergence is expected to accelerate, these data dictate a need for proactive approaches to develop broadly active family-specific and cross-family therapeutics for use in future disease outbreaks. Emphasis should focus not only on the development of broad-spectrum small-molecule and antibody direct-acting antivirals, but also on host-factor therapeutics, including repurposing previously approved or in-pipeline drugs. Another new class of therapeutics with great antiviral therapeutic potential is RNA-based therapeutics. Rather than only focusing on known risks, dedicated efforts must be made toward pre-emptive research focused on outbreak-prone virus families, ultimately offering a strategy to shorten the gap between outbreak and response. Emphasis should also focus on orally available drugs for outpatient use, if possible, and on identifying combination therapies that combat viral and immune-mediated pathologies, extend the effectiveness of therapeutic windows and reduce drug resistance. While such an undertaking will require new vision, dedicated funding and private, federal and academic partnerships, this approach offers hope that global populations need never experience future pandemics such as COVID-19.","Meganck, Rita M; Baric, Ralph S",Nat Med,,1

The effects on patients' interest of elective neurosurgical procedures are currently unexplored. METHODS: Using Google Trends, search terms of 7 different neurosurgical procedure categories (trauma, spine, tumor, movement disorder, epilepsy, endovascular, and miscellaneous) were assessed in terms of relative search volume (RSV) between January 2015 and September 2020. Analyses of search terms were performed for over the short term (February 18, 2020, to April 18, 2020), intermediate term (January 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020), and long term (January 2015 to September 2020). State-level interest during phase I reopening (April 28, 2020, to May 31, 2020) was also evaluated. RESULTS: In the short term, RSVs of 4 categories (epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the intermediate term, RSVs of 5 categories (miscellaneous, epilepsy, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. In the long term, RSVs of nearly all categories (endovascular, epilepsy, miscellaneous, movement disorder, spine, and tumor) were significantly lower in the post-CMS announcement period. Only the movement disorder procedure category had significantly higher RSV in states that reopened early. CONCLUSIONS: With the recommendation for cessation of elective surgeries, patient interests in overall elective neurosurgical procedures have dropped significantly. With gradual reopening, there has been a resurgence in some procedure types. Google Trends has proven to be a useful tracker of patient interest and may be used by neurosurgical departments to facilitate outreach strategies.","Feng, Austin Y; Garcia, Cesar A; Jin, Michael C; Ho, Allen L; Li, Gordon; Grant, Gerald; Ratliff, John; Skirboll, Stephen L",World neurosurgery (Online),,1

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. In China, the pandemic was controlled after 2 mo through effective policies and containment measures. Describing the detailed policies and containment measures used to control the epidemic in Chongqing will provide a reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in other areas of the world. AIM To explore the effects of different policies and containment measures on the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing. METHODS Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Chongqing were prospectively collected from January 21 to March 15, 2020. The policies and prevention measures implemented by the government during the epidemic period were also collected. Trend analysis was performed to explore the impact of the main policy measures on the effectiveness of the control of COVID-19 in Chongqing. RESULTS As of March 15, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Chongqing was 1.84/100000 (576 cases) and the infection fatality rate was 1.04% (6/576). The spread of COVID-19 was controlled by effective policies that involved establishing a group for directing the COVID-19 epidemic control effort; strengthening guidance and supervision; ensuring the supply of daily necessities and medical supplies and equipment to residents; setting up designated hospitals; implementing legal measures; and enhancing health education. Medical techniques were implemented to improve the recovery rate and control the epidemic. Policies such as ""the lockdown of Wuhan"", ""initiating a first-level response to major public health emergencies"", and ""implementing the closed management of residential communities"" significantly curbed the spread of COVID-19. Optimizing the diagnosis process, shortening the diagnosis time, and constructing teams of clinical experts facilitated the provision of ""one team of medical experts for each patient"" treatment for severe patients, which significantly improved the recovery rate and reduced the infection fatality rate. CONCLUSION The prevention policies and containment measures implemented by the government and medical institutions are highly effective in controlling the spread of the epidemic and increasing the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients.","Liang, Xiao-Hua; Tang, Xian; Luo, Ye-Tao; Zhang, Min; Feng, Ze-Pei",World J.

242049,Global Sequence Analysis and Expression of Azurin Gene in Different Clinical Specimens of Burn Patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the effect of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory viral loads. PATIENTS AND METHODS: French Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was considered the end point. RESULTS: Six patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much lower average carrying duration than reported in the litterature for untreated patients. Azithromycin added to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination. CONCLUSION: Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.","Gautret, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Parola, Philippe; Hoang, Van Thuan; Meddeb, Line; Mailhe, Morgane; Doudier, Barbara; Courjon, Johan; Giordanengo, Valérie; Vieira, Vera Esteves; Tissot Dupont, Hervé; Honoré, Stéphane; Colson, Philippe; Chabrière, Eric; La Scola, Bernard; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Brouqui, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,1
242078,Covid-19 vaccines: Should we allow human challenge studies to infect healthy volunteers with SARS-CoV-2?,2020,"PURPOSE: Cytokine storm, an uncontrolled overproduction of inflammatory cytokines contributing to an aberrant systemic inflammatory response, is a major pathological feature of acute respiratory distress syndromes being severe manifestations of COVID-19, thus highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for COVID-19. We aimed to determine associations of circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines with severity and mortality of COVID-19 by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search in electronic databases consisting of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library and in a hand searching of reference lists from inception to July 31, 2020, was performed using the following search terms: COVID-19, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;). Mean difference (MD) from individual studies was pooled using a random-effects model. Quality assessment, publication bias, meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 6212 COVID-19 patients from 24 eligible studies were included. Compared with non-severe COVID-19 patients, systemic levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but not TNF-&#945;, were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients (MD = 18.63, 95% CI: 10.91, 26.35, P < 0.00001; MD = 2.61, 95% CI: 2.00, 2.32, P < 0.00001; respectively). For COVID-19 mortality, circulating levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; were found to be significantly increased in non-survivors when compared with survivors (MD = 57.82, 95% CI: 10.04, 105.59, P = 0.02; MD = 4.94, 95% CI: 3.89, 6.00, P < 0.00001; MD = 5.60, 95% CI: 4.03, 7.17, P < 0.00001; respectively). CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of IL-6 and IL-10 might have great potential as biomarkers for the disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Udomsinprasert, Wanvisa; Jittikoon, Jiraphun; Sangroongruangsri, Sermsiri; Chaikledkaew, Usa",J. clin. immunol,,1

243141,Exploring the Effect of 2019-nCoV Containment Policies on Crime: The Case of Los Angeles,2020-03-23,"The current consensus is that 2 doses of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are needed for people without COVID-19 history, while for those who had suffered COVID-19, a single dose may be enough to achieve high levels of immunization. This consensus has been based on results obtained in middle-aged populations, whereas only few data exist for the oldest and most frail adults such as nursing home residents (NH-Res) that is, the population most vulnerable to develop severe forms of COVID-19. In this study, we studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG(S) level of NH-Res and healthcare workers (HCWs) with or without a history of COVID-19 infection taking into account the time since immunization (COVID-19 and/or vaccination). 654 subjects were analyzed: 397 NH-Res (median age 88, IQR 82-93 years, 75% women) and 257 Health Care Workers (HCWs, median 46, IQR 38-54 years, 81% women). NH-Res and HCWs were classified in one of the following 3 groups: No-COVID history and 2 vaccine shots (COV-NO/2VACC); Yes-COVID history and 1 (COV-YES/1VACC) or 2 (COV-YES/2VACC) vaccine injections. The time-related decrease in IgG (S) in subjects without COVID-19 history, SARS-COV-2 serology would be negative in HCWs approximately 220 days and in residents 180 days after vaccination. This time-related decrease was much slower in those with history of COVID. NH-Res belonging into the COV-NO/2VACC and the COV-YES/1VACC groups showed lower IgG (S) levels than the same groups of HCWs (for both groups, p<0.0001), whereas in the group COV-YES/2VACC, IgG (S) levels were similar in NH-Res and HCWs (p=0.88). These results remained unchanged after adjustment for age and duration since immunization. Thus, in NH-Res, 2 vaccine shots were associated with a more pronounced immune response, whereas in HCWs, 1 or 2 vaccine shots in patients with COVID-19 history did make any difference. These results indicate significant differences in mRNA vaccination between NH-Res and middle-aged controls, and could contribute to the specification of vaccine policy in this very old, frail population.","Jeulin, Helene; Craus, Denis; Labat, Carlos; Benetos, Athanase",,,1

244112,Advanced glycosylation end products inhibit the proliferation of bone-marrow stromal cells through activating MAPK pathway,2021,"Introduction: The rapidly spreading Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) appeared to be a highly transmissible pathogen in healthcare environments and had resulted in a significant number of patients with respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy, an aerosol-generating procedure that places healthcare workers at high risk of contracting the infection. Instead of deferring or delaying the procedure, we developed and implemented a novel percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) protocol aimed at minimizing the risk of transmission while maintaining favorable procedural outcome. Patients and Methods. All patients who underwent PDT per novel protocol were included in the study. The key element of the protocol was the use of apnea during the critical part of the insertion and upon any opening of the ventilator circuit. This was coupled with the use of enhanced personnel protection equipment (PPE) with a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The operators underwent antibody serology testing and were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms two weeks from the last procedure included in the study. Results: Between March 12th and June 30th, 2020, a total of 32 patients underwent PDT per novel protocol. The majority (80%) were positive for COVID-19 at the time of the procedure. The success rate was 94%. Only one patient developed minor self-limited bleeding. None of the proceduralists developed positive serology or any symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: A novel protocol that uses periods of apnea during opening of the ventilator circuit along with PAPR-enhanced PPE for PDT on COVID-19 patients appears to be effective and safe for patients and healthcare providers.","Boujaoude, Ziad; Madisi, Nagendra; Patel, Bhavi; Rachoin, Jean-Sebastien; Dellinger, R Phillip; Abouzgheib, Wissam",Pulm Med,,1

In this article, we discuss current knowledge of immune responses that confer protection to more than 80% of the people who have been infected and possible mechanisms by which the virus escapes immune surveillance in people who develop severe disease and those who die from the disease. We also discuss the differences in the immune responses by which, in most children, the infection results in only mild disease, although causing severe disease in some adults. Understanding these differences in both the innate and adaptive immune responses among these people can lead to the development of biotherapeutic treatment modalities that could modulate immune responses to offer protection against SARS-CoV-2 and block the ability of the virus to cause severe disease or death in humans.

256853,"A review for natural polysaccharides with anti-pulmonary fibrosis properties, which may benefit to patients infected by 2019-nCoV",2020,"AIM: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, human milk banks world-wide continue to provide donor human milk to vulnerable infants who lack access to mother's own milk. Under these circumstances, ensuring the safety of donor human milk is paramount, as the risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk by pasteurisation and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk under cold storage. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally inoculated into human milk samples from healthy donors or into a control medium. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after Holder pasteurisation (63°C for 30 min), heating to 56°C for 30 min, or after 48 h of storage at 4°C or -30°C. Infectious titres of virus were determined at 72 h post-infection by endpoint titration. RESULTS: Following heating to 63°C or 56°C for 30 min, replication competent (i.e. live) SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in both human milk and the control medium. Cold storage of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk (either at 4°C or -30°C) did not significantly impact infectious viral load over a 48 h period. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, suggesting that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 to vulnerable infants through pasteurised donor human milk. The demonstrated stability of SARS-CoV-2 in refrigerated or frozen human milk may assist in the development of guidelines around safe expressing and storing of milk from COVID-19 infected mothers.","Walker, Gregory J; Clifford, Vanessa; Bansal, Nidhi; Stella, Alberto O; Turville, Stuart; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Klein, Laura D; Rawlinson, William",J. paediatr. child health,,1

Moreover, social and economic changes caused by the pandemic, along with the traditional difficulties regarding treatment access and adherence-will certainly worsen during this period, therefore aggravate their condition. In addition, this population are potential vectors of transmission. In that sense, specific strategies for prevention and treatment must be discussed. health care professionals dealing with SUD must be aware of the risks and challenges they will meet during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Addiction care must be reinforced, instead of postponed, in order to avoid complications of both SUD and COVID-19 and to prevent the transmission of coronavirus.","Ornell, Felipe; Moura, Helena Ferreira; Scherer, Juliana Nichterwitz; Pechansky, Flavio; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim; von Diemen, Lisia",Psychiatry Res,,1

Though emerging approaches such as immunotherapy is promising, it is still faced with immune tolerance, an obstacle that may be overcome by targeting autophagy-related (ATG) genes. After identifying three differentially expressed ATG genes (RIPK2, MUL1 and CXCR4), we constructed an ATG gene risk signature by Kaplan-Meier, univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate Cox regression, followed by internal and external validation using K-M and ROC analysis. Since gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) suggested that the signature was strongly associated with immune cell functions, CIBERSORT, LM22 matrix and Pearson correlation were further performed, showing that the risk signature was significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes. In conclusion, we identified and independently validated an ATG gene risk signature for LGG patients, as well as discovering its significant association with LGG immune microenvironment.","Lin, Jia-Zhe; Lin, Nuan",Genomics,,1
261737,Effectiveness of the Single-Dose Ad26.COV2.S COVID Vaccine,2021,"Objectives: This study is aimed at exploring the relationship of the viral load of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and investigating the dynamic change of patients' viral load during the conversion from mild COVID-19 to severe COVID-19, so as to clarify the correlation between the viral load and progression of COVID-19. Methods: This paper included 38 COVID-19 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Jiaxing from January 28, 2020, to March 6, 2020, and they were clinically classified according to the Guidelines on the Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment. According to the instructions of the Nucleic Acid Detection Kit for the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), respiratory tract specimens (throat swabs) were collected from patients for nucleic acid testing. Patients' lymphocyte count and neutrophil count were determined by blood routine examination, and CRP was measured by biochemical test. Results: The results of our study suggested that the cycle threshold (Ct) value of Nucleocapsid protein (N) gene examined by nucleic acid test was markedly positively correlated with lymphocyte count (p = 0.0445, R 2 = 0.1203), but negatively correlated with neutrophil count (p = 0.0446, R 2 = 0.1167) and CRP (p = 0.0393, R 2 = 0.1261), which indicated that patients with a higher viral load tended to have lower lymphocyte count but higher neutrophil count and CRP. Additionally, we detected the dynamic change of Ct value in patients who developed into a severe case, finding that viral load of 3 patients increased before disease progression, whereas this phenomenon was not found in 2 patients with underlying diseases. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly negatively correlated with lymphocyte count, but markedly positively correlated with neutrophil count and CRP. The rise of viral load is very likely to be the key factor leading to the overloading of the body's immune response and resulting in the disease progression into severe disease.","Chen, Wenyu; Xiao, Qinfeng; Fang, Zhixian; Lv, Xiaodong; Yao, Ming; Deng, Min",Comput Math Methods Med,,1

266804,The first known case of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia in Australia,2021,"A small number of individuals infected within a community can lead to the rapid spread of the disease throughout that community, leading to an epidemic outbreak. This is even more true for highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19, known to be caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Mathematical models of epidemics allow estimating several impacts on the population and, therefore, are of great use for the definition of public health policies. Some of these measures include the isolation of the infected (also known as quarantine), and the vaccination of the susceptible. In a possible scenario in which a vaccine is available, but with limited access, it is necessary to quantify the levels of vaccination to be applied, taking into account the continued application of preventive measures. This work concerns the simulation of the spread of the COVID-19 disease in a community by applying the Monte Carlo method to a Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered (SEIR) stochastic epidemic model. To handle the computational effort involved, a simple parallelization approach was adopted and deployed in a small HPC cluster. The developed computational method allows to realistically simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a medium-sized community and to study the effect of preventive measures such as quarantine and vaccination. The results show that an effective combination of vaccination with quarantine can prevent the appearance of major epidemic outbreaks, even if the critical vaccination coverage is not reached.","Balsa, Carlos; Lopes, Isabel; Guarda, Teresa; Rufino, José",Comput Math Organ Theory,,1

As a large London transplant center serving a diverse patient population, we report the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort of 2848 kidney and/or pancreas transplant patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively for all transplant patients who attended hospital during the peak of the pandemic and had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty percent were treated as outpatients, 59% were admitted to the general ward, and 21% required intensive care. Treatment consisted of reduced immunosuppression, antibiotics for pneumonia or sepsis, and other supportive treatments. Within our cohort, 12 patients died (18%), with an overall mortality of 0.4%.

Despite significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region still experienced high air pollution concentrations. Employing two emissions reduction scenarios, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to investigate the PM2.5 concentrations change in this region. The model using the scenario (C3) with greater traffic reductions performed better compared to the observed PM2.5. Compared with the no reductions base-case (scenario C1), PM2.5 reductions with scenario C3 were 2.70, 2.53, 2.90, 2.98, 3.30, 2.81, 2.82, 2.98, 2.68, and 2.83 µg/m3 in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Cangzhou, Chengde, Handan, Hengshui, Tangshan, and Xingtai, respectively.

One College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) class utilized the teleconferencing tool Zoom. Zoom's breakout rooms and waiting room features were used to facilitate a clinical interviewing skills lab and telemedicine-type encounter with standardized patients. We were able to successfully designate groups of approximately 10 students into three rooms, amongst which the standardized patients moved at set intervals. Faculty facilitators participated in each room to guide students, and one support staff member served as host to manage the technical aspects of the overall meeting.

D614G did not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact and that the conformation is shifted toward an ACE2 binding-competent state, which is modeled to be on pathway for virion membrane fusion with target cells. Consistent with this more open conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.","Yurkovetskiy, Leonid; Wang, Xue; Pascal, Kristen E; Tomkins-Tinch, Christopher; Nyalile, Thomas P; Wang, Yetao; Baum, Alina; Diehl, William E; Dauphin, Ann; Carbone, Claudia; Veinotte, Kristen; Egri, Shawn B; Schaffner, Stephen F; Lemieux, Jacob E; Munro, James B; Rafique, Ashique; Barve, Abhi; Sabeti, Pardis C; Kyratsous, Christos A; Dudkina, Natalya V; Shen, Kuang; Luban, Jeremy",Cell,,1

While these studies can expedite the drug approval process, researchers must carefully design and analyze such studies in order to perform rigorous science that is reproducible and credible. This article focuses on several key design and analysis considerations that can improve the scientific rigor of non-randomized studies of off-label drugs. Areas covered: The aim of this article is to provide an overview of best approaches that should be considered for non-randomized studies on off-label drugs. We discuss these approaches in detail and use a non-randomized study by Rivera et al. in Cancer Discovery as an example of methods that have been undertaken for COVID-19. Expert opinion: While non-randomized studies are inherently biased, they may be unavoidable in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where researchers need to find an effective treatment quickly. We believe that a well-formed experimental design, high-quality data collection, and a well-thought-out statistical and data analysis plan are sufficient to produce rigorous and credible results for making an optimal decision.","Shyr, Derek; Shyr, Yu",Expert Opin Investig Drugs,,1

The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with the cause of death in hospitalized patients. Design: Retrospective observational study;deidentified discharge summaries of deceased patients were reviewed by two intensivists and classified as coronavirus disease 2019-related (caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) or coronavirus disease 2019-unrelated (not caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or indeterminate) deaths. For classification disagreement, a separate group of three intensivists reviewed the discharge summaries and arbitrated to determine the cause of death. Setting: Single-center study performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Patients: All adult patients (&gt; 18 yr) admitted from March 10, 2020, to October 22, 2020, with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results who expired during their hospitalization were identified. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Patient demographics, comorbidities, prescribed medications, and ventilatory support data were collected. Comparison between groups was performed using t test and chi-square test. During the study period, 1,052 patients were admitted within 14 days of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive test results, of whom 100 expired during the hospitalization. Deceased patients were predominantly male and older than 65 years. Obesity (body mass index &gt;= 30 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was present in 41%, and common comorbidities included hypertension (47%), diabetes (30%), and heart failure (20%). Death was classified as directly caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 85% and not caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5%. An indeterminate cause of death in 10% was due to insufficient information or an atypical presentation. The observed interrater agreement on the cause of death classification was 81%.

312903,Serological differentiation between COVID-19 and SARS infections,2020,"Systemic arterial hypertension (referred to as hypertension herein) is a major risk factor of mortality worldwide, and its importance is further emphasized in the context of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection referred to as COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections commonly are older and have a history of hypertension. Almost 75% of patients who have died in the pandemic in Italy had hypertension. This raised multiple questions regarding a more severe course of COVID-19 in relation to hypertension itself as well as its treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). We provide a critical review on the relationship of hypertension, RAS, and risk of lung injury. We demonstrate lack of sound evidence that hypertension per se is an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Interestingly, ACEIs and ARBs may be associated with lower incidence and/or improved outcome in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. We also review in detail the molecular mechanisms linking the RAS to lung damage and the potential clinical impact of treatment with RAS blockers in patients with COVID-19 and a high cardiovascular and renal risk. This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues. In summary, a critical review of available evidence does not support a deleterious effect of RAS blockers in COVID-19 infections. Therefore, there is currently no reason to discontinue RAS blockers in stable patients facing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kreutz, Reinhold; Algharably, Engi Abd El-Hady; Azizi, Michel; Dobrowolski, Piotr; Guzik, Tomasz; Januszewicz, Andrzej; Persu, Alexandre; Prejbisz, Aleksander; Riemer, Thomas Günther; Wang, Ji-Guang; Burnier, Michel",Cardiovasc Res,,1

316149,The phenotypic changes of Î³Î´ T cells in COVID-19 patients,2020,"The common trait among the betacoronaviruses that emerged during the past two decades (the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - SARS-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus - MERS-CoV, and the recent SARS coronavirus 2 - SARS-CoV-2) is their probable animal origin, all deriving from viruses present in bat species. Bats have arisen the attention of the scientific community as reservoir of emerging viruses, given their wide geographical distribution, their biological diversity (around 1400 species, 21 different families and over 200 genera), and their peculiar ecological and physiological characteristics which seem to facilitate them in harbouring a high viral diversity. Several human activities may enable the viral spill-over from bats to humans, such as deforestation, land-use changes, increased livestock grazing or intensive production of vegetal cultures. In addition, the globalization of trade and high global human mobility allow these viruses to be disseminated in few hours in many parts of the World. In order to avoid the emergence of new pandemic threats in the future we need to substantially change our global models of social and economic development, posing the conservation of biodiversity and the preservation of natural ecosystems as a pillar for the protection of global human health.","Calistri, P.; Decaro, N.; Lorusso, A.",Microorganisms,,1
316453,Safety and efficacy study: Short-term application of radiofrequency ablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy for Barcelona Clinical Liver Cancer stage 0-B1 hepatocellular carcinoma,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The management of COVID-19 patients requires efficiency and accuracy in methods of detection, identification, monitoring, and treatment feasible in every hospital. Aside from clinical presentations and laboratory markers, chest x-ray imaging could also detect pneumonia caused by COVID-19. It is also a fast, simple, cheap, and safe modality used for the management of COVID-19 patients. Established scoring systems of COVID-19 chest x-ray imaging include Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) and Brixia classification. A modified scoring system has been adopted from BRIXIA and RALE scoring systems and has been made to adjust the scoring system needs at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Indonesia. This study aims to determine the value of scoring systems through chest x-ray imaging in evaluating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were collected from May to June of 2020 who underwent chest x-ray evaluation. Each image is then scored using three types of classifications: modified score, RALE score, and Brixia score. The scores are then analyzed and compared with the clinical conditions and laboratory markers to determine their value in evaluating the severity of COVID-19 infection in patients. RESULTS: A total of 115 patients were males (51.1%) and 110 were females (48.9%). All three scoring systems are significantly correlated with the clinical severity of the disease, with the strengths of correlation in order from the strongest to weakest as Brixia score (p&lt;0.01, correlation coefficient 0.232), RALE score (p&lt;0.01, correlation coefficient 0.209), and Dr. Soetomo General Hospital score (p&lt;0.01, correlation coefficient 0.194). All three scoring systems correlate significantly with each other. Dr. Soetomo General Hospital score correlates more towards Brixia score (p&lt;0.01, correlation coefficient 0.865) than RALE score (p&lt;0.01, correlation coefficient 0.855). Brixia to RALE score correlates with a coefficient of 0.857 (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: The modified scoring system can help determine the severity of the disease progression in COVID-19 patients especially in areas with shortages of facilities and specialists.","Setiawati, R.; Widyoningroem, A.; Handarini, T.; Hayati, F.; Basja, A.

316693,Correction: Insights from immuno-oncology: the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Statement on access to IL-6-targeting therapies for COVID-19,2020,"Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen A [HLA-A], -B, and -C genes) may affect susceptibility to and severity of the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA-A, -B, and -C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides. We further explored the potential for cross-protective immunity conferred by prior exposure to four common human coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome was successfully sampled and was represented by a diversity of HLA alleles. However, we found that HLA-B*46:01 had the fewest predicted binding peptides for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that individuals with this allele may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, as they were previously shown to be for SARS (M. Lin, H.-T. Tseng, J. A. Trejaut, H.-L. Lee, et al., BMC Med Genet 4:9, 2003, https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2350-4-9). Conversely, we found that HLA-B*15:03 showed the greatest capacity to present highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 peptides that are shared among common human coronaviruses, suggesting that it could enable cross-protective T-cell-based immunity. Finally, we reported global distributions of HLA types with potential epidemiological ramifications in the setting of the current pandemic.IMPORTANCE Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. In particular, understanding how variation in HLA may affect the course of COVID-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive. Pairing HLA typing with COVID-19 testing where feasible could improve assessment of severity of viral disease in the population. Following the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, individuals with high-risk HLA types could be prioritized for vaccination.","Nguyen, Austin; David, Julianne K; Maden, Sean K; Wood, Mary A; Weeder, Benjamin R; Nellore, Abhinav; Thompson, Reid F",J. virol,,1

This study examines the effect of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on mindfulness among Chinese college students in September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that ACEs negatively affected students' mindfulness. The data were collected from 1,871 college students from 12 colleges across China. The results aligned with our hypothesis that ACEs was negatively associated with mindfulness. In particular, emotional abuse and neglect in childhood appear to have the most negative effects on mindfulness compared to other dimensions of ACEs such as physical abuse and household challenges.","Huang, C.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All imaging departments in the UK were contacted and asked about the provision of home reporting and IT support before and after the first wave of the pandemic. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-seven of the 217 departments contacted replied, producing a response rate of 61%. There was a 147% increase in the provision of remote access viewing and reporting platforms during the pandemic. Although 578 consultants had access to a viewing platform pre-pandemic, this had increased to 1,431 during the course of the first wave. CONCLUSION: This survey represents work undertaken by UK NHS Trusts in co-ordinating and providing increased home-reporting facilities to UK radiologists during the first wave of this global pandemic. The impact of these facilities has been shown to allow more than just the provision of reporting of both elective and emergency imaging and provides additional flexibility in how UK radiologists can help support and provide services.

METHOD: Final participants were 71 adults who were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants responded to daily questions regarding ruminations they engaged in and PTG they experienced that day for a total of 29 days. RESULTS: As expected, there was no significant association between intrusive rumination and PTG, but a significant positive association was found between deliberate rumination and PTG. In addition, a person of color and those who reported as religious experienced higher levels of PTG. Furthermore, there was a significant between-person variability on the effect of deliberate rumination on PTG. CONCLUSIONS: The current study supports previous findings between rumination and PTG. It also raises the importance of acknowledging that the levels of one's PTG following deliberate rumination may differ greatly from the typical individual, indicating the need to be mindful of individual experience.

We are poorly aware of their survival in environment and precise factors of their transmission. Countries located in east and west of globe did not have a significant impact on prevalence of disease among communities, and on the other hand, north and south have provided a model for relative prediction of disease outbreaks. The 2019-nCoV can survive for up to 9 days at 25 °C, and if this temperature rises to 30 °C, its lifespan will be shorter. The 2019-nCoV is sensitive to humidity, and lifespan of viruses in 50% humidity is longer than that of 30%. Also, temperature and humidity are important factors influencing the COVID-19 mortality rate and may facilitate 2019-nCoV transmission. Thus, considering the available and recent evidence, it seems that low temperatures, as well as dry and unventilated air, may affect stability and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.","Harmooshi, Narges Nazari; Shirbandi, Kiarash; Rahim, Fakher",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,1

Several reports highlighted the risk of infection and disease in pregnant women and neonates. To assess the risk of clinical complications in pregnant women and neonates infected with SARS-CoV-2 carrying out a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies. DATA SOURCES: Search of the scientific evidence was performed using the engines PubMed and Scopus, including articles published from December 2019 to 15 April 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Only observational studies focused on the assessment of clinical outcomes associated with pregnancy in COVID-19 women were selected. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The first screening was based on the assessment of titles and abstracts, followed by the evaluation of full-texts. Qualitative variables were summarized with frequencies, whereas quantitative variables with central and variability indicators depending on their parametric distribution. Forest plots were used to describe point estimates and in-between studies variability. Study quality assessment was performed. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected. All of them were carried out in China. The mean (SD) age and gestational age of pregnant women were 30.3 (1.5) years and 35.9 (2.9) weeks, respectively. The mean (SD) duration from the first symptoms to the hospital admission and to labour were 5.5 (2.0) and 9.5 (8.7) days, respectively. Patients mainly complained of fever and cough (pooled (95 % CI) proportions were 76.0 % (57.0 %-90.0 %) and 38.0 (28.0 %-47.0 %), respectively). Several antibiotics, antivirals, and corticosteroids were prescribed in different combinations. The pooled prevalence of maternal complications and of caesarean section were 45.0 % (95 % CI: 24.0 %-67.0 %) and 88.0 % (95 %CI: 82.0 %-94.0 %). A proportion of pregnant women less than 20 % were admitted to ICU. The pooled proportion of preterm infants was 23.0 % (95 %CI: 11.0 %-39.0 %). The most frequent neonatal complications were pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome. The pooled percentage of infected neonates was 6.0 % (95 %CI: 2.0 %-12.0 %). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests a high rate of maternal and neonatal complications in infected individuals. However, the current scientific evidence highlights a low risk of neonatal infection.

It is shown that all of these parameters directly influence the silica-condensation kinetics. Concerning films with the 2D-hexagonal structure belonging to the CTAB-water phase diagram, the mesophase is mainly stabilized by interactions between cylindrical micelles, and the reactivity of the silica sol does not drastically modify the extent of the order in films. In contrast, the formation of a rigid silica network just after the micellar organization appears to be crucial to prepare well-organized films with the 3D-hexagonal or the cubic transient structure. In the latter case, the size and reactivity of silica clusters have to be controlled to obtain rapid gelation in the deposited sol.","Matheron, Muriel; Gacoin, Thierry; Boilot, Jean-Pierre",Soft Matter,,1

Exonuclease activity enables the RdRp complex to remove wrongly incorporated bases via proofreading, a process not utilized by other RNA viruses. However, it is unclear why the RdRp complex needs proofreading and what the associated trade-offs are. Here we investigate the interplay among the accuracy, speed, and energetic cost of proofreading in the RdRp complex using a kinetic model and bioinformatics analysis. We find that proofreading nearly optimizes the rate of functional virus production. However, we find that further optimization would lead to a significant increase in the proofreading cost. Unexpected importance of the cost minimization is further supported by other global analyses. We speculate that cost optimization could help avoid cell defense responses. Thus, proofreading is essential for the production of functional viruses, but its rate is limited by energy costs.","Mallory, Joel D; Mallory, Xian F; Kolomeisky, Anatoly B; Igoshin, Oleg A",J Phys Chem Lett,,1

354585,[Q&A on Novel Coronavirus Infections in Ophthalmology],2020,"OBJECTIVES: This is the second of a 2-part article that discusses essential case management practices and strategies amidst the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in support of managing during a crisis such as a global pandemic. Part II continues to describe reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and their leaders to meet the needs of patients/support systems during the crisis. It focuses on the increased need for end-of-life care, impact on workers' compensation case management practice, and the self-care needs of the professional case manager. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, with special focus on acute care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a crisis case managers and other health care professionals never faced something like it before. At the same time, it has provided opportunities for innovation and creativity including use of digital and telecommunication technology in new ways to ensure the continued delivery of health and human services to those who need them regardless of location. It has also resulted in the development of necessary and impactful partnerships within and across different health care organizations and diverse professional disciplines. Most importantly, this pandemic has required special attention to the increased need of patients for timely palliative and end-of-life care. In addition, it has prompted a focus on the safety, health, and well-being of case managers and other health care professionals, resulting in expanded workers' compensation case management practice coupled with the need for self-care and resilience. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles and responsibilities are even more necessary during the uncertainty of a global pandemic such as COVID-19. So far, the experience of this crisis has resulted in a deliberate need to ensure the safety of both, those who are the recipients of health care services and those who are responsible for the provision of care. Self-care and resilience of health care professionals and case managers, especially due to the complex dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, have advanced a desirable and necessary view of remote/virtual practice and as a strategy for enhancing the person's health and well-being. This pandemic has forced the development of impactful partnerships and collaborations among the diverse contexts of health care organizations and support service providers. These contexts of care delivery have also emphasized the necessary legal and ethical practice of case managers and the other involved parties. Experts agree that the innovative care delivery methods practiced during the pandemic will undoubtedly remain as desirable beyond the current crisis period.","Tahan, Hussein M",Prof. case manag,,1
357439,Expression of the SAR2-Cov-2 receptor ACE2 reveals the susceptibility of COVID-19 in non-small cell lung cancer,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the promotive role of TRPP2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) proliferation by targeting Skp2/c-Myc, thus accelerating the malignant progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TRPP2 levels in NPC patients with different T stages were detected. Correlation between TRPP2 level and clinical features of NPC patients was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curves were depicted for assessing the prognostic value of TRPP2 in NPC. Subsequently, regulatory effects of TRPP2 on viability and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)-positive ratio were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU assay, respectively. Relative levels of Skp2 and c-Myc in NPC cells transfected with si-TRPP2 were examined. At last, the involvement of c-Myc in TRPP2-regulated proliferative ability of NPC was evaluated by performing rescue experiments. RESULTS: TRPP2 was upregulated in NPC tissues. TRPP2 level was higher in NPC patients with T3+T4 than those with T1+T2. Worse survival was observed in NPC patients expressing high level of TRPP2. TRPP2 level was correlated to T stage, N stage, M stage, and locoregional failure of NPC patients. Knockdown of TRPP2 reduced viability and EdU-positive ratio in NPC cells. In addition, relative levels of Skp2 and c-Myc in NPC cells transfected with si-TRPP2 were downregulated. Overexpression of c-Myc could partially reverse the regulatory effects of TRPP2 on NPC proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: TRPP2 stimulates NPC cells to proliferate by upregulating expressions of Skp2/c-Myc, thus deteriorating the development of NPC.","Zhang, T; Yu, G-D; Ye, H-P; Jin, Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,1

359725,Potential neurologic and oncologic implications of the novel coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic placed Irish Laboratory Medicine services under sustained and massive strain. Rapid reconfiguration was required to introduce new assays at high capacity for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, while maintaining existing services. AIM: The aim of this national survey was to capture Laboratory Medicine's response across the Republic of Ireland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey developed using Microsoft Forms® was emailed on 5 October 2020 to 53 local representatives of the PeriAnalytic and Laboratory Medicine Society (PALMSoc), reaching 38 separate pathology departments in the country. RESULTS: A total of 45 responses from 38 laboratories were received (72% response rate) representing a range of departments and disciplines. Most laboratories (63%) introduced new tests, and in a time frame of less than 6 weeks (80%). Point-of-care testing (POCT) played a significant role in the response to COVID-19, with almost half of respondents (47%) reporting that additional equipment was introduced. Maintenance of the Quality Management System (QMS) proved challenging, with 60% of respondents indicating that not all aspects were sustained. When asked about changes to staff rostering, 98% of respondents reported that changes were made. All adjustments were made despite staffing challenges; only 18% of respondents described the staffing levels in their department as 100% prior to the onset of the first wave. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms an agile and resilient response to the COVID-19 pandemic from Ireland's Laboratory Medicine services despite many economic and staffing challenges.","Leonard, Ann; Murray, Brian; Prior, Anna Rose; Srinivasan, Rama; Kane, Anne; Boran, Gerard",Ir. j. med. sci,,1

368994,Conserved Interferon-Î³ Signaling Drives Clinical Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy in Melanoma,2020,"The behaviour of information cascades (such as retweets) has been modelled extensively. While point process-based generative models have long been in use for estimating cascade growths, deep learning has greatly enhanced diverse feature integration. We observe two significant temporal signals in cascade data that have not been emphasized or reported to our knowledge. First, the popularity of the cascade root is known to influence cascade size strongly; but the effect falls off rapidly with time. Second, there is a measurable positive correlation between the novelty of the root content (with respect to a streaming external corpus) and the relative size of the resulting cascade. Responding to these observations, we propose GammaCas, a new cascade growth model as a parametric function of time, which combines deep influence signals from content (e.g., tweet text), network features (e.g., followers of the root user), and exogenous event sources (e.g., online news). Specifically, our model processes these signals through a customized recurrent network, whose states then provide the parameters of the cascade rate function, which is integrated over time to predict the cascade size. The network parameters are trained end-to-end using observed cascades. GammaCas outperforms seven recent and diverse baselines significantly on a large-scale dataset of retweet cascades coupled with time-aligned online news -- it beats the best baseline with an 18.98% increase in terms of Kendall's $\tau$ correlation and $35.63$ reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Extensive ablation and case studies unearth interesting insights regarding retweet cascade dynamics.","Dutta, Subhabrata; Mittal, Shravika; Das, Dipankar; Chakrabarti, Soumen; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07012v1.pdf,1

Dental healthcare personnel are at a higher risk of COVID-19 due to their exposure to saliva, blood, and aerosol/droplet during their daily practice. Their perceptions of COVID-19 drive their behaviors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey to assess COVID-19 related perceptions and possible disparities between them. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Science, version 23 (IBM SPSS). Descriptive analyses were performed using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, mean and (± SD) for numerical variables. Bivariate analyses were assessed using t-test and one-way ANOVA, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: With a response of 75% (150), results showed that there were perceptional disparities: students and technical staff perceived more barriers to preventive measures compared to faculties with a mean difference of (-0.145 SD ± 0.580, p = 0.802, CI -1.29 / 1.00 and -2.433, SD ± 0.94, p = 0.010), respectively. This was also shown in threat perception with a mean difference of (2.525, SE ± 0.917, CI 0.71/4.34, p = 0. 0.007). Students perceived more threat than clerks did with a mean difference of (1.281, SE ± 0.569, CI - 0.16 / 2.41, p = 0.026), while clerks perceived less threat than the technical staff with a mean difference of (-2.790, SE ± 0.860, CI -4.49 /-1.09, p = 0.001).

Contact with surfaces contaminated with droplets generated by infected persons through exhaling, talking, coughing and sneezing is a major driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, with the virus being able to survive on surfaces for extended periods of time. To interrupt these chains of transmission, there is an urgent need for devices that can be deployed to inactivate the virus on both recently and existing contaminated surfaces. Here, we describe the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in both wet and dry format using radiation generated by a commercially available Signify ultraviolet (UV)-C light source at 254 nm. We show that for contaminated surfaces, only seconds of exposure is required for complete inactivation, allowing for easy implementation in decontamination workflows.","Storm, Nadia; McKay, Lindsay G A; Downs, Sierra N; Johnson, Rebecca I; Birru, Dagnachew; de Samber, Marc; Willaert, Walter; Cennini, Giovanni; Griffiths, Anthony",Sci Rep,,1

374330,Can the coronavirus infection penetrates the brain resulting in sudden anosmia followed by severe neurological disorders?,2020,"Coronaviruses have caused multiple epidemics in the past two decades, in addition to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is severely damaging global health and the economy. Coronaviruses employ between 20 and 30 proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle, including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2'-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? Although experimentally derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over 1 ms of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16's conformational ensemble to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models, we investigate whether Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","Vithani, Neha; Ward, Michael D; Zimmerman, Maxwell I; Novak, Borna; Borowsky, Jonathan H; Singh, Sukrit; Bowman, Gregory R",Biophys J,,1

380114,Leukocyte-Reactive Antibodies in Female Blood Donors: The Austrian Experience,2020,"Pathological narcissism is a term often applied to former President Donald Trump, but it has been less examined as a potential predictor of voting for him. Trump projects a grandiose and omnipotent self-image during press conferences and rallies, and his followers at these events often respond with both effusive admiration and an inflated sense of their own self-regard, all of which are aspects of narcissism. However, while Trump's personal narcissism has been well documented, there is little research on the narcissism of his supporters. In this study we conducted an exploratory analysis examining the hierarchical structure of pathological narcissism and which aspects of narcissism within that structure were associated with intended voting for Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in a sample of U.S. residents collected online (N = 495) using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results indicated that an eight-echelon hierarchy best fit the data. Within this hierarchy, antagonistic and indifferent aspects of narcissism within the fifth echelon best predicted intended voting for Trump over and above relevant demographic variables. These results have implications for the study of narcissism and, especially given the results of the 2020 election, the degree to which one can make use of narcissistic aspects of personality in political contests.","Yalch, Matthew M",PLoS One,,1

In this narrative review, we illustrate how telemedicine technologies are increasingly integrated into pediatric infectious disease programs with the aim of facilitating access to specialist care and reducing costs. There is widespread use of telemedicine for the management of acute and chronic infectious diseases, particularly in countries in which the majority of the population lives in rural areas, far from third-level hospital centers located in large urban centers. Obviously, telemedicine is also used in developed countries, and its importance has been further increased recently given the COVID-19 pandemic. It has many advantages for patients, such as saving time, money and working hours, and reducing cancelled appointments and delays, while there are also many advantages for doctors, allowing collaborations with specialists and continuous updating. Among the disadvantages are the limitation in carrying out an objective examination, which is particularly important for children under 2 years of age, and the need for cutting-edge technology and reliable connectivity. Telemedicine increasingly represents the future and the beginning of a new healthcare system that also will redefine medical care for the treatment of infectious diseases, both acute and chronic. However, the majority of the experience has involved adults, and its validation in pediatric care, as well as its application in real-life practices, are urgently needed.","Pappalardo, Marco; Fanelli, Umberto; Chiné, Vincenzo; Neglia, Cosimo; Gramegna, Andrea; Argentiero, Alberto; Esposito, Susanna",,,1

The question of whether reproductive coercion (RC) influences these outcomes has received increased attention. Little is known about whether RC is independently associated with contraceptive use and having a sexually transmitted disease (STD) among African American female adolescents. Materials and Methods: Survey data for self-identified African American young women 14-19 years of age (n = 735) who accessed services at a publicly funded clinic were used to assess the extent of RC, the association between RC and other forms of intimate partner violence (IPV), and whether RC was independently associated with contraceptive use and an STD diagnosis. Results: Approximately 20% of participants had experienced RC; there was a statistically significant bivariate association between RC and other forms of IPV. In multivariate analyses, experiencing two or more forms of RC (vs. not experiencing any RC) was associated with reduced odds of contraceptive use in the past 3 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.76) and with increased odds of having an STD (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI = 2.35-4.37). Experiencing only one type of RC and experiencing other forms of IPV were not associated with the outcomes. Although ease of partner communication (aOR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.80-0.98) was associated with having an STD, few other psychosocial variables were associated with the outcomes. Conclusions: RC is associated with reduced contraceptive use and increased STDs among African American adolescent women. Interventions to prevent and respond to RC that engage adolescent women and men are needed.","Kraft, Joan Marie; Snead, Margaret Christine; Brown, Jennifer L; Sales, Jessica M; Kottke, Melissa J; Hatfield-Timajchy, Kendra; Goedken, Peggy",J. womens health (Larchmt.),,1

However, it is not clear how long asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be an asymptomatic carrier. Case Presentation: We experienced a case of an asymptomatic female patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 with abnormal chest computed tomography findings. She did not develop a fever during hospitalized isolation. She remained reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction-positive for 24 days. Conclusion: An asymptomatic patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction-positive for 24 days, although she was quarantined in an isolation hospital. This finding suggests that an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection with abnormal chest computed tomography findings can be an asymptomatic carrier for more than 3 weeks.","Uechi, Takahiro; Nakamura, Shunsuke; Takeshita, Ryo; Morino, Kyoko; Mizuno, Ren; Nakagawa, Yuki; Irifukuhama, Yuna; Takada, Shiho; Teruya, Hideki; Mita, Naoto; Nakamori, Tomoki; Kinoshita, Hirohisa",Acute Med.

Retrospective analysis on patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with moderate/severe COVID-19 and availability of at least two nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the time to nasopharyngeal swab negativization. A multivariable Cox model was fitted to determine factors associated with nasopharyngeal swab negativization. Of 280 patients included, 59 (21.1%) patients were treated with steroids. Differences observed between steroid users and non-users included the proportion of patients with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 200 mmHg (45.8% vs 34.4% in steroids and non-steroids users, respectively; p = 0.023) or &#8804; 100 mmHg (16.9% vs 12.7%; p = 0.027), and length of hospitalization (20 vs 14 days; p < 0.001). Time to negativization of nasopharyngeal swabs was similar in steroid and non-steroid users (p = 0.985). According to multivariate analysis, SARS-CoV-2 clearance was associated with age &#8804; 70 years, a shorter duration of symptoms at admission, a baseline PaO2/FiO2 > 200 mmHg, and a lymphocyte count at admission > 1.0 × 109/L. SARS-CoV-2 clearance was not associated with corticosteroid use. Our study shows that delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance in moderate/severe COVID-19 is associated with older age and a more severe disease, but not with an early use of corticosteroids.","Spagnuolo, V; Guffanti, M; Galli, L; Poli, A; Querini, P Rovere; Ripa, M; Clementi, M; Scarpellini, P; Lazzarin, A; Tresoldi, M; Dagna, L; Zangrillo, A; Ciceri, F; Castagna, A",Sci Rep,,1

Literature Review,2020,"RATIONALE: Clinical trials are the gold standard for testing interventions. COVID-19 has further raised their public profile and emphasised the need to deliver better, faster, more efficient trials for patient benefit. Considerable overlap exists between data required for trials and data already collected routinely in electronic healthcare records (EHRs). Opportunities exist to use these in innovative ways to decrease duplication of effort and speed trial recruitment, conduct and follow-up. APPROACH: The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), Health Data Research UK and Clinical Practice Research Datalink co-organised a national workshop to accelerate the agenda for 'data-enabled clinical trials'. Showcasing successful examples and imagining future possibilities, the plenary talks, panel discussions, group discussions and case studies covered: design/feasibility; recruitment; conduct/follow-up; collecting benefits/harms; and analysis/interpretation. REFLECTION: Some notable studies have successfully accessed and used EHR to identify potential recruits, support randomised trials, deliver interventions and supplement/replace trial-specific follow-up. Some outcome measures are already reliably collected; others, like safety, need detailed work to meet regulatory reporting requirements. There is a clear need for system interoperability and a 'route map' to identify and access the necessary datasets. Researchers running regulatory-facing trials must carefully consider how data quality and integrity would be assessed. An experience-sharing forum could stimulate wider adoption of EHR-based methods in trial design and execution. DISCUSSION: EHR offer opportunities to better plan clinical trials, assess patients and capture data more efficiently, reducing research waste and increasing focus on each trial's specific challenges. The short-term emphasis should be on facilitating patient recruitment and for postmarketing authorisation trials where research-relevant outcome measures are readily collectable. Sharing of case studies is encouraged. The workshop directly informed NIHR's funding call for ambitious data-enabled trials at scale. There is the opportunity for the UK to build upon existing data science capabilities to identify, recruit and monitor patients in trials at scale.","Sydes, Matthew R; Barbachano, Yolanda; Bowman, Louise; Denwood, Tom; Farmer, Andrew; Garfield-Birkbeck, Steph; Gibson, Martin; Gulliford, Martin C; Harrison, David A; Hewitt, Catherine; Logue, Jennifer; Navaie, Will; Norrie, John; O039,; Kane, Martin; Quint, Jennifer K; Rycroft-Malone, Jo; Sheffield, Jonathan; Smeeth, Liam; Sullivan, Frank; Tizzard, Juliet; Walker, Paula; Wilding, John; Williamson, Paula R; Landray, Martin; Morris, Andrew; Walker, Rhoswyn R; Williams, Hywel C; Valentine, Janet",BMJ Open,,1

396902,Climate change brings the specter of new infectious diseases,2020,"Introduction: The 4-aminoquinolines, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine have been used for over 70 years for malaria and rheumatological conditions, respectively. Their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, excellent safety profile, tolerability, low cost, and ready availability made them prime repurposing therapeutic candidates at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.Areas covered: Here, the authors discuss the history of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, the in vitro data which led to their widespread repurposing and adoption in COVID-19 and their complex pharmacokinetics. The evidence for the use of these drugs is assessed through in vivo animal experiments and the wealth of conflicting data and interpretations published during COVID-19, including the more informative results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The safety aspects of these drugs, in particular cardiotoxicity, are then reviewed.Expert opinion: The evidence from clinical trials in COVID-19 supports the well-established safety record of the 4-aminoquinolines at currently recommended dosage. In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 RCTs show clearly that the 4-aminoquinolines are not beneficial. The only treatments with proven benefit at this stage of infection are immunomodulators (dexamethasone, IL-6 receptor antagonists). No antiviral drugs have proven life-saving in late-stage COVID-19.","Schilling, William Hk; White, Nicholas J",Expert Opin Pharmacother,,1

These products were developed, trialled, manufactured, and authorised for use in several countries within a year of the pandemic's onset. Many gaps remain, however, that must be bridged to establish a truly efficient and effective end-to-end R&D preparedness and response ecosystem. Foremost among them is a global financing system. In addition, important changes are required for multiple aspects of enabling sciences and product development. For each of these elements we identify priorities for improved and faster functionality.

OBJECTIVES: Delineate the different patterns of olfactory disorders recovery in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort study included 96 patients with olfactory complaint confirmed to be COVID-19 positive with recent onset of anosmia. All patients were inquired for smell recovery patterns using self-assessment questionnaires. RESULTS: Ninety six patients completed the study with mean age 34.26â¯±â¯11.91â¯years. Most patients had sudden anosmia 83%. Loss of smell was accompanied by nonspecific inflammatory symptoms as low-grade fever (17%) and generalized body ache (25%). Nasal symptoms were reported by 33% of patients. Some patients reported comorbidities as D.M (16%), hypertension (8%) or associated allergic rhinitis (25%), different patterns of olfactory recovery showed 32 patients experiencing full recovery (33.3%) while, 40 patients showed partial recovery (41.7%) after a mean of 11â¯days while 24 patients (25%) showed no recovery within one month from onset of anosmia. CONCLUSION: The sudden olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom in patients with COVID-19. Hyposmia patients recover more rapidly than anosmic ones while the middle age group carried the best prognosis in olfactory recovery. Females possess better potentiality in regaining smell after recovery and the association of comorbidities worsen the recovery rate of olfactory dysfunction in patients with COVID19.

It may facilitate health care delivery while reducing unnecessary visits to the clinic. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has caused an abrupt change in our daily urological practice, converting many of us to be reliant on telehealth. OBJECTIVE: To provide practical recommendations for effective use of technological tools in telemedicine. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A Medline-based and gray literature search was conducted through April 2020. We selected the most relevant articles related to ""telemedicine"" and ""smart working"" that could provide important information. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Telemedicine refers to the use of electronic information and telecommunications tools to provide remote clinical health care support. Smart working is a model of work that uses new or existing technologies to improve performance. Telemedicine is becoming a useful invaluable tool during and even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. It is time for us to formalize the place of telemedicine in routine urological practice, and it is our responsibility to adapt and learn about all the tools and possible strategies for their optimal implementation during the pandemic to ensure that the quality of care received by patients and the outcomes of patients and their families are of the highest standard. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine facilitates specialized urological clinical support at a distance, solves problems of limitations in mobility, reduces unnecessary visits to clinics, and is useful for reducing the risk of viral transmission in the current COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, both personal and societal considerations may favor continued use of telemedicine, even beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: Telemedicine in urology offers specialized remote clinical support to patients, similar to face-to-face visits. It is very useful for reducing unnecessary visits to the clinic, as well as reducing the risk of contagion in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Rodriguez Socarrás, Moises; Loeb, Stacy; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Ribal, Maria J; Bloemberg, Jarka; Catto, James; N039,; Dow, James; Van Poppel, Hendrik; Gómez Rivas, Juan",Eur. urol,,1

412067,"Reply to ""Can femoral head necrosis induced by steroid therapy in patients infected with coronaviruses be reversed?""",2021,"BACKGROUND: First-year students entering postsecondary education must navigate a new and complex academic and social environment. Research indicates that this transition and developmental period can be challenging and stressful - academically, emotionally and socially - and that mental health and wellbeing can be compromised. Additionally, mental health disorders can also compromise students' ability to successfully navigate this transition. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the incoming 2020 cohort of first-year students face heightened and new challenges. Most will have spent the conclusion of high school learning virtually, in quarantine, in an uncertain and difficult time, and are then experiencing their first year of university while living, learning and socializing off-campus, virtually and remotely. In response to COVID-19 and with an appreciation of the considerable stresses students face generally and particularly in 2020-21, and the potential effects on mental health and wellbeing, McMaster University, a mid-sized research intensive university with approximately 30,000 students, has developed an innovative program to support students, called Archway. This initiative has been developed to help to prevent and to intervene early to address common transitional issues students experience that can influence mental health and wellbeing, with the ultimate goals of increasing student connectedness, supports, and retention. METHODS: The current study will use a mixed-method design to evaluate Archway and gain a better understanding of the transition into first-year postsecondary for students who engage and participate in Archway at various levels. The study will not only help to determine the effect of this program for students during COVID-19, but it will help us to better understand the challenges of this transition more broadly. DISCUSSION: Findings have the potential to inform future efforts to support students and protect their mental health and wellbeing through the use of virtual and remote platforms and mechanisms that meet their increasingly diverse needs and circumstances.","Kwan, Matthew Y W; Brown, Denver; MacKillop, James; Beaudette, Sean; Van Koughnett, Sean; Munn, Catharine",BMC Public Health,,1
412625,Current status of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for immune/inflammatory lung disorders: Gleaning insights for possible use in COVID-19,2020,"There is growing evidence regarding chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) findings for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At present, the role of lung ultrasonography (LUS) has yet to be explored. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between LUS findings and chest CT in patients confirmed to have (positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) or clinically highly suspected of having (dyspnea, fever, myasthenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry cough, ageusia or anosmia) COVID-19. This prospective study was carried out in the emergency department, where patients confirmed of having or clinically highly suspected of having COVID-19 were recruited and underwent chest CT and concurrent LUS exam. An experienced emergency department physician performed the LUS exam blind to the clinical history and results of the CT scan, which were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus for signs compatible with COVID-19 (bilateral ground-glass opacities in peripheral distribution). A compatible LUS exam was considered a bilateral pattern of B-lines, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations. Between March and April 2020, 51 patients were consecutively enrolled. The indication for CT was a negative or indeterminate RT-PCR test (49.0%) followed by suspicion of pulmonary embolism (41.2%). Radiologic signs compatible with COVID-19 were present in 37 patients (72.5%) on CT scan and 40 patients (78.4%) on LUS exam. The presence of LUS findings was correlated with a positive CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 (odds ratio: 13.3, 95% confidence interval: 4.5-39.6, p < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 100.0%, specificity of 78.6%, positive predictive value of 92.5% and negative predictive value of 100.0%. There was no missed diagnosis of COVID-19 with LUS compared with CT in our cohort. The correlation between LUS score and CT total severity score was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.803, 95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.90, p < 0.001). LUS exhibited similar accuracy compared with chest CT in the detection of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.","Tung-Chen, Yale; Martí de Gracia, Milagros; Díez-Tascón, Aurea; Alonso-González, Rodrigo; Agudo-Fernández, Sergio; Parra-Gordo, Maria Luz; Ossaba-Vélez, Silvia; Rodríguez-Fuertes, Pablo; Llamas-Fuentes, Rafael",Ultrasound Med Biol,,1

Applying peptide therapeutics and their related compounds is a promising strategy to achieve this goal. This review is written based on the literature search using several databases, previous studies, scientific reports, our current knowledge about the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), and our personal analyses on the potential of the antiviral peptides for the treatment of COVID-19.Areas covered: In this review, we begin with a brief description of SARS-CoV2 followed by a comprehensive description of antiviral peptides (AVPs) including natural and synthetic AMPs or AVPs and peptidomimetics. Subsequently, the structural features, mechanisms of action, limitations, and therapeutic applications of these peptides are explained.Expert opinion: Regarding the lack and the limitations of drugs against COVID-19, AMPs, AVPs, and other peptide-like compounds such as peptidomimetics have captured the attention of researchers due to their potential antiviral activities. Some of these compounds comprise unique properties and have demonstrated the potential to fight SARS-CoV2, particularly melittin, lactoferrin, enfuvirtide, and rupintrivir that have the potential to enter animal and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19.","Mousavi Maleki, Masoumeh Sadat; Rostamian, Mosayeb; Madanchi, Hamid",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,1

The latest Syrian assault on Idlib in February 2020, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises of this brutal civil war, brought this to the world's attention again. Highlighting the scale of this 'social question' on the Eve of a Covid-19 pandemic, it shows that displaced Syrians of Idlib had been trapped between the advancing Syrian regime and Russian troops. In response, Turkey, already hosting almost 3.5 million Syrians and closing its border in 2015 to prEvent a further influx, let refugees-Syrians and migrants from other countries-head for the EU. Aiming to cajole the EU into heeding its demands, Turkey linked this to its Syria cause. Once again, the latest crisis showed that Turkey had reached the limit of its capacity to absorb more Syrians.

417099,Occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in burns treatment during the COVID-19 epidemic: Specific diagnosis and treatment protocol,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare institutions posed a significant problem. Due to limited evidence, guidance on appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as the wearing of face masks varied. Here, we applied whole virus genome sequencing (WvGS) to analyse transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-acquired (HA) COVID-19. METHODS: An investigation was undertaken for all HA cases of COVID-19 from March to April 2020. Fifty SARS-CoV-2 samples were analysed by WvGS and their phylogenetic relationship established. RESULTS: WvGS identified transmission events previously undetected by epidemiological analysis and provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers (HCW) and patients and among HCW themselves. The majority of HA COVID-19 cases occurred in patients highly dependent on nursing care, suggesting the likely route of transmission was by close contact or droplet, rather than aerosol, transmission. Mortality among HA COVID-19 infections was recorded as 33%. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs to patients. Interventions including comprehensive screening of HCWs for COVID-19 symptoms, PCR testing of asymptomatic HCWs upon identification of HA cases and implementation of universal use of surgical masks for all clinical care is indicated to prevent viral transmission. Our study highlights the importance of close collaboration between guidance bodies and frontline IPC experts for developing control measures in an emergency pandemic situation caused by a virus with undefined transmission modus.","Lucey, Mary; Macori, Guerrino; Mullane, Niamh; Sutton-Fitzpatrick, Una; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Coughlan, Suzie; Purcell, Aisling; Fenelon, Lynda; Fanning, Séamus; Schaffer, Kirsten",Clin Infect Dis,,1

This leaves many questions unanswered or inadequately answered. Many of these questions are not unique, and reliable identification of similar questions would enable more efficient and effective question answering schema. COVID-19 has only exacerbated this problem. Almost every government agency and healthcare organization has tried to meet the informational need of users by building online FAQs, but there is no way for people to ask their question and know if it is answered on one of these pages. While many research efforts have focused on the problem of general question similarity, these approaches do not generalize well to domains that require expert knowledge to determine semantic similarity, such as the medical domain. In this paper, we show how a double fine-tuning approach of pretraining a neural network on medical question-answer pairs followed by fine-tuning on medical question-question pairs is a particularly useful intermediate task for the ultimate goal of determining medical question similarity. While other pretraining tasks yield an accuracy below 78.7% on this task, our model achieves an accuracy of 82.6% with the same number of training examples, an accuracy of 80.0% with a much smaller training set, and an accuracy of 84.5% when the full corpus of medical question-answer data is used. We also describe a currently live system that uses the trained model to match user questions to COVID-related FAQs.","McCreery, Clara H.; Katariya, Namit; Kannan, Anitha; Chablani, Manish; Amatriain, Xavier",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13546v1.pdf,1

Strategies are needed to identify and characterize animal viruses that pose the greatest risk of spillover and spread in humans and inform public health interventions. Using expert opinion and scientific evidence, we identified host, viral, and environmental risk factors contributing to zoonotic virus spillover and spread in humans. We then developed a risk ranking framework and interactive web tool, SpillOver, that estimates a risk score for wildlife-origin viruses, creating a comparative risk assessment of viruses with uncharacterized zoonotic spillover potential alongside those already known to be zoonotic. Using data from testing 509,721 samples from 74,635 animals as part of a virus discovery project and public records of virus detections around the world, we ranked the spillover potential of 887 wildlife viruses. Validating the risk assessment, the top 12 were known zoonotic viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Several newly detected wildlife viruses ranked higher than known zoonotic viruses. Using a scientifically informed process, we capitalized on the recent wealth of virus discovery data to systematically identify and prioritize targets for investigation. The publicly accessible SpillOver platform can be used by policy makers and health scientists to inform research and public health interventions for prevention and rapid control of disease outbreaks. SpillOver is a living, interactive database that can be refined over time to continue to improve the quality and public availability of information on viral threats to human health.","Grange, Zoë L; Goldstein, Tracey; Johnson, Christine K; Anthony, Simon; Gilardi, Kirsten; Daszak, Peter; Olival, Kevin J; O039,; Rourke, Tammie; Murray, Suzan; Olson, Sarah H; Togami, Eri; Vidal, Gema; Mazet, Jonna A K",Proc.

Furthermore, failure to incorporate timely detection and management of symptoms increases the risk of partially avoidable complications. A promising approach to overcome these pitfalls is telenursing, which entails proactive care delivery by a PD Nurse Specialist (PDNS) through telephone contacts. We hypothesized that adding telenursing to usual care could fill a gap in currently available services, including offering patients easy accessibility to a nurse with specific expertise in PD. We explored this hypothesis by prospectively assessing the effects of a telenursing intervention on motor and non-motor symptoms in a patient with PD. During a threemonth intervention period which comprised 13 telephone contacts, the patient reported a remarkable reduction in number of falls, from 99 falls per three months to 3 falls per three months; and a reduction in non-motor symptoms. The main working mechanism was presumably rather indirect and mediated via alleviation of anxiety, achieved by the individually tailored information and problem-solving strategies provided by the PDNS. Our observations should encourage large-scale evaluations to assess the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of telenursing interventions in persons with PD.","Mancini, Francesca; van Halteren, Angelika D; Carta, Tania; Thomas, Sue; Bloem, Bastiaan R; Darweesh, Sirwan K L",Clin Park Relat Disord,,1

Assuming an equally proportional change in the output/input ratio, we can estimate how many additional medical resource health service units would be required if the number of hospitalizations was expected to increase during an epidemic outbreak. This assessment proposes a two-step methodology for hospital beds vacancy and reallocation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework determines the production capacity of hospitals through data envelopment analysis and incorporates the complexity of needs in two categories for the reallocation of beds throughout the medical specialties. As a result, we have a set of inefficient healthcare units presenting less complex bed slacks to be reduced, that is, to be allocated for patients presenting with more severe conditions. The first results in this work, in collaboration with state and municipal administrations in Brazil, report 3772 beds feasible to be evacuated by 64% of the analyzed health units, of which more than 82% are moderate complexity evacuations.

447457,Grand Challenges in Infectious Diseases: Are We Prepared for Worst-Case Scenarios?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Concern regarding bacterial co-infection complicating SARS-CoV-2 has created a challenge for antimicrobial stewardship. Following introduction of national antibiotic recommendations for suspected bacterial respiratory tract infection complicating COVID-19, a point prevalence survey of prescribing was conducted across acute hospitals in Scotland. METHODS: Patients in designated COVID-19 units were included and demographic, clinical and antimicrobial data were collected from 15 hospitals on a single day between 20th and 30th April 2020. Comparisons were made between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients and patients on non-critical care and critical care units. Factors associated with antibiotic prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were examined using Univariable and multivariable regression analyses. FINDINGS: There were 820 patients were included, 64.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 14.9% were managed in critical care, and 22.1% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were considered probable or definite nosocomial infections. On the survey day, antibiotic prevalence was 45.0% and 73.9% were prescribed for suspected respiratory tract infection. Amoxicillin, doxycycline and co-amoxiclav accounted for over half of all antibiotics in non-critical care wards and meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and co-amoxiclav accounted for approximately half prescribed in critical care. Of all SARS-CoV-2 patients, 38.3% were prescribed antibiotics. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, COPD/chronic lung disease and CRP &#8805; 100â¯mg/l were associated with higher odds and probable or confirmed nosocomial COVID-19, diabetes and management on an elderly care ward had lower odds of an antibiotic prescription. Systemic antifungals were prescribed in 9.8% of critical care patients and commenced a median of 18 days after critical care admission. INTERPRETATION: A relatively low prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalised patients and low proportion of broad spectrum antibiotics in non-critical care settings was observed potentially reflecting national antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. Broad spectrum antibiotic and antifungal prescribing in critical care units was observed indicating the importance of infection prevention and control and stewardship initiatives in this setting.

The burden of COVID-19 varies between and within countries due to differences in contextual and individual factors, transmission rates, and clinical and public health interventions. Objectives: To identify high-risk areas, between April and October, on a weekly basis and at the municipality level, and to assess the temporal evolution of COVID-19, considering municipalities classified by incidence levels. Methods: This is an ecological study following a 3-step approach, i.e., (1) calculation of the relative risk (RR) of the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases, weekly, per municipality, using a spatial scan analysis;(2) classification of the municipalities according to the European Centre for Disease Control incidence categorization on November 19;and (3) characterization of RR temporal evolution by incidence groups. Results: Between April and October, the mean RR was 0.53, with a SD of 1.44, varying between 0 and 46.4. Globally, the north and Lisbon and Tagus Valley (LVT) area were the regions with the highest number of municipalities with a RR above 3.2. In April and beginning of May, most of the municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from the north, while between May and August most municipalities with an RR above 3.2 were from LVT area. Comparing the incidence in November and retrospectively analyzing the RR showed the huge variation, with municipalities with an RR of 0 at a certain time classified as extremely high in November. Conclusions: Our results showed considerable variation in RR over time and space, with no consistent ""better""or ""worst""municipality. In addition to the several factors that influence COVID-19 transmission dynamics, there were some outbreaks over time and throughout the country and this may contribute to explaining the observed variation. Over time, on a weekly basis, it is important to identify critical areas allowing tailored and timely interventions in order to control outbreaks in early stages. © 2021 S. Karger AG.

However, genetic markers that could be used to predict lymph node (LN) involvement, which is the most important prognostic factor for colon cancer, have not been identified. In the present study, we compared LN(+) and LN(-) colon cancer patients using differential gene expression and network analysis. Colon cancer gene expression data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas and divided into two groups, LN(+) and LN(-). Gene expression networks were constructed using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. We identified hub genes, such as APBB1, AHSA2, ZNF767, and JAK2, that were highly differentially expressed. Survival analysis using selected hub genes, such as AHSA2, CDK10, and CWC22, showed that their expression levels were significantly associated with the survival rate of colon cancer patients, which indicates their possible use as prognostic markers. In addition, protein-protein interaction network, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathway analysis were performed with selected hub genes from each group to investigate the regulatory relationships between hub genes and LN involvement in colon cancer; these analyses revealed differences between the LN(-) and LN(+) groups. Our network analysis may help narrow down the search for novel candidate genes for the treatment of colon cancer, in addition to improving our understanding of the biological processes underlying LN involvement.

Recommendation of the International Geriatric Radiotherapy Group,2020,"The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has hit health-care systems and societies in an unprecedented manner. In 1981, the first cases of AIDS were reported and wide diagnostic testing helped to characterize high-risk groups and the global burden of the epidemic. With Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19, everything has happened too fast and both cases and fatalities are huge but still uncertain in most places. Diagnostic testing of active and past SARS-CoV-2 infections needs to expand rapidly, ideally using rapid tests. COVID-19 deaths are highly concentrated in the elderly population, with a large proportion of fatalities being ""with"" rather than ""by"" SARS-CoV-2 infection. They are often the result of inadequate health care due to overwhelming demands. To date, there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several antivirals are being tested clinically, including remdesivir, at this time the most promising. For others such as lopinavir/ritonavir, neither significant virological nor clinical benefit has been shown. Given the characteristic pulmonary cytokine storm underlying the pathogenic mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, antiinflammatory agents are being investigated. The benefit of orticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, etc., is limited. Monoclonal antibodies targeting different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin 6 agent, are being tried with encouraging results. Ultimately a protective vaccine will be the best response for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Soriano, Vicente; Barreiro, Pablo; Ramos, José Manuel; Eirós, José M; de Mendoza, Carmen",AIDS Rev,,1

METHODS: Vaccine uptake and vaccination coverage for recommended vaccines and for measles-containing vaccines at milestone ages were assessed in a large cohort of children aged 0 to 18 years in Southern California during January to August 2020 and were compared with those in the same period in 2019. Differences in vaccine uptake and vaccination coverage (recommended vaccines and measles-containing vaccines) in prepandemic (January to March), stay-at-home (April to May), and reopening (June to August) periods in 2020 and 2019 were compared. RESULTS: Total and measles-containing vaccine uptake declined markedly in all children during the pandemic period in 2020 compared with 2019, but recovered in children aged 0 to 23 months. Among children aged 2 to 18 years, measles-containing vaccine uptake recovered, but total vaccine uptake remained lower. Vaccination coverage (recommended and measles-containing vaccines) declined and remained reduced among most milestone age cohorts &#8804;24 months during the pandemic period, whereas recommended vaccination coverage in older children decreased during the reopening period in 2020 compared with 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric vaccine uptake decreased dramatically during the pandemic, resulting in decreased vaccination coverage that persisted or worsened among several age cohorts during the reopening period. Additional strategies, including immunization tracking, reminders, and recall for needed vaccinations, particularly during virtual visits, will be required to increase vaccine uptake and vaccination coverage and reduce the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.","Ackerson, Bradley K; Sy, Lina S; Glenn, Sungching C; Qian, Lei; Park, Claire H; Riewerts, Robert J; Jacobsen, Steven J",Pediatrics,,1
456408,Coronaviruses: from the common cold to severe lung failure,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as an outbreak by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020 and as a pandemic in March 2020. The majority of infected individuals have experienced no or only mild symptoms, ranging from fully asymptomatic cases to mild pneumonic disease. However, a minority of infected individuals develop severe respiratory symptoms. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible HLA alleles and clinical markers that can be used in risk prediction model for the early identification of severe COVID-19 among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A total of 137 patients with mild COVID-19 (mCOVID-19) and 53 patients with severe COVID-19 (sCOVID-19) were recruited from the Center Hospital of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), Tokyo, Japan for the period of February-August 2020. High-resolution sequencing-based typing for eight HLA genes was performed using next-generation sequencing. In the HLA association studies, HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [Pc = 0.013, OR = 2.26 (1.27-3.91)] and HLA-C*12:02:02:01-HLA-B*52:01:01:02 [Pc = 0.020, OR = 2.25 (1.24-3.92)] were found to be significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19. After multivariate analysis controlling for other confounding factors and comorbidities, HLA-A*11:01:01:01 [P = 3.34E-03, OR = 3.41 (1.50-7.73)], age at diagnosis [P = 1.29E-02, OR = 1.04 (1.01-1.07)] and sex at birth [P = 8.88E-03, OR = 2.92 (1.31-6.54)] remained significant. The area under the curve of the risk prediction model utilizing HLA-A*11:01:01:01, age at diagnosis, and sex at birth was 0.772, with sensitivity of 0.715 and specificity of 0.717. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that describes associations of HLA alleles with COVID-19 at the 4-field (highest) resolution level. Early identification of potential sCOVID-19 could help clinicians prioritize medical utility and significantly decrease mortality from COVID-19.","Khor, Seik-Soon; Omae, Yosuke; Nishida, Nao; Sugiyama, Masaya; Kinoshita, Noriko; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Suzuki, Michiyo; Suzuki, Satoshi; Izumi, Shinyu; Hojo, Masayuki; Ohmagari, Norio; Mizokami, Masashi; Tokunaga, Katsushi",Front Immunol,,1

In this evaluation, we tested for the first time a new, extraction-free, protocol with the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Assay RT-qPCR kit on a Nimbus platform. Ninety-one samples, of which 71 previously tested positive with RT-qPCR with extraction were immediately analyzed without extraction, using only a dilution and thermal shock protocol. The positive and negative percentage agreements were respectively 97.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.99) and 95.0% (95% CI: 0.76-0.99). The two false negatives observed were very weakly positive with the comparison method. Moderate variations in Ct of the targeted genes were observed (median ± 95% CI): E gene, +2.49 ± 0.44; N gene, +0.98 ± 0.54; RdRP/S genes, +2.64 ± 0.48. On the other hand, the number of tests performed within 24 h raised from 86.4% to 97.8%, the turn-around time decreased from 19:18 to 09:03 (p < .0001), and the number of tests that can be performed per day doubled since this technique was introduced routinely in our laboratory.","Blairon, Laurent; Piteüs, Sébastien; Beukinga, Ingrid; Tré-Hardy, Marie",J Med Virol,,1

461647,Effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment on non-SARS-CoV2 viral infections: A systematic review of clinical studies,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is one of the beta-coronaviruses with the spike protein. It invades host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This newly discovered virus can result in excessive inflammation and immune pathological damage, as shown by a decreased number of peripheral lymphocytes, increased levels of cytokines, and damages of lung, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs. Effective therapeutic modalities such as new antiviral drugs and vaccines against this emerging virus need to be thoroughly studied and developed. However, so far the only recognized but mild progress in this area is the screening of old drugs for new uses. Therefore, rapid and accurate laboratory SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches are the important basis of identification and blockage of COVID-19 transmission. For COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications (mild, common, severe, and critically severe), dynamic monitoring of functional indicators of susceptible and vital organs is an important strategy for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. In this review, we summarized SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic schemes, pathophysiological indices of tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, and laboratory diagnostic strategies for distinct disease stages. Further, we discussed the importance of hierarchical management and dynamic observation in SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics. We then summed up the advance in SARS-CoV-2 testing technology and described the prospect of intelligent medicine in the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks.","Yi, Kezhen; Rong, Yuan; Wang, Cheng; Huang, Lanxiang; Wang, Fubing",Mol. cell. biochem,,1

In recent years, the overall detection rates have been low and have varied by region. HCoVs have not been considered as the major pathogens in pediatric acute gastroenteritis. HCoVs detected in children with acute gastroenteritis have included 229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have also been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms in children. Although digestive tract has been recognized as an infection route, it has not been possible to fully investigate the association between HCoVs infection and the gastrointestinal symptoms because of the limited number of pediatric cases. Furthermore, pathologic features have not been clear. Till now, our knowledge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is limited. However, diarrhea and vomiting have been seen in pediatric cases, particularly in newborns and infants. It has been necessary to pay more attention on gastrointestinal transmission to identify the infected children early and avoid the children without apparent or mild symptoms becoming the sources of infection.","Xiong, Li-Jing; Zhou, Meng-Yao; He, Xiao-Qing; Wu, Ying; Xie, Xiao-Li",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,1

Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. TFF was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 µm and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute three-day, multi-dose tolerability and exposure study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, and also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model.

METHODS: This single-center study was conducted between March 11, 2020-March 11, 2021. All children who were tested by polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viral pathogens were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 995 children with suspected COVID-19 admitted to the study center. Of these, 513 patients who were tested by polymerase chain reaction for both SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory viral pathogens were included in the final analysis. Two hundred ninety-five patients were (57.5%) male. The median age was 3 years of age (27 days-17 years). A total of 321 viral pathogens identified in 310 (n: 310/513, 60.4%) patients, and 11 of them (n: 11/310, 3.5%) had co-detection with more than 1 virus.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Between 1 December 2019 and 8 January 2021, 3350 articles were identified. Two reviewers conducted study screening, data abstraction and quality assessment independently and in duplicate. Observational studies describing laboratory-confirmed paediatric (0-19 years old) COVID-19 were considered for inclusion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The pooled proportions of clinical findings, treatment and outcomes were compared according to World Bank country income level and reported disease severity. RESULTS: 129 studies were included from 31 countries comprising 10 251 children of which 57.4% were hospitalised. Mean age was 7.0 years (SD 3.6), and 27.1% had a comorbidity. Fever (63.3%) and cough (33.7%) were common. Of 3670 cases, 44.1% had radiographic abnormalities. The majority of cases recovered (88.9%); however, 96 hospitalised children died. Compared with high-income countries, in low-income and middle-income countries, a lower proportion of cases were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) (9.9% vs 26.0%) yet pooled proportion of deaths among hospitalised children was higher (relative risk 2.14, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.20). Children with severe disease received antimicrobials, inotropes and anti-inflammatory agents more frequently than those with non-severe disease. Subgroup analyses showed that a higher proportion of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were admitted to ICU (47.1% vs 22.9%) and a higher proportion of hospitalised children with MIS-C died (4.8% vs 3.6%) compared with the overall sample. CONCLUSION: Paediatric COVID-19 has a favourable prognosis. Further severe disease characterisation in children is needed globally.","Irfan, Omar; Muttalib, Fiona; Tang, Kun; Jiang, Li; Lassi, Zohra S; Bhutta, Zulfiqar",Arch. dis. child,,1

478685,A cytokine super cyclone in COVID-19 patients with risk factors: the therapeutic potential of BCG immunization,2020,"Although primarily affecting the respiratory system, COVID-19 causes multiple organ damage. One of its grave consequences is a prothrombotic state that manifests as thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. Therefore, understanding the effect of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in the context of COVID-19 treatment is important. The aim of this rapid review was to highlight the role of thrombosis in COVID-19 and to provide new insights on the use of antithrombotic therapy in its management. A rapid systematic review was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews. Papers published in English on antithrombotic agent use and COVID-19 complications were eligible. Results showed that the use of anticoagulants increased survival and reduced thromboembolic events in patients. However, despite the use of anticoagulants, patients still suffered thrombotic events likely due to heparin resistance. Data on antiplatelet use in combination with anticoagulants in the setting of COVID-19 are quite scarce. Current side effects of anticoagulation therapy emphasise the need to update treatment guidelines. In this rapid review, we address a possible modulatory role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant combination against COVID-19 pathogenesis. This combination may be an effective form of adjuvant therapy against COVID-19 infection. However, further studies are needed to elucidate potential risks and benefits associated with this combination.","Matli, Kamal; Farah, Raymond; Maalouf, Mario; Chamoun, Nibal; Costanian, Christy; Ghanem, Georges",,,1

481759,Detection of cryptic CCND1 rearrangements in mantle cell lymphoma by next generation sequencing,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the body of evidence addressing the coagulation derangements caused by Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been constantly growing, we investigated whether pre-hospitalization oral anticoagulation (OAC) or in-hospital heparin treatment could have a protective role among COVID-19 patients. METHOD: In this cohort study, consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to four different Italian Institutions were enrolled. Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as in-hospital treatment and outcomes were evaluated. The primary outcome was mortality. RESULTS: A total of 844 COVID-19 patients were enrolled as study cohort, n = 65 (7.7%) taking OACs prior to hospitalization. Regarding clinical outcomes, OAC patients developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) more frequently than non-OAC patients as well as presenting a higher mortality rate (44.6% vs 19.8%, p < 0.001). At overall multivariate logistical regression, use of heparin (n = 394, 46.6%) was associated with a better chance of survival to hospital discharge (OR 0.60 [0.38-0.94], p < 0.001), in particular in patients with AHRF, with no association found with the use of OACs. In a sub-analysis, the highest mortality rate was found for AHRF patients when heparin was not administered. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, OACs appeared to be ineffective in reducing mortality rate, while heparin resulted to be a useful treatment when lung disease was sufficiently severe, potentially suggesting a crucial role of microthrombosis in severe COVID-19. Due to the relatively small number of COVID-19 patients treated with OACs included in our analysis and their higher number of comorbidities, larger studies are needed in order to confirm our findings.","Schiavone, Marco; Gasperetti, Alessio; Mancone, Massimo; Curnis, Antonio; Mascioli, Giosuè; Mitacchione, Gianfranco; Busana, Mattia; Sabato, Federica; Gobbi, Cecilia; Antinori, Spinello; Galli, Massimo; Forleo, Giovanni Battista",Int. j. cardiol,,1

485130,PIM3 Promotes the Proliferation and Migration of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells,2020,"The transboundary dynamics of COVID-19 present an unprecedented test of organisational resilience. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS), a talisman of collective fortitude against disease and illness, has struggled to cope with inadequate provision of virus tests, ventilators, and personal protective equipment needed to fight the pandemic. In this paper, we reflect on the historic dynamics and strategic priorities that have undermined the NHS’s attempts to navigate these troubled times. We invoke the organisational resilience literature to address ‘the good, the bad and the ugly’ of preparedness in readiness and response to the current pandemic. In particular, we draw on Meyer’s (1982) seminal work on ‘adaptation to jolts’, excavating current preparedness failings. We argue an overreliance on perceived efficiency benefits of ‘lean production’ and ‘just in time’ continuity planning superseded strategic redundancy and slack in the system. This strategic focus was not simply the result of a failure in foresight, but rather a failure to act adaptively on knowledge of the known threats and weaknesses spotlighted by earlier projections of an inevitable pandemic threat. In conclusion, we consider how the UK Government and NHS must now undergo a phase of ‘readjustment’ in Meyer’s terms, in light of these failings. We suggest that independent responsibility for national future preparedness should be handed to the NHS free from political interference. This would operate under the umbrella of a national emergency preparedness, resilience and response public body, enshrined in law, and similar in governance to the current Bank of England. This will help ensure that foresight is accompanied by durability and fortitude in safeguarding the UK against future pandemic threats.","Bryce, C.; Ring, P.; Ashby, S.; Wardman, J. K.",J.

Unfortunately, it is challenging to control thin.film uniformity over a large area while maintaining crystallization quality. Herein, by using a high-pressure nitrogen-extraction (HPNE) strategy to assist crystallization, a wide processing window in the well-controlled printing process for preparing high-quality perovskites is achieved. The yellow-phase perovskite generated by the HPNE acts as a crucial intermediate phase to produce large-area high-quality perovskite film. Furthermore, an ionic liquid is developed to passivate the perovskite surface to reduce surface defect density and to suppress carrier recombination, resulting in significantly increased efficiency to 22.7%, the highest for large-area fabrication. The strategies are successfully extended to large-area device fabrication, making it possible to produce a 40 × 40 mm2 module with stabilized PCE as high as 19.4%, the highest-efficiency for a large-area module to date.","Du, Minyong; Zhu, Xuejie; Wang, Likun; Wang, Hui; Feng, Jiangshang; Jiang, Xiao; Cao, Yuexian; Sun, Youming; Duan, Lianjie; Jiao, Yuxiao; Wang, Kai; Ren, Xiaodong; Yan, Zhe; Pang, Shuping; Liu, Shengzhong Frank",Adv Mater,,1

492762,"Cryoglobulins: Identification, classification, and novel biomarkers of mysterious proteins",2020,"BACKGROUND: Electronic messaging and telemedicine visits increased during the COVID pandemic. African-Americans and older patients have less frequently used electronic messaging with their physicians. This study compares the utilization of virtual health care before and during the COVID pandemic for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: A chart review of all IBD patients seen at an academic medical center from 2014-2020 was conducted to evaluate the use of telehealth options (e-messaging, e-visits) during a pre-COVID and COVID timeframe. Analysis of telehealth use from March - August 2018 and March - August 2020 was performed. Patient age, gender, race, IBD type, electronic messaging and telehealth visits were obtained. A confidential database was created. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher Exact test with significance set at p < 0.05. The study was IRB approved. RESULTS: 392 patients were in the pre-COVID cohort. There were 204 White, 99 African-American, 11 Asian, and 78 racially un-identified patients. 160 (40.8%) initiated E-communication with their physicians. There was a significant difference in the use of e-messaging based upon age (51.1% < 50 vs 39.7% &#8805; 50; pâ¯=â¯0.0396) and race (62.3% White vs 28.2% African-American; p < 0.00001).There were no significant differences in the use of e-messaging based upon patient gender (pâ¯=â¯0.6840) or IBD type (pâ¯=â¯0.6374). There were 295 patients in the COVID cohort. There were 155 White, 83 African American patients, 24 Hispanic patients, 10 Asian patients, and 22 racially un-identified patients. 109 (36.9%) utilized a telehealth option (53 via e-messaging; 56 via telemedicine visit). There was no significant difference in the use of a telehealth option based upon age (36.8% < 50 vs 37.25% &#8805; 50 years; pâ¯=â¯1.00), race (42.6% White vs 35.9% African-American; pâ¯=â¯0.2693) or IBD type (pâ¯=â¯0.331). Males used telehealth more than females (46.1% vs 29.7%, respectively; pâ¯=â¯0.0051). DISCUSSION: The COVID pandemic emergency increased e-visits and e-messaging for care delivery. Expanded telemedicine options for IBD patients eliminated previously identified racial and age disparities in virtual medical care. African Americans utilized electronic communication as frequently as Whites during the pandemic. Post-pandemic policy consideration for continued telemedicine options may expand patient-physician engagement and eliminate disparities in health care.","Hayrapetian, Laurie; Zepp, Molly; Rao, Sanjana; Hennessey, Megan; Houle, Matthew; Atienza, Matthew; Belfaqeeh, Omar Ali; Dharia, Ishaan; Khan, Ali; Borum, Marie L",J. natl. med. assoc,,1

The need to develop easy to use, rapid, robust and with minimal hands-on time approaches are warranted. In this setting, the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test may be a valuable option. The aim of our study is to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of this assay on previously tested SARS-CoV-2 people by conventional RT-PCR based approach in different settings, including initial diagnosis and clinical follow-up. METHODS: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test, we retrieved 55 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analysed by a fully validated assay, from symptomatic patients or from people who have been in close contact with COVID-19 positive cases. Discordant or high discrepant cases were further analysed by a third technique. In addition, a second subset of 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples with uncertain results (cycle threshold between 37 and 40), by using the fully validated assay, from patients with viral infection beyond day 21, were retrieved. RESULTS: Overall, Idylla showed a sensitivity of 93.9% and a specificity of 100.0%. In addition, in the additional 14 nasopharyngeal swab samples, only five (35.7%) featured a positive result by the Idylla SARS-CoV-2 Test.

METHODS: The medical records of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent elective surgery in our department during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1 to May 31, 2020) were collected and analyzed. We compared the clinical data with colorectal cancer during the same 4-month period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer underwent elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was 66% of the number of patients that underwent the procedure during the same period in 2018 and 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients without any digestive system symptoms decreased to 3% and severe clinical symptoms decreased by 20.9%. The proportion of right colon cancer decreased by 17.9%, while the proportion of rectal cancer increased by 52.2%, as compared with 2018 and 2019. The fraction of protective stoma was significantly higher than in 2018 (23.9% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.011). Compared with 2019, the average post-operative stay was significantly shorter than in 2018 (9.6 ± 3.7 vs. 12.1 ± 9.1, p = 0.015). Compared with 2019, the number of patients with perineural invasion (a feature of adverse prognosis) significantly increased (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer was reduced. However, the tumor stage of patients did not change substantially.

Thus the objective of this study is to analyze public perceptions through sentiment analysis regarding black fungus during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To attain the objective, first, a Support Vector Machine model, with an average AUC of 82.75%, was developed to classify user sentiments in terms of anger, fear, joy, and sad. Next, this Support Vector Machine is used to supervise the class labels of the public tweets (n = 6477) related to COVID-19 and black fungus. As outcome, this study found that public perceptions belong to sad (n = 2370, 36.59 %), followed by joy (n = 2095, 32.34%), fear (n = 1914, 29.55 %) and anger (n = 98, 1.51%) towards black fungus during COVID-19 pandemic. This study also investigated public perceptions of some critical concerns (e.g., education, lockdown, hospital, oxygen, quarantine, and vaccine) and it was found that public perceptions of these issues varied.

The challenge of how to communicate these then becomes apparent. Based on empirical work (total n = 5520, UK) supported by in-person interviews with the public and physicians, we make recommendations on the presentation of such information. These include: using predominantly percentages when communicating the absolute risk, but also providing, for balance, a format which conveys a contrasting (higher) perception of risk (expected frequency out of 10 000);using a visual linear scale cut at an appropriate point to illustrate the maximum risk, explained through an illustrative 'persona' who might face that highest level of risk;and providing context to the absolute risk through presenting a range of other 'personas' illustrating people who would face risks of a wide range of different levels. These 'personas' should have their major risk factors (age, existing health conditions) described. By contrast, giving people absolute likelihoods of other risks they face in an attempt to add context was considered less helpful. We note that observed effect sizes generally were small. However, even small effects are meaningful and relevant when scaled up to population levels.","Freeman, A. L. J.; Kerr, J.; Recchia, G.; Schneider, C. R.; Lawrence, A. C.

505141,Neuro-ophthalmological Manifestations of Novel Coronavirus,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. METHODS: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework-Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. RESULTS: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.","Lebrasseur, Audrey; Fortin-Bédard, Noémie; Lettre, Josiane; Raymond, Emilie; Bussières, Eve-Line; Lapierre, Nolwenn; Faieta, Julie; Vincent, Claude; Duchesne, Louise; Ouellet, Marie-Christine; Gagnon, Eric; Tourigny, André; Lamontagne, Marie-Ève; Routhier, François",JMIR Aging,,1

509669,Mesenchymal Stem Cell Treatment for Covid-19: a 2021 Update,2021,"Background and Objectives: Sentinel surveillance in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico represented a significant cost reduction and was useful in estimating the population infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, it also implied that many patients were not screened and therefore had no accurate diagnosis. In this study, we carried out a population-based SARS-CoV-2 screening in Mexico to evaluate the COVID-19-related symptoms and their weighting in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss this data in the context of the operational definition of suspected cases of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus. Materials and Methods: One thousand two hundred seventy-nine subjects were included. They were screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. The weighting of COVID-19 symptoms in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated statistically. Results: Three hundred and twenty-five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 954 were negative. Fever, asthenia, dysgeusia, and oxygen saturation predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratios ranged from 1.74 to 4.98; p < 0.05). The percentage of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients was 36% and only 38.15% met the Mexican operational definition. Cq-values for the gene N of SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in asymptomatic subjects than in the groups of COVID-19 patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Dysgeusia, fever, and asthenia increased the odds of a positive result for COVID-19 1.74-4.98-fold among the study population. Patients with neurological, respiratory, and/or musculoskeletal manifestations had higher viral loads at COVID-19 diagnosis than those observed in asymptomatic patients. A high percentage of the participants in the study (61.85%) did not meet the operational definition for a suspected case of COVID-19 established by the Mexican Health Authority's consensus, representing a high percentage of the population that could have remained without a COVID-19 diagnosis, so becoming a potential source of virus spread.","Martinez-Fierro, Margarita L; Diaz-Lozano, Martha; Alvarez-Zuñiga, Claudia; Ramirez-Hernandez, Leticia A; Araujo-Espino, Roxana; Trejo-Ortiz, Perla M; Mollinedo-Montaño, Fabiana E; Ortiz-Castro, Yolanda; Vazquez-Reyes, Sodel; Velasco-Elizondo, Perla; Garcia-Esquivel, Lidia; Araujo-Conejo, Arturo; Garza-Veloz, Idalia",Medicina (Kaunas),,1

This study aimed to investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes of CLD confirmed in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: A total of 104 cases (each group containing 52 patients) were analyzed in this study. The CLD group showed an average of 14 (10.0~21.2) length of stay (LOS) days, compared to the group without CLD that only showed an average of 12.5 (10~16) LOS days (Relative Risk [RR] = 1.34, 95% CI (1.22~1.48), P<0.001; Adjusted Relative Risk was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.12~1.39)). The CLD group contained a higher mortality rate and slight liver injury. Furthermore, COX regression model analyses suggested that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was an independent predictor of mortality risk (P < 0.001) in the CLD group. Additionally, a high NLR significantly correlated with a shorter overall survival (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients also diagnosed with CLD suffered longer LOS, slight liver injuries and a higher mortality when compared to COVID-19 patients without CLD. The NLR was an independent risk factor for in-hospital deaths. Increased expression of NLR was an indicator of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with CLD. Thus, COVID-19 patients diagnosed with CLD and who show a higher NLR need additional care. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed at the Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital from February 2, 2020 to April 2, 2020. COVID-19 patients diagnosed with CLD or not diagnosed with CLD were enrolled in this study. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients were compared.","Li, Chaowei; Chen, Qingshi; Wang, Jianwen; Lin, Huasong; Lin, Yalan; Lin, Jinhuang; Peng, Fangzhan; Chen, Jiangmu; Yang, Zhirong",Aging (Albany NY),,1

Although many patients can be managed at home, a reasonable proportion will experience progression of disease requiring hospitalization and potentially mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Herein, we report the presentation of the first case of COVID-19 admitted to hospital in Alberta. While The patient's course was mild, this case highlights a number of key points—namely the importance of widespread testing in the community to help inform emergency services (ambulance) workers and receiving front-line health care staff.

The new generation of smart rhythm monitoring devices allows for continuous monitoring and simple real time access to the majority of the data. Therefore, they are well suited to be part of the growing number of so-called remote medicine concepts. Although the technology is not only restricted to smartwatches, single lead ECGs that are portable and phone applications that detect heart rate can serve as event recorders during an episode of symptoms. Furthermore, implanted rhythm monitoring may also communicate with mobile applications to allow more rapid and accurate arrhythmia diagnosis and therapy. The authors aimed to demonstrate and discuss new technical developments focusing on the latest generation of implantables and wearables and their benefit in terms of smart and simple cardiac rhythm monitoring.","Sohns, Christian; Khalaph, Moneeb; Bergau, Leonard; Sommer, Philipp",Herzschrittmacherther Elektrophysiol,,1

At the phylum level, an increase of Proteobacteria was detected in w-COVID19 patients as compared to CTRL. A decrease of Fusobacteria and Spirochetes has been found, with the latter decreased in i-COVID19 patients as compared to CTRL. Significant changes in gut microbial communities in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with different disease severity compared to CTRL have been identified.

In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported from China. This coronavirus infection subsequently identified as Covid-19 aroused worldwide concern. As a result, the scientific community has focused attention on Covid-19, as revealed by recent research reported in literature based on a holistic approach. In this regard, this study conducts a bibliometric analysis of coronavirus research in the literature with an emphasis on Covid-19 disease, using as a reference the publications in the Web of Science Core Collection from 1970 to 2020. This research analyzes 12,571 publications from 1970 to (April 18) 2020 by applying advanced bibliometric techniques in SciMAT bibliometric analysis software. The current research therefore provides a complete conceptual analysis of the main coronavirus types and strains in the literature by quantifying the main bibliometric performance indicators, identifying the main authors, organizations, countries, sources, and research areas, and evaluating the development of this field. Furthermore, a science map is constructed to understand the corresponding intellectual structure and main research lines (themes). SciMAT thereby offers a complete approach to the field and evaluates the main performance indicators related to coronavirus, with a focus on Covid-19. Finally, this research serves as a framework to strengthen existing research lines and develop new ones, establishing synergistic relationships that were not visible without the maps generated herein.","Herrera-Viedma, Enrique; López-Robles, José-Ricardo; Guallar, Javier; Cobo, Manuel-Jesús",Prof. Inf.,,1

Previous research has shown that this type of material hardship can lead to negative mental and physical health outcomes, especially for children and the elderly. This study analyzes a state-representative sample of low-income households to evaluate if households of color are more likely than white households to be energy insecure, and, if the reasons are either poor housing conditions or higher energy burdens. We find that energy insecurity is widespread. Over a year period, 30 percent of respondents were unable to pay at least one energy bill, 33 percent received at least one disconnection notice, and 13 percent were disconnected from their electric utility service. Regression analysis further suggests that Black and Hispanic households are more likely than white households to be energy insecure. Additionally, deficient housing conditions and higher energy burdens are both independent predictors of household energy insecurity. Through a mediating variables analysis, however, we find that housing conditions and energy burdens only explain a small proportion of the association between race and energy insecurity. These results indicate that there remains considerable uncertainty about the reasons that households of color experience energy insecurity at higher rates than white households and that future research is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying these disparities.","Graff, Michelle Carley Sanya Konisky David M.; Memmott, Trevor",Energy Research &amp; Social Science,,1

Microbiological testing for respiratory viruses is important for patient management, infection control and epidemiological studies. Nasopharyngeal specimens are frequently tested, but their sensitivity is suboptimal. This study evaluated the incremental benefit of testing respiratory viruses in expectorated saliva using molecular assays. A total of 258 hospitalized adult patients with suspected respiratory infections were included. Their expectorated saliva was collected without the use of any special devices. In the first cohort of 159 patients whose nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) tested positive for respiratory viruses during routine testing, the viral load was measured using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Seventeen percent of the patients (27/159) had higher viral loads in the saliva than in the NPA. The second cohort consisted of 99 patients whose NPAs tested negative for respiratory viruses using a direct immunofluorescence assay. Their NPA and saliva specimens were additionally tested using multiplex PCR. In these patients, the concordance rate by multiplex PCR between NPA and saliva was 83.8%. Multiplex PCR detected viruses in saliva samples from 16 patients, of which nine (56.3%) had at least one virus that was not detected in the NPA. Decisions on antiviral or isolation precautions would be affected by salivary testing in six patients. Although NPAs have high viral loads and remain the specimen of choice for most patients with respiratory virus infections, supplementary molecular testing of saliva can improve the clinical management of these patients.","To, Kelvin KW; Lu, Lu; Yip, Cyril CY; Poon, Rosana WS; Fung, Ami MY; Cheng, Andrew; Lui, Daniel HK; Ho, Deborah TY; Hung, Ivan FN; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588283/,1

We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.

594956,Endemic and Emerging Coronavirus Pulmonary Infections,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection (BSI) management remains challenging for clinicians. Numerous in vitro studies report synergy when vancomycin (VAN) and daptomycin (DAP) are combined with beta-lactams (BLs), which has led to clinical implementation of these combinations. While shorter durations of bacteremia have often been reported, there has been no significant impact on mortality. METHODS: The Detroit Medical Center (DMC) developed and implemented a clinical pathway algorithm for MRSA BSI treatment in 2016 that included the early use of BL combination therapy with standard of care (VAN or DAP) and a mandatory Infectious Diseases consultation. This was a retrospective, quasi-experimental study at the DMC between 2013 and 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the independent association between pathway implementation and 30-day mortality while adjusting for confounding variables. RESULTS: Overall, 813 adult patients treated for MRSA BSI were evaluated. Compared with prepathway (PRE) patients (n = 379), those treated postpathway (POST; n = 434) had a significant reduction in 30-day and 90-day mortality: 9.7% in POST vs 15.6% in PRE (P = .011) and 12.2% in POST vs 19.0% in PRE (P = .007), respectively. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was higher in the PRE compared with the POST group: 9.6% vs 7.2% (P = .282), respectively. After adjusting for confounding variables including Infectious Diseases consult, POST was independently associated with a reduction in 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.608; 95% CI, 0.375–0.986). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an MRSA BSI treatment pathway with early use of BL reduced mortality with no increased rate of AKI. Further prospective evaluation of this pathway approach is warranted.","Alosaimy, Sara; Lagnf, Abdalhamid M; Morrisette, Taylor; Jorgensen, Sarah C J; Trinh, Trang D; Zasowski, Evan J; Scipione, Marco R; Zhao, Jing J; Mynatt, Ryan; Herbin, Shelbye; Dhar, Sorabh; Chopra, Teena; Janisse, James; Rebold, Nicholas; Pogue, Jason M; Rybak, Michael J",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258313/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab261,1

We identify the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] for this model, and show that the [Formula: see text] determines the global dynamics of the model. If [Formula: see text] , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, which means that tuberculosis will disappear, and if [Formula: see text] , there exists a unique endemic equilibrium that attracts all solutions that can cause the spread of tuberculosis. Based on the tuberculosis data in China from 2007 to 2018, we use Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm to find the optimal parameter values and initial values of the model. Furthermore, we perform uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that have significant impact on the basic reproduction number. Finally, we give an effective measure to reach the goal of WHO of reducing the incidence of tuberculosis by 80% by 2030 compared to 2015.","Guo, Zhong-Kai; Xiang, Hong; Huo, Hai-Feng",J Math Biol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-021-01595-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811276/,1

The risk of deliberate release of a biological agent is lower but remains possible and may only be recognised after casualties seek medical attention. In this context the emergency preparedness, resilience and response (EPRR) process protects the public from high consequence infectious diseases, other infectious disease outbreaks and biological agent release. The core elements of the EPRR response are recognition of an outbreak, isolation of patients, appropriate personal protective equipment for medical staff and actions to minimise further disease spread. The paper discusses how high-threat agents may be recognised by clinicians, the initial actions to be taken on presentation and how the public health system is notified and responds. It draws on the national pandemic influenza plans to describe the wider response to a major disease outbreak and discusses training requirements and the potential role of the military.","Welby-Everard, P; Quantick, O; Green, A",BMJ Mil Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999617/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jramc-2019-001323,1
597169,Point-of-Care Microdevices for Blood Plasma Analysis in Viral Infectious Diseases,2014-05-31,"East Asia is as a principal hotspot for emerging zoonotic infections. Understanding the likely pathways for their emergence and spread requires knowledge on human-human and human-animal contacts, but such studies are rare. We used self-completed and interviewer-completed contact diaries to quantify patterns of these contacts for 965 individuals in 2017/2018 in a high-income densely-populated area of China, Shanghai City. Interviewer-completed diaries recorded more social contacts (19.3 vs. 18.0) and longer social contact duration (35.0 vs. 29.1 hours) than self-reporting. Strong age-assortativity was observed in all age groups especially among young participants (aged 7–20) and middle aged participants (25–55 years). 17.7% of participants reported touching animals (15.3% (pets), 0.0% (poultry) and 0.1% (livestock)). Human-human contact was very frequent but contact with animals (especially poultry) was rare although associated with frequent human-human contact. Hence, this densely populated area is more likely to act as an accelerator for human-human spread but less likely to be at the source of a zoonosis outbreak. We also propose that telephone interview at the end of reporting day is a potential improvement of the design of future contact surveys.","Zhang, Juanjuan; Klepac, Petra; Read, Jonathan M.; Rosello, Alicia; Wang, Xiling; Lai, Shengjie; Li, Meng; Song, Yujian; Wei, Qingzhen; Jiang, Hao; Yang, Juan; Lynn, Henry; Flasche, Stefan; Jit, Mark; Yu, Hongjie",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641189/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51609-8,1

The S1 genes of the isolates were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains can be grouped into eight genotypes. Although IBVs of Taiwan-I type, massachusetts type, and proventriculitis type were isolated, but most isolates were LX4 genotype. Homology analysis of the sequences of S1 genes of the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains revealed that the identity of the nucleotides and amino acid sequences of the S1 genes between the 15 LX4-type isolates and other IBV strains were 71.9–99.3% and 72.1–99.1%, respectively, while those of the analyzed IBV of LX4 type were 96.0–99.9% and 94.3–99.8%, respectively. The results from this study and other published results in the GenBank database showed that isolates circulating in Sichuan province in recent years were mainly LX4 genotype, which is the predominant genotype circulated in China in recent years.","Zou, Nian-Li; Zhao, Fang-Fang; Wang, Yuan-Ping; Liu, Ping; Cao, San-Jie; Wen, Xin-Tian; Huang, Yong",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20556502/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-010-0500-9,1

Method: Negative sexual cognitions (NSC), positive sexual emotions (PSE) and negative sexual emotions (NSE) are assessed using a tool inspired by the Sexual Mode Questionnaire. Data are crossed with sociodemographic indicators, information on lockdown modalities, indices on sex life, information on psychological functioning and sexual satisfaction. Main Results: One third of the participants saw a decrease in the frequency of their sexual activities or in their sexual satisfaction. Changes in NSCs were found in 74.4% of subjects (increase: 38.4%; decrease: 36%). Emotional changes are found in between 50.7% (NSC: increase: 20.2%; decrease: 30.5 %) and 60.9% (PSE: increase: 24.6 %; decrease: 36.3%) of participants. The effect of lockdown on NSC, NSE, and PSE depends on gender at birth, intensity of depressive symptoms, and attachment styles. Women appear to be more vulnerable to lockdown than men. Insecure or depressed subjects also appear more vulnerable. The lockdown impact also depends on changes in the frequency of physical/digital intercourse during lockdown and the modalities of confinement. Changes in NSC, NSE, and PSE had a significant effect on sexual satisfaction during lockdown. Conclusion: The lockdown impact on sexual emotions and cognitions is non-negligible and greater than the impact on sexual behaviors. Whether it is positive or negative, it asks about the post-confinement repercussions: what becomes of a positive impact with deconfinement? Will the negative impacts be one-off or will vulnerabilities be expressed over the long term?.","Gouvernet, Brice; Bonierbale, Mireille",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1158136020301080; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1158136020301080?v=s5,1

599900,Neutrophils and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Regulate Immune Responses in Health and Disease,2020-09-20,"Understanding the structural organization of lipids in the cell and viral membranes is essential for elucidating mechanisms of viral fusion that lead to entry of enveloped viruses into their host cells. The HIV lipidome shows a remarkable enrichment in dihydrosphingomyelin, an unusual sphingolipid formed by a dihydrosphingosine backbone. Here we investigated the ability of dihydrosphingosine to incorporate into the site of membrane fusion mediated by the HIV envelope (Env) protein. Dihydrosphingosine as well as cholesterol, fatty acid, and tocopherol was conjugated to highly conserved, short HIV-1 Env-derived peptides with no antiviral activity otherwise. We showed that dihydrosphingosine exclusively endowed nanomolar antiviral activity to the peptides (IC(50) as low as 120 nM) in HIV-1 infection on TZM-bl cells and on Jurkat T cells, as well as in the cell-cell fusion assay. These sphingopeptides were active against enfuvirtide-resistant and wild-type CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic HIV strains. The anti-HIV activity was determined by both the peptides and their dihydrosphingosine conjugate. Moreover, their mode of action involved accumulation in the cells and viruses and binding to membranes enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The data suggest that sphingopeptides are recruited to the HIV membrane fusion site and provide a general concept in developing inhibitors of sphingolipid-mediated biological systems.—Ashkenazi, A., Viard, M., Unger, L., Blumenthal, R., Shai, Y.

599984,Human bocavirus infections in hospitalized Greek children,2010-03-09,"OBJECTIVE: To assess in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, treated with different immunosuppressive therapies, the induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response after vaccination in terms of anti-region-binding-domain (RBD)-antibody- and T-cell-specific responses against spike, and the vaccine safety in terms of clinical impact on disease activity. METHODS: Health care workers (HCWs) and RA patients, having completed the BNT162b2-mRNA vaccination in the last 2 weeks, were enrolled. Serological response was evaluated by quantifying anti-RBD antibodies, while the cell-mediated response was evaluated by a whole-blood test quantifying the interferon (IFN)-γ-response to spike peptides. FACS analysis was performed to identify the cells responding to spike stimulation. RA disease activity was evaluated by clinical examination through the DAS28crp, and local and/or systemic clinical adverse events were registered. In RA patients, the ongoing therapeutic regimen was modified during the vaccination period according to the American College of Rheumatology indications. RESULTS: We prospectively enrolled 167 HCWs and 35 RA patients. Anti-RBD-antibodies were detected in almost all patients (34/35, 97%), although the titer was significantly reduced in patients under CTLA-4-inhibitors (median: 465 BAU/mL, IQR: 103-1189, p<0.001) or IL-6-inhibitors (median: 492 BAU/mL, IQR: 161-1007, p<0.001) compared to HCWs (median: 2351 BAU/mL, IQR: 1389-3748). T-cell-specific response scored positive in most of RA patients [24/35, (69%)] with significantly lower IFN-γ levels in patients under biological therapy such as IL-6-inhibitors (median: 33.2 pg/mL, IQR: 6.1-73.9, p<0.001), CTLA-4-inhibitors (median: 10.9 pg/mL, IQR: 3.7-36.7, p<0.001), and TNF-α-inhibitors (median: 89.6 pg/mL, IQR: 17.8-224, p=0.002) compared to HCWs (median: 343 pg/mL, IQR: 188-756). A significant correlation between the anti-RBD-antibody titer and spike-IFN-γ-specific T-cell response was found in RA patients (rho=0.432, p=0.009). IFN-γ T-cell response was mediated by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Finally, no significant increase in disease activity was found in RA patients following vaccination. CONCLUSION: This study showed for the first time that antibody-specific and whole-blood spike-specific T-cell responses induced by the COVID-19 mRNA-vaccine were present in the majority of RA patients, who underwent a strategy of temporary suspension of immunosuppressive treatment during vaccine administration. However, the magnitude of specific responses was dependent on the immunosuppressive therapy administered. In RA patients, BNT162b2 vaccine was safe and disease activity remained stable.","Picchianti-Diamanti, Andrea; Aiello, Alessandra; Laganà, Bruno; Agrati, Chiara; Castilletti, Concetta; Meschi, Silvia; Farroni, Chiara; Lapa, Daniele; Najafi Fard, Saeid; Cuzzi, Gilda; Cimini, Eleonora; Grassi, Germana; Vanini, Valentina; Di Rosa, Roberta; Salemi, Simonetta; Nalli, Gabriele; Salmi, Andrea; Repele, Federica; Altera, Anna Maria Gerarda; Maffongelli, Gaetano; Palazzolo, Claudia; Vita, Serena; Leone, Sara; Puro, Vincenzo; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Nicastri, Emanuele; Goletti, Delia",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34594343/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.740249,1
600043,Magnesium in Infectious Diseases in Older People,2021-01-08,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Reports indicate a rare but serious complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The cause of this is yet to be found. However, since the summer of 2020, some case reports have documented multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). CASE PRESENTATION: A 37-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes and tobacco use presented to the emergency department (ED) for two days of fever, chest pain, and dyspnea. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and quarantined at home without symptom progression 17 days prior to his ED visit. In the ED, the patient was found to have a temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 145 bpm, and blood pressure of 95/41 mmHg. Lab values showed a creatinine of 4.74 mg/dL, lactic acid 4.7 mmol/L, C-reactive protein 640.4 mg/L, sedimentation rate 108 mm/hr, ferritin 2126 mcg/L, D-Dimer 2770 ng/mL and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 629 ng/L. Chest computed tomography angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism;however, it did show mediastinal lymphadenopathies (Figure 1). The patient was given intravenous fluids, piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and started on norepinephrine followed by admission to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). In the MICU, the patient required a second vasopressor (vasopressin) and hydrocortisone. Nephrology was consulted to start continuous renal replacement therapy. An echocardiogram revealed new-onset heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. Infectious, hematologic, and autoimmune investigations continued to be unremarkable;however, the patient's COVID-19 antibodies were reactive to spike and nucleocapsid antigens. After three days of treatment, the patient no longer required vasopressor support, and steroids were discontinued. Even so, the next morning he was again febrile and hypotension requiring vasopressors as well as new-onset atrial fibrillation with controlled rate. On exam, he developed a new non-blanching rash of his bilateral feet (Figure 2). Thereafter, infectious disease was consulted and diagnosed the patient with MIS-A. They started steroids along with intravenous immunoglobulin. This regimen saw a rapid resolution in fevers, despite holding antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Common symptoms of MIS-A are fever, chest pain, palpitations, and gastrointestinal distress. Elevated inflammatory markers include C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer [1]. Both children and adults have been reported to have cardiac dysfunction with MIS [1,2]. Recently the most common therapies provided to patients with MIS-C and -A are IVIG, vasoactive medications, and steroids [3]. CONCLUSIONS: Though MIS-C has been recognized in the pediatric population, MIS-A is beginning to present in adults after a COVID-19 infection. Increased awareness, as well as further study of this syndrome's pathophysiology, may lead to rapid treatment and improved outcomes. REFERENCE #1: Morris SB, Schwartz NG, Patel P, et al.

600155,Erratum: Guidance for building a dedicated health facility to contain the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak,2020-05-11,"Purpose: Post-secondary students have higher than average contacts than the general population due to congregate living, use of public transit, high-density academic and social activities, and employment in the services sector. We evaluated the impact of a large student population returning to a mid-sized city currently experiencing a low rate of COVID-19 on community health outcomes. We consider whether targeted routine or one-time screening in this population can mitigate community COVID-19 impacts. Methods: We developed a dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 subdivided into three interacting populations: general population, university students, and long-term care residents. We parameterized the model using the medical literature and expert opinion. We calibrated the model to the observed outcomes in a mid-sized Canadian city between March 1 and August 15, 2020 prior to the arrival of a relatively large post-secondary student population. We evaluated the impact of the student population (20,000 people arriving on September 1) on cumulative COVID-19 infections over the fall semester, the timing of peak infections, the timing and peak level of critical care occupancy, and the timing of re-engaged social and economic restrictions. We consider multiple scenarios with different student and general population COVID-19 prevention behaviours as well as different COVID-19 screening strategies in students. Results: In a city with low levels of COVID-19 activity, the return of a relatively large student population substantially increases the total number of COVID-19 infections in the community. In a scenario in which students immediately engage in a 24% contact reduction compared to pre-COVID levels, the total number of infections in the community increases by 87% (from 3,900 without the students to 7,299 infections with the students), with 71% of the incremental infections occurring in the general population, causing social and economic restrictions to be re-engaged 3 weeks earlier and an incremental 17 COVID-19 deaths. Scenarios in which students have an initial, short-term increase in contacts with other students before engaging in contact reduction behaviours can increase infections in the community by 150% or more. In such scenarios, screening asymptomatic students every 5 days reduces the number of infections attributable to the introduction of the university student population by 42% and delays the re-engagement of social and economic restrictions by 1 week. Compared to screening every 5 days, one-time mass screening of students prevents fewer infections, but is highly efficient in terms of infections prevented per screening test performed. Discussion: University students are highly inter-connected with the city communities in which they live and go to school, and they have a higher number of contacts than the general population. High density living environments, enthusiasm for the new school year, and relatively high rates of asymptomatic presentation may decrease their self-protective behaviours and contribute to increased community transmission of COVID-19 affecting at-risk members of the city community. Screening targeted at this population provides significant public health benefits to the community through averted infections, critical care admissions, and COVID-19 deaths.","Cipriano, L.

In the present study, a novel metastasis-related gene, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), was characterized for its role in CRC metastasis and underlying molecular mechanisms. The clinical significance of FGL2 was investigated using tissue microarray analysis of samples from 82 patients with CRC. The molecular effects of FGL2 in CRC cells were determined using RNA interference and ectopic expression of FGL2. The overexpression of FGL2 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients, and it was determined to be an independent predictor of overall survival (P < 0.05). The depletion of FGL2 expression inhibited tumor progression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo, while ectopic overexpression of FGL2 enhanced cell invasion and induced EMT in vitro. Our results suggest that FGL2 plays an important oncogenic role in CRC aggressiveness by inducing EMT, and FGL2 could be employed as a novel prognostic marker and effective therapeutic target for CRC.","Qin, Wen-Zheng; Li, Quan-Lin; Chen, Wei-Feng; Xu, Mei-Dong; Zhang, Yi-Qun; Zhong, Yun-Shi; Ma, Li-Li; Hu, Jian-Wei; Cai, Ming-Yan; He, Meng-Jiang; Yao, Li-Qing; Zhou, Ping-Hong",Med Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25129313/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-014-0181-7,1

Survey results suggested that educators with longer years of working in education and White educators reported higher levels of compassion fatigue than their counterparts. Controlling for educators' demographic factors, online teaching self-efficacy had a negative and significant association with compassion fatigue. Moreover, the negative association between online teaching self-efficacy and compassion fatigue was intensified among educators with a higher level of SEL competencies. The findings highlight the importance of promoting educators' online teaching self-efficacy in preventing educator compassion fatigue. It also indicates that educators with higher SEL competencies were more attuned to the negative association between online teaching self-efficacy and compassion fatigue than educators with lower SEL competencies. IMPACT STATEMENT This is one of the first empirical studies examining educators' experiences with online teaching self-efficacy, compassion fatigue, and SEL competencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and distance education. It highlights the importance of promoting educators' online teaching self-efficacy and monitoring their SEL competencies in preventing compassion fatigue among educators. It also indicates that educators with a higher level of SEL competencies were more attuned to the negative influence of online teaching self-efficacy on compassion fatigue than educators with a lower SEL competency level.","Yang, C.

602859,Patients with COVID-19: in the dark-NETs of neutrophils,2021-05-24,"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence, healthcare resource utilization and costs (HCRU&C) of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients versus controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective, matched-cohort administrative claims analysis using IBM MarketScan databases (2011–2017). Newly diagnosed, adult (18+ yrs) knee OA patients identified by ICD9/10 code were matched 1:1 to controls by age, sex, payer, and geography; alpha level set to 0.05. Prevalence was estimated for 2017. All-cause and knee OA-related HCRU&C reported per-patient-per-year (PPPY) over follow-up period up to 4 years. RESULTS: Overall 2017 knee OA prevalence was 4% (615,514 knee OA/15.4M adults). A total of 510,605 patients meeting inclusion criteria were matched 1:1 with controls. The knee OA cohort had mean age 60 years and was 58% female. Versus controls, knee OA patients had significantly more PPPY outpatient (84.5 versus 45.0) and pharmacy (29.8 versus 19.8) claims, and significantly higher PPPY outpatient costs ($12,571 versus $6,465), and pharmacy costs ($3,655 versus $2,038). Knee OA patients incurred $7,707 more PPPY total healthcare costs than controls, of which $4,674 (60.6%) were knee OA-related medical claims and $1,926 (25%) were knee OA-related medications of interest. PPPY costs for nonselective NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, intraarticular hyaluronic acid, non-acute opioids, and knee replacement were higher for knee OA patients than controls. Using median and mean all-cause total cost ($9,330 and $24,550, respectively), the estimated sum cost of knee OA patients in MarketScan ranged from $5.7B to $15B annually. CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis demonstrated an annual 2017 prevalence of 4.0% (≥18 years) and 13.2% (≥65 years) for newly diagnosed knee OA patients. Compared with controls, all-cause costs were significantly higher for knee OA patients, nearly double that of matched controls, attributable to increased medical and treatment costs and comorbidity treatment burden. Additionally, the estimated annual cost of knee OA treatment was substantial, ranging between $5.7 billion and $15 billion.","Bedenbaugh, Angela V; Bonafede, Machaon; Marchlewicz, Elizabeth H; Lee, Vinson; Tambiah, Jeyanesh",Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054301/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s302289,1
603789,Engineering a Self-Navigated MnARK Nanovaccine for Inducing Potent Protective Immunity against Novel Coronavirus,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Concern has been expressed over how well Africa is prepared to cope with the pandemic of Covid-19. Will rural populations with low levels of education know how to apply community-based infection control? We undertook fieldwork in two villages in central Sierra Leone to gain insight into how rural people faced with Covid-19 assess epidemic infection risks. METHODS: Two communities were selected based on prior contrasted exposure to Ebola Virus Disease–one with substantial number of cases and the other having resisted infection through strong community sequestration measures. We assessed understanding of infection risks via an experimental game. This asked players to express a preference for one of two diseases, one resembling Ebola with lower risk of infection and the other resembling Covid-19 with lower risk of death. Players were not told the identity of the diseases. RESULTS: In total 107 adult villagers played the game (58% women). Half (52%) preferred the disease model with lower risk of infection, 29% preferred the model with lower risk of death, while 21% saw the combined risk of infection and death as being equivalent. Differences in reactions between the two locations were small despite different experiences of Ebola. Asked to explain their choices 48% of players cited information on infection risks modelled by the game and 31% stated that their choices reflected awareness of the need for personal action and respect for local regulations. We concluded that villagers thoughtfully assess disease risks and that some are good intuitive statisticians. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest rural people in Sierra Leone retain the lessons of experience from the Ebola outbreak of 2014–15 and will be able to apply these lessons to a new infectious disease for which have no prior practical experience. Our expectation is that rural populations will understand Covid-19 control measures, thus reducing need for draconian enforcement.","Kamara, Foday Mamoud; Mokuwa, Esther Yei; Richards, Paul",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579602/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235108,1
604744,Reducing the Impact of Viral Respiratory Infections in Children,2005-05-28,"This paper sets out key challenges related to detection and management of infection in nursing home residents, and then explores the situation in South Africa, and use of decision support tools as a mechanism to improve this area of practice. In line with global trends, concerns have been raised about the rapidly increasing aging population in South Africa and the ability of the current healthcare system to keep pace with patient demand, particularly nursing home residents. Nursing home residents, who often exhibit atypical signs and symptoms, are at increased risk of infection and unplanned admissions, which account for 65% of all bed days, and cost the US healthcare economy more than a trillion dollars a year. Evidence suggests that the current workforce in South Africa receive limited training in this area and are largely unprepared to meet the demands of the aging population. Building the capacity and skills of the workforce in South Africa is one approach that could help to improve the early detection of infection and assist the nursing home workforce to provide more effective and timely care, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Decision support tools, such as the Early Detection of Infection Scale, can help ensure consistency and ensure more timely treatment, minimising unplanned admissions and healthcare expenditure. However. the potential benefits or indeed how easily this could be integrated in to nursing homes in South Africa is unknown. An important first step, as in other parts of the world, is therefore to explore views and opinions of how infections are detected and managed in practice by nurses, care workers and managers in nursing homes.","Carey, Nicola; Christelle Boersema, Geertien; du Toit, Helena S.",Int J Afr Nurs Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214139121000111; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijans.2021.100288; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214139121000111?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520656/,1
604929,"COVID-19: Diagnostics, Therapeutic Advances, and Vaccine Development",2021-02-15,"As the global burden of mortality from COVID-19 continues to rise, an understanding of who is most at risk of adverse outcomes is of paramount importance. Pre-existing cardiometabolic, renal and respiratory diseases as well as old age are well-established risk factors associated with disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. However, mounting evidence also indicates an increased susceptibility to, and risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 in people with schizophrenia, independent of age and comorbidity. Therefore, elucidating the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms which may increase the risk of poor outcomes in people with schizophrenia is of crucial importance. Here, we provide a narrative on the current understanding of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia and propose potential mechanisms which may link schizophrenia with an increased susceptibility to, and greater risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Given the existing knowledge gaps, robust clinical and biological studies are required to further our understanding of some of these underlying mechanisms, so that effective prevention and treatment strategies for COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia can be developed.","Mohan, Mohapradeep; Perry, Benjamin Ian; Saravanan, Ponnusamy; Singh, Swaran Preet",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079487/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.666067,1

COVID-19 pneumonia is often manifested in sub-pleural areas, which is preferably detected by sonography. An RT-PCR test cannot always ensure a safe differentiation of COVID-19- and non-diseased cases. Clinically challenging is that a reliable and time efficient decision regarding COVID-19 suspects requiring isolation. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the significance of LUS in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 suspicion at hospital admission. A total of 101 patients admitted to a suspect ward with COVID-19-typical symptoms were assessed. All patients received prospectively a standardized LUS at admission. Patients were classified as LUS-positive and -negative cases based on a specific LUS score. The RT-PCR test in combination with the clinical findings served as a reference. Correctly classified were 14/15 COVID-19 diseased suspects as LUS-positive (sensitivity: 93.3%). Twenty-seven out of 61 non-positive cases were classified as false positive with LUS (specificity: 55.7%). In 34/35 patients who were assessed as LUS negative, no COVID-19 disease was detected during the hospitalization. The PPV and NPV of the LUS were 34.1% and 97.1%. LUS is a valuable tool in symptomatic patients for the assessment of COVID-19-disease. The high negative predictive value of LUS is helpful to rule out the disease.","Gutsche, Holger; Lesser, Thomas G.; Wolfram, Frank; Doenst, Torsten",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063861/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11060921,1

At the moment no reports are available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with COVID19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted aortic graft. Case report A 67-year old male patient, undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a bifurcated graft six years before, was admitted to the Emergency Department with high fever for a week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in radiological suite. Conclusion Acute thrombosis of vascular prosthetic grafts is a possible, catastrophic complication of COVID19 infection. In COVID19 patients with prosthetic graft an aggressive antithrombotic treatment could be considered to prevent such an event.","Giacomelli, Elena; Dorigo, Walter; Fargion, Aaron; Calugi, Gianmarco; Cianchi, Giovanni; Pratesi, Carlo",Ann Vasc Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890509620303666; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890509620303666?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2020.04.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360432/,1

These sugars are predicted to help mediate spike binding to the host receptor by stabilizing its ‘open’ conformation and evading host immunity. Here, we investigated both the essentiality of the host N-glycosylation pathway and SARS-CoV-2 N-glycans for infection. Inhibition of host N-glycosylation using RNAi or FDA-approved drugs reduced virus infectivity, including that of several variants. Under these conditions, cells produced less virions and some completely lost their infectivity. Furthermore, partial deglycosylation of intact virions showed that surface-exposed N-glycans are critical for cell invasion. Altogether, spike N-glycosylation is a targetable pathway with clinical potential for treatment or prevention of COVID-19.","Casas-Sanchez, Aitor; Romero-Ramirez, Alessandra; Hargreaves, Eleanor; Ellis, Cameron C.; Grajeda, Brian I.; Estevao, Igor; Patterson, Edward I.; Hughes, Grant L.; Almeida, Igor C.; Zech, Tobias; Acosta-Serrano, Álvaro",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.429940,1

The death toll associated with the pandemic is increasing day by day in a high rate. Herein, an effort has been made to identify the potentiality of commercially available drugs and also their probable derivatives for creation of better opportunity to make more powerful drugs against coronavirus. This study involves the in-silico interactions of dexamethasone and its derivatives against the multiple proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with the help of various computational methods. Descriptor parameters revealed their non-toxic effect in the human body. Ultimately docking studies and molecular dynamic simulation on those target protein by dexamethasone and its derivatives showed a high binding energy. Dexamethasone showed -9.8 kcal/mol and its derivative D5 showed -12.1 kcal/mol binding energy. Those scores indicate that dexamethasone has more therapeutic effect on SARS CoV-2 than other currently used drugs. Derivatives give the clue for the synthesis of a novel drug to remove SARS CoV-2. Until then, dexamethasone will be used as a potential inhibitor of SARS CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Employing a more realistic model that considers heterogeneous contact is consequently necessary. Here, we use a contact network to reconstruct unprotected, protected contact, and airborne spread to simulate the two-stages outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on the “Diamond Princess” cruise ship. We employ Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the model parameters and quantify the uncertainties by the ensemble simulation technique. During the early epidemic with intensive social contacts, the results reveal that the average transmissibility [Formula: see text] was 0.026 and the basic reproductive number [Formula: see text] was 6.94, triple that in the WHO report, indicating that all people would be infected in one month. The [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] decreased to 0.0007 and 0.2 when quarantine was implemented. The reconstruction suggests that diluting the airborne virus concentration in closed settings is useful in addition to isolation, and high-risk susceptible should follow rigorous prevention measures in case exposed.

Nonetheless, data on the correlation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral genotypes and COVID-19 symptoms caused by them are still scarce. In this report, we present a moderately severe COVID-19 case in a healthcare worker in Moscow, Russia, supplemented with the data on its causative agent's phenotype regarding in vitro and full-genome characterization. The 44-year-old male healthcare worker who had frequent professional contacts with COVID-19 patients was hospitalized with a viral pneumonia diagnosis and soon started to exhibit fever, dry paroxysmal cough, loss of smell, and typical ground-glass opacities found in both lungs on chest CT scans. The COVID-19 diagnosis was verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunochromatography, and immunochemiluminescent assays. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, paracetamol, and enoxaparin, leading to his recovery after two weeks from the disease onset.

The critical care nurse's role in facilitating patient communication and enabling communication between patients and their families has never been more important or poignant than during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have witnessed tremendous examples of resourceful, caring nurses serving as the primary communication partner and support for isolated seriously ill patients during this pandemic. However, evidence-based tools and techniques for assisting awake, communication-impaired, seriously ill patients to communicate are not yet systematically applied across all settings. Missed communication or misinterpretation of patients' messages induces panic and fear in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and can have serious deleterious consequences.

One of these networks is the Parkinson Network Eastern Saxony (PANOS). PANOS aims to deliver timely and equal care to PD patients with a collaborative intersectoral structured care pathway. Additional components encompass personalized case management, an electronic health record, and communicative and educative measures. To reach an intersectoral consensus of the future collaboration in PANOS, a structured consensus process was conducted in three sequential workshops. Community-based physicians, PD specialists, therapists, scientists and representatives of regulatory authorities and statutory health insurances were asked to rate core pathway-elements and supporting technological, personal and communicative measures. For the majority of core elements/planned measures, a consensus was reached, defined as an agreement by >75% of participants. Additionally, six representatives from all partners involved in the network-design independently assessed PANOS based on the Development Model for Integrated Care (DMIC), a validated model addressing the comprehensiveness and maturity of integrated care concepts. The results show that PANOS is currently in an early maturation state but has the potential to comprehensively represent the DMIC if all planned activities are implemented successfully. Despite the favorable high level of consensus regarding the PANOS concept and despite its potential to become a balanced integrated care concept according to the DMIC, its full implementation remains a considerable challenge.","Loewenbrück, Kai F.; Stein, Doron B.; Amelung, Volker E.; Bitterlich, Robert; Brumme, Martin; Falkenburger, Björn; Fehre, Annekathrin; Feige, Tim; Frank, Anika; Gißke, Carola; Helmert, Claudia; Kerkemeyer, Linda; Knapp, Andreas; Lang, Caroline; Leuner, Annegret; Lummer, Carina; Minkman, Mirella M.

Evidence shows severe acute respiratory syndrome is closely related to the induced cytokine storm. Interleukin-6 is a key player; its role in systemic inflammation is well known. AIM: To evaluate the effect of tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, on the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, MedRxiv, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 9(th) June 2020 for observational or prospective studies reporting results of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 infection treated with TCZ. Effect sizes were reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and an OR less than 1 was associated with a better outcome in those treated with TCZ. RESULTS: Overall 13476 patients (33 studies; n = 3264 received TCZ) with COVID-19 pneumonia and various degree of severity were included. Outcome was improved with TCZ. In the primary analysis (n = 19 studies reporting data), mortality was reduced in patients treated with TCZ (OR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.47-0.87; P < 0.01). In 9 studies where risk of death with TCZ use was controlled for other variables mortality was reduced by 57% (OR = 0.43, 95%CI: 0.27-0.7; P < 0.01).

Collectively, these studies reveal an unexpected complexity of the spatial organization of the replication membranes and suggest that (+)RNA viruses actively change cellular membrane composition to build their replication organelles.","Belov, George A; van Kuppeveld, Frank JM",Curr Opin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712001411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23036609/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.09.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712001411,1
614471,Prevention of Travel-Related Infectious Diseases in Families of Internationally Adopted Children,2005-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence of person-to-person transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in household and healthcare settings, more data are needed to describe and better understand the risk factors and transmission routes in both settings, as well as the extent to which disease severity affects transmission. METHODS: A seroepidemiological investigation was conducted among MERS-CoV case patients (cases) and their household contacts to investigate transmission risk in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Cases diagnosed between 1 January 2013 and 9 May 2014 and their household contacts were approached for enrollment. Demographic, clinical, and exposure history data were collected. Sera were screened by MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence, with results confirmed by microneutralization assay. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 34 (91%) case patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and did not require oxygen during hospitalization. MERS-CoV antibodies were detected in 13 of 24 (54%) case patients with available sera, including 1 severely symptomatic, 9 mildly symptomatic, and 3 asymptomatic case patients. No serologic evidence of MERS-CoV transmission was found among 105 household contacts with available sera. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of MERS-CoV was not documented in this investigation of mostly asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases and their household contacts. These results have implications for clinical management of cases and formulation of isolation policies to reduce the risk of transmission.","Al Hosani, Farida Ismail; Kim, Lindsay; Khudhair, Ahmed; Pham, Huong; Al Mulla, Mariam; Al Bandar, Zyad; Pradeep, Krishna; Elkheir, Kheir Abou; Weber, Stefan; Khoury, Mary; Donnelly, George; Younis, Naima; El Saleh, Feda; Abdalla, Muna; Imambaccus, Hala; Haynes, Lia M; Thornburg, Natalie J; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Miao, Congrong; Tamin, Azaibi; Hall, Aron J; Russell, Elizabeth S; Harris, Aaron M; Kiebler, Craig; Mir, Roger A; Pringle, Kimberly; Alami, Negar N; Abedi, Glen R; Gerber, Susan I",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29905769/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy503,1

The internal consistency, construct validity, and criteria validity of the instrument were examined. Principal component analysis followed by an oblique rotation was used to derive a three-factor solution. These factors were labeled intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance; all three factors together accounted for 58.1% of the variance. The total Cronbach’s alpha of 0.94 reflected the good internal consistency of the instrument. With reference to diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, the IES-R cutoff point for posttraumatic stress disorder was 19 of 20 with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 84.1%.

Although there has been attention to the accelerated growth of telemedicine in the United States and other high-income countries, the telemedicine revolution may have an even greater benefit in LMICs, where it could improve health care access for vulnerable and geographically remote patients. In this article, we survey the expansion of telemedicine for chronic disease management in LMICs and describe seven key steps needed to implement telemedicine in LMIC settings. Telemedicine can not only maintain essential medical care for chronic disease patients in LMICs throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, but also strengthen primary health care delivery and reduce socio-economic disparities in health care access over the long-term.","Hoffer-Hawlik, Michael A.; Moran, Andrew E.; Burka, Daniel; Kaur, Prabhdeep; Cai, Jun; Frieden, Thomas R.; Gupta, Reena",Global heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150128/; https://doi.org/10.5334/gh.852,1

We examined feature importance across 2787 counties in the United States using data-driven machine learning models. Existing mathematical models of disease spread usually focused on the case prediction with different infection rates without incorporating multiple heterogeneous features that could impact the spatial and temporal trajectory of COVID-19. Recognizing this, we trained a data-driven model using 23 features representing six key influencing factors affecting the pandemic spread: social demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties, movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure. Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening stage. The study aimed to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features evolved at different stages; (2) The extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varied across counties with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of COVID-19 across 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features had the highest importance in counties with higher population densities; (3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social connectedness index), had higher importance for counties with higher population densities. The results showed that the data-driven machine learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and at different stages of a pandemic life cycle.","Li, Qingchun; Yang, Yang; Wang, Wanqiu; Lee, Sanghyeon; Xiao, Xin; Gao, Xinyu; Oztekin, Bora; Fan, Chao; Mostafavi, Ali",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92634-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158571/,1

This study’s purpose is to measure changes in adolescents’ perceived stress and mood early in the pandemic. METHODS: The present study drew from a racially and ethnically diverse sample of high school student participants in an ongoing intervention study in the Midwestern U.S., 128 of whom provided reports of their daily stress and mood both before (December 2017 to March 2020) and during (March–July 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. We expected to see increases in perceived stress, declines in positive mood states, and increases in negative mood states, with larger impacts on individuals from households with lower parental education levels. RESULTS: Multilevel models revealed increases in perceived stress primarily for adolescents from low/moderate education families during the pandemic. Impacts on mood states also diverged by education: adolescents from low/moderate education households reported feeling more ashamed, caring, and excited than before the pandemic, changes that were not shared by their peers from high education households. Although changes in mood that arose with the onset of the pandemic became less pronounced over time, increased levels of home- and health-related stress stayed high for low/moderate education adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 period, we observed disparate impacts on adolescents according to household education level, with more dramatic and negative changes in the emotional well-being of adolescents from low/moderate education households.","Collier Villaume, Sarah; Stephens, Jacquelyn E.; Nwafor, Ednah E.; Umaña-Taylor, Adriana J.; Adam, Emma K.",J Adolesc Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.06.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1054139X21002949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420820/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21002949,1

To discover cellular protein responses of PK-15 cells to PCV2 infection, two-dimensional liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling was employed to quantitatively identify the proteins that were differentially expressed in PK-15 from the PCV2-infected group compared to the uninfected control group. A total of 196 cellular proteins in PK-15 that were significantly altered at different time periods post-infection were identified. These differentially expressed proteins were related to the biological processes of binding, cell structure, signal transduction, cell adhesion, etc. and their interactions. Moreover, some of these proteins were further confirmed by Western blot. The high number of differentially expressed proteins identified should be very useful in elucidating the mechanism of replication and pathogenesis of PCV2 in the future.","Liu, Jie; Bai, Juan; Zhang, Lili; Hou, Chengcai; Li, Yufeng; Jiang, Ping",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25103791/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-014-1106-4,1

Yet, little is known about the extent of this support over the early childhood period or how program participation varies by race (or ethnicity) and metropolitan county residence. We use administrative data from Virginia to document participation in SNAP and TANF among children born between 2007 and 2010 during their early childhood period, which we define here as birth to age six. We find that participation in SNAP is about four times greater than participation in TANF and that most children begin their connection with the social welfare system in their birth year. Children who participate earlier in life tend to stay connected over a longer portion of the early childhood period, although SNAP participation peaks around ages 3–4 while TANF peaks earlier, around ages 2–3. Most households on SNAP do not receive TANF, but only about 1 in 12 children on TANF do not receive SNAP. Finally, over the early childhood period, on average, just under 1 in 2 children in Virginia participated in SNAP or TANF but demography plays an important role in this process: The level of cumulative receipt is 1 in 4 among White children, 1 in 2 among Hispanic children but rises to 3 in 4 for Black children; cumulative receipt is also higher in nonmetropolitan counties than metropolitan counties.

The main problem is the subjectivity of the test. The MMT in the version of a “break test” depends on the tester’s force rise and the patient’s ability to resist the applied force. As a first step, the investigation of the reproducibility of the testers’ force profile is required for valid application. The study examined the force profiles of n = 29 testers (n = 9 experiences (Exp), n = 8 little experienced (LitExp), n = 12 beginners (Beg)). The testers performed 10 MMTs according to the test of hip flexors, but against a fixed leg to exclude the patient’s reaction. A handheld device recorded the temporal course of the applied force. The results show significant differences between Exp and Beg concerning the starting force (p(adj) = 0.029), the ratio of starting to maximum force (p(adj) = 0.005) and the normalized mean Euclidean distances between the 10 trials (p(adj) = 0.015). The slope is significantly higher in Exp vs. LitExp (p = 0.006) and Beg (p = 0.005). The results also indicate that experienced testers show inter-tester differences and partly even a low intra-tester reproducibility. This highlights the necessity of an objective MMT-assessment. Furthermore, an agreement on a standardized force profile is required. A suggestion for this is given.","Bittmann, Frank N.; Dech, Silas; Aehle, Markus; Schaefer, Laura V.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics10120996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255648/,1

This study is aimed at assessing the prevalence of four healthy behaviors (sufficient physical activity, avoiding cigarette smoking, low to moderate alcohol use, and maintaining a healthy weight) among platelet donors and to compare the results with those in the general population of similar ages. METHODS: Eighty-six platelet donors were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to assess physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. Sociodemographic information including gender, age, and education was also collected from all participants. Chi-square statistics and logistic regression were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of the study donors was 51 years, 56% were female. Most were employed (90%), and 48% hold a bachelor's or higher degree. The prevalence of healthy behaviors differed by education gradients but not by gender and age. About 49% of the donors met the weekly physical activity recommendations, less than 5% were daily smokers, and~26% were classified as more frequent drinkers (≥1 to ≤5 times per week). The corresponding percentages for the general population were, respectively, 33%, 13%, and 35%. The prevalence of overweight and obesity, as assessed by body mass index (BMI), among donors were 50% and 29%, respectively, much higher than the current prevalence of overweight and obesity of 37% and 19%, respectively, among adults in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The individual health behaviors of the majority of the study population could be characterized by a relatively high level of physical activity, low prevalence of daily smoking, and moderate alcohol drinking. The above-average overweight/obesity prevalence among platelet donors in this cohort is of concern because of the potential serious health consequences and it warrants further reflection.","Mousavi, Seyed Ali; Hermundstad, Brita; Saether, Per Christian; Nybruket, Monica Jenssen; Knutsen, Teresa Risopatron; Llohn, Abid Hussain",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860057/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8891885,1

Although several studies have examined agreement between peer and faculty assessments regarding basic life support (BLS), few studies have done so for advanced resuscitation skills (ARS) such as intubation and defibrillation. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the degree of agreement between medical students’ and faculty assessments of ARS examinations. METHODS: This retrospective explorative study was conducted during the emergency medicine (EM) clinical clerkship of fourth-year medical students from April to July 2020. A faculty assessor (FA) and a peer assessor (PA) assessed each examinee’s resuscitation skills (including BLS, intubation, and defibrillation) using a checklist that consisted of 20 binary items (performed or not performed) and 1 global proficiency rating using a 5-point Likert scale. The prior examinee assessed the next examinee after feedback and training as a PA. All 54 students participated in peer assessment. The assessments of 44 FA/PA pairs were analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Gwet’s first-order agreement coefficient. RESULTS: The PA scores were higher than the FA scores (mean±standard deviation, 20.2±2.5 [FA] vs. 22.3±2.4 [PA]; P<0.001). The agreement was poor to moderate for the overall checklist (ICC, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.73; P<0.01), BLS (ICC, 0.19; 95% CI, -0.11 to 0.46; P<0.10), intubation (ICC, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.70; P<0.01), and defibrillation (ICC, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.68; P<0.01).

There is a need to understand the impact on different health care professionals in different countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic among dental staff in Norway in relation to background characteristics, work situation and preparedness of the service. METHODS: A structured questionnaire sent electronically to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants inquired information about the lockdown period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020). Distributions of background characteristics, perceptions of preparedness and psychological impact were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were used to compare psychological impact between dental professionals treating patients versus not during lockdown. RESULTS: Among the 1237 respondents, 58.8% worked clinically with patients. The majority were concerned of becoming infected (71.9%), of infecting others (85.4%) and/or of their family becoming infected (76.9%). Respondents who treated patients felt significantly more insecure about whether having become infected or not. The minority felt discriminated (6.7%), worried about death (11.7%), felt that life was threatening (9.8%) or felt loss of control of their lives (8.9%). More than 80% agreed that their workplace handled the situation well. Four factors were retrieved from the factor analysis. SEMs showed that gender and work experience had a significant effect on the factors Instability, Infection and Concerns. Respondents with work experience ≥10 years were less likely to express fear about Instability and Infection. Personnel reporting that their workplace had adequate equipment were also less concerned, however having adequate equipment did not reduce the factor Loss of control. CONCLUSION: The present study showed a considerable psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental personnel in Norway regardless of working clinically with patients or not. However, working with patients increased the insecurity about own infection status and of infecting people close to them. A safe working environment and adequate infection control measures are associated with less fear of infection and feeling of instability.","Uhlen, M. M.; Ansteinsson, V.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (>50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance.(1) When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation, the outcome is poor,(2–4) and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually 2or 3 weeks.(2) In this article, theauthors review several technological devices, which could support health care providers at the bedside to optimizethe care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralyzed, and ventilated. Particular attention is provided to the use of videolaryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting health care providers from this viral infection. Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train-of-four monitors which are utilizedto better titrate neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources. COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU. This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation. The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue, and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including (a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all health care givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; (b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point-of-care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; (c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and thromboelastography(TEG); (d) adapting the use of anesthetic machines and the use of volatile anesthetics. Implementing technologies for safeguarding health care providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources are paramount. Only by leveraging new technologies, it will be possible to sustain and support health care systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.","Rubulotta, Francesca; Soliman-Aboumarie, Hatem; Filbey, Kevin; Geldner, Goetz; Kuck, Kai; Ganau, Mario; Hemmerling, Thomas M.",Anesth Analg,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433248/,1

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 75 fatal COVID-19 cases who were admitted to the intensive care unit at Jinyintan Hospital (Wuhan, China). The median age of the cases was 67 (62–74) years, and 47 (62.7%) were male. Fifty patients (66.7%) were diagnosed with disseminated intra-vascular coagulation. Approximately 90% of patients had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products, which decreased continuously after anticoagulant treatment and was accompanied by elevated albumin (all P<0.05). The median survival time of patients treated with anticoagulant was 9.0 (6.0–14.0) days compared with 7.0 (3.0–10.0) days in patients without anticoagulant therapy (P=0.008). After anticoagulation treatment, C-reactive protein levels decreased (P=0.004), as did high-sensitivity troponin (P=0.018), lactate dehydrogenase (P<0.001), and hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (P<0.001). In conclusion, coagulation disorders were widespread among fatal COVID-19 cases. Anticoagulant treatment partially improved hypercoagulability, prolonged median survival time, and may have postponed inflammatory processes and cardiac injury.","Shi, Jiaran; Zhang, Wang; Sang, Ling; Qu, Zhaohui; Zhong, Ming; jiang, Li; Song, Bin; Kang, Liang; Zhang, Yun; Wang, Xingxiang; Zhang, Dingyu; Zheng, Xia",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318314/,1

632769,"Air pollutants and outpatient visits for influenza-like illness in Beijing, China",2021-06-02,"BACKGROUND: About 10–20% of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection progressed to severe illness within a week or so after initially diagnosed as mild infection. Identification of this subgroup of patients was crucial for early aggressive intervention to improve survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether computer tomography (CT) - derived measurements of body composition such as myosteatosis indicating fat deposition inside the muscles could be used to predict the risk of transition to severe illness in patients with initial diagnosis of mild COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection presenting initially as having the mild common-subtype illness were retrospectively recruited between January 21, 2020 and February 19, 2020. CT-derived body composition measurements were obtained from the initial chest CT images at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) and were used to build models to predict the risk of transition. A myosteatosis nomogram was constructed using multivariate logistic regression incorporating both clinical variables and myosteatosis measurements. The performance of the prediction models was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve including the area under the curve (AUC). The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve. RESULTS: A total of 234 patients were included in this study. Thirty-one of the enrolled patients transitioned to severe illness. Myosteatosis measurements including SM-RA (skeletal muscle radiation attenuation) and SMFI (skeletal muscle fat index) score fitted with SMFI, age and gender, were significantly associated with risk of transition for both the training and validation cohorts (P < 0.01). The nomogram combining the SM-RA, SMFI score and clinical model improved prediction for the transition risk with an AUC of 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75 to 0.95] for the training cohort and 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.97] for the validation cohort, as compared to the nomogram of the clinical model with AUC of 0.75 and 0.74 for the training and validation cohorts respectively. Favorable clinical utility was observed using decision curve analysis. CONCLUSION: We found CT-derived measurements of thoracic myosteatosis to be associated with higher risk of transition to severe illness in patients affected by COVID-19 who presented initially as having the mild common-subtype infection. Our study showed the relevance of skeletal muscle examination in the overall assessment of disease progression and prognosis of patients with COVID-19 infection.","Yi, Xiaoping; Liu, Haipeng; Zhu, Liping; Wang, Dongcui; Xie, Fangfang; Shi, Linbo; Mei, Ji; Jiang, Xiaolong; Zeng, Qiuhua; Hu, Pingfeng; Li, Yihui; Pang, Peipei; Liu, Jie; Peng, Wanxiang; Bai, Harrison X.; Liao, Weihua; Chen, Bihong T.",Clin Nutr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561421002818?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.05.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561421002818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147286/,1

Incidence continues to rise. As the epidemic threatens to overwhelm health care systems, identifying regions where the expected disease burden is likely to be high relative to the rest of the country is critical for enabling prudent and effective distribution of emergency resources. Across all global regions affected by the pandemic, an elevated risk of severe outcomes has consistently been observed in older age groups. Using age-specific mortality patterns in tandem with demographic data, we map a projection of the cumulative burden of COVID-19 and the associated cumulative burden on the healthcare system at the county-scale in the United States for a scenario in which 20% of the population of each county acquires infection. We identify regions that may be particularly impacted relative to the rest of the country, and observe a general trend that per capita disease burden and relative healthcare system demand may be highest away from major population centers.","Miller, Ian F; Becker, Alexander D; Grenfell, Bryan T; Metcalf, C.

Immune-mediated diseases of the integumentary, urogenital, endocrine and vascular systems",1986-12-31,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic disease worldwide. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuing at a rapid speed. Till May 4, 2020, there have been 3,407,747 confirmed cases and 238,198 deaths globally. The common symptoms in pregnant women are fever, cough, and dyspnea. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has transient overexpression and increased activity during pregnancy, which is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. There is no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there is no valid medication or vaccination. The immune suppression or modulation during pregnancy increases the risk of severe pneumonia. Remdesivir is an antiviral medication targeting ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis that has clinical improvement in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Chloroquine is controversial in its effectiveness and safety to treat SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is safe in pregnancy. Chloroquine has not been formally assigned to a pregnancy category by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The management strategy includes monitoring fetal heart rate and uterine contractions; early oxygenation if O(2) saturation is less than 95%; empiric antibiotics for prevention of secondary infection; corticosteroid to treat maternal SARS-CoV-2 disease routinely is not suggested, only for fetal lung maturation in selected cases; and consideration of delivery is according to the obstetric indication, gestational age, and severity of the disease. During epidemics, delivery at 32–34 weeks is considered. The indication for the Cesarean section should be flexible to minimize the risk of infection during the delivery. The newborn should be in isolation ward immediately after birth; breastfeeding is not contraindicated but should avoid direct transmission infection.","Lai, Yu-Ju; Chang, Chia-Ming; Lina,, Chi-Kung; Yang, Yi-Ping; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Wang, Peng-Hui; Changa, Cheng-Chang",J Chin Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902940/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000362,1

Moreover, we delineate risk factors for urine retention in such patients. METHODS All COVID-19 infected males were expeditiously evaluated. All enrolled patients were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), uroflowmetry, and pelvi-abdominal ultrasonography for prostate volume and postvoiding residual urine (PVR) estimation. RESULTS Fifty patients, who were diagnosed with BPH, were enrolled. The mean age (±SD) was 62.64 ± 7.69. In the pre- and post-COVID-19 group, the mean (±SD) IPSS was 13.42 ± 4.32 and 26.62 ± 5.77, respectively (P < .001), while PVR was 90.40 ± 32.75 and 185.42 ± 73.42, respectively (P < .001), and maximum flow rate was 14.40 ± 2.75 and 10.74 ± 3.43, respectively (P < .004). After infection with COVID-19, 13 (26%) patients were managed by urethral catheter fixation owing to urine retention. On bivariate analysis, age, diabetes, large prostate on digital rectal examination, alpha-blocker monotherapy, microscopic hematuria, positive urine culture, and pre-COVID-19 IPSS were significantly correlated with urine retention (P < .001, P = .01, P < .001, P = .06, P < .001, P = .04, and P < .001, respectively). On multivariate analysis, age, pre-COVID-19 IPSS, and positive urine culture were the independent predictors of urine retention (P = .05, P < .001, and P = .01, respectively). CONCLUSION LUTS in BPH patients were significantly affected by COVID-19. COVID-19 increases IPSS leading to a change in the treatment modality of BPH. On multivariate analysis, age, pre-COVID-19 IPSS, and positive urine culture were the independent predictors of urine retention post COVID-19 infection.","Nabeeh, Hossam; Ibrahim, Ali; Taha, Diaa-Eldin; Talaat, Mona; Abdelbaky, Tarek M",Lower urinary tract symptoms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34435456/; https://doi.org/10.1111/luts.12407,1
634376,Changing epidemiology of SARS-CoV in the context of COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-04,"Wireless body sensor network (WBSN) is an interdisciplinary field that could permit continuous health monitoring with constant clinical records updates through the Internet. WBAN is a special category of wireless networks. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic creates the situation to monitor the patient remotely following the social distance. WBSN provides the way to effectively monitor the patient remotely with social distance. The data transmitted in WBSN are vulnerable to attacks and this is necessary to take security procedure like cryptographic protocol to protect the user data from attackers. Several physiological sensors are implanted in the human body that will collect various physiological updates to monitor the patient’s healthcare data remotely. The sensed information will be transmitted wirelessly to doctors all over the world. But it has too many security threats like data loss, masquerade attacks, secret key distribution problems, unauthorized access, and data confidentiality loss. When any attackers are attacking the physiological sensor data, there is a possibility of losing the patient’s information. The creation, cancellation, and clinical data adjustment will produce a mass effect on the healthcare monitoring system. Present-day cryptographic calculations are highly resistant to attacks, but the only weak point is the insecure movement of keys. In this paper, we look into critical security threats: secure key distribution. While sharing the secret key between communicating parties in the wireless body sensor networks in the conventional method like via phone or email, the attackers will catch the private key. They can decrypt and modify more sensitive medical data. It can cause a significant effect like death also. So need an effective, secure key distribution scheme for transmission of human body health related data to medical professional through wireless links. Moreover, a new enhanced BB84 Quantum cryptography protocol is proposed in this paper for sharing the secret key among communicating parties in a secure manner using quantum theory. Besides, a bitwise operator is combined with quantum concepts to secure the patient’s sensed information in the wireless environment. Instead of mail and phone via sharing secret key, quantum theory with the bitwise operator is used here. Therefore, it is not possible to hack the secret key of communication. The body sensor’s constrained assets as far as battery life, memory, and computational limit are considered for showing the efficiency of the proposed security framework. Based on experimental results, it is proven that the proposed algorithm EBB84QCP provides high secure key distribution method without direct sharing the secret key and it used the quantum mechanism and bitwise operator for generating and distributing secret key value to communicating parties for sensitive information sharing in the wireless body sensor networks.","V, Anusuya Devi; V, Kalaivani",Pers Ubiquitous Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758585/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00779-021-01546-z,1

The literature appraised provides sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2 in community, household and school settings. Transmission by children was most frequently documented in household settings, while examples of children as index cases in school settings were rare. Included studies suggested that school closures may help to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but the societal, economic, and educational impacts of prolonged school closures must be considered.

They allow people to identify individuals, understand conversational cues, and make judgements about others’ mental states. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, widespread mask-wearing practices were implemented, causing a shift in the way Americans typically interact. This introduction of masks into social exchanges posed a potential challenge—how would people make these important inferences about others when a large source of information was no longer available? We conducted two studies that investigated the impact of mask exposure on emotion perception. In particular, we measured how participants used facial landmarks (visual cues) and the expressed valence and arousal (affective cues), to make similarity judgements about pairs of emotion faces. Study 1 found that in August 2020, participants with higher levels of mask exposure used cues from the eyes to a greater extent when judging emotion similarity than participants with less mask exposure. Study 2 measured participants’ emotion perception in both April and September 2020 –before and after widespread mask adoption—in the same group of participants to examine changes in the use of facial cues over time. Results revealed an overall increase in the use of visual cues from April to September. Further, as mask exposure increased, people with the most social interaction showed the largest increase in the use of visual facial cues. These results provide evidence that a shift has occurred in how people process faces such that the more people are interacting with others that are wearing masks, the more they have learned to focus on visual cues from the eye area of the face.","Barrick, Elyssa M.; Thornton, Mark A.; Tamir, Diana I.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637454/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258470,1

Whether the serum SP-D level could identify the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the early stage has not been elucidated. METHODS: We performed an observational study on 39 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from The Fourth People’s Hospital of Yiyang, Hunan, China. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, correlation analysis, and multivariate logistic regression model analysis were performed. RESULTS: In the acute phase, the serum levels of SP-D were elevated significantly in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases (mean value ± standard deviation (SD), 449.7 ± 125.8 vs 245.9 ± 90.0 ng/mL, P<0.001), while the serum levels of SP-D in the recovery period were decreased dramatically than that in the acute phase (mean value ± SD, 129.5 ± 51.7 vs 292.9 ± 130.7 ng/ml, P<0.001), and so were for the stratified patients. The chest CT imaging scores were considerably higher in the severe group compared with those in the mild group (median value, 10.0 vs 9.0, P = 0.011), while markedly lower in the recovery period than those in the acute phase (median value, 2.0 vs 9.0, P<0.001), and so were for the stratified patients. ROC curve analysis revealed that areas under the curve of lymphocyte counts (LYM), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and SP-D for severe COVID-19 were 0.719, 0.833, 0.817, 0.837, and 0.922, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the SP-D levels were negatively correlated with LYM (r = − 0.320, P = 0.047), while positively correlated with CRP (r = 0.658, P<0.001), IL-6 (r = 0.471, P = 0.002), the duration of nucleic acid of throat swab turning negative (r = 0.668, P<0.001), chest CT imaging score on admission (r = 0.695, P<0.001) and length of stay (r = 0.420, P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression model analysis showed that age (P = 0.041, OR = 1.093) and SP-D (P = 0.008, OR = 1.018) were risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated serum SP-D level was a potential biomarker for the severity of COVID-19; this may be useful in identifying patients whose condition worsens at an early stage.","Tong, Ming; Xiong, Ying; Zhu, Chen; Xu, Hong; Zheng, Qing; Jiang, Yu; Zou, Lianhong; Xiao, Xiaolin; Chen, Fang; Yan, Xiquan; Hu, Changping; Zhu, Yimin",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06447-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344306/,1

Ongoing research suggests that multiple biomarkers are associated with single foods, offering great sensitivity and specificity. However, currently there is a dearth of methods to model the relationship between multiple biomarkers and single food intake measurements. RESULTS Here, we introduce multiMarker, a web-based application based on the homonymous R package, that enables one to infer the relationship between food intake and two or more metabolomic biomarkers. Furthermore, multiMarker allows prediction of food intake from biomarker data alone. multiMarker differs from previous approaches by providing distributions of predicted intakes, directly accounting for uncertainty in food intake quantification. Usage of both the R package and the web application is demonstrated using real data concerning three biomarkers for orange intake. Further, example data is pre-loaded in the web application to enable users to examine multiMarker's functionality. CONCLUSION The proposed software advance the field of Food Intake Biomarkers providing researchers with a novel tool to perform continuous food intake quantification, and to assess its associated uncertainty, from multiple biomarkers. To facilitate widespread use of the framework, multiMarker has been implemented as an R package and a Shiny web application.","D'Angelo, Silvia; Gormley, Isobel Claire; McNamara, Aoife E; Brennan, Lorraine",BMC bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583648/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04394-z,1

642486,Deep Learning Based Drug Screening for Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCov,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure is a common complication of SARS-CoV2 related pneumonia, for which non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with Helmet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is widely used. The frequency of pneumothorax in SARS-CoV2 was reported in 0.95% of hospitalized patients in 6% of mechanically ventilated patients, and in 1% of a post-mortem case series. OBJECTIVES: Aim of our retrospective study was to investigate the incidence of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum (PNX/PNM) in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia patients treated with Helmet CPAP. Moreover, we examined the correlation between PNX/PNM and Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) values. METHODS: We collected data from patients admitted to “Luigi Sacco” University Hospital of Milan from 2 February to 5 May 2020 with SARS-CoV2 pneumonia requiring CPAP. Patients, who need NIV with bi-level pressure or endotracheal intubation (ETI) for any reason except those who needed ETI after PNX/PNM, were excluded. Population was divided in two groups according to PEEP level used (≤10 cmH2O and >10 cmH20). RESULTS: 154 patients were enrolled. In the overall population, 42 patients (27%) were treated with High-PEEP (>10 cmH2O), and 112 with Low-PEEP (≤10 cmH2O). During hospitalization 3 PNX and 2 PNM occurred (3.2%). Out of these five patients, 2 needed invasive ventilation after PNX and died. All the PNX/PNM occurred in the High-PEEP group (5/37 vs 0/112, p<0,001). CONCLUSION: The incidence of PNX appears to be lower in SARS-CoV2 than SARS and MERS. Considering the association of PNX/PNM with high PEEP we suggest using the lower PEEP as possible to prevent these complications.","Gidaro, Antonio; Samartin, Federica; Brambilla, Anna Maria; Cogliati, Chiara; Ingrassia, Stella; Banfi, Francesco; Cupiraggi, Viola; Bonino, Cecilia; Schiuma, Marco; Giacomelli, Andrea; Rusconi, Stefano; Currà, Jaqueline; Brucato, Antonio Luca; Salvi, Emanuele",Sarcoidosis Vasc Diffuse Lung Dis,https://doi.org/10.36141/svdld.v38i2.11222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316257/,1

However, a requirement of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement. While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals) or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high potential for individualization to patient’s or pathology’s specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively monitor the patient’s performance, and signal processing may contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects, mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice, and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care, where hospital-based procedures are complementarily integrated with telerehabilitative ones.

Neonatal patients needing intensive care are considered a vulnerable population. To report the results of a policy based on multi-timepoint surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 of all neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), their parents, and all healthcare providers in a part of Italy with a high prevalence of the infection. Observational study conducted from 21 February to 21 April 2020. Intervention consisted of (a) parental triage on arrival at the neonatal ward; (b) universal testing with nasopharyngeal swabs and blood testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; (c) use of continuous personal protective equipment at the NICU by parents and staff. A total of 6726 triage procedures were performed on 114 parents, and 954 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 226 individuals. Five (2.2%) asymptomatic individuals (2 parents and 3 healthcare providers) tested positive on nasopharyngeal swabs and were kept isolated for 14 days. Of 75 admitted newborn, no one tested positive on nasopharyngeal swabs or antibody tests. Three parents presented with fever or flu-like symptoms at triage; they tested negative on swabs. Conclusion: With universal screening of neonates, parents, and staff, there were no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the neonates admitted to a NICU in an area with a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2. Our experience could be usefully compared with other strategies with a view to developing future evidence-based guidelines for managing high-risk neonates in case of new epidemics.","Cavicchiolo, Maria Elena; Trevisanuto, Daniele; Lolli, Elisabetta; Mardegan, Veronica; Saieva, Anna Maria; Franchin, Elisa; Plebani, Mario; Donato, Daniele; Baraldi, Eugenio",Eur J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03765-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767137/,1
644182,Correction to: Mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of severe COVID-19,2021-08-23,"More than 4 million adults survive a stay in the intensive care unit each year, with many experiencing new or worsening physical disability, mental health problems, and/or cognitive impairments, known as the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Given the prevalence and magnitude of physical impairments after critical illness, many survivors, including those recovering from COVID-19, could benefit from physical therapist services after hospital discharge. However, due to the relatively recent recognition and characterization of PICS, there may be limited awareness and understanding of PICS among physical therapists practicing in home healthcare and community-based settings. This lack of awareness may lead to inappropriate and/or inadequate rehabilitation service provision. While this perspective article provides information relevant to all physical therapists, it is aimed toward those providing rehabilitation services outside of the acute and post-acute inpatient settings. This article reports the prevalence and clinical presentation of PICS and provides recommendations for physical examination and outcomes measures, plan of care, and intervention strategies. The importance of providing patient and family education, coordinating community resources including referring to other healthcare team members, and community-based rehabilitation service options is emphasized. Finally, this perspective article discusses current challenges for optimizing outcomes for people with PICS and suggests future directions for research and practice.","Smith, James M; Lee, Alan C; Zeleznik, Hallie; Coffey Scott, Jacqueline P; Fatima, Arooj; Needham, Dale M; Ohtake, Patricia J",Phys Ther,https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32280993/,1
645341,Evaluation of multiple test methods for the detection of the novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) during the New York City outbreak,2009-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Policy throughout the United Kingdom promotes involvement of patients and public members in research to benefit patient care and health outcomes. PRIME Centre Wales is a national research centre, developing and coordinating research about primary and emergency care which forms 90% of health service encounters. In this paper, we describe our approach to public involvement and engagement in PRIME Centre Wales (hereafter called PRIME), in particular: how this approach has developed; ways in which public members contribute to PRIME activity; the strengths and limitations of our approach, challenges and future opportunities. PRIME ensures work is relevant to service users, carers, the public and policy makers by incorporating comprehensive patient and public involvement in every phase of our work. APPROACH: PRIME has policies and processes to enable and promote successful public involvement and engagement across research activities. This ensures public perspectives and patient experiences are integrated throughout research development, implementation and dissemination and in managing and delivering PRIME strategy over a 10 year timescale. A public/patient group called SUPER is a key resource providing wide-ranging perspectives via email and face-to-face discussion. We collect information on processes and experiences to assess value and impact, to guide ongoing involvement and engagement. A funded post provides leadership and support to staff and to public/patient contributors to facilitate collaborations. DISCUSSION: A stable, well-resourced structure has provided the timescales to build strong relationships and embed diverse approaches to public involvement and engagement within PRIME. Researchers and public contributors have committed to collaborations, developed knowledge and skills and sustained relationships. Effective approaches incorporate values and actions which, when operating together, strengthen processes and outcomes of public involvement and engagement. CONCLUSION: Supportive context, motivation and time are necessary to foster values and practices that enable effective public involvement and engagement. PRIME has embedded public involvement and engagement across research activities and structures. Central is the public/patient group SUPER offering experience-based expertise to add value to the research cycle. This innovative model, aligned with best practice, enhances relevance and quality of primary and emergency care research to benefit patients and the general population.","Evans, Bridie Angela; Gallanders, John; Griffiths, Lesley; Harris-Mayes, Robert; James, Mari; Jones, Sian; Joseph-Williams, Natalie; Nettle, Mary; Rolph, Martin; Snooks, Helen; Wallace, Carolyn; Edwards, Adrian",International journal of population data science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644413/; https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v5i3.1363,1
645434,Epidemic Viral Pneumonia and Other Emerging Pathogens,2011-08-23,"Atopy is characterized by eosinophilic inflammation associated with recruitment of eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) progenitors. We have previously shown that Eo/B progenitor phenotypes are altered in cord blood (CB) in infants at high risk of atopy/asthma, and respond to maternal dietary intervention during pregnancy. As respiratory tract viral infections have been shown to induce wheeze in infancy, we investigated the relationship between CB progenitor function and phenotype and acute respiratory illness (ARI), specifically wheeze and fever. CB from 39 high‐risk infants was studied by flow cytometry for CD34(+) progenitor phenotype and by ex vivo Eo/B‐colony forming unit (CFU) responses to cytokine stimulation in relation to ARI in the first year of life. A consistent relationship was observed between increased numbers of granulocyte/macrophage (GM)‐colony‐stimulating factor (CSF)‐ and IL‐3‐responsive Eo/B‐CFU in CB and the frequency/characteristics of ARI during infancy. Comparable associations were found between ARI and CB IL‐3R(+) and GM‐CSFR(+)CD34(+) cell numbers. Conversely, a reciprocal decrease in the proportion of CB IL‐5R(+) cells was found in relation to the clinical outcomes. The elevation of IL‐3/GM‐CSF‐responsive Eo/B progenitors in high‐risk infants in relation to ARI outcomes suggests a mechanism for the increased severity of inflammatory responses in these subjects following viral infection.","Fernandes, Rochelle; Kusel, Merci; Cyr, Michael; Sehmi, Roma; Holt, Kathryn; Holt, Barbara; Kebadze, Tatiana; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Sly, Peter; Denburg, Judah A.; Holt, Patrick",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2007.00615.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18397408/,1

In addition to the different regional camel festivals in neighboring countries, Hafr Al-Batin has the biggest camel market in the entire Kingdom and hosts an annual camel festival. Thus, we conducted a detailed epidemiological, clinical and genomic study to ascertain common exposure and transmission patterns of all cases of MERS-CoV reported from Hafr Al-Batin. Analysis of previously reported genetic data indicated that at least two of the infected contacts could not have been directly infected from the index patient and alternate source should be considered. While camels appear as the likely source, other sources have not been ruled out.

The authors aim to highlight these by providing an overview of the regulatory approaches adopted during the onset of the pandemic, provide an assessment of observed trends, and offer some reflections and proposals to leverage learnings and opportunities from this current pandemic. Methods The authors collected and classified documents and informational materials relating to the regulatory environment around the development and management of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic. These have been sourced from official websites and press releases of health authorities and international bodies from selected markets across the globe and covers the period between January to July 2020. Additional information to support this study has been gathered through a literature review and analysis of related data available in the public domain and complemented with our own experience in the company. Findings Communication has been vital in addressing the impact of COVID-19. More than 1700 documents and informational materials have been gathered relating to health or regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of these 1705 documents, around 20% or 343 have been identified as regulatory agilities. These agile approaches have been classified into three major categories namely where health and regulatory authorities have: a) facilitated product management across the entire lifecycle, notably in expediting medical product use, ensuring the continuity of clinical trials, and addressing supply chain issues; b) strengthened international cooperation; and c) addressed regulatory burden with the adoption of electronic and digital tools. Implications While many of these regulatory measures have been introduced temporarily as a response to the COVID-19 crisis, there are opportunities to leverage learnings from these approaches in order to collectively achieve more efficient regulatory systems to mitigate and address the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and further future-proof the regulatory environment.","Bolislis, Winona Rei; De Lucia, Maria Lucia; Dolz, Felipe; Mo, Runyi; Nagaoka, Makoto; Rodriguez, Heraclio; Woon, MayLi; Yu, Wei; Kühler, Thomas C.",Clin Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353762/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291820305257?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.11.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291820305257,1

Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the role of MBL and ficolin-3 in the complement system activation and compared to pandemic Influenza A virus H1N1 subtype infection (H1N1pdm09) and control patients. A total of 27 lungs formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (10 from H1N1 group, 6 from the COVID-19 group, and 11 from the control group) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-IL-6, TNF-alfa, CD163, MBL e FCN3 antibodies. Genotyping of target polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene was performed by real-time PCR. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha presented higher tissue expression in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and control groups. The same results were observed for ICAM-1 tissue expression. Increased expression of the FCN3 was observed in the COVID-19 group and H1N1 group compared to the control group. The MBL tissue expression was higher in the COVID-19 group compared to H1N1 and control groups. The genotypes AA for rs180040 (G/A), GG for rs1800451 (G/A) and CC for rs5030737 (T/C) showed a higher prevalence in the COVID-19 group. The intense activation of the lectin pathway, with particular emphasis on the MBL pathway, together with endothelial dysfunction and a massive proinflammatory cytokines production, possibly lead to a worse outcome in patients infected with SARS-Cov-2.

Only sporadic data are available on the circulation of RVAs in equine populations in Europe. In this study, 65 diarrheic samples from foals under 4 months of age were collected in Belgium (n = 32), Germany (n = 17), Slovenia (n = 5), Sweden (n = 4), Hungary (n = 3), Italy (n = 2), France (n = 1) and The Netherlands (n = 1). Forty percent of these samples (n = 26) were found to be RVA positive by a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The viral load in 11 of these samples was sufficiently high to be (partially) genotyped. G3, G14 and P[12] were the main genotypes detected, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that they were closely related to contemporary equine RVA strains detected in Europe as well as in Brazil and South Africa. Regional variation was observed with only G14 and P[12] being detected in Germany, whereas mainly G3P[12] was encountered in Belgium. Surprisingly the only G14P[12] RVA strain detected in Belgium was also found to possess the very rare P[18] genotype, which has been described only once from equine RVA strain L338 detected in the UK in 1991. Despite the identification of this uncommon P[18] genotype, G3P[12] and G14P[12] RVA strains remained the most important genotypes in Europe during the study period. Based on this finding and the knowledge that G3P[12] and G14P[12] serotypes are partially cross-reactive it can be assumed that a vaccine based on an inactivated virus of the G3P[12] genotype is still relevant in the current European epidemiological situation, although the addition of a G14 strain would most likely be beneficial.","Matthijnssens, Jelle; Ons, Ellen; De Coster, Sarah; Conceição-Neto, Nádia; Gryspeerdt, Annick; Van Ranst, Marc; Raue, Rudiger",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515000280; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515000280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637313/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.01.011,1

Thus, the candidate compounds can be regarded as potential lead compounds against the wild-type virus and drug-resistant forms.","Novikov, Mikhail S.; Ivanova, Olga N.; Ivanov, Alexander V.; Ozerov, Alexander A.; Valuev-Elliston, Vladimir T.; Temburnikar, Kartik; Gurskaya, Galina V.; Kochetkov, Sergey N.; Pannecouque, Christophe; Balzarini, Jan; Seley-Radtke, Katherine L.",Bioorg Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2011.08.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21903401/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089611006596; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089611006596,1

653555,Early respiratory viral infections in infants with cystic fibrosis,2019-02-27,"Background Healthcare services were faced with unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown regulations. In order to analyse the influence of the pandemic on the healthcare of patients with chronic hepatitis C in Germany, we carried out a structured questionnaire among all centres participating in the German Hepatitis C-Registry (DHC-R). Methods 320 centres of the DHC-R were invited to participate in an online survey. Of these, 74 centres had included ≥ 5 patients in the last 12 months. Findings A fully answered questionnaire was sent back by 64 centres. Due to the lockdown regulations, 11 % of the centres had stopped their regular consultation between March and May 2020; 58 % had reduced the consultations and 32 % did not change the consultations. More than 50 % of the appointment cancellations were done by the patients. 52 % of the centres offered a new or additional telephone consultation and 17 % offered a new video consultation. Between March and May 2020, the number of patients newly treated with antivirals was markedly lower when compared with the same period in 2019. All centres had returned to their usual consultation procedures in July 2020. Almost 80 % indicated that there were no significant limitations in patient’s healthcare. However, 22 % of the centres stated that liver decompensation was diagnosed late and 9.4 % stated that diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was delayed. An adequate amount of personal protective equipment (including disinfectants) was available in 56 % of the centres. Official information by public healthcare authorities was considered sufficient by 63 % of the centres. Summary Diagnosis, therapy and monitoring of patients with chronic hepatitis C were impaired during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the majority of the centres did not see healthcare problems for these patients in the medium and long term. However, the fact that the diagnosis of liver decompensations with potential lethal consequences was delayed in a considerable number of patients causes major concern.","Hüppe, Dietrich; Niederau, Claus; Serfert, Yvonne; Hartmann, Heinz; Wedemeyer, Heiner",Z Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1291-8518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167051/,1

In this study, we aimed to describe the incubation period of COVID-19 globally and in the mainland of China. METHODS: The searched studies were published from December 1, 2019 to May 26, 2021 in CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, and Embase databases. A random-effect model was used to pool the mean incubation period. Meta-regression was used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Meanwhile, we collected 11 545 patients in the mainland of China outside Hubei from January 19, 2020 to September 21, 2020. The incubation period fitted with the Log-normal model by the coarseDataTools package. RESULTS: A total of 3235 articles were searched, 53 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.0 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6–6.5) globally, 6.5 days (95% CI 6.1–6.9) in the mainland of China, and 4.6 days (95% CI 4.1–5.1) outside the mainland of China (P = 0.006). The incubation period varied with age (P = 0.005). Meanwhile, in 11 545 patients, the mean incubation period was 7.1 days (95% CI 7.0–7.2), which was similar to the finding in our meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: For COVID-19, the mean incubation period was 6.0 days globally but near 7.0 days in the mainland of China, which will help identify the time of infection and make disease control decisions. Furthermore, attention should also be paid to the region- or age-specific incubation period.

657400,In Vivo Persistence of Human Rhinoviruses in Immunosuppressed Patients,2017-02-02,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of this include flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus, which cause millions of yearly infections around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the source of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of research aimed at determining methods to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective treatments. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system that can be used to visualize and identify cells infected with dengue virus or SARS-CoV-2. This system is based on viral protease activity that mediates cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein stably expressed in cells. We show the suitability of this system for live cell imaging, for visualization of single infected cells, and for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. With the integrated modular building blocks, this system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility. IMPORTANCE Reporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of virus-infected cells within a host cell population. Here, we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the GFP moiety translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue. This reporter system is not only an invaluable tool for the characterization of viral replication, but also for the discovery and development of antivirals that are urgently needed to halt the spread of these viruses.","Pahmeier, Felix; Neufeldt, Christopher J.; Cerikan, Berati; Prasad, Vibhu; Pape, Costantin; Laketa, Vibor; Ruggieri, Alessia; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Cortese, Mirko",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01715-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257477/,1

However, little is known about how social capital may influence health-protective behavior in the general population. This study examined whether each of the social capital dimensions (bonding, bridging, and linking) contributed to the intention to adopt any of the health-protective behaviors in an influenza pandemic. The data of this study were from the 2014 Taiwan Social Change Survey. A stratified, three-stage probability proportional-to-size sampling from across the nation, was conducted to select adults aged 20 years and older (N = 1,745). Bonding social capital was measured by the frequency of neighborly contact and support. Bridging social capital was measured based on association membership. Linking social capital was measured according to general government trust and trust in the government’s capacity to counter an influenza pandemic. Binary logistic regressions were used to assess the multivariate associations between social capital and behavioral intention. The study results indicate that social capital may influence the response to influenza pandemic. Specifically, the intention to receive a vaccine and to wash hands more frequently were associated with the linking dimension and the bonding dimension of social capital, while the intention to wear a face mask was associated with all forms of social capital. The findings of this study suggest that government credibility and interpersonal networks may play a crucial role in health-protective behavior. This study provides new insights into how to improve the effectiveness of influenza prevention campaigns.","Chuang, Ying-Chih; Huang, Ya-Li; Tseng, Kuo-Chien; Yen, Chia-Hsin; Yang, Lin-hui",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25874625/,1

Accurate determination of the dimer dissociation constant and the role of the N-finger (residues 1–7) will provide more insights into the enzyme catalytic mechanism of SARS 3CL proteinase. The dimer dissociation constant of the wild-type protein was determined to be 14.0 μM by analytical ultracentrifugation method. The N-finger fragment of the enzyme plays an important role in enzyme dimerization as shown in the crystal structure. Key residues in the N-finger have been studied by site-directed mutagenesis, enzyme assay, and analytical ultracentrifugation. A single mutation of M6A was found to be critical to maintain the dimer structure of the enzyme. The N-terminal octapeptide N8 and its mutants were also synthesized and tested for their potency as dimerization inhibitors. Peptide cleavage assay confirms that peptide N8 is a dimerization inhibitor with a K(i) of 2.20 mM. The comparison of the inhibitory activities of N8 and its mutants indicates that the hydrophobic interaction of Met-6 and the electrostatic interaction of Arg-4 contribute most for inhibitor binding. This study describes the first example of inhibitors targeting the dimeric interface of SARS 3CL proteinase, providing a novel strategy for drug design against SARS and other coronaviruses.","Wei, Ping; Fan, Keqiang; Chen, Hao; Ma, Liang; Huang, Changkang; Tan, Lei; Xi, Dong; Li, Chunmei; Liu, Ying; Cao, Aoneng; Lai, Luhua",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X05026331; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X05026331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16329994/,1

Many factors impact on the rate vaccination and parents’ health behaviours may affect the frequency of vaccinations. The aim of the study was to assess the association of parents’ health behaviors with children’s vaccinations. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July 2015 to June 2016 to assess to assess the association of parents’ health behaviors with children’s vaccinations in Białystok city, Poland. We used the the Inventory of Health Behaviours and an original questionnaire including demographic data and questions about vaccination. Three hundred parents were recruited from the Pro Medica Family Medica Center in Bialystok, Poland. RESULTS: Only 3.7% of respondents did not vaccinate their children. The level of health behaviours was average in 42.3% of the respondents, low in 33%, and high in 24.7%. Significant differences in health behaviours, mainly the level of normal eating habits (p = 0.038) and positive mental attitude (p = 0.022), were found in relation to views on the toxicity of vaccines. Participants who reported that vaccines can cause autism engaged in a higher level of prophylactic behaviours. Respondents who vaccinated their children with combined vaccines had a significantly higher level of health practices. CONCLUSIONS: Parents preferred health behaviours did not effect on children vaccination. Parents who believed in the toxicity of vaccines were more concerned about proper nutrition, had a positive mental attitude, and engaged in a higher level of preventive behaviours and health practices. Parents who did not vaccinate their children had lower levels of normal eating habits.

In reality, the epidemic progressing in a particular country depends largely on its policy responses and interventions. Since the outbreaks in some countries are earlier than United States, the prediction of US cases can benefit from incorporating the similarity in their trajectories. We propose an empirical Bayesian time series framework to predict US cases using different countries as prior reference. The resultant forecast is based on observed US data and prior information from the reference country while accounting for different population sizes. When Italy is used as prior in the prediction, which the US data resemble the most, the cases in the US will exceed 300,000 by the beginning of April unless strong measures are adopted.","Liu, Ziyue; Guo, Wensheng",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20044578,1

Adverse outcome after cardiac surgery has been observed in the presence of elevated levels of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP). The aim of study was (i) to investigate the relationship between preoperative elevated levels of suPAR and hsCRP and postoperative AKI in unselected cardiac surgery patients and (ii) to assess whether the concentration of the biomarkers reflected severity of AKI. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, biobank blood plasma samples (n = 924) from patients admitted for elective on-pump cardiac surgery were analysed for suPAR and hsCRP levels. The relation between suPAR and hsCRP-values and AKI (any stage), defined by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria, was assessed using adjusted logistic regression. Further, the association between biomarkers and severity (KDIGO 1, KDIGO 2–3 and renal replacement therapy (RRT)) was assessed using adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: Postoperative AKI (any stage) was observed in 327 patients (35.4 %). A doubling of preoperative suPAR corresponded to an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for postoperative AKI (any stage) of 1.62 (95 % CI 1.26–2.09, p < 0.001). Furthermore, a doubling of suPAR had an adjusted OR of 1.50 (95 % CI 1.16–1.93, p = 0.002), 2.44 (95 % CI 1.56–3.82, p < 0.001) and 1.92 (95 % CI 1.15–3.23, p = 0.002), for KDIGO 1, KDIGO 2–3 and need for RRT, respectively. No significant association was found between elevated levels of hsCRP and any degree of AKI.

We did a review of the files of these two patients who were admitted to the internal medicine ward of a medical Centre in Maroua Town, Far North Region. We present 2 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, both males and health personnel, with an average age of 53 years, with no recent history of travel to a COVID-19 zone at risk and working in a then COVID-19 free region. They presented with extreme fatigue as their main symptom. Both were treated initially for severe malaria with quinine sulfate infusion with initial relief of symptoms. In the first confirmed case, at his re-hospitalization with an acute respiratory syndrome, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in search of SARS-CoV-2 was requested with his results available 7 days into admission. For the second case, he had his results 48 hours on admission while he was prepared to be discharged. Both control PCR tests for COVID-19 came back negative 14 days after hospitalization. Health personnel remains a group at risk for the COVID-19 infection. The clinical manifestation at an early stage may be atypical mimicking endemic tropical infections.

664501,"ACE2, a Promising Therapeutic Target for Pulmonary Hypertension",2011-04-01,"Abstract We evaluated farmworkers exposed to pesticides and individuals with no history of occupational exposure to pesticides. It was performed the comet assay to evaluate DNA damage. The immunophenotyping of TCD4+ lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood was performed by flow cytometry. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PON1, XRCC1, IL6, IL6R, TNF-α, and MIR137 genes were evaluated by real-time PCR. The exposed group was composed mostly by males (69.44%), with direct exposure to pesticides (56%) and with an average age range of 46 ± 13.89 years, being that 58.3% of farmworkers directly exposed to pesticides and reported the full use of personal protective equipment (PPE). DNA damage was greater in the exposed group (p < 0.05), reinforced by the use of PPE to denote a lower degree of DNA damage (p = 0.002). In this context, in the exposed group, we demonstrated that the use of PPE, age, gender and intoxication events were the variables that most contributed to increase DNA damage (p < 0.0001). Besides, the exposed group showed a significant increase in the subpopulations of T lymphocytes CD3+ CD4+ (p = 0.04) and CD3+ CD4+ CD25+ (p < 0.0001). SNPs in the TNF-α (rs361525) gene presented a difference in the genotype distribution between the groups (p = 0.002). The genotype distribution of TNF-α (rs361525) was also positively correlated with the DNA damage of the exposed group (r = 0.19; p = 0.01), demonstrating a higher risk of DNA damage in the farmworkers presenting the A mutated allele. Our findings demonstrate that pesticides can exert various deleterious effects on human health by damaging the DNA as well as by influencing the immune system in the case of both direct or indirect exposure and these issues are associated to age, gender, intoxication and the nonuse of PPE.","Ramos, Jheneffer Sonara Aguiar; Pedroso, Thays Millena Alves; Godoy, Fernanda Ribeiro; Batista, Renata Elisa; de Almeida, Frankcione Borges; Francelin, Carolina; Ribeiro, Francis Lee; Rocha-Parise, Michelle; de Melo e Silva, Daniela",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920385/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972035422X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972035422X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141893,1

Two recently developed conceptual models – the American CQO Movement and the European MEAT VBP Framework – have been developed to support the implementation of value-based procurement in healthcare. We demonstrate how the latter of these models can be adapted and applied pragmatically to generate insights into the value of a specific medical device, technology or consumable. METHODS: We undertook an explanatory, qualitative, single-case study focused on a specific consumable – surgical gloves – that provide a critical example of a type of medical device usually procured in high volumes but at risk of commoditisation due to a widespread lack of understanding of their value. Since the global Covid-19 pandemic prevented fieldwork, structured interviews were conducted via Zoom and corroborated by a literature review. RESULTS: We identified ten cost criteria and eight outcome criteria with which the value of surgical gloves can be analysed and understood. For each of these criteria we propose definitions and value impact metrics that decision-makers can use during a procurement exercise to describe, quantify and compare glove value. CONCLUSION: The MEAT VBP Framework provides a highly practical and adaptable means of imposing both structure and rigour on a value analysis process and of qualitatively describing the potential value impact of surgical gloves for patients, professionals, providers and health systems.","Stanberry, Benedict; Bothma, Gerhard; Harrison, Katie",Health Econ Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228279/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13561-021-00325-z,1

The critical binding region of ACE2 is an ∼30-amino-acid (aa)-long helix. Here, we report the design of four stapled peptides based on the ACE2 helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50 to 94% helicity). In contrast, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus-based single-cycle assay in HT1080/ACE2 cells and human lung cell line A549/ACE2, overexpressing ACE2. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080/ACE2 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)]: 1.9 to 4.1 μM) and A549/ACE2 (IC(50): 2.2 to 2.8 μM) cells. The linear peptide NYBSP-C and the double-stapled peptide StRIP16, used as controls, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of the peptides by infecting Vero E6 cells with the replication-competent authentic SARS-CoV-2 (US_WA-1/2020). NYBSP-1 was the most efficient, preventing the complete formation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) at an IC(100) of 17.2 μM. NYBSP-2 and NYBSP-4 also prevented the formation of the virus-induced CPE with an IC(100) of about 33 μM. We determined the proteolytic stability of one of the most active stapled peptides, NYBSP-4, in human plasma, which showed a half-life (T(1/2)) of >289 min.","Curreli, Francesca; Victor, Sofia M.

Here, we report the postmortem lung findings from a 37-year-old asthmatic man, who met the clinical criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and died of COVID-19 less than two weeks after presentation to the hospital. His lungs showed mucus plugging and other histologic changes attributable to asthma, as well as early diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and a fibrinous pneumonia. The presence of DAD is similar to descriptions of autopsy lung findings from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and the absence of a neutrophil-rich acute bronchopneumonia differs from the histologic changes typical of influenza.

In absence of any definite antiviral agent availability and therapeutic armamentarium, vaccines are considered critical. While 20 vaccines are in use, about 295 vaccines are underdevelopment globally using eleven technological platforms. While the vaccines have >80% efficacy, the ultracold (-70°C and -20°C) storage and logistics requirements for some raise concerns for implementation, especially in developing countries. The Ebola vaccination in African countries, which required an ultracold chain provided lessons for these COVID-19 vaccines. The existing vaccine cold chain system suffers from temperature excursions at cold chain stores and during transportations in different countries suggests careful assessment and addressing the gaps for effective vaccine introduction. Appropriate attention for cold chain storage, logistics (especially the last mile), and vaccine management and upgradation is needed to achieve optimal vaccine effectiveness for curtailing the pandemic.","Das, Manoja Kumar",Indian journal of public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34558497/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_1353_20,1

Here, we report the result of the surveillance activity in a general hospital in Saudi Arabia over a four year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All admitted patients with community acquired pneumonia from 2012 to 2016 were tested for MERS-CoV. In addition, testing for influenza viruses was carried out starting April 2015. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 2657 patients were screened for MERS-CoV and only 20 (0.74%) tested positive. From January 2015 to December 2016, a total of 1644 patients were tested for both MERS-CoV and influenza. None of the patients tested positive for MERS-CoV and 271 (16.4%) were positive for influenza. The detected influenza viruses were Influenza A (107, 6.5%), pandemic 2009 H1N1 (n = 120, 7.3%), and Influenza B (n = 44, 2.7%). Pandemic H1N1 was the most common influenza in 2015 with a peak in peaked October to December and influenza A other than H1N1 was more common in 2016 with a peak in August and then October to December. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV was a rare cause of community acquired pneumonia and other viral causes including influenza were much more common. Thus, admitted patients are potentially manageable with Oseltamivir or Zanamivir therapy.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.; Rabaan, Ali A.; Hinedi, Kareem",Travel Med Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.10.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147789391730159X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147789391730159X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031867/,1

Tests must include fail-safe controls that affirmatively report the presence of intact RNA and demonstrate success of all steps of the assay. A result of “no virus signal” is insufficient for clinical interpretation: controls must also say “The reaction worked as intended and would have found virus if present.” Unfortunately, a widely used test specified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incorporates a control that does not perform as intended and claimed. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 with this assay requires both intact RNA and successful reverse transcription. The CDC-specified control does not require either of these, due to its inability to differentiate human genomic DNA from reverse-transcribed RNA. Patient DNA is copurified from nasopharyngeal swabs during clinically-approved RNA extraction and is sufficient to return an “extraction control success” signal using the CDC design. As such, this assay fails-unsafe: truly positive patient samples return a false-negative result of “no virus detected, control succeeded” following any of several readily-encountered mishaps. This problem affects tens-of-millions of patients worth of shipped assays, but many of these flawed reagents have not yet been used. There is an opportunity to improve this important diagnostic tool. As demonstrated here, a re-designed transcript-specific control correctly monitors sample collection, extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR detection. This approach can be rapidly implemented and will help reduce truly positive patients from being incorrectly given the all-clear.

673042,Kawasaki disease patients homozygous for the rs12252-C variant of interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 are significantly more likely to develop coronary artery lesions,2014-05-14,"Angiopoietins Ang1 and Ang2 are secreted ligands for the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 essential for vascular development and maintenance. Ang1 acts as an agonist to maintain normal vessel function, whereas Ang2 acts as a Tie2 antagonist. Ang2 is increased in macular edema, sepsis, and other conditions, in which it blocks Ang1-mediated signaling, causing vascular dysfunction and contributing to disease pathology. Therefore, Ang2 is an attractive therapeutic target. Previously, we reported a Tie2 ectodomain variant that selectively binds Ang2 and acts as soluble ligand trap to sequester Ang2; however, the mechanism of Ang2-binding selectivity is unknown. In the present study, we used directed protein evolution to enhance Ang2-binding affinity of this Tie2 ectodomain trap. We examined contributions of individual residues in the ligand-binding interface of Tie2 to Ang1 and Ang2 binding. Surprisingly, different combinations of Tie2 residues were found to bind each ligand, with hydrophobic residues binding both ligands and polar residues contributing selectively to either Ang1 or Ang2 binding. Our analysis also identified a single Tie2 residue, His168, with a pivotal role in both Ang1 and Ang2 binding, enabling competition between binding ligands. In summary, this study reports an enhanced-affinity Ang2-selective ligand trap with potential for therapeutic development and reveals the mechanism behind its selectivity. It also provides the first analysis of contributions of individual Tie2 residues to Ang1 and Ang2 binding and identifies selectivity-determining residues that could be targeted in the future design of small molecule and other inhibitors of Ang2 for the treatment of vascular dysfunction.","Bate, Neil; Lodge, James; Brindle, Nicholas P.J.",J Biol Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34153320/,1

Its rapid transmission, unpredicted mortality rate, and the uncertainty surrounding its transmission method have evoked additional fear and anxiety. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has explored PTSD prevalence three months after the start of the quarantine procedures in Saudi Arabia nor has examined PTSD prevalence by three different methods. OBJECTIVE: This observational cross-sectional study aimed to identify the prevalence, severity, and influencing factors of PTSD in different regions of Saudi Arabia three months after the onset of the quarantine procedures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Through the month of June 2020, 1374 people (49.05% men and 50.95% women) completed a 35-item, 10-minute online. The prevalence of PTSD was measured using PCL-S (specific for COVID-19) that assesses the 17 symptoms of PTSD. Resilience was measured using 2-items Arabic version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 2 (CD-RISC 2). RESULTS: We calculated the prevalence by three methods, namely, PTSD cut-off score, criteria, and combined, and the prevalence was 22.63%, 24.8%, and 19.6%, respectively. Female participants showed higher prevalence than male. As well, participants who were either tested positive or suspected of having been infected with COVID-19 showed higher PTSD prevalence. Higher resilience was associated with lower PTSD prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to report PTSD prevalence by three differential methods three months after the onset of the quarantine procedures related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. We observed a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Saudi population; therefore, great attention should be performed in implementing new procedures that deal with the highlighted risk factors, especially in vulnerable groups, to overcome the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alshehri, Fahad S.; Alatawi, Yasser; Alghamdi, Badrah S.; Alhifany, Abdullah A.; Alharbi, Adnan",Saudi Pharm J,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2020.10.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319016420302486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424259/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319016420302486,1

It includes heterogeneity in productivity, age and the ability to work from home. Worker and firm behavior changes in the presence of the virus, which itself has equilibrium consequences for the infection rate. The model is calibrated to the UK and counterfactual lockdown measures are evaluated. We find a different response in both the evolution of the virus and the labor market with different lockdown policies. A laissez-faire approach results in lives lost and acts as negative shock to the economy. A lockdown policy, absent any other intervention, will reduce the lives lost but increase the economic burden. Consistent with recent evidence, we find that the economic costs from lockdown are most felt by those earning the least. Finally, we introduce a job retention scheme as implemented by the UK Government and find that it spreads the economic hardship more equitably.","Bradley, Jake; Ruggieri, Alessandro; Spencer, Adam Hal",Eur Econ Rev,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292121001653; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2021.103828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518708/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014292121001653,1

The platelet count reflects the thrombocyte turnover, acting as a sensitive indicator of illness severity that is of great clinical utility to monitor a quickly changing health condition of patients affected by aggressive viral infections. This study aims to investigate the significance of platelet count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 532 COVID-19 patients were involved in the cohort study from the First People’s Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan from January 7, 2020, to February 28, 2020. We collected the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of patients. Patients still hospitalized before February 29, 2020, died on admission, with malignant tumors, previous gastrointestinal surgery, missing baseline platelet count, or platelet count detected only once, were excluded. We used a generalized additive model and generalized additive mixed model to compare trends in platelet count over time among survivors and non-survivors, with an adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: During the follow-up, twenty-nine subjects died (mortality rate, 5.45%). The platelets among non-survivors decreased and among survivors increased gradually within 1 week after admission. In addition, the difference between the two groups showed an increasing trend during 1 week after admission. This difference increased by an average of 5.3 × 10^9/L daily. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage, platelet count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. Early decrease in platelet count was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19. Causality, however, cannot be deduced from our data.","Zhao, Xiaofang; Wang, Kun; Zuo, Peiyuan; Liu, Yuwei; Zhang, Meng; Xie, Songpu; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Xinglin; Liu, Chengyun",EPMA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419876/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00208-z,1

Study design: Longitudinal ecological study. Setting: 460 Care home units using the same software package to collect data on residents, from 46 local authority areas in England. Participants: 6,464 care home residents with at least one NEWS recording. Exposure measure: 29,656 anonymised person-level NEWS from 29/12/2019 to 20/05/2020 with component physiological measures: systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation. Baseline values for each measure calculated using 80th and 20th centile scores before March 2020. Outcome measure: Time series comparison with Office for National Statistics (ONS) weekly reported registered deaths of care home residents where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, and all other deaths (excluding COVID-19) up to 10/05/2020. Results: Deaths due to COVID-19 were registered from 23/03/2020 in the study geographical areas. Between 23/03/2020 and 10/05/2020, there were 5,753 deaths (1,532 involving COVID-19 and 4,221 other causes). The proportion of above-baseline NEWS increased from 16/03/2020 and closely followed the rise and fall in COVID-19 deaths over the study period. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately two weeks before peaks in care home deaths in corresponding geographical areas. Conclusions: NEWS may make a useful contribution to disease surveillance in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents' health.

The infectivity titer was the highest when the plates were centrifuged at 400 × g (1500 rpm) for 2 h. All five strains classified as FIPV Type I showed infectivity titers enhanced 10–100-fold by centrifugation at 400 × g for 2 h. The centrifugal enhancement of infection was obtained only by centrifugation immediately after inoculation of the virus, suggesting that the enhancement occurs during attachment or adsorption of viruses to the cells. This method may be useful for the culture of FIPV Type I strains.","Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Tatekawa, Takahiro; Koyama, Hiroyuki",Journal of Virological Methods,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166093494001192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7738156/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0166093494001192,1
678019,Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States,2020-02-11,"The COVID-19 lockdown has significantly disrupted the higher education environment within the Netherlands and led to changes in available study-related resources and study demands of students. These changes in study resources and study demands, the uncertainty and confusion about educational activities, the developing fear and anxiety about the disease, and the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown measures may have a significant impact on the mental health of students. As such, this study aimed to investigate the trajectory patterns, rate of change, and longitudinal associations between study resources–demands and mental health of 141 university students from the Netherlands before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The present study employed a longitudinal design and a piecewise latent growth modeling strategy to investigate the changes in study resources and mental health over a 3 month period. The results showed that moderate levels of student resources significantly decreased before, followed by a substantial rate of increase during, lockdown. In contrast, study demands and mental health were reported to be moderate and stable throughout the study. Finally, the growth trajectories of study resources–demands and mental health were only associated before the lockdown procedures were implemented. Despite growing concerns relating to the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 on students, our study shows that the mental health during the initial COVID-19 lockdown remained relatively unchanged.","van Zyl, Llewellyn E.; Rothmann, Sebastiaan; Zondervan-Zwijnenburg, Maria A.

The use of advanced therapies in the form of durable left ventricular assist device or heart transplant in this patient population remains a data free zone. We present, to our knowledge, the first case of durable LVAD implantation in a recovered COVID-19 patient. Case Report A 63-year old, previously healthy, male was admitted to OSH with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. This hospitalization was complicated by anterior STEMI, cardiomyopathy with severe LV dysfunction and cardiogenic shock. Due to widespread COVID-19 pandemic, invasive evaluation was deferred and the patient was medically managed. He was then transferred to our institution after re-admission for recurrent cardiogenic shock. Echocardiogram revealed dilated LV cavity (6.3 cm), LVEF 10% and large apical aneurysm. Chest CT showed sequelae of prior COVID-19 with changes suggestive of fibrosis. CMR which showed LV dilatation, severe LV systolic dysfunction, LVEF 7% and large apical aneurysm with evidence of thrombus. A large transmural infarct in the LAD territory without viability was confirmed. Cardiogenic shock was managed with Dobutamine and attempts to wean inotrope resulted in worsening hemodynamic and clinical profile. Axillary IABP was placed to facilitate physical and respiratory rehabilitation. The patient underwent placement of HeartMate™ 3 device as DT and LV aneurysm repair. Post-operative course was uneventful and he was ultimately discharged to acute rehabilitation in stable condition. Summary As the global case rate continues to climb and the threat of an exponential surge of long-term cardiac complications looms in the not so distant future, the use of durable MCS in recovered COVID-19 patients may evolve. This case highlights LVAD as a feasible option in end-stage HF and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in assessing candidacy for advanced HF therapies in post-COVID-19 patients. Continued international collaboration and further study regarding use of MCS will be paramount in optimizing care and outcomes in this growing patient population.","Ignaszewski, M.; Pandrangi, K.; Kabbany, M.; Wilcox, J.

In this context, a combination of Cloud and IoT architectures is often exploited to make smart healthcare systems capable of supporting near realtime applications when processing and performing Artificial Intelligence on the huge amount of data produced by wearable sensor networks. Anyway, the response time and the availability of cloud based systems, together with security and privacy, still represent critical issues that prevents Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and architectures from being a reliable and effective solution to the aim. Lately, there is a growing interest towards architectures and approaches that exploit Edge and Fog computing as an answer to compensate the weaknesses of the cloud.

A county-level social vulnerability index was created using principal component analysis. Social vulnerability components were regressed against both county case and mortality rates. Results suggest that hotspots of case and mortality rates are clustered in Midwest and Upper-Midwest US. We found substantial disparities in case and mortality rates between urban and rural counties. County social vulnerability was positively correlated with both case and mortality rates suggesting counties with higher social vulnerability had higher case and mortality rates. Relationships between social vulnerability components and case and mortality rates vary across the conterminous US. Additionally, counties with increased racial and ethnic minorities, higher percentages of minors, and lower median household income are associated with higher COVID-19 case and mortality rates.","Rifat, Shaikh Abdullah Al; Liu, Weibo",Int J Environ Health Res,https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2021.1979196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34554860/,1

In this Review, we discuss the hepatotropism of SARS-CoV-2, including the differential expression of viral receptors on liver cell types, and we describe the liver histology features present in patients with COVID-19. We also provide an overview of the pattern and relevance of abnormal liver biochemistry during COVID-19 and present the possible underlying direct and indirect mechanisms for liver injury. Furthermore, large international cohorts have been able to characterize the disease course of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis have particularly high rates of hepatic decompensation and death following SARS-CoV-2 infection and we outline hypotheses to explain these findings, including the possible role of cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction. This finding contrasts with outcome data in pharmacologically immunosuppressed patients after liver transplantation who seem to have comparatively better outcomes from COVID-19 than those with advanced liver disease. Finally, we discuss the approach to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with cirrhosis and after liver transplantation and predict how changes in social behaviours and clinical care pathways during the pandemic might lead to increased liver disease incidence and severity.","Marjot, Thomas; Webb, Gwilym J.; Barritt, Alfred S.; Moon, Andrew M.; Stamataki, Zania; Wong, Vincent W.; Barnes, Eleanor",Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692570/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41575-021-00426-4,1

Over the last 2 years, there have been mounting challenges in the ability to provide FMT to pediatric patients. Firstly, an Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety alert in 2019 reported transmission of a multidrug resistant organism from FMT donor to recipient resulting in the death of 1 patient. Secondly, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced further safety and regulatory challenges. Biotherapeutics are promising and more readily regulated treatment options for rCDI, which may replace FMT in the near future for adults upon regulatory agency approvals. Such approvals, however, are expected to be significantly delayed for children, raising concerns for limited access to effective treatment for children with rCDI. In this commentary, we discuss the recent challenges and future directions of FMT and microbial therapeutics in children with rCDI.","Hourigan, Suchitra K; Nicholson, Maribeth R; Kahn, Stacy A; Kellermayer, Richard",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238831/; https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000003229,1

The most commonly used models to predict the spread of Covid-19 are SEIR models which lack the spatial resolution necessary to answer this question. We develop an agent-based model of social interactions in which the distribution of agents across wards, as well as their travel and interactions are calibrated to real data for Cape Town, South Africa. We characterize the elasticity of various policy interventions including increased likelihood to self-isolate, travel restrictions, assembly bans, and behavioural interventions like washing hands or wearing masks. Even in an informal setting, where agents' ability to self-isolate is compromised, a lockdown remains an effective intervention. In our model, the lockdown enacted in South Africa reduced expected fatalities in Cape Town by 26% and the expected demand for intensive care beds by 46%. However, our best calibration predicts a substantially higher case load, demand for ICU beds, and expected number of deaths than the current best estimate published for Cape Town.","Davids, A.; Rand, G.

Objectives: To report the use of prolonged active prone positioning in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure. Spontaneously breathing vs non-invasive respiratory support for COVID19 associated acute respiratory failure. Methods: Patients with PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 150, with lung posterior consolidations as assessed by means of lung ultrasound, and chest x-ray were studied. Under continuous pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) monitoring, patients maintained active prone position. A PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150 was considered as treatment failure and patients had to be switched to non-invasive respiratory support. Retrospectively, data of 16 patients undergoing who refused proning and underwent non-invasive respiratory support were used as controls. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients maintaining prolonged prone position and discharged home. Secondary outcomes included improvement in oxygenation, hospital length of stay, and 6-month survival. Results: Three out of 16 (18.7%) patients did not tolerate the procedure. Three more patients showed a worsening in PaO(2)/FiO(2) to <150 and required non-invasive support, two of whom finally needing endotracheal intubation. After 72 h, 10 out of 16 (62.5%) patients improved oxygenation [PaO(2)/FiO(2): from 194.6 (42.1) to 304.7 (79.3.2) (p < 0.001)] and were discharged home. In the control group, three out of 16 failed, required invasive ventilatory support, and died within 1 month in ICU. Thirteen were successful and discharged home.

We aimed to develop a dynamic COVID-19 microsimulation model to assess clinical and economic outcomes and cost-effectiveness of epidemic control strategies in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. METHODS: We compared different combinations of five public health interventions: health-care testing alone, where diagnostic testing is done only for individuals presenting to health-care centres; contact tracing in households of cases; isolation centres, for cases not requiring hospital admission; mass symptom screening and molecular testing for symptomatic individuals by community health-care workers; and quarantine centres, for household contacts who test negative. We calibrated infection transmission rates to match effective reproduction number (R(e)) estimates reported in South Africa. We assessed two main epidemic scenarios for a period of 360 days, with an R(e) of 1·5 and 1·2. Strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than US$3250 per year of life saved were considered cost-effective. We also did sensitivity analyses by varying key parameters (R(e) values, molecular testing sensitivity, and efficacies and costs of interventions) to determine the effect on clinical and cost projections. FINDINGS: When R(e) was 1·5, health-care testing alone resulted in the highest number of COVID-19 deaths during the 360-day period. Compared with health-care testing alone, a combination of health-care testing, contact tracing, use of isolation centres, mass symptom screening, and use of quarantine centres reduced mortality by 94%, increased health-care costs by 33%, and was cost-effective (ICER $340 per year of life saved). In settings where quarantine centres were not feasible, a combination of health-care testing, contact tracing, use of isolation centres, and mass symptom screening was cost-effective compared with health-care testing alone (ICER $590 per year of life saved). When R(e) was 1·2, health-care testing, contact tracing, use of isolation centres, and use of quarantine centres was the least costly strategy, and no other strategies were cost-effective. In sensitivity analyses, a combination of health-care testing, contact tracing, use of isolation centres, mass symptom screening, and use of quarantine centres was generally cost-effective, with the exception of scenarios in which R(e) was 2·6 and when efficacies of isolation centres and quarantine centres for transmission reduction were reduced. INTERPRETATION: In South Africa, strategies involving household contact tracing, isolation, mass symptom screening, and quarantining household contacts who test negative would substantially reduce COVID-19 mortality and would be cost-effective. The optimal combination of interventions depends on epidemic growth characteristics and practical implementation considerations.

688020,Role of neutrophils in acute viral infection,2021,"Background Evolution within spine surgery is driven by a surgeon’s desire for expertise and significant improvement in their patients’ quality of life. As surgeons move away from using subjective patient-reported outcome (PRO) surveys, there must be an alternative objective metric in its place. Modern iPhone (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) technology can be used to capture daily activity in a simple, non-user biased manner. These health data can be used to analyze objective functional status in conjunction with PRO surveys to measure surgical outcomes. Methods Patients who underwent an awake transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) between 2014 and 2018 at our institution were identified. Patients were consented and instructed to download the application “QS Access” (Quantified Self Labs, San Francisco, CA). Following data collection, we analyzed the demographic information of patients who were reached to gauge participation and feasibility of data exportation. Results A total of 177 patients who underwent an awake TLIF at our institution were contacted. Of those who answered, 41 (44.6%) agreed to participate and 51 (55.4%) declined to participate. When comparing those who either participated or declined, there were no significant differences in age (p=0.145), sex (p=0.589), or ethnicity (p=0.686). Conclusion Our pilot study examined the patient participation in the novel usage of Apple ""Health"" data, queried from ""QS Access"" (Quantified Self Labs), to objectively measure relative patient functional status surrounding spinal fusion.

These three factors are known to exert predictable influence on people’s risk overgeneralization, policy preference, and sociopolitical attitudes. We provide a succinct, illustrative review of empirical work on these dynamics in times of a disease outbreak (e.g., the 2009 H1N1 swine flu, the 2014 Ebola). Theoretical and applied implications for the present COVID-19 pandemic include the value of salience in motivating public opinion change, the importance of reducing unfamiliarity for curbing risk-averse tendencies, and the need for policies that guard against xenophobia-driven racism in collaborative efforts.","Lee, Spike W.

We compared the performance of four of these assays that were evaluated for use at our institution: Abbott RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay, DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID NOW COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens were collected from 88 ED and hospital-admitted patients and tested by the four methods in parallel to compare performance. ID NOW performance stood out as significantly worse than the other three assays despite demonstrating comparable analytic sensitivity. Further study determined that the use of a nasal swab compared to a nylon flocked nasopharyngeal swab, as well as use in a population chronically vs. acutely positive for SARS-CoV-2, were substantial factors.","Lephart, Paul R.; Bachman, Michael A.; LeBar, William; McClellan, Scott; Barron, Karen; Schroeder, Lee; Newton, Duane W.",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889320305770; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115200; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889320305770?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32980807/,1
