857,Porcine Noroviruses Related to Human Noroviruses,2005-12-11,"Detection of genogroup II (GII) norovirus (NoV) RNA from adult pigs in Japan and Europe and GII NoV antibodies in US swine raises public health concerns about zoonotic transmission of porcine NoVs to humans, although no NoVs have been detected in US swine. To detect porcine NoVs and to investigate their genetic diversity and relatedness to human NoVs, 275 fecal samples from normal US adult swine were screened by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction with calicivirus universal primers. Six samples were positive for NoV. Based on sequence analysis of 3 kb on the 3´ end of 5 porcine NoVs, 3 genotypes in GII and a potential recombinant were identified. One genotype of porcine NoVs was genetically and antigenically related to human NoVs and replicated in gnotobiotic pigs. These results raise concerns of whether subclinically infected adult swine may be reservoirs of new human NoVs or if porcine/human GII recombinants could emerge.","Wang, Qiu-Hong; Han, Myung Guk; Cheetham, Sonia; Souza, Menira; Funk, Julie A.; Saif, Linda J.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367634/,109

The transmission of an exogenous retrovirus, SFV, from macaques (Macaca fascicularis) to a human at a monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia, was investigated with molecular and serologic techniques. Antibodies to SFV were detected by Western blotting of serum from 1 of 82 humans tested. SFV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the blood of the same person. Cloning and sequencing of PCR products confirmed the virus's close phylogenetic relationship to SFV isolated from macaques at the same temple. This study raises concerns that persons who work at or live around monkey temples are at risk for infection with SFV.","Jones-Engel, Lisa; Engel, Gregory A.; Schillaci, Michael A.; Rompis, Aida; Putra, Artha; Suaryana, Komang Gde; Fuentes, Agustin; Beer, Brigitte; Hicks, Sarah; White, Robert; Wilson, Brenda; Allan, Jonathan S.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371821/,109

Of the 151 pools analyzed, 17 tested positive for Zika virus RNA; infectious Zika virus was successfully isolated from 1 of the larvae pools (31N) in C6/36 cells. Real-time quantitative PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assays confirmed the identity of the isolate, named Zika virus isolate 31N; plaque assays in Vero cells demonstrated the isolate’s infectivity in a mammalian cell line. We obtained the complete genome of Zika virus isolate 31N by next-generation sequencing and identified 3 single-nucleotide variants specific to Zika virus isolate 31N using the meta-CATS tool.

7394,Ribavirin Reduces Mortality in Enterovirus 71–Infected Mice by Decreasing Viral Replication,2008-03-15,"The primary intracellular protein degradation systems, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosome pathways, have been emerging as central regulators of viral infectivity, inflammation, and viral pathogenicity. Viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium caused by virus infection in the heart. The disease progression of viral myocarditis occurs in three distinct stages: acute viral infection, immune cell infiltration, and cardiac remodelling. Growing evidence suggests a crucial role for host proteolytic machineries in the regulation of the pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis in all three stages. Cardiotropic viruses evolve different strategies to subvert host protein degradation systems to achieve successful viral replication. In addition, these proteolytic systems play important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection. Recent evidence also suggests a key role for the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems as the primary effectors of protein quality control in the regulation of cardiac remodelling. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the direct interaction between cardiotropic viruses and host proteolytic systems, with an emphasis on coxsackievirus B3, one of the primary aetiological agents causing viral myocarditis, and highlights possible roles of the host degradation systems in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and its progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.","Luo, Honglin; Wong, Jerry; Wong, Brian",Cardiovasc Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109953/,109

In many cases such VLPs have structural characteristics and antigenicity similar to the parental virus, and some have already proven successful as vaccines against the cognate virus infection. The structural components of some VLPs have also proven amenable to the insertion or fusion of foreign antigenic sequences, allowing the production of chimeric VLPs exposing the foreign antigen on their surface. Other VLPs have been used as carriers for foreign antigens, including non-protein antigens, via chemical conjugation. This review outlines some of the advantages, disadvantages, and technical considerations for the use of a wide range of VLP systems in vaccine development.","Grgacic, Elizabeth V.L.; Anderson, David A.",Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128828/,109

27006,No end in sight to SARS,2004-10-30,"Understanding and controlling the spread of infectious disease is a pressing issue for our society. Contemporary globally connected civilization is more at risk from various modern infectious diseases than classical ones such as pests, cholera, and tuberculosis. Over the last few years, pandemic outbreaks of highly virulent influenza, possibly related to avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and middle-eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MARSE) have been a threat. Beyond this, the intentional spread of infectious disease, e.g., “bioterrorism”, has come to be recognized as being just as dangerous as nuclear weapons. An infectious disease spreads on human social networks. Each individual can protect himself through several measures. Pre-emptive vaccination is thought to be most effective, although it incurs a partial cost to each individual. This brings about a social dilemma, because an individual may be able to rely on so-called “herd immunity” to avoid his own infection without himself being vaccinated. Also, besides vaccination, there may be several practical ways to protect against contagion, such as wearing a mask, keeping away from crowds, and self-isolation by leaving the home less often, which may be less costly and less effective than vaccination. In any case, there is a human-decision-making process regarding what steps should be taken, while the dynamics of infectious-disease spread can themselves be evaluated as a diffusion problem that has been well-studied in physics for many years. Thus, based on the concept of human–environment–social interaction, a basic-physics model for this diffusion problem that considers evolutionary game theory (EGT) may lead us to obtain some meaningful solutions that can be proposed to our society. Following the previous chapter explaining how EGT can be applied to traffic-flow analysis, this chapter describes this practical problem.","Tanimoto, Jun",Evolutionary Games with Sociophysics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124076/,109

This procedure is purely based on the clinician’s judgment and there is no universally accepted protocol to date for this vital procedure. This study aimed to describe decannulation practice and failure rates in patients with tracheostomy and to determine the factors associated with the outcome of tube removal. A prospective study was done on 50 patients (both sexes) who required a tracheostomy and cared for at Command Hospital Bangalore Center between January 2019 and April 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential tests. Out of the 50 decannulation decisions, 7 patients experienced decannulation failures giving a failure rate of 14%. Out of the 7 decannulation failure cases, about 4 patients (10%) experienced difficulty in swallowing and 3 patients (2%) experienced stridor. There was no associated mortality. A decannulation failure of 14% was seen in this study in tracheostomised patients after prolonged mechanical ventilation. Various factors govern the success of tracheostomy decannulation procedures which occur during the first 24–48 h after decannulation. Lack of swallowing/secretions/cough management and the development of stridor were the commonest cause of decannulation failure in this study.","Bishnoi, Tapasya; Sahu, Pankaj Kumar; Arjun, A.

Most existing approaches address this problem as deterministic regression of future features or future predictions given observed frames. However, such approaches ignore the fact that future can not always be guessed with certainty. For example, when a car is about to turn around a corner, the road which is currently occluded by buildings may turn out to be either free to drive, or occupied by people, other vehicles or roadworks. When a deterministic model confronts such situation, its best guess is to forecast the most likely outcome. However, this is not acceptable since it defeats the purpose of forecasting to improve security. It also throws away valuable training data, since a deterministic model is unable to learn any deviation from the norm. We address this problem by providing more freedom to the model through allowing it to forecast different futures. We propose to formulate multimodal forecasting as sampling of a multimodal generative model conditioned on the observed frames. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset reveal that our multimodal model outperforms its deterministic counterpart in short-term forecasting while performing slightly worse in the mid-term case.

52355,Adrenal Hyperplasia as Possible Predictor of Mortality in Patients Admitted for Suspected SARS-Cov-2 Infection: A Prospective Study,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: In March 2020, UK epistaxis guidelines were issued incorporating major shifts in standard practice, namely the recommended use of dissolvable products and discharge of patients with non-dissolvable packs. The aim of this audit was to assess patient outcomes following epistaxis care during the initial COVID-19 peak, exploring factors relating to unscheduled re-presentations. METHODS: A UK-wide prospective multicentre national audit was performed over 12-weeks from 6th April 2020 at ENT departments treating adults with epistaxis. The primary outcome was re-presentation within 10-days. Univariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify significant determinants of the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: 83 centres from all four UK nations submitted 2,631 cases, the majority of which were Emergency Department (ED) referrals (89.7%). ENT clinicians used a dissolvable intranasal product in 34.7% of patients overall (n = 816/2,351), and in 61.1% of those receiving an intranasal product (n = 816/1,336). 54.6% were discharged from the ED following ENT review. The overall re-presentation rate was 19.5% for ED discharges (n = 245/1,259) and 9.9% for ED admissions (n = 104/1,046). 6.8% of ED discharges and 5.7% of ED admissions were admitted following their re-presentations (n = 86 and 60 respectively). Not being packed by ED clinicians, antiplatelet medications, failed cautery and recent epistaxis treatment were predictors of re-presentation within 10-days. DISCUSSION: Re-presentation data were similar to the 2016 UK Epistaxis Audit, however, there was a notable shift towards alternative packing techniques and reduced admission. This highlights that many patients who would previously have necessitated admission may be safely discharged from ED.","Swords, Chloe",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083339/,109

A decision-analytic Markov model was used to assess the budget impact from payers' and facility-providers' perspectives of the four index procedure strategies (BMS, DES, DCB, and PTA). Base cases were developed for U.S. Medicare and the German statutory sickness fund perspectives using current 2013 reimbursement rates. RESULTS Thirteen studies with 2,406 subjects were included. The reported probability of TLR in the identified studies varied widely, particularly following treatment with PTA or BMS. The pooled 24-month probabilities were 14.3%, 19.3%, 28.1%, and 40.3% for DCB, DES, BMS, and PTA, respectively. The drug-eluting strategies had a lower projected budget impact over 24 months compared to BMS and PTA in both the U.S. Medicare (DCB: $10,214; DES: $12,904; uncoated balloons $13,114; BMS $13,802) and German public health care systems (DCB €3,619; DES €3,632; BMS €4,026; PTA €4,290). CONCLUSIONS DCB and DES, compared to BMS and PTA, are associated with lower probabilities of target lesion revascularization and cost savings for U.S. and German payers.","Pietzsch, Jan B; Geisler, Benjamin P; Garner, Abigail M; Zeller, Thomas; Jaff, Michael R",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.25536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782424/,109
67571,Comparison of the First and Second Waves of Hospitalized Patients With SARS-CoV-2.,2021-05-07,"INTRODUCTION COVID-19, a dreadful pandemic that has impacted human life like no other pathogenic invasion, has claimed the lives of over 100 million people. The need for effective treatment strategies is still a subject of intense research considering the rapidly evolving genome and continental diversity. Indomethacin is administered mostly as co-treatment for affected patients as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). However, the underlying mechanism of action is unresolved. This study explores the basal mechanism of indomethacin and potency in alleviating the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the experimental and clinical efficacy in recent studies. AREAS COVERED The literature search and system biology-based network formation was employed to describe the potent effects and risks associated with indomethacin in in-vitro, in-vivo, and clinical studies. This study also highlights the plausible mechanism of antiviral action of indomethacin with its apparent viral protein targets. The SARS-CoV-2 protein, the interacting host proteins, and the effect of indomethacin on this interactome as a standalone treatment or as part of a co-therapy strategy are particularly emphasized using network modeling. EXPERT OPINION Indomethacin has demonstrated excellent clinical endpoint characteristics in several studies, and we recommend that it be utilised in the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID patients.","Shekhar, Nishant; Kaur, Harpinder; Sarma, Phulen; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2022.1990756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633277/,109
67638,[Immunization against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and vaccine development].,2021-08-25,"Purpose To study the relationship between functional independence and time to reperfusion in the Solitaire with the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (SWIFT PRIME) trial in patients with disabling acute ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular therapy plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration versus tPA administration alone and to investigate variables that affect time spent during discrete steps. Materials and Methods Data were analyzed from the SWIFT PRIME trial, a global, multicenter, prospective study in which outcomes were compared in patients treated with intravenous tPA alone or in combination with the Solitaire device (Covidien, Irvine, Calif). Between December 2012 and November 2014, 196 patients were enrolled. The relation between time from (a) symptom onset to reperfusion and (b) imaging to reperfusion and clinical outcome was analyzed, along with patient and health system characteristics that affect discrete steps in patient workflow. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationships between time and outcome; negative binomial regression was used to evaluate effects on workflow. The institutional review board at each site approved the trial. Patients provided written informed consent, or, at select sites, there was an exception from having to acquire explicit informed consent in emergency circumstances. Results In the stent retriever arm of the study, symptom onset to reperfusion time of 150 minutes led to 91% estimated probability of functional independence, which decreased by 10% over the next hour and by 20% with every subsequent hour of delay. Time from arrival at the emergency department to arterial access was 90 minutes (interquartile range, 69-120 minutes), and time to reperfusion was 129 minutes (interquartile range, 108-169 minutes). Patients who initially arrived at a referring facility had longer symptom onset to groin puncture times compared with patients who presented directly to the endovascular-capable center (275 vs 179.5 minutes, P < .001). Conclusion Fast reperfusion leads to improved functional outcome among patients with acute stroke treated with stent retrievers. Detailed attention to workflow with iterative feedback and aggressive time goals may have contributed to efficient workflow environments.

71041,Association Between Number of In-Person Health Care Visits and SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Obstetrical Patients.,2020-08-14,"Effective, safe, and affordable rabies vaccines are still being sought. Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus, has shown promise as a vaccine vector for mammals. Here, we generated a recombinant avirulent NDV La Sota strain expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) and evaluated its potential to serve as a vaccine against rabies. The recombinant virus, rL-RVG, retained its high-growth property in chicken eggs, with titers of up to 10⁹·⁸ 50% egg infective doses (EID₅₀)/ml of allantoic fluid. RVG expression enabled rL-RVG to spread from cell to cell in a rabies virus-like manner, and RVG was incorporated on the surface of the rL-RVG viral particle. RVG incorporation did not alter the trypsin-dependent infectivity of the NDV vector in mammalian cells. rL-RVG and La Sota NDV showed similar levels of sensitivity to a neutralization antibody against NDV and similar levels of resistance to a neutralization antibody against rabies virus. Animal studies demonstrated that rL-RVG is safe in several species, including cats and dogs, when administered as multiple high doses of recombinant vaccine. Intramuscular vaccination with rL-RVG induced a substantial rabies virus neutralization antibody response and provided complete protection from challenge with circulating rabies virus strains. Most importantly, rL-RVG induced strong and long-lasting protective neutralization antibody responses to rabies virus in dogs and cats. A low vaccine dose of 10⁸·³ EID₅₀ completely protected dogs from challenge with a circulating strain of rabies virus for more than a year. This is the first study to demonstrate that immunization with an NDV-vectored vaccine can induce long-lasting, systemic protective immunity against rabies.","Ge, Jinying; Wang, Xijun; Tao, Lihong; Wen, Zhiyuan; Feng, Na; Yang, Songtao; Xia, Xianzhu; Yang, Chinglai; Chen, Hualan; Bu, Zhigao",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00519-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21632762/,109

Though the virus was identified more than 60 years ago, there is still no licensed vaccine available. Over the years, several vaccine delivery strategies have been evaluated. In this study, we developed two recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector-based vaccine candidates expressing the RSV G (attachment) protein (rVSV-G) or F (fusion) protein (rVSV-F). All vectors were evaluated in the cotton rat animal model for their in vivo immunogenicity and protective efficacy against an RSV-A2 virus challenge. Intranasal delivery of rVSV-G and rVSV-F together completely protected the lower respiratory tract (lungs) at doses as low as 103 plaque forming units (pfu). In contrast, doses greater than 106 pfu were required to protect the upper respiratory tract completely. Re-immunization of RSV-immune cotton rats was most effective with rVSV-F. In immunized animals, overall antibody responses were sufficient for protection, whereas CD4 and CD8 T cells were not necessary. A prime-boost immunization regimen increased both protection and neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, mucosally delivered rVSV-vector-based RSV vaccine candidates induce protective immunity, and therefore represent a promising immunization regimen against RSV infection.Importance Even after decades of intensive research efforts, a safe and efficacious RSV vaccine remains elusive. Expression of heterologous antigens from rVSV vectors has demonstrated several practical and safety advantages over other virus vector systems and live attenuated vaccines. In this study, we developed safe and efficacious vaccine candidates by expressing the two major immunogenic RSV surface proteins from rVSV vectors and delivered mucosally in a prime-boost regimen. The main immune parameter responsible for protection was the antibody response. These vaccine candidates induced complete protection of both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.","Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Ma, Yuanmei; Binjawadagi, Rashmi; Brakel, Kelsey; Harder, Olivia; Peeples, Mark; Li, Jianrong; Niewiesk, Stefan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02345-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408176/,109

While the number of publications of advocacy curricula for GME-level trainees has increased, there has been no formal effort to catalog them. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the existing literature on curricula for teaching advocacy to GME-level trainees and synthesize the results to provide a resource for programs interested in developing advocacy curricula. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to identify articles published in English that describe advocacy curricula for graduate medical education trainees in the USA and Canada current to September 2017. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts to identify articles meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. We abstracted information and themes on curriculum development, implementation, and sustainability. Learning objectives, educational content, teaching methods, and evaluations for each curriculum were also extracted. RESULTS After reviewing 884 articles, we identified 38 articles meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Curricula were offered across a variety of specialties, with 84% offered in primary care specialties. There was considerable heterogeneity in the educational content of included advocacy curriculum, ranging from community partnership to legislative advocacy. Common facilitators of curriculum implementation included the American Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements, institutional support, and preexisting faculty experience. Common barriers were competing curricular demands, time constraints, and turnover in volunteer faculty and community partners. Formal evaluation revealed that advocacy curricula were acceptable to trainees and improved knowledge, attitudes, and reported self-efficacy around advocacy. DISCUSSION Our systematic review of the medical education literature identified several advocacy curricula for graduate medical education trainees. These curricula provide templates for integrating advocacy education into GME-level training programs across specialties, but more work needs to be done to define standards and expectations around GME training for this professional activity.","Howell, Benjamin A; Kristal, Ross B; Whitmire, Lacey R; Gentry, Mark; Rabin, Tracy L; Rosenbaum, Julie",Journal of general internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-019-05184-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385216/,109
88203,Intestinal Abnormalities in Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Histopathologic Changes Reflect Mechanisms of Disease.,2021-06-03,"Background Circadian clock alterations were poorly reported in trauma patients, although they have a critical role in human physiology. Core body temperature is a clinical variable regulated by the circadian clock. Our objective was to identify the circadian temperature disruption in trauma patients and to determine whether these disruptions were associated with the 28-day mortality rate. Methods A retrospective and observational single-center cohort study was conducted. All adult severe trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Aix Marseille University, North Hospital, from November 2013 to February 2018, were evaluated. The variations of core body temperature for each patient were analyzed between days 2 and 3 after intensive care unit admission. Core body temperature variations were defined by three parameters: mesor, amplitude, and period. A logistic regression model was used to determine the variables influencing these three parameters. A survival analysis was performed assessing the association between core body temperature rhythm disruption and 28-day mortality rate. A post hoc subgroup analysis focused on the patients with head trauma. Results Among the 1584 screened patients, 248 were included in this study. The period differed from 24 h in 177 (71%) patients. The mesor value (°C) was associated with body mass index and ketamine use. Amplitude (°C) was associated with ketamine use only. The 28-day mortality rate was 18%. For all trauma patients, age, body mass index, intracranial hypertension, and amplitude were independent risk factors. The patients with a mesor value < 36.9 °C (p < 0.001) and an amplitude > 0.6 °C (p < 0.001) had a higher 28-day mortality rate. Among the patients with head trauma, mesor and amplitude were identified as independent risk factors (HR = 0.40, 95% CI [0.23-0.70], p = 0.001 and HR = 4.73, 95% CI [1.38-16.22], p = 0.01). Conclusions Our results highlight an association between core body temperature circadian alteration and 28-day mortality rate. This association was more pronounced in the head trauma patients than in the non-head trauma patients. Further studies are needed to show a causal link and consider possible interventions.","Culver, Aurélien; Coiffard, Benjamin; Antonini, François; Duclos, Gary; Hammad, Emmanuelle; Vigne, Coralie; Mege, Jean-Louis; Baumstarck, Karine; Boucekine, Mohamed; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Leone, Marc",Journal of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-019-0425-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31921428/,109

METHODS We conducted a health records review of adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac condition who were identified as low risk by the screening tool and transported by PCP(f). We excluded patients transported by an advanced care crew, those accompanied by a clinical escort from hospital, and those transported from a scene call, by rotary wing or ground vehicle. We recorded patient and transportation parameters using a piloted-standardized collection tool. We defined adverse events during transport a priori. We report descriptive statistics using mean (standard deviation), [range], (percentage). RESULTS We included 400 patients: mean age 66.9 years old, 66.5% male. Mean transport duration was 136.2 (74.9) minutes. Most common comorbidities were hypertension (50.3%) and coronary artery disease (39.5%). Most transports originated out of Northern Ontario and were for cardiac catheterization (61.8%) or coronary artery bypass grafting (26.8%). Overall, the adverse event rate was low (0.3%), with no serious event such as cardiac arrest, death, or airway intervention. CONCLUSIONS A screening tool can identify cardiac patients at low risk for clinical deterioration during air-medical transport. We believe patients screened with this tool can be transported safely by a PCP(f) crew, leading to potentially significant resource savings.","Godbout, Justin; Moore, Sean W; Sawadsky, Bruce; Pan, Andy; Vaillancourt, Christian",CJEM,https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2019.459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084556/,109

METHODS Two hundred individuals who were 65 years old and older were included in our study. They were questioned about their awareness regarding adult immunisation, and their knowledge level and vaccination statuses were determined regarding the tetanus, influenza, hepatitis, and pneumococcal vaccines. After they were given information about the pneumococcal vaccine, they were asked about their interest in being vaccinated. Those who agreed to be vaccinated were invited and vaccinated. RESULTS According to the questionnaire, 150 people (75%) knew of the influenza vaccine, 130 people (65%) knew of the tetanus vaccine, 53 people (26.5%) knew of the hepatitis B vaccine, and 49 people (24.5%) knew of the pneumococcal vaccine. A total of five people (2.5%) had received the pneumococcal vaccine. Fifty-eight of 97 patients (59.8%) who completed the questionnaire during a phone call and 84 of 103 patients (81.6%) who completed the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview received the pneumococcal vaccine. As a result, the rates of pneumococcal vaccination increased from 2.5% before the study to 73.5% after the study. CONCLUSION The findings show that the vaccination rates for pneumococcus were very low among our participants. The immunisation rates increased when doctors provided consultation to participants about adult immunisation.","Biyik, M V; Arslan, I; Yengil Taci, D",Primary health care research & development,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1463423620000389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985407/,109
99739,Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Enterovirus/rhinoviruses (EvRh) are the most common cause of respiratory virus infections in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). OBJECTIVE We sought to analyze the value of the immunodeficiency scoring index (ISI) in predicting lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) progression and mortality in a prospective cohort of consecutive adult (> 16 years) allo-HSCT recipients with EvRh infection from December 1 2013 to December 1 2019 at two Spanish transplant centers. RESULTS We included 234 allo-HSCT recipients with 383 EvRh episodes. Out of 383 EvRh episodes, 98 (25%) had LRTD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent factors associated with LRTD progression: Ig G <400 mg/dl, community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) co-infection and high-risk ISI. Inclusion of Ig G levels and CARV co-infection in the ISI improved its performance by significantly increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.643 to 0.734 (p= 0.03). Likewise, the two conditions identified by multivariate analyses as associated with higher probability of mortality were high-risk ISI and EvRh infection within 6 months after transplant. CONCLUSIONS Our findings confirm the value of high-risk ISI in predicting both probability of EvRh LRTD and 3-month overall mortality. We also demonstrate that the original ISI could be adapted to other CARV types by including additional variables to improve its performance.","Pérez, Ariadna; Montoro, Juan; Hernani, Rafael; Lorenzo, Ignacio; Hernández-Boluda, Juan Carlos; Giménez, Estela; Gómez, María Dolores; Balaguer-Roselló, Aitana; Gonzalez-Barberá, Eva; Guerreiro, Manuel; Aguilar, Cristóbal; Navarro, David; Solano, Carlos; Sanz, Jaime; Luis Piñana, José",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363665/,109

Oral propranolol has been well established as the first-line treatment of complicated hemangiomas; however, variability in the administration protocol remains. We sought to evaluate our current propranolol treatment protocols to determine if the level of monitoring and follow-up predicts immediate or future adverse events by comparing one in-person visit vs two in-person visits versus teledermatology for treatment initiation and dose escalation. METHODS We analyzed retrospective data on 279 patients diagnosed with IH and treated with oral propranolol on an in-person or virtual telemedicine outpatient basis from January 01, 2015 through May 31, 2020. Data were collected via chart review on all aspects of patient demographics, treatment indication, treatment initiation, adverse events, and follow-up visits. RESULTS Two monitoring visits (Protocol 1) versus one (Protocol 2) was not associated with decreased adverse outcomes (P = .255). The odds of having an adverse event in Protocol 1 compared to Protocol 2 was insignificant (OR: 0.64; CI: 0.30-1.38). The most frequently reported adverse event among patients in both protocols was sleep disturbance. However, it did not vary significantly among the groups (P = .980, OR: 0.98, CI: 0.35-2.69). CONCLUSION Prolonged in-office monitoring of propranolol initiation and dose escalation (Protocol 1) may not be necessary for the setting of adequate prescreening as it does not predict immediate or future adverse events.","Johansen, Maija Liv; Mahendran, Geetha; Lawley, Leslie P",Pediatric dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115417/,109
113669,SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with haematological disorders: Severity and one-month outcome in 66 Danish patients in a nationwide cohort study.,2020-09-16,"Multiple novel members of the genus Hepacivirus have recently been discovered in diverse mammalian species. However, to date, their replication mechanisms and zoonotic potential have not been explored in detail. The NS3/4A serine protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is critical for cleavage of the viral polyprotein. It also cleaves the cellular innate immune adaptor MAVS, thus decreasing interferon (IFN) production and contributing to HCV persistence in the human host. To investigate the conservation of fundamental aspects of the hepaciviral life cycle, we explored if MAVS cleavage and suppression of innate immune signaling represent a common mechanism employed across different clades of the genus Hepacivirus to enhance viral replication. To estimate the zoonotic potential of these nonhuman hepaciviruses, we assessed if their NS3/4A proteases were capable of cleaving human MAVS. NS3/4A proteases of viruses infecting colobus monkeys, rodents, horses, and cows cleaved the MAVS proteins of their cognate hosts and interfered with the ability of MAVS to induce the IFN-β promoter. All NS3/4A proteases from nonhuman viruses readily cleaved human MAVS. Thus, NS3/4A-dependent cleavage of MAVS is a conserved replication strategy across multiple clades within the genus Hepacivirus Human MAVS is susceptible to cleavage by these nonhuman viral proteases, indicating that it does not pose a barrier for zoonotic transmission of these viruses to humans. IMPORTANCE Virus infection is recognized by cellular sensor proteins triggering innate immune signaling and antiviral defenses. While viruses have evolved strategies to thwart these antiviral programs in their cognate host species, these evasion mechanisms are often ineffective in a novel host, thus limiting viral transmission across species. HCV, the best-characterized member of the genus Hepacivirus within the family Flaviviridae, uses its NS3/4A protease to disrupt innate immune signaling by cleaving the cellular adaptor protein MAVS. Recently, a large number of HCV-related viruses have been discovered in various animal species, including wild, livestock, and companion animals. We show that the NS3/4A proteases of these hepaciviruses from different animals and representing various clades of the genus cleave their cognate host MAVS proteins in addition to human MAVS. Therefore, cleavage of MAVS is a common strategy of hepaciviruses, and human MAVS is likely unable to limit replication of these nonhuman viruses upon zoonotic exposure.","Anggakusuma,; Brown, Richard J P; Banda, Dominic H; Todt, Daniel; Vieyres, Gabrielle; Steinmann, Eike; Pietschmann, Thomas",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01634-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27654291/,109

METHODS Between August 2008 and August 2010, 42 patients were offered a pure TVA. Patients who did not wish to undergo a TVA underwent a LA and served as the control group. Demographic data, operative time, length of stay, patient controlled analgesia (PCA) 12-hour-morphine utilization, complications, return to normal activity, and return to work were recorded. RESULTS Eighteen of 40 enrolled patients underwent a pure TVA. Two patients refused to participate in this study. Mean age (TVA: 31.3 ± 2.5 years vs. LA: 28.2 ± 2.3 years, P = 0.36), mean body mass index (TVA: 23.7 ± 1.2 kg/m2 vs. LA: 23.6 ± 0.7 kg/m2, P = 0.96) mean operative time (TVA: 44.4 ± 4.5 minutes vs. LA: 39.8 ± 2.6 minutes, P = 0.38), and mean length of hospital stay (TVA: 1.1 ± 0.1 days vs. LA: 1.2 ± 0.1 days, P = 0.53) were not statistically significant. However, mean postoperative morphine-use (TVA: 8.7 ± 2.0 mg vs. LA: 23.0 ± 3.4 mg, P < 0.01), return to normal activity (TVA: 3.3 ± 0.4 days vs. LA: 9.7 ± 1.6 days, P < 0.01), and return to work (TVA: 5.4 ± 1.1 days vs. LA: 10.7 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.01) were statistically significant. One conversion in the TVA group to a LA was necessary because of inability to maintain adequate pneumoperitoneum. Four complications were observed: 1 intraabdominal abscess and 1 case of urinary retention in the TVA group; 1 early postoperative bowel obstruction and 1 case of urinary retention in the LA group. CONCLUSIONS Pure TVA is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with significantly less pain and faster recovery compared to traditional LA.","Roberts, Kurt E; Solomon, Daniel; Mirensky, Tamar; Silasi, Dan-Arin; Duffy, Andrew J; Rutherford, Tom; Longo, Walter E; Bell, Robert L",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e31823b2748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22167005/,109

115796,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk factors in health care workers.,2020,"OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the modified Atkins diet in children with epileptic spasms who had failed hormonal therapy. METHODS Children aged 9 months to 3 years having daily epileptic spasms despite a trial of ACTH or oral prednisolone and 1 additional anticonvulsant medication were enrolled. Children were randomly assigned to receive the modified Atkins diet either immediately or after a delay of 4 weeks. The ongoing anticonvulsant medications were continued unchanged. The primary outcome variable was the proportion of children who achieved spasm freedom as per parental reports at 4 weeks. Secondary outcomes included time to spasm cessation, proportion of children with electroclinical remission, the proportion of children with >50% reduction of spasms at 4 weeks, and adverse effects of the diet. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03807141). RESULTS A total of 91 children were enrolled in the study; 46 in the diet group and 45 in the control group. At the end of 4 weeks, 11 children in the diet group were spasm free compared with none in the control group (P ≤ .001). The median time to achieve spasm cessation was 10 days (interquartile range 9-20). Nine of these had resolution of hypsarrhythmia on electroencephalography (EEG). Thirty (65.2%) in the diet group had >50% reduction in spasms, compared with none in the control group (P < .001). The most common side effect was constipation, noted in 34.8% of the children. CONCLUSIONS The modified Atkins diet was found to be effective and well tolerated in children with epileptic spasms refractory to hormonal therapy.","Sharma, Suvasini; Goel, Shaiphali; Kapoor, Dipti; Garg, Divyani; Panda, Isha; Elwadhi, Aman; Patra, Bijoy; Mukherjee, Sharmila B; Pemde, Harish",Journal of child neurology,https://doi.org/10.1177/08830738211004747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834913/,109
116986,"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Asymptomatic Health Care Workers in the Greater Houston, Texas, Area.",2020-07-01,"Inorganic arsenic (iAs) exposure has been reported to have an impact on cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, there is not much known about the cardiac tissue injury of CVD patients in relation to iAs exposure and potential role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes related to iAs metabolism, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation which may play important roles in such CVD cases. In this dual center cross-sectional study, based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria, we have recruited 50 patients out of 270, who came from known arsenic-affected and- unaffected areas of mainly Chittagong, Dhaka and Rajshahi divisions of Bangladesh and underwent open-heart surgery at the selected centers during July 2017 to June 2018. We found that the patients from arsenic affected areas contained significantly higher average iAs concentrations in their urine (6.72 ± 0.54 ppb, P = 0.028), nail (529.29 ± 38.76 ppb, P < 0.05) and cardiac tissue (4.83 ± 0.50 ppb, P < 0.05) samples. Patients' age, sex, BMI, hypertension and diabetes status adjusted analysis showed that patients from arsenic-affected areas had significantly higher iAs concentration in cardiac tissue (2.854, 95%CI 1.017-8.012, P = 0.046) reflecting higher cardiac tissue injury among them (1.831, 95%CI 1.032-3.249, P = 0.039), which in turn allowed the analysis to assume that the iAs exposure have played a vital role in patients' disease condition. Adjusted analysis showed significant association between urinary iAs concentration with AA (P = 0.012) and AG (P = 0.034) genotypes and cardiac iAs concentration with AA (P = 0.017) genotype of AS3MT rs10748835. The AG genotype of AS3MT rs10748835 (13.333 95%CI 1.280-138.845, P = 0.013), AA genotype of NOS3 rs3918181 (25.333 95%CI 2.065-310.757, P = 0.002), GG genotype of ICAM1 rs281432 (12.000 95%CI 1.325-108.674, P = 0.010) and AA genotype of SOD2 rs2758331 (13.333 95%CI 1.280-138.845, P = 0.013) were found significantly associated with CVD patients from arsenic-affected areas. Again, adjusted analysis showed significant association of AA genotype of AS3MT rs10748835 with CVD patients from arsenic affected areas. In comparison to the reference genotypes of the selected SNPs, AA of AS3MT 10748835, AG of NOS3 rs3918181 and AC of rs3918188, GG of ICAM1 rs281432, TT of VCAM1 rs3176867, AA of SOD2 rs2758331 and GT of APOE rs405509 significantly increased odds of cardiac tissue injury of CVD patients from arsenic affected areas. The results showed that the selected SNPs played a susceptibility role towards cardiac tissue iAs concentration and injury among CVD patients from iAs affected areas.","Al-Forkan, Mohammad; Wali, Fahmida Binta; Khaleda, Laila; Alam, Md Jibran; Chowdhury, Rahee Hasan; Datta, Amit; Rahman, Md Zillur; Hosain, Nazmul; Maruf, Mohammad Fazle; Chowdhury, Muhammad Abdul Quaium; Hasan, N K M Mirazul; Shawon, Injamamul Ismail; Raqib, Rubhana",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85780-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737636/,109

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective multicenter study. PATIENTS The study included 46 women with GH-secreting pituitary microadenomas (n = 7) or macroadenomas (n = 39). Their mean age was 31.7 yr (±4.5 yr). Incomplete transsphenoidal surgical resection (n = 39) and pituitary radiation (n = 14) had been performed, respectively, 2.9 ± 2.6 and 7.3 ± 4.2 yr before pregnancy. The patients were receiving dopamine agonists (n = 25) and/or somatostatin analogs (n = 14), and GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was controlled and uncontrolled in, respectively, 23 and 34 cases. Five pregnancies followed the fertility treatment. RESULTS Fifty-nine pregnancies resulted in 64 healthy babies. Gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension occurred in four (6.8%) and eight (13.6%) pregnancies, respectively, and both were more frequent when GH/IGF-I hypersecretion was not controlled before pregnancy. Visual field defects were diagnosed during pregnancy in four women, three of whom were diagnosed with acromegaly during the pregnancy. Seven women had isolated headache. Magnetic resonance imaging performed 3.9 ± 0.3 months after delivery showed that the size of the adenoma had increased in three cases, decreased in two cases, and remained stable in 22 cases. Seventeen women breast-fed with no complications. Four women gave birth to a small-for-gestational-age infant; all had received somatostatin analogs, alone or in combination with dopamine agonists, during pregnancy. The mean IGF-I level fell significantly during the first trimester in 12 cases (before conception 588 ± 207 ng/ml, first trimester 319 ± 126 ng/ml, P = 0.002), whereas the GH concentration did not change significantly. CONCLUSION The following conclusions were reached: 1) pregnancy in women with active or uncontrolled acromegaly may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes and gravid hypertension; 2) pregnancy is occasionally associated with symptomatic enlargement of GH-secreting pituitary macroadenomas; 3) changes in serum GH and IGF-I concentrations are variable during pregnancy, indicating that routine monitoring is not mandatory if the pregnancy is uneventful; and 4) GH-suppressive treatment can be safely withdrawn after conception in most acromegalic women.","Caron, Philippe; Broussaud, Stéphanie; Bertherat, Jérome; Borson-Chazot, Françoise; Brue, Thierry; Cortet-Rudelli, Christine; Chanson, Philippe",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-2331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660047/,109

Methods We collected 48 pairs of tumor and adjacent normal tissues from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Both 786-o and caki-1 ccRCC cell lines were transfected with GA-binding protein transcription factor subunit beta-1 antisense RNA 1 (GABPB1-AS1), miR-1246, or small interfering RNA phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (siPCK1) vectors. RNA expression was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and protein expression by Western blot. Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 assays. Cell migration and invasion were measured by transwell assays. Targeting relationships between genes were tested by luciferase reporter gene assays. Results Lower GABPB1-AS1 expression was found in ccRCC cells and tissues. GABPB1-AS1 expression was inversely associated with tumor size, TNM stage, and Furhman stage. High GABPB1-AS1 expression was associated with a better prognosis. GABPB1-AS1 overexpression significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion by 786-o and caki-1 cells. GABPB1-AS1 overexpression reduced tumor weights in xenograft experiments. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-1246 overexpression significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of 786-o and caki-1 cells transfected with wild-type (WT)-GABPB1-AS1 or WT-PCK1. Knockdown of PCK1 weakened the inhibition of proliferation, migration, and invasion induced by GABPB1-AS1 overexpression in 786-o and caki-1 cells. Conclusion GABPB1-AS1 inhibits ccRCC growth and plays a tumor suppressor role through an miR-1246/PCK1 axis.","Gao, Shuang; Zhang, Feng; Sun, Hanxue; Yang, Xianghong",OncoTargets and therapy,https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s257275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764970/,109

RECENT FINDINGS Typical symptom for SB infections is diarrhea, mostly self-limiting. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoan parasites, and helminths. Host-pathogen interaction is of special interest in infections with potentially severe or prolonged course. Research uses increasingly enterocyte cell culture systems. SARS-CoV2 can also infect enterocytes via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and causes gastrointestinal complaints in some patients. Chronic SB infections as tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus have to be differentiated from Crohn's and other diseases. Severe rare fungal and protozoan parasitic infections can cause relevant morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Soil-transmitted helminthic infections are a special issue in endemic areas. SUMMARY Many infections involve the SB, typically causing mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Symptomatic therapy, hygiene, and isolation are the mainstay of management. However, some patients develop severe or chronic disease. Immunosuppression is a major cause for severe, but also for rare opportunistic systemic infections that can also affect the SB.","Keuchel, Martin; Bota, Marc; Baltes, Peter",Current opinion in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mog.0000000000000720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769379/,109

Monitoring oxygen saturation with pulse oximetry is potentially useful, but its use may be limited by poor peripheral perfusion due to hypothermia. This preliminary study explores the feasibility of pulse oximetry in simulated minor drowning scenarios. MATERIALS AND METHODS Six different pulse oximeters were tested on ten healthy volunteers after brief submersion, after ten minutes of swimming in a swimming pool (warm water, temperature 21°C), and in the sea (cold water, temperature 16°C). A measured oxygen saturation reading ≤ 94% was assumed to be incorrect. RESULTS There was considerable variability between each pulse oximeter. In warm water, 5.8% of measurements were outside the predicted range (8.3% after submersion, 3.3% after swimming), compared to 34% in cold water (20% after submersion, 48% after swimming). The spurious measurements came from two pulse oximeters in warm water, but from all six in cold water. The best and worst performing pulse oximeters showed 5% and 33% measurements respectively outside the predicted range. CONCLUSION The performance of pulse oximeters varies considerably in healthy volunteers submersed or immersed in warm or cold water. Further studies are needed to understand these differences.","Montenij, Leonard J; de Vries, Wiebe; Schwarte, Lothar; Bierens, Joost J L M",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.04.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21612853/,109

We aimed to establish if dead-space ventilation is different in patients with COVID-19 ARDS when compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS A total of 187 subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and 178 subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS who were undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. The association between the ARDS types and dead-space ventilation, compliance of the respiratory system, subjects' characteristics, organ failures, and mechanical ventilation was evaluated by using data collected in the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS Corrected minute ventilation (V̇E), a dead-space ventilation surrogate, was higher in the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS versus in those with non-COVID-19 ARDS (median [interquartile range] 12.6 [10.2-15.8] L/min vs 9.4 [7.5-11.6] L/min; P < .001). Increased corrected V̇E was independently associated with COVID-19 ARDS (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.47; P = .007). The best compliance of the respiratory system, obtained after testing different PEEPs, was similar between the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS and the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS (mean ± SD 38 ± 11 mL/cm H2O vs 37 ± 11 mL/cm H2O, respectively; P = .61). The subjects with COVID-19 ARDS received higher median (interquartile range) PEEP (12 [10-14] cm H2O vs 8 [5-9] cm H2O; P < .001) and lower median (interquartile range) tidal volume (5.8 [5.5-6.3] mL/kg vs 6.6 [6.1-7.3] mL/kg; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS, being these differences maintained at multivariable analysis. In the multivariable analysis, the subjects with COVID-19 ARDS showed a lower risk of anamnestic arterial hypertension (odds ratio 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.45; P < .001) and lower neurologic sequential organ failure assessment score (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.27; P < .001) than the subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. CONCLUSIONS Indirect measurements of dead space were higher in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS compared with subjects with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The best compliance of the respiratory system was similar in both ARDS forms provided that different PEEPs were applied. A wide range of compliance is present in every ARDS type; therefore, the setting of mechanical ventilation should be individualized patient by patient and not based on the etiology of ARDS.","Bertelli, Michele; Fusina, Federica; Prezioso, Chiara; Cavallo, Erika; Nencini, Niccolò; Crisci, Serena; Tansini, Francesca; Mari, Letizia Mazzuca; Hoxha, Laureta; Lombardi, Fabiana; Natalini, Giuseppe",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035148/,109

However, the ability of HRV infections to trigger exacerbations, and the link between allergic status and HRV responsiveness, remains incompletely understood. Whilst the receptors on human airway cells that detect and are utilized by most HRV group A and B, but not C serotypes are known, how endosomal pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect HRV replication products that are generated within the cytoplasm remains somewhat of an enigma. In this article, we explore a role for autophagy, a cellular homeostatic process that allows the cell to encapsulate its own cytosolic constituents, as the crucial mechanism controlling this process and regulating the innate immune response of airway epithelial cells to viral infection. We will also briefly describe some of the recent insights into the immune responses of the airway to HRV, focusing on neutrophilic inflammation that is a potentially unwanted feature of the acute response to viral infection, and the roles of IL-1 and Pellinos in the regulation of responses to HRV.","Parker, L C; Stokes, C A; Sabroe, I",Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.12182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24355017/,109

With arising concerns of sustainability, alternative sources of vegetal lecithin are urgently needed, and their metabolic effects must be characterized. OBJECTIVES We evaluated the impact of increasing doses of rapeseed lecithin (RL), rich in essential α-linolenic acid (ALA), on postprandial lipid metabolism and ALA bioavailability in lymph-cannulated rats. METHODS Male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) undergoing a mesenteric lymph duct cannulation were intragastrically administered 1 g of an oil mixture containing 4% ALA and 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30% RL (5 groups). Lymph fractions were collected for 6 h. Lymph lipids and chylomicrons (CMs) were characterized. The expression of genes implicated in intestinal lipid metabolism was determined in the duodenum at 6 h. Data was analyzed using either sigmoidal or linear mixed-effects models, or one-way ANOVA, where appropriate. RESULTS RL dose-dependently increased the lymphatic recovery (AUC) of total lipids (1100 μg/mL·h per additional RL%; P = 0.010) and ALA (50 μg/mL·h per additional RL%; P = 0.0076). RL induced a faster appearance of ALA in lymph, as evidenced by the exponential decrease of the rate of appearance of ALA with RL (R2 = 0.26; P = 0.0064). Although the number of CMs was unaffected by RL, CM diameter was increased in the 30%-RL group, compared to the control group (0% RL), by 86% at 3-4 h (P = 0.065) and by 81% at 4-6 h (P = 0.0002) following administration. This increase was positively correlated with the duodenal mRNA expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp; ρ= 0.63; P = 0.0052). The expression of Mttp and secretion-associated, ras-related GTPase 1 gene homolog B (Sar1b, CM secretion), carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (Cpt1a) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1, beta-oxidation), and fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2, bioconversion of ALA into long-chain n-3 PUFAs) were, respectively, 49%, 29%, 74%, 48%, and 55% higher in the 30%-RL group vs. the control group (P < 0.05).

The epidemiologist sometimes needs to combine several independent parameter estimates: e.g. (i) adjust an incidence rate for healthcare utilisation, (ii) derive a disease prevalence from the conditional prevalence on another condition and the prevalence of that condition, (iii) adjust a seroprevalence for test sensitivity and specificity. While obtaining the combined parameter estimate is usually straightforward, deriving a corresponding confidence interval often is not. bootComb is an R package using parametric bootstrap sampling to derive such confidence intervals. Implementation. bootComb is a package for the statistical computation environment R. General features. As well as a function that returns confidence intervals for parameters combined from several independent estimates, bootComb provides auxiliary functions for 6 common distributions (beta, normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson and negative binomial) to derive best-fit distributions (and their sampling functions) for parameters given their reported confidence intervals.

The economy has long experience with a managed floating exchange rate system, which motivates us to investigate the exchange rate response to domestic economic policy uncertainty, incorporating oil prices and the trade volume under different economic circumstances. We apply quantile-based time-series approaches to deal with extreme values. Our empirical investigation demonstrates that the local currency appreciates in response to increased Russian economic policy uncertainty under different quantiles of the managed floating exchange rate, but it depreciates under most quantiles in a floating exchange rate period. Our findings confirm that the Russian currency appreciates with the rise in international oil prices and trade as Russia is an oil-exporting country.

The current model called leader-primed transcription, which states that subgenomic mRNA is transcribed directly from genome-length negative-strands, cannot explain many of the recent experimental findings. For instance, subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed directly via transcription intermediates that contain subgenome-length negative-strand templates; however subgenomic mRNA does not appear to be copied directly into negative strands. In our model the subgenome-length negative strands would be derived using the genome as a template. After the polymerase had copied the 3'-end of the genome, it would detach at any one of the several intergenic sequences and reattach to the sequence immediately downstream of the leader sequence at the 5'-end of genome RNA. Base pairing between the 3'-end of the nascent subgenome-length negative strands, which would be complementary to the intergenic sequence at the end of the leader sequence at the 5'-end of genome, would serve to align the nascent negative strand to the genome and permit the completion of synthesis, i.e., discontinuous extension of the 3'-end of the negative strand. Thus, subgenome-length negative strands would arise by discontinuous synthesis, but of negative strands, not of positive strands as proposed originally by the leader-primed transcription model.","Sawicki, S G; Sawicki, D L",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830530/,109

Even so, prognostication in COVID-19 remains limited. METHODS We assessed 90-day mortality stratified by comorbidities, routine biochemical markers and oxygen need in a consecutive single-centre cohort from 2 March to 2 June 2020. RESULTS We included 263 hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. On admission, fitness for intensive care was determined in 254 patients including 98 (39%) with a do-not-resuscitate order. Ninety-day overall mortality was 29%, whereas intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 35% (14/40). Alcohol abuse, liver disease and elevated urea were strongly associated with mortality in univariable analyses. In a mutually adjusted multivariable analysis, we found an independent incremental increase in 90-day mortality with each increasing age by decade (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-1.9), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (HR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0-1.4), number of abnormal blood tests (HR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and l/min. of supplemental oxygen (HR = 1.1; 95% CI: 1.1-1.2). CONCLUSIONS The overall mortality was similar to that of other hospitalised patients, whereas the ICU mortality was lower than expected. On admission, each additional age by decade, CCI score, number of abnormal blood tests and magnitude of supplemental oxygen were independently associated with increased mortality. FUNDING none.

However, there is limited information about this disease in children and adolescents. Only a few pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported so far. Since the immune responses of children are different from adults, their clinical findings and therapeutic responses may differ. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a 12-year-old girl with abdominal pain in Iran. Case Presentation A 12-year-old girl with a history of cold, dry cough, sore throat, fever, and left-sided abdominal pain was referred to the Children's Medical Center, Tehran, Iran, on March 7, 2020. The chest X-ray indicated air space opacification in the right lower lobe and faint ground-glass opacity in the left lower lung. A subsequent chest computed tomography (CT) scan indicated blialteral patchy lower lobe consolidations. The patient's oropharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19, based on the result of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. The patient's clinical status was improved, and she was discharged five days after admission (March 11, 2020). Conclusion Since the number of infected cases with COVID-19 is growing rapidly in Iran, early detection and management of infected cases are highly recommended for preventing the disease transmission and reducing the rate of infection.","Mahmoudi, Shima; Rostamyan, Maryam; Aziz-Ahari, Alireza; Pourakbari, Babak; Ghaffari, Mohammad; Mamishi, Setareh",Tanaffos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262804/,109
197815,[Development of monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV and identification of antigenic epitopes].,2005,"BACKGROUND In Ontario, current treatment for eligible patients who have an acute ischemic stroke is intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). However, there are some limitations and contraindications to IVT, and outcomes may not be favourable for patients with stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion. An alternative is mechanical thrombectomy with newer devices, and a number of recent studies have suggested that this treatment is more effective for improving functional independence and clinical outcomes. The objective of this health technology assessment was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices (with or without IVT) compared to IVT alone (if eligible) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of the literature, limited to randomized controlled trials that examined the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy using stent retrievers and thromboaspiration devices for patients with acute ischemic stroke. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We developed a Markov decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (with or without IVT) versus IVT alone (if eligible), calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using a 5-year time horizon, and conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the estimates. RESULTS There was a substantial, statistically significant difference in rate of functional independence (GRADE: high quality) between those who received mechanical thrombectomy (with or without IVT) and IVT alone (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.88-3.04). We did not observe a difference in mortality (GRADE: moderate quality) (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.60-1.07) or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (GRADE: moderate quality) (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.66-1.87). In the base-case cost-utility analysis, which had a 5 year time horizon, the costs and effectiveness for mechanical thrombectomy were $126,939 and 1.484 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (2.969 life-years). The costs and effectiveness for IVT alone were $124,419 and 1.273 QALYs (2.861 life-years), respectively. Mechanical thrombectomy was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $11,990 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of mechanical thrombectomy being cost-effective was 57.5%, 89.7%, and 99.6%, at thresholds of $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000 per QALY gained, respectively. We estimated that adopting mechanical thrombectomy would lead to a cost increase of approximately $1 to 2 million. CONCLUSIONS High quality evidence showed that mechanical thrombectomy significantly improved functional independence and appeared to be cost-effective compared to IVT alone for patients with acute ischemic stroke.",,Ontario health technology assessment series,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026799/,109

DESIGN: REDcap online-based survey of hospital capacity. SETTING: UK secondary and tertiary hospitals providing head and neck cancer surgery. PARTICIPANTS: One representative per hospital was asked to report the capacity for head and neck cancer surgery in that institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The principal measures of interests were new patient referrals, capacity in outpatients, theatres and critical care; therapeutic compromises constituting delay to surgery, de-escalated surgery and therapeutic migration to non-surgical primary modality. RESULTS: Data were returned from approximately 95% of UK hospitals with a head and neck cancer surgery specialist service. 50% of UK head and neck cancer patients requiring surgery have significantly compromised treatments during the second wave: 28% delayed, 10% have received radiotherapy-based treatment instead of surgery, and 12% have received de-escalated surgery. Surgical capacity has been more severely constrained in the second wave (58% of pre-pandemic level) compared with the first wave (62%) despite the time to prepare. CONCLUSIONS: Some hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID-19 and unable to offer essential cancer surgery, but all have neighbouring hospitals in their region retaining good (or even normal) capacity. It is noteworthy that very few patients have been appropriately redirected away from the hospitals most constrained by their burden of COVID-19. The paucity of an effective central or regional strategic response to this evident mismatch between demand and surgical capacity is to the detriment of our head and neck cancer patients.","Shaw, Richard",Clin. otolaryngol,,109

By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state-the transition state-that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/µl), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay).

Therefore, gene sequencing has its own pros and cons in clinical application. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is the most commonly used technology in clinical application. Due to its broad coverage of all types of pathogens, mNGS demonstrates incomparable advantage in rapid identification of novel pathogens such as 2019-nCoV. In addition, it can simultaneously identify other pathogens except 2019-nCoV and mixed infections. On the other hand, however, due to the complexity of mNGS and long detection time, it is unlikely to achieve the purpose of wide-range and rapid diagnosis of 2019 n-CoV.

Mounting evidence suggests that immunopathological changes, including diminished lymphocytes and elevated cytokines, are important drivers of disease progression and death in coronavirus infections. Cytokine storm not only limits further spread of virus in the body but also induces secondary tissue damage through the secretion of large amounts of active mediators and inflammatory factors. It has been determined that cytokine storm is a major cause of deaths in COVID-19; therefore, in order to reverse the deterioration of severe and critically ill patients from this disease, the cytokine storm has become a key therapeutic target. Although specific mechanisms of the occurrences of cytokine storms in COVID-19 have not been fully illuminated, hyper-activated innate immune responses, and dysregulation of ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) expression and its downstream pathways might provide possibilities. Tailored immunoregulatory therapies have been applied to counteract cytokine storms, such as inhibition of cytokines, corticosteroids, blood purification therapy, and mesenchymal stem cell therapy.

To describe characteristics of COVID-19 cases at child care facilities and facility adherence to guidance and recommendations, the District of Columbia (DC) Department of Health (DC Health) and CDC reviewed COVID-19 case reports associated with child care facilities submitted to DC Health and publicly available data from the DC Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) during July 1-December 31, 2020. Among 469 licensed child care facilities, 112 (23.9%) submitted 269 reports documenting 316 laboratory-confirmed cases and three additional cases identified through DC Health's contact tracers. Outbreaks associated with child care facilities, defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed and epidemiologically linked cases at a facility within a 14-day period (3), occurred in 27 (5.8%) facilities and accounted for nearly one half (156; 48.9%) of total cases. Among the 319 total cases, 180 (56.4%) were among teachers or staff members. The majority (56.4%) of facilities reported cases to DC Health on the same day that they were notified of a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, by staff members or parents.§ Facilities were at increased risk for an outbreak if they had been operating for <3 years, if symptomatic persons sought testing &#8805;3 days after symptom onset, or if persons with asymptomatic COVID-19 were at the facility. The number of outbreaks associated with child care facilities was limited. Continued implementation and maintenance of multiple prevention strategies, including vaccination, masking, physical distancing, cohorting, screening, and reporting, are important to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in child care facilities and to facilitate a timely public health response to prevent outbreaks.¶.","Kim, Christine; McGee, Sasha; Khuntia, Shreya; Elnour, Azam; Johnson-Clarke, Fern; Mangla, Anil; Iyengar, Preetha; Nesbitt, LaQuandra",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,109

219865,Nationwide seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic population in South Korea: a cross-sectional study,2021,"Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and initial lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts.","Shaw, Allison K; White, Lauren A; Michalska-Smith, Matthew; Borer, Elizabeth T; Craft, Meggan E; Seabloom, Eric W; Snell-Rood, Emilie C; Travisano, Michael",PLoS One,,109

In pathologies with clinical characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, most patients showed cognitive deficits after discharge from ICU. Further studies are needed on verbal fluency impairment among PICS patients.ObjectivesTo analyse the phonological verbal fluency in patients with PICS after COVID-19 infection in a Functional Rehabilitation Unit in Madrid (Spain) using the Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S).MethodsThis study was conducted in the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, in Madrid (Spain). A sample of 17 PICS adult patients was included, with age ranging from 56 to 74 years old (mean = 68.35 years;13 males). Patients were assessed around three weeks after referral from their reference hospital. The Verbal Fluency Test (VFT) of the SCIP-S was used as outcome. Descriptive analyses were conducted (mean and standard deviation) on standardized scores (z) based on age-adjusted general population norms. Significant impairment was set at z &lt; -1.5.ResultsMean z-score on VFT was -.53 (S.D. = .74) from the total sample, with 11.8% of cases with significant impairment (mean = -1.60;S.D. = .00).ConclusionsThese preliminary results show low probable presence of impairment on phonological verbal fluency among PICS patients after COVID-19 infection, which is in accordance with previous empirical studies.

However, evidence on this complication in less severe patients is not widely available. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, to assess the prevalence of DVT with duplex ultrasound, and to compare patients with DVT and those without it using lung computerized tomography (CT), clinical information and lab data. The subjects of this study were 75 consecutive patients (aged 27-92 y, median-63 y; 36 males and 39 females) with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. DVT was found in 15 patients (20%). The vast majority of those with DVT (13 patients, 86.7%) had thrombi in calf veins and 2 (13.3%) had ileofemoral thrombosis. High incidence of DVT (20%) is observed even in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. These patients require early anticoagulation therapy as part of their treatment. Such therapy may be continued after hospital discharge and these patients may also require follow-up vein ultrasonography after recovery to rule out DVT.","Kerbikov, Oleg; Orekhov, Pavel; Borskaya, Ekaterina; Nosenko, Natalia",Int J Hematol,,109

Here, we report the single-cell transcriptional landscape of longitudinally collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in both COVID-19- and influenza A virus (IAV)-infected patients. We observed increase of plasma cells in both COVID-19 and IAV patients and XIAP associated factor 1 (XAF1)-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and FAS-induced T cell apoptosis in COVID-19 patients. Further analyses revealed distinct signaling pathways activated in COVID-19 (STAT1 and IRF3) versus IAV (STAT3 and NF&#954;B) patients and substantial differences in the expression of key factors. These factors include relatively increase of interleukin (IL)6R and IL6ST expression in COVID-19 patients but similarly increased IL-6 concentrations compared to IAV patients, supporting the clinical observations of increased proinflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients. Thus, we provide the landscape of PBMCs and unveil distinct immune response pathways in COVID-19 and IAV patients.","Zhu, Linnan; Yang, Penghui; Zhao, Yingze; Zhuang, Zhenkun; Wang, Zhifeng; Song, Rui; Zhang, Jie; Liu, Chuanyu; Gao, Qianqian; Xu, Qumiao; Wei, Xiaoyu; Sun, Hai-Xi; Ye, Beiwei; Wu, Yanan; Zhang, Ning; Lei, Guanglin; Yu, Lingxiang; Yan, Jin; Diao, Guanghao; Meng, Fanping; Bai, Changqing; Mao, Panyong; Yu, Yeya; Wang, Mingyue; Yuan, Yue; Deng, Qiuting; Li, Ziyi; Huang, Yunting; Hu, Guohai; Liu, Yang; Wang, Xiaoqian; Xu, Ziqian; Liu, Peipei; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Zhang, Shaogeng; Chen, Zhihai; Wang, Jian; Xu, Xun; Wu, Guizhen; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Gao, George F; Liu, Longqi; Liu, William J",Immunity,,109

A binocular camera with an RGB lens and a thermal lens is utilized to simultaneously capture image pairs. Then, a mobile detection model based on a multi-task cascaded convolutional network (MTCNN) is proposed to realize face alignment and mask detection on the RGB images. For accurate temperature measurement, we transform the facial landmarks on the RGB images to the thermal images by an affine transformation and select a more accurate temperature measurement area on the forehead. The collected information is uploaded to the cloud in real time for COVID-19 prevention. Experiments show that the detection model is only 6.1M and the average detection speed is 257ms. At a distance of 1m, the error of indoor temperature measurement is about 3%.

This epitope was found to have a 99.8% structural favorability as per Ramachandran-plot analysis. Similarly, a suitable range of IC50 values and population coverage was obtained to represent greater validation of T-cell epitope analysis. Stability analysis using MDWeb and half-life analysis using the ProtParam tool has confirmed that this epitope is well-selected.

As an outstanding scientific discovery, the scientist who discovered glucocorticoids was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1950. Cortisone (hydrocortisone) is a natural glucocorticoid, which is secreted with circadian rhythm by the cortical cells of adrenal glands. Physiologically, about 10-20 mg of hydrocortisone are secreted each day for maintaining homeostasis. Since the biological half-life of natural glucocorticoid is short, scientists developed various synthetic glucocorticoids including prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, and so on. These synthetic glucocorticoids are generated by modifying some structures based on the cortisone backbone, leading to extension of their biological half-life with stronger activities. In the face of severe infection, allergy, shock, trauma, pain, and other stresses, the demand for glucocorticoids increases dramatically. It is critical to supplement extra glucocorticoids to protect the biological functions of vital organs. However, the amount and duration of glucocorticoid administration need to be carefully adjusted, because a series of side effects may occur after long-term or high-dose usage of glucocorticoids. This review article will discuss the application of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and solid tumors of advanced stage. The controversy of using glucocorticoid in medical community will also be discussed. This review article will help doctors and basic researchers better understand the practical application of glucocorticoids.","Yang, Ruixin; Yu, Yingyan",Int J Biol Sci,,109

255768,Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study,2020,"Lower and upper limb maximum muscular force development is an important indicator of physical capacity. Manual muscle testing, load cell coupled with a signal conditioner, and handheld dynamometry are three widely used techniques for measuring isometric muscle strength. Recently, there is a proliferation of low-cost tools that have potential to be used to measure muscle strength. This study examined both the criterion validity, inter-day reliability and intra-day reliability of a microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for quantifying muscle strength. To do so, a low-cost microcontroller-based load cell amplifier for measuring lower and upper limb maximal voluntary isometric muscular force was compared to a commercial grade signal conditioner and to a handheld dynamometer. The results showed that the microcontroller-based load cell amplifier correlated nearly perfectly (Pearson's R-values between 0.947 to 0.992) with the commercial signal conditioner and the handheld dynamometer, and showed good to excellent association when calculating ICC scores, with values of 0.9582 [95% C.I.: 0.9297-0.9752] for inter-day reliability and of 0.9269 [95% C.I.: 0.8909-0.9533] for session one, intra-day reliability. Such results may have implications for how the evaluation of muscle strength measurement is conducted in the future, particularly for offering a commercial-like grade quality, low cost, portable and flexible option.","Gaudet, Julie; Handrigan, Grant",,,109
256162,Prospective observational study and serosurvey of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic healthcare workers at a Canadian tertiary care center,2021,"We are currently in a rapidly expanding pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which originated in the city of Wuhan in central China. The disease COVID-19 is now spread worldwide and has tremendous socio-economic consequences. The origin of the virus can be reconstructed through epidemiological studies and, even more so, from genome comparisons. How the evolution of the virus and the transition to humans might have happened is the subject of much speculation. It is considered certain that the virus is of animal origin and very likely passed from bats to humans in a zoonotic event. An intermediate host was postulated, but many SARS-like bat viruses have the ability to infect human cells directly, which has been shown experimentally by scientists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology using collected specimens containing virus material from horseshoe bats. The propagation of SARS-like bat viruses in cell culture allowed experiments aimed at increasing the infectivity of the virus and adaptation to human cells. This article summarizes the unique properties of SARS-CoV-2 and focusses on a specific sequence encoding the spike protein. Possible scenarios of virus evolution are discussed, with particular emphasis on the hypothesis that the virus could have emerged unintentionally through routine culture or gain-of-function experiments in a laboratory, where it was optimally adapted to human cells and caused cryptic infections among workers who finally spread the virus causing the pandemic.","Kaina, Bernd",In Vivo,,109

They add further distress to the lives of people in Syria, who have already endured 9 years of war. This study evaluates distress and the major causes of concerns related to COVID-19 during the full lockdown. Methods: Online questionnaires were distributed using SPTSS, K10, and MSPSS which were used with other demographic, war- and COVID-19-related questions that were taken from The (CRISIS) V0.1 Adult Self-Report Baseline Form. Results: Our sample included 5,588 with the mean age of 26.84 ± 7.815 years. Of those, only one case of COVID-19 was confirmed. Over 42.7% had two or more positive PTSD symptoms, 42.6% had moderate or severe mental disorder, but only 14.9% had low social support. Higher PTSD and K10 scores overall were seen in female participants and with most of war variables (P < 0.05). Relationships with the partner being negatively affected and distress from a decline in ability to work and provide food were the most prominent. Conclusions: The indirect effects of COVID-19 are far more than that of the pathogen itself. A reduced ability to earn and to provide food were the main concerns indicated in this study. Relationships deteriorated in participants with high K10 and PTSD scores who also had more symptoms and used more hypnotics in the last four weeks. Smoking patterns were not related to K10 and PTSD. Social support played a role in reducing stress, but when relationships were affected, lower support was observed.","Kakaje, Ameer; Fadel, Ammar; Makki, Leen; Ghareeb, Ayham; Al Zohbi, Ragheed",Front Public Health,,109

260103,A severe case with co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory pathogens,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Daily medication is the cornerstone of evidence-based therapy to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). Up to 20% of Canadian patients pay for medications out of pocket. We sought to identify strategies that patients and prescribers can employ to reduce these costs. METHODS: We collected data from outpatient pharmacies in Hamilton, Ontario. We determined prices for different medications in each of the drug classes recommended for HF with reduced ejection fraction in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's guidelines. We examined differences in dispensing and delivery fees and inquired about other cost-saving strategies. RESULTS: We collected data from 24 different pharmacies, including a selection of hospital-based, independent, and larger chain pharmacies. In the most extreme scenario (i.e., 90-day prescription instead of a 30-day prescription and the least expensive generic drug instead of the most expensive brand name drug), total medication costs can differ by up to $495.56 per month. Costs were affected by choice of agent within a drug class, generic versus brand-name drug, quantity dispensed, dispensing fee, and delivery cost. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription content, dispensing practice, and pharmacy choice can remarkably impact out-of-pocket costs for HF medications. Prescribers can reduce costs by writing 90-day prescriptions and choosing the lowest-cost generic drugs in each therapeutic class. Patients should consider the services received for their pharmacy dispensing fees, use free delivery services where needed, and request inexpensive generic drugs. Pharmacists can facilitate cost minimization without compromising therapeutic efficacy.","McIntyre, William F; Belesiotis, Peter; McClure, Graham R; Demers, Catherine; Chahill, Gurneet; Hayes, Abigail; Sohi, Gursharan; Bordman, Wendy; Whitlock, Richard P; Belley-Côté, Emilie P",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,,109

264553,P3 Porto-mesenteric thrombosis in a non-cirrhotic patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"In the article a virus transmission model is constructed on a simplified social network. The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly distributed and undirected. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that at the end of the first epidemic wave, the infection was twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) and data assimilation approach to estimate the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty and to inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic, the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus biology, i.e. its reproduction number. In the controlled epidemic with low ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range forecasts. Virus transmission models with accurate social network models are thus essential for improving epidemics forecasting.","Zaplotnik, Ziga; Gavric, Aleksandar; Medic, Luka",PLoS One,,109

265508,Failed antibody response in a renal transplant recipient with SARS-CoV-2 infected,2020,"Comorbid medical illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes, are associated with more severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. However, the role of the immune system in mediating these clinical outcomes has not been determined. We used multi-parameter flow cytometry and systems serology to comprehensively profile the functions of T cells and antibodies targeting spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins in a convalescent cohort of COVID-19 subjects who were either hospitalized (n=20) or not hospitalized (n=40). To avoid confounding, subjects were matched by age, sex, ethnicity, and date of symptom onset. Surprisingly, we found that the magnitude and functional breadth of virus-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses were consistently higher among hospitalized subjects, particularly those with medical comorbidities. However, an integrated analysis identified more coordination between polyfunctional CD4 T-cells and antibodies targeting the S1 domain of spike among subjects that were not hospitalized. These data reveal a functionally diverse and coordinated response between T cells and antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 which is reduced in the presence of comorbid illnesses that are known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our data suggest that isolated measurements of the magnitudes of spike-specific immune responses are likely insufficient to anticipate vaccine efficacy in high-risk populations.","Yu, Krystle K Q; Fischinger, Stephanie; Smith, Malisa T; Atyeo, Caroline; Cizmeci, Deniz; Wolf, Caitlin R; Layton, Erik D; Logue, Jennifer K; Aguilar, Melissa S; Shuey, Kiel; Loos, Carolin; Yu, Jingyou; Franko, Nicholas; Choi, Robert Y; Wald, Anna; Barouch, Dan H; Koelle, David M; Lauffenburger, Douglas; Chu, Helen Y; Alter, Galit; Seshadri, Chetan",,,109

The goal of this paper is to describe the development steps and current design of a system providing medication decision support for isolated patients. With an increased number of patients living alone or isolated - a situation exacerbated during the COVID19 pandemic - polypharmacy patients may be challenged when PRN (as needed) medications confound what might ordinarily be a routine medication schedule.

However, research in the field of sentiment evolution analysis for complex interactive texts are notable. Sentiment evolution models the dynamics of sentiment orientation over time, it can predict the stage of event development. In this paper, we propose a sentiment evolution method based on a joint model to analyze the dynamics and interactions of individual sentiment on social media such as Weibo. The model contains two modules, sentiment encoder module based on pre-training model and time series prediction module based on Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM). We conducted experiments on real-world datasets which were crawled from Weibo. The experiment demonstrated a case study that analyzed the sentiment dynamics of topics related to COVID-19.

266098,Axonal Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a child,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of COVID-19, health care workers and first responders have been at high risk for mental health symptoms due to their exposure to the virus and higher work stress during the pandemic. Although interventions exist to address mental health issues following exposure to disasters, emergencies, and humanitarian crises, considerably less is known about web-based unguided interventions to help mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Additionally, in contexts in which emergencies reduce access to in-person care, remote forms of support are critical, yet there remains limited research on the use of such interventions. Evidence-based, easy to use and scalable interventions are direly needed for this population. OBJECTIVE: To develop and feasibility-test an unguided e-mental health program tailored to first responders and health care personnel based on scientific evidence and empirically based techniques. METHODS: We developed COVID-19- specific training modules focusing on several domains that previous research has indicated as key to resilience and stress recovery: self-efficacy, mindfulness, sleep, and positive thinking. The program was made available to 702 first responders between May and August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, work- and COVID-19-related information were collected, and psychometric questionnaires completed. We examined user acceptance and user activity, including module choice and participant feedback. RESULTS: Seven percent of all first responders we reached out to, n= 52, used the program at least once. COAST use was independent of age, sex, or baseline levels of self-efficacy, mindful awareness, sleep quality and positive thinking, all P >. 39. First-responders who had been tested positive and those who had been quarantined were more likely to engage in the program. A click-count analysis per module showed that participants used the self-efficacy and mindfulness modules most often, 382 and 122 clicks over 15 weeks, respectively. Overall, first responders expressed satisfaction with the program. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of first responders in a multi-module web-based COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training program was feasible and the first responder cohort expressed overall satisfaction with the program. Those in more difficult circumstances, i.e., in quarantine and those tested positive, may be more likely to engage in such programs. Further controlled studies could pave the way for efficacy studies and development of additional modules, including just-in time interventions or blended interventions combining individual use of an unguided self-help intervention, such as COAST, with subsequent individual psychotherapy for those who continue to experience stress and psychological symptoms.","Heyen, Janna Marie; Weigl, Noé; Müller, Mario; Müller, Stefan; Eberle, Urs; Manoliu, Andrei; Vetter, Stefan; Brown, Adam D; Berger, Thomas; Kleim, Birgit",,,109

The purpose of this study is to draw attention to the budding correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidality from the theoretical perspective of Emile Durkheim's sociology of suicide. A review of online newspaper databases (1 January to 30 April 2020) that reported suicide cases and attempts triggered as a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were included and analysed. Out of the 28 identified cases, there were three suicide attempts, one homicide-suicide/pact-suicide, and 24 suicides spanning 10 countries. Durkheim explained the social causation of suicide and provided a four-fold suicide typology. The cases were analysed according to their appropriate typology, and classified as egoistic (9), altruistic (3), anomic (8), and fatalistic (8). Durkheim suggests that the rise and fall of suicide rates will depend on the nature of social change. As society is undergoing massive social disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, suicide rates may increase unless suicide prevention measures align with the current social reconstruction process.","Khan, Anisur Rahman; Shimul, S M Anowarul Kayes; Arendse, Najuwa",Int. soc. sci. j,,109

This 1-DoF soft robot is modeled through the integral representation of the spacial curve. The direct and instantaneous kinematics are calculated explicitly through a modal method. The fixed centrode deviation (FCD) method is used to to detect the external contact and estimate contact location.

274991,"Correction: Sociodemographic characteristics and risk factors related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Luanda, Angola",2021,"Edge video analytics is becoming the solution to many safety and management tasks. Its wide deployment, however, must first address the tension between inference accuracy and resource (compute/network) cost. This has led to the development of video analytics pipelines (VAPs), which reduce resource cost by combining DNN compression/speedup techniques with video processing heuristics. Our measurement study on existing VAPs, however, shows that today's methods for evaluating VAPs are incomplete, often producing premature conclusions or ambiguous results. This is because each VAP's performance varies substantially across videos and time (even under the same scenario) and is sensitive to different subsets of video content characteristics. We argue that accurate VAP evaluation must first characterize the complex interaction between VAPs and video characteristics, which we refer to as VAP performance clarity. We design and implement Yoda, the first VAP benchmark to achieve performance clarity. Using primitive-based profiling and a carefully curated benchmark video set, Yoda builds a performance clarity profile for each VAP to precisely define its accuracy/cost tradeoff and its relationship with video characteristics. We show that Yoda substantially improves VAP evaluations by (1) providing a comprehensive, transparent assessment of VAP performance and its dependencies on video characteristics; (2) explicitly identifying fine-grained VAP behaviors that were previously hidden by large performance variance; and (3) revealing strengths/weaknesses among different VAPs and new design opportunities.","Xiao, Zhujun; Xia, Zhengxu; Zheng, Haitao; Zhao, Ben Y.; Jiang, Junchen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.08694v1.pdf,109

METHODS: Data were provided by adults with RA participating in FORWARD, The National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases, observational registry who answered COVID-19 web-based surveys in May 2020 and previously provided baseline (pre-COVID) characteristics and medication use. We compared medication changes by DMARD exposure in logistic models adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities including pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, education, health insurance, RA activity, fatigue, and polysymptomatic distress. RESULTS: Of 734 respondents, 221 (30%) reported medication changes. Changers more commonly used glucocorticoids (GCs) (33% vs 18%) and less commonly used non-hydroxychloroquine conventional DMARDs (49% vs 62%) pre-COVID and reported more economic hardship during COVID (23% vs 15%). While JAK inhibitor use was associated (OR 1.9 [95%CI 1.0, 3.4]) with change, only pre-COVID GCs remained a strong predictor (OR 3.0 [1.9, 4.9]) in multivariable models. Change in care was significantly associated with pulmonary disease (OR 2.9 [1.3, 6.5]), worse RA activity (OR 1.1 [1.0, 1.1]), and GC use (OR 1.6 [1.0, 2.5]). While the incidence of medication change before and after ACR guidelines were published was the same, self-imposed changes were approximately twice as likely before, and physician guided changes were more likely after. CONCLUSION: Persons with RA in the US made substantial medication changes during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes after publication of ACR recommendations were made with increased physician guidance.","Michaud, Kaleb; Pedro, Sofia; Wipfler, Kristin; Agarwal, Ekta; Katz, Patricia",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),,109

278006,"SARS-CoV-2 immunity, infective and naïve incidence in fertility clinics after lockdown",2021,"Background: COVID-19 affects not only patients' physical health but also their mental health. For the general public, although their physical health may not be directly affected, their mental health may be affected by stress, anxiety, and social panic caused by COVID-19. Controlling the pandemic should focus on not only physical health but also mental health. For the general public, mental health is even more important, as good mental health at the individual level can form a positive social mentality conducive to pandemic prevention and control. Therefore, it is important to assess mental health during the pandemic, and analyze risk and protective factors. Methods: A self-compiled COVID-19 Social Mentality Questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey. A total of 16,616 participants responded, with 13,511 valid questionnaires. Results: Results showed that 10.7% of participants rated their mental health as ""worse than usual"" during the pandemic, and there were gender, age, and educational differences. Social support was positively correlated with pandemic-related knowledge and self-efficacy, and could indirectly predict mental health. Pandemic-related knowledge was positively correlated with self-efficacy and mental health, and risk level was negatively correlated with mental health. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that pandemic-related knowledge played a partial mediating role in the relationship between social support and self-efficacy, while self-efficacy played a complete mediating role in the relationship between social support and mental health. Logistic regression analysis showed that risk level moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and mental health. Conclusions: Social support can increase pandemic-related knowledge, thus improving self-efficacy and maintaining/promoting mental health. High risk levels can undermine the role of self-efficacy in promoting mental health. Therefore, in the fight against the COVID-19, people need to support and cooperate with each other, to improve self-efficacy and reduce risk, thus maintaining and promoting mental health.","Wang, Shengnan; Feng, Kai; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Jianan; Wang, Wei; Li, Yongxin",Front Psychiatry,,109

Observational study and review of the literature",2021,"Nowadays, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global health problem and, given the high mortality and transmission rate of this infection and the lack of approved or specific treatments for it so far, the exploitation of the potentials of existing drugs is of paramount importance, hence, we aimed to investigate all possible COVID-19-related mechanisms of systemic retinoids. We systematically searched all related evidence in various data bases about the effect of retinoic acids on respiratory failure as the most important COVID-19-related complication and the other important potentials of this drug to affect COVID pathomechanism. Considering the various behaviors and presentations of this virus in different people, paying attention to the underlying diseases, physical conditions, genetics, and medications that cause these differences may be helpful in reducing the mortality and morbidity of the disease. In the field of dermatology, retinoids are a group of drugs that have controversial evidence regarding their effects when administered to patients with COVID-19. On one hand, these drugs offer immunomodulatory, immune-enhancing, antiviral, and antiangiogenesis activity, and can stimulate the differentiation and repair of epithelial cells. On the other hand, they can increase inflammation and cause the fragility of oral and nasal mucosae. When prescribe systemic retinoids, all of these aspects should be considered in all fields of the medicine and dermatology is not an exception.","Sadeghzadeh-Bazargan, A.; Behrangi, E.; Goodarzi, A.",Iranian Journal of Dermatology,,109
282508,Two Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pediatric Oncohematologic Patients in Spain,2020,"Sludge dewatering is an important step for wastewater treatment. Composite degradable flocculant (CDF) was prepared by cationic polyacrylamide (PAM) grafting onto modified starch with a novel initiator, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The microstructure of flocculated sludge was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The study investigated the properties of CDF compared to PAM, which showed that the prepared CDF exhibited a highly effective flocculation on sludge dewatering, a higher transmittance and chemical oxygen demand removal rate, and a lower value of effluent ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus. The fermentation process was also analyzed by testing the performance of dewatered sludge (temperature, pH, ammonia nitrogen, E4/E6 (humic acid absorbance at 465 nm (E4) and 665 nm (E6))). The dehydrated sludge with CDF could be easily compressed into cakes by belt-filter for easy transportation and storage. With the continuous addition of CDF and PAM, the corresponding index of capillary suction time (CST) increased. Moreover, the total value of CST with CDF was low, showing a good dewaterability. In addition, the sludge index of pumping time and moisture content with CDF were low in contrast with PAM. Fermentation experiments demonstrated that sludge with CDF had a comparatively high temperature and low value of E4/E6. Such novel CDF shows enormous potential in wastewater treatment and sludge fermentation.","Liu, Jianbo; Jia, Shouhao; Xu, Liming; Zhu, Feifei; Ren, Shan; Liu, Yuanfeng; Sun, Ziqi",Water Sci Technol,,109
282640,First report on prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care workers in Nicaragua,2021,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy associated with numerous viral infections. Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and GBS, but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. We reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 to summarize this information for clinicians and to determine whether a specific clinical or electrodiagnostic (EDx) pattern is emerging. The mean age (59 years), gender (65% male), and COVID-19 features appeared to reflect those of hospitalized COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic. The mean time from COVID-19 symptoms to GBS symptoms was 11 days. The clinical presentation and severity of these GBS cases was similar to those with non-COVID-19 GBS. The EDx pattern was considered demyelinating in approximately half of the cases. Cerebrospinal fluid, when assessed, demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation in 76% of patients and was negative for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all cases. Serum antiganglioside antibodies were absent in 15 of 17 patients tested. Most patients were treated with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement was noted within 8 weeks in most cases. GBS-associated COVID-19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and EDx patterns to GBS before the pandemic. Future studies should compare patients with COVID-19-associated GBS to those with contemporaneous non-COVID-19 GBS and determine whether the incidence of GBS is elevated in those with COVID-19.","Caress, James B; Castoro, Ryan J; Simmons, Zachary; Scelsa, Stephen N; Lewis, Richard A; Ahlawat, Aditi; Narayanaswami, Pushpa",Muscle nerve,,109

Some have argued that immunity passports are unethical and impractical, pointing to uncertainties relating to COVID-19 immunity, issues with testing, perverse incentives, doubtful economic benefits, privacy concerns, and the risk of discriminatory effects. We first review the scientific feasibility of immunity passports. Considerable hurdles remain, but increasing understanding of the neutralising antibody response to COVID-19 might make identifying members of the community at low risk of contracting and transmitting COVID-19 possible. We respond to the ethical arguments against immunity passports and give the positive ethical arguments. First, a strong presumption should be in favour of preserving people's free movement if at all feasible. Second, failing to recognise the reduced infection threat immune individuals pose risks punishing people for low-risk behaviour. Finally, further individual and social benefits are likely to accrue from allowing people to engage in free movement. Challenges relating to the implementation of immunity passports ought to be met with targeted solutions so as to maximise their benefit.","Brown, Rebecca C H; Kelly, Dominic; Wilkinson, Dominic; Savulescu, Julian","Lancet, Infect. dis.

285443,Guillain-Barré syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Italy had the highest number of deaths in Europe; most occurred in the Lombardy region. Up to 4% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to an intensive care unit because they developed a critical illness (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Numerous patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who had been admitted to the intensive care unit required rescue therapy like prone positioning. OBJECTIVES: To describe the respiratory management of and the extensive use of prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 at the intensive care unit hub in Lombardy, Italy. METHODS: A total of 89 patients (67% male; median age, 59 years [range, 23-80 years]) with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted between February 23 and March 31, 2020, were enrolled in this quality improvement project. RESULTS: Endotracheal intubation was required in 86 patients (97%). Prone positioning was used as rescue therapy in 43 (48%) patients. Significantly more younger patients (age &#8804; 59 years) were discharged alive (43 of 48 [90%]) than were older patients (age &#8805; 60 years; 26 of 41 [63%]; P < .005). Among the 43 patients treated with prone ventilation, 15 (35% [95% CI, 21%-51%]) died in the intensive care unit, of which 10 (67%; P < .001) were older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning is one strategy available for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19. During this pandemic, prone positioning can be used extensively as rescue therapy, per a specific protocol, in intensive care units.","Binda, Filippo; Marelli, Federica; Galazzi, Alessandro; Pascuzzo, Riccardo; Adamini, Ileana; Laquintana, Dario",Crit Care Nurse,,109

A first wave is visible up to the end of June 2020 in many regions. This article presents a review of the current knowledge on the epidemiology and prevention. The SARS-CoV­2 predominantly replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and is particularly transmitted by droplets and aerosols. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2-14 days). As with the related SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), superspreading events play an important role in the dissemination. A high proportion of infections are uncomplicated but moderate or severe courses develop in 5-10% of infected persons. Pneumonia, cardiac involvement and thromboembolisms are the most frequent manifestations leading to hospitalization. Risk factors for a complicated course are high age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as immunodeficiency. Currently, the estimation for the infection fatality rate (IFR) is between 0.5% and 1% across all age groups. Outbreaks were limited in many regions with bundles of various measures for reduction of social contacts. The incidence for the first wave in Germany can be estimated as 0.4-1.8% and excess mortality could not be observed.","Salzberger, Bernd; Buder, Felix; Lampl, Benedikt; Ehrenstein, Boris; Hitzenbichler, Florian; Holzmann, Thomas; Schmidt, Barbara; Hanses, Frank",Nephrologe,,109

However, with no standardised regulation of the internet, the population is vulnerable to misinformation regarding important health information. This review aimed to evaluate the quality and readability of the online information available on emergency contraception (EC) options. STUDY DESIGN: In this descriptive study, a Google search was performed using the term 'emergency contraception options' on 13 April 2020 yielding 232 results. Seventy-one results were excluded (34 inaccessible, 37 contained no medical information). The remaining 161 results were categorised by typology and assessed for credibility (JAMA criteria and HONcode), reliability (DISCERN tool) and readability (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook). RESULTS: Of all webpages evaluated, the most common typology was governmental. Credibility of web pages was poor (average JAMA score of 1.47 out of 4). Only 10.6% of webpages were HONcode certified. The most common DISCERN category was Fair (29.81%), closely followed by Poor (27.95%) reliability. On average, readability levels were above the recommended grade level for health information. The intrauterine device was discussed least frequently (86.96%) of all the EC options. CONCLUSION: Online information was of low credibility, reliability and written above the recommended reading level. Clinicians should be aware of the poor quality of online information on EC options, and actively educate patients on what makes a source credible.","Agrawal, Simrita; Irwin, Ciara; Dhillon-Smith, Rima K",Eur J Contracept Reprod Health Care,,109

295117,"Frequency of symptoms and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in New Orleans, Louisiana",2020,"This study proposes a method for calculating the appropriate medical treatment price level for foreign visitors (FVs) in Japan. Hospital management costs and foreign prices were analyzed from a market principles perspective to determine the medical treatment price. The study involved two stages: a preliminary survey and an extended survey, supplemented by an international survey. Relatively frequent diseases were selected, and the costs incurred by hospitals for the treatment of FVs were analyzed though data from three hospitals, covering 24 outpatients and 4 inpatients. Payments made by three insurance companies for overseas medical institution services for Japanese tourists with pharyngitis were analyzed. This study shows that the appropriate medical treatment prices for FVs, considering profits, were 1.22-4.26 times higher compared with prices under Japan's public health insurance plans. Furthermore, these prices were 1.31-4.26 times higher for outpatients with pharyngitis and external injury and 1.22-3.66 times higher for inpatients with appendicitis and femoral fractures. The price of pharyngitis treatment in 12 countries was USD 20.32-158.75 per patient for Japanese tourists, whereas FVs paid 60.24 dollars (1.13 times higher than Japan's public healthcare price) in Japan. This study shows it was appropriate to set the ideal price level for FVs higher than that for Japanese patients.","Takura, Tomoyuki",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,109

Material and Methods: An observational study with a cross-sectional ecological design, using data from the Health Information System for Primary Care. Data regarding the number of Oral Health Teams (OHT), Oral Health Coverage in Primary Care (OHC), number of First Programmatic Dental Consultations (FPDC), and number of visits due to dental abscess and toothache were collected. Data regarding the 26 Brazilian states and Federal District were collected, as consolidated of the first quarter (January to April) of 2019 and of 2020. The median of the difference (MD) and the percentage of variation (%V) were obtained for each variable and were compared by Wilcoxon test (&#945;&lt;0.05). Results: An increase in the number of OHT was observed in 25 states (MD=45; %V=6.13; p&lt;0.001), whilst the OHC increased in 17 states (MD=1.01; %V=1.62; p=0.035) between the 2019 and 2020. We also verified a significant reduction in the number of FPDC (MD=- 42.806; %V=-38.70; p&lt;0.001), as well as in the number of visits due to dental abscess (MD=-1.032; %V=-29.04; p=0.002) and due to toothache (MD=-14.445; %V=-32.68; p&lt;0.001).

297901,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Pediatric Department in Milan: A Logistic Rather Than a Clinical Emergency,2020,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is now dominated by variant lineages; the resulting impact on disease severity remains unclear. Using a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the risk of hospitalization following infection with nine variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI). MethodsOur study includes individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the Washington Disease Reporting System and with available viral genome data, from December 1, 2020 to July 30, 2021. The main analysis was restricted to cases with specimens collected through sentinel surveillance. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of hospitalization following infection with a VOC/VOI, adjusting for age, sex, and vaccination status. FindingsOf the 27,814 cases, 23,170 (83.3%) were sequenced through sentinel surveillance, of which 726 (3.1%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Higher hospitalization risk was found for infections with Gamma (HR 3.17, 95% CI 2.15-4.67), Beta (HR: 2.97, 95% CI 1.65-5.35), Delta (HR: 2.30, 95% CI 1.69-3.15), and Alpha (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26-1.99) compared to infections with an ancestral lineage. Following VOC infection, unvaccinated patients show a similar higher hospitalization risk, while vaccinated patients show no significant difference in risk, both when compared to unvaccinated, ancestral lineage cases. InterpretationInfection with a VOC results in a higher hospitalization risk, with an active vaccination attenuating that risk. Our findings support promoting hospital preparedness, vaccination, and robust genomic surveillance.","Paredes, Miguel I.; Lunn, Stephanie; Famulare, Michael; Frisbie, Lauren A.; Painter, Ian; Burstein, Roy; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Xie, Hong; Bakhash, Shah A.

METHOD: The healthcare workers who use the N95 face-mask, between 30-50 years of age who have best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) &#8805;10/10, spherical or cylindrical refraction errors less than 2 diopters, with normal intra ocular pressure (IOP), axial length (AL) between 22-24 mm included in the study. The choroid was imaged with enhanced depth imaging (EDI) techniques using SD-OCT. CT was measured, subfoveal, at 1000 µm nasal and temporal of the center of the fovea. Measurements were first made after wearing the N95 mask for at least 2 h without removing it and repeated 15 min after removing. RESULTS: After 2 h of the N95 mask using without removal, the mean subfoveal CT was 293.56 ± 76.12(min:185, max:479), the mean temporal CT was 253.81 ± 63.48(min:172, max:384), the mean nasal CT was 239.18 ± 53.92(min:139, max:356). Fifteen minutes after removal of the N95 mask, the mean subfoveal CT was 250.56 ± 52.48(min:172, max:397), the mean temporal was 218.40 ± 53.58(min:129, max:354), the mean nasal CT was 210.67 ± 53.31(min:132, max:366). The differences in subfoveal, temporal and nasal CT between 2 h of N95 mask use and 15 min after removal of the mask were statistically significant (p < 0.05 for each). CONCLUSION: Hypercapnia due to prolonged use of the N95 mask may cause choroidal hemodynamic changes and transient increased choroidal thickness.","Karatas Durusoy, Gonul; Gumus, Gulsah; Demir, Gokhan",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,109

However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades host immunity remain poorly understood. Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 membrane glycoprotein M as a negative regulator of the innate immune response. We found that the M protein interacted with the central adaptor protein MAVS in the innate immune response pathways. This interaction impaired MAVS aggregation and its recruitment of downstream TRAF3, TBK1, and IRF3, leading to attenuation of the innate antiviral response. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades the innate immune response and suggest that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for the development of SARS-CoV-2 interventions.","Fu, Yu-Zhi; Wang, Su-Yun; Zheng, Zhou-Qin; Li, Wei-Wei; Xu, Zhi-Sheng; Wang, Yan-Yi",Cell. mol. immunol.

Little is known about the laboratory surface areas and operation behaviors that may cause potential contamination in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. This study aims to provide reference basis for the improvement of laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating protocols. In this study, we compared the qRT-PCR and ddPCR in detecting of residual virus that existed on the object surfaces from sample transportation and reception related facilities, testing related instruments, personal protective equipment and other facilities in nucleic acid testing laboratory. All samples were negative by qRT-PCR, in contrast, 13 of 61 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by ddPCR. The areas with highest density of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were the outer gloves of operator A (37.4 copies/cm2), followed by door handle of 4 °C refrigerator (26.25 copies/cm2), goggles of operator A (22.16 copies/cm2), outer cover of high speed centrifuge (19.95 copies/cm2), inner wall of high speed centrifuge (14.70 copies/cm2) and others. We found that all the positive objects were directly or indirectly contacted by the operator's gloved hands, suggesting that hands contact was the main transmission pathway that led to laboratory environmental contamination. In summary, ddPCR has an advantage over qRT-PCR in tracing laboratory contamination. We evaluated the risk areas and operation behaviors that may easily cause contamination, and provided recommendation for improving the laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating specifications.","Lv, Jun; Yang, Jin; Xue, Juan; Zhu, Ping; Liu, Lanfang; Li, Shan",Sci Total Environ,,109

This is especially so in the case of health research with children. The responsible use of children's data plays a key role in promoting children's well-being and securing their right to health and to privacy. In this article, we contend that a contextual approach that appropriately balances children's legal and moral rights and interests is needed when thinking about data protection issues with children. We examine three issues in health research through a child-focused lens: consent to data processing, data retention, and data protection impact assessments. We show that these issues present distinctive concerns for children and that the General Data Protection Regulation provides few bright-line rules. We contend that there is an opportunity for creative approaches to children's data protection when child-specific principles, such as the best interests of the child and the child's right to be heard, are put into dialogue with the structure and logic of data protection law.","Beauvais, M.

We performed a comprehensive quantitative assessment of pre-existing clinical phenotypes associated with COVID-19-related hospitalization. METHODS: Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients from an integrated health system (Geisinger) with system-level outpatient/inpatient COVID-19 testing capacity and retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data to assess pre-COVID-19 pandemic clinical phenotypes associated with hospital admission (hospitalization). RESULTS: Of 12,971 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 with sufficient pre-COVID-19 pandemic EHR data at Geisinger, 1604 were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 354 required hospitalization. We identified 21 clinical phenotypes in 5 disease categories meeting phenome-wide significance (P<1.60x10-4), including: six kidney phenotypes, e.g. end stage renal disease or stage 5 CKD (OR = 11.07, p = 1.96x10-8), six cardiovascular phenotypes, e.g. congestive heart failure (OR = 3.8, p = 3.24x10-5), five respiratory phenotypes, e.g. chronic airway obstruction (OR = 2.54, p = 3.71x10-5), and three metabolic phenotypes, e.g. type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.80, p = 7.51x10-5). Additional analyses defining CKD based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, confirmed high risk of hospitalization associated with pre-existing stage 4 CKD (OR 2.90, 95% CI: 1.47, 5.74), stage 5 CKD/dialysis (OR 8.83, 95% CI: 2.76, 28.27), and kidney transplant (OR 14.98, 95% CI: 2.77, 80.8) but not stage 3 CKD (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.48).

Provision of dental services was significantly affected, with limited provision for emergencies resulting in patients increasingly attending hospitals.Objectives and methods The aim of the study was to assess the provision of emergency dental services by the maxillofacial departments during the initial COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the United Kingdom. At the outset of the first lockdown, we initiated a prospective study to monitor the presentation and management of dental emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data were collected onto an online live database until the lockdown relaxation.Results Of a total of 211 dental emergencies, 156 were infection-related, 42 were trauma-related and 12 were cases of post-operative complications. A proportion of patients (76%) could have been treated in primary care, with 52% of presentations having already been 'triaged' on several occasions by urgent dental hubs and given multiple antibiotic courses, rather than any direct treatment.Conclusion There is a need to restructure emergency dental service provision as well as planning for possible further COVID-19 spikes and future pandemics.","Blackhall, Kristian K; Singh, Rabindra P",Br. dent. j,,109

METHOD: To treat pregnant patients meeting criteria for severe or critical COVID-19 with high-dose (160-200 ppm) nitric oxide by mask twice daily and report on their clinical response. EXPERIENCE: Six pregnant patients were admitted with severe or critical COVID-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital from April to June 2020 and received inhalational nitric oxide therapy. All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A total of 39 treatments was administered. An improvement in cardiopulmonary function was observed after commencing nitric oxide gas, as evidenced by an increase in systemic oxygenation in each administration session among those with evidence of baseline hypoxemia and reduction of tachypnea in all patients in each session. Three patients delivered a total of four neonates during hospitalization. At 28-day follow-up, all three patients were home and their newborns were in good condition. Three of the six patients remain pregnant after hospital discharge. Five patients had two negative test results on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 within 28 days from admission.

310774,Invisible spread of SARS-CoV-2 - Authors' reply,2020,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second most common cause of death in women. Estrogen plays an important role in breast tumor etiopathogenesis. Tamoxifen and other anti-estrogen drugs are used in breast cancer patients who have a positive estrogen receptor (ER). While angiotensin II plays a key role in breast cancer etiology and causes tamoxifen resistance, angiotensin 1-7 has been reported to may reduce the spread and invasion of breast cancer. During the COVID-19 infection, the virus blocks ACE2, and angiotensin 1-7 production discontinued. Angiotensin III production may increase as angiotensin II destruction is reduced. Thus, aminopeptidase upregulation may occur. Increased aminopeptidase may develop resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Estrogen can have a protective effect against COVID-19. Estrogen increase causes ER-&#945; upregulation in T lymphocytes. Thus, estrogen increases the release of interferon I and III from T lymphocytes. Increasing interferon I and III alleviates COVID-19 infection. Tamoxifen treatment causes down-regulation, mutation, or loss in estrogen receptors. In the long-term use of tamoxifen, its effects on estrogen receptors can be permanent. Thus, since estrogen receptors are damaged or downregulated, estrogen may not act by binding to these receptors. Tamoxifen is a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, independent of its effect on estrogen receptors. It suppresses T cell functions and interferon release. We think tamoxifen may increase the COVID-19 risk due to its antiestrogen and P-glycoprotein inhibitory effects.","Vatansev, Hulya; Kadiyoran, Cengiz; Cumhur Cure, Medine; Cure, Erkan",Med Hypotheses,,109

There are many unknowns about this virus to date and no vaccine or conclusive treatment due to the lack of understanding of its pathogenesis and proliferation pathways which are unknown and cannot be traced. The prime objective is to stop its spread worldwide. This article aims to provide predictions of its spread using a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model coupled with an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to model the COVID-19 dynamics. Our results show the feasibility of utilizing this model for predicting the spread of the virus and the ability of different control measures (e.g., social distancing) on reducing the number of affected people.","Younes, Ahmad Bani; Hasan, Zeaid",Appl.

OBJECTIVES: We estimated the association between patients' characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome in Mexico. METHODS: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalisation and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalisation and adverse outcome. RESULTS: Overall, 236â439 patients were included, with 89â756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalised and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalisation and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.","Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Sussman, Roberto A; Mier, José M; Poulas, Konstantinos; Farsalinos, Konstantinos",Eur. respir. j,,109

In this study the Poles' knowledge about COVID-19 as well as people's behaviours, attitudes and fears during the pandemic were assessed. Changes in these between the outset of the pandemic and the imposition of the strictest lockdown measures in Poland were investigated. METHODS: Physicians, nurses, students of medicine-oriented faculties, non-medical professionals, students of non-medicine-oriented faculties and secondary school students were surveyed by an anonymous online questionnaire two times: at the onset of the pandemic and in the second week of the strictest lockdown. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests - Pearson Chi Square, Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: In total 2618 responses were collected. At the beginning people knew that the respiratory system was attacked (97.9%); correctly identified the major symptoms of COVID-19 (95.0%) and ways to prevent infection: hand washing (99.8%), covering mouth (85.9%) and the need to call sanitary-epidemiological services if one experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (92.1%). The biggest changes between the first and second phase of the study concerned behaviours: more people wearing facial masks (+ 37.5%) and staying at home (+ 66.1%). Respondents in the second wave of the survey were also more scared of the pandemic (+ 19.6%), economic crisis (+ 64.1%), and worried about their families (+ 26.5%). However, they were less afraid of the quarantine (lockdown) (- 18.2%). Nurses and physicians were the most worried groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that even at the outset of the pandemic Polish population had a good initial knowledge about symptoms, transmission, and preventive behaviours regarding COVID-19. People revealed more short-term concerns, such as the worries about coping with quarantine and isolation. After a month, the knowledge and the concerns among the respondents changed. A shift towards long-term pandemic management issues was observed. Respondents reported to experience more fears concerning the pandemic in general, as well as economic and healthcare crises. Medical professionals reported higher level of fear of the pandemic than other groups included in this study. This study uses before-and-after approach which highlights the changes in people's knowledge and perception of the COVID-19 pandemic during the pandemic's progression.","Nazar, Wojciech; Leszkowicz, Julia; Pienkowska, Agata; Brzezinski, Michal; Szlagatys-Sidorkiewicz, Agnieszka; Plata-Nazar, Katarzyna",BMC Infect Dis,,109

By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19.

Beyond respiratory distress,2021,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among Behçet's syndrome (BS) patients, evaluating the possible association between demographic and clinical features and the risk of infection. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the possible association between BS disease activity and treatment, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A survey was conducted on BS patients followed at the Behçet's Centre of the Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy. We further evaluated the possible association between BS disease activity and treatment, and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Out of 335 BS patients contacted, fourteen cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified between April 1st, 2020 and February 9th, 2021, suggesting a prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among BS patients of 4.2%, in line with the data of the general population in Italy (4.4%). When comparing clinical features between SARS-CoV-2 cases and matched SARS-CoV-2 negative BS patients, we found that the presence of different disease manifestations did not significantly differ between the two groups. SARS-CoV-2 cases and controls were also comparable in terms of immunosuppressive therapy, with the only exception of corticosteroids (71.4% vs. 35.7%, p=0.030), whose daily dose was significantly higher in cases than controls [5mg/day (IQR 0-10,) vs. 0 mg/day (IQR 0-5), p=0.005], suggesting that the right timing of usage and the more appropriate dosage of corticosteroid are a key question for the better management of these patients.

The results confirmed that personality vulnerability factors underscored by a negative sense of self (i.e., self-criticism and dependency) and individual difference factors reflecting self-esteem, feelings of mattering, and fear of not mattering are associated in meaningful ways with adaptability to the pandemic, loneliness, distress, negative mood states, and positive mood states. Most notably, higher self-reported adaptability to the pandemic is associated with lower dependency, self-criticism, and fear of not mattering, and higher levels of self-esteem and mattering. The findings attest to the central role of adaptability and related individual difference factors in acclimatizing to the numerous changes and challenges associated with the COVID-19 crisis. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed.","Besser, Avi; Flett, Gordon L; Nepon, Taryn; Zeigler-Hill, Virgil",Int J Ment Health Addict,,109

333836,Psychiatric and Cognitive Morbidity Following Moderate and Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Cohort Study (preprint),2021,"Zinc finger protein 554 (ZNF554), a member of the Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger protein subfamily, is predominantly expressed in the brain and placenta in humans. Recently, we unveiled that ZNF554 regulates trophoblast invasion during placentation and its decreased expression leads to the early pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Since ZNF proteins are immensely implicated in the development of several tumors including malignant tumors of the brain, here we explored the pathological role of ZNF554 in gliomas. We examined the expression of ZNF554 at mRNA and protein levels in normal brain and gliomas, and then we searched for genome-wide transcriptomic changes in U87 glioblastoma cells transiently overexpressing ZNF554. Immunohistochemistry of brain tissues in our cohort (n = 62) and analysis of large TCGA RNA-Seq data (n = 687) of control, oligodendroglioma, and astrocytoma tissues both revealed decreased expression of ZNF554 towards higher glioma grades. Furthermore, low ZNF554 expression was associated with shorter survival of grade III and IV astrocytoma patients. Overexpression of ZNF554 in U87 cells resulted in differential expression, mostly downregulation of 899 genes. The ""PI3K-Akt signaling pathway"", known to be activated during glioma development, was the most impacted among 116 dysregulated pathways. Most affected pathways were cancer-related and/or immune-related. Congruently, cell proliferation was decreased and cell cycle was arrested in ZNF554-transfected glioma cells. These data collectively suggest that ZNF554 is a potential tumor suppressor and its decreased expression may lead to the loss of oncogene suppression, activation of tumor pathways, and shorter survival of patients with malignant glioma.","Balogh, Andrea; Reiniger, Lilla; Hetey, Szabolcs; Kiraly, Peter; Toth, Eszter; Karaszi, Katalin; Juhasz, Kata; Gelencser, Zsolt; Zvara, Agnes; Szilagyi, Andras; Puskas, Laszlo G; Matko, Janos; Papp, Zoltan; Kovalszky, Ilona; Juhasz, Csaba; Than, Nandor Gabor",,,109

OBJECTIVES: This study described the clinical profile and associated outcomes among patients with HF hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 6,439 patients admitted for COVID-19 at 1 of 5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27 and June 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and outcomes (length of stay, need for intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality) were captured from electronic health records. For patients identified as having a history of HF by International Classification of Diseases-9th and/or 10th Revisions codes, manual chart abstraction informed etiology, functional class, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). RESULTS: Mean age was 63.5 years, and 45% were women. Compared with patients without HF, those with previous HF experienced longer length of stay (8 days vs. 6 days; p < 0.001), increased risk of mechanical ventilation (22.8% vs. 11.9%; adjusted odds ratio: 3.64; 95% confidence interval: 2.56 to 5.16; p < 0.001), and mortality (40.0% vs. 24.9%; adjusted odds ratio: 1.88; 95% confidence interval: 1.27 to 2.78; p = 0.002). Outcomes among patients with HF were similar, regardless of LVEF or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitor use. CONCLUSIONS: History of HF was associated with higher risk of mechanical ventilation and mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, regardless of LVEF.","Alvarez-Garcia, Jesus; Lee, Samuel; Gupta, Arjun; Cagliostro, Matthew; Joshi, Aditya A; Rivas-Lasarte, Mercedes; Contreras, Johanna; Mitter, Sumeet S; LaRocca, Gina; Tlachi, Pilar; Brunjes, Danielle; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Levin, Matthew A; Nadkarni, Girish; Fayad, Zahi; Fuster, Valentin; Mancini, Donna; Lala, Anuradha",J Am Coll Cardiol,,109
335285,TEMPORARY REMOVAL: Hospital factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel in Greece,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded, zoonotic RNA viruses. Four CoVs commonly circulate among humans: HCoV2-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43. However, CoVs can rapidly mutate and recombine leading to novel CoVs that can spread from animals to humans. The novel CoVs severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing a severe outbreak of disease (termed COVID-19) in China and multiple other countries, threatening to cause a global pandemic. In humans, CoVs mostly cause respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe disease such as bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seem to less commonly affect children and to cause fewer symptoms and less severe disease in this age group compared with adults, and are associated with much lower case-fatality rates. Preliminary evidence suggests children are just as likely as adults to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 but are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms. However, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. Children more often have gastrointestinal symptoms compared with adults. Most children with SARS-CoV present with fever, but this is not the case for the other novel CoVs. Many children affected by MERS-CoV are asymptomatic. The majority of children infected by novel CoVs have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before them. In contrast, adults more often have a nosocomial exposure. In this review, we summarize epidemiologic, clinical and diagnostic findings, as well as treatment and prevention options for common circulating and novel CoVs infections in humans with a focus on infections in children.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,109

SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing data were collected from 97 clinical laboratories, including 84 medical institutions and 13 independent clinical laboratories in Korea. We assessed the testing capacities to utilize SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR based on surveillance data obtained from February 7th to June 4th, 2020 and evaluated positive result characteristics according to the reagents used and sample types. A total of 1,890,319 SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing were performed, 2.3% of which were positive. Strong correlations were observed between the envelope (E) gene and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/nucleocapsid (N) genes threshold cycle (Ct) values for each reagent. No statistically significant differences in gene Ct values were observed between the paired upper and lower respiratory tract samples, except in the N gene for nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples. Our study showed that clinical laboratories in Korea have rapidly expanded their testing capacities in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with a peak daily capacity of 34,193 tests. Rapid expansion in testing capacity is a critical component of the national response to the ongoing pandemic.","Huh, Hee Jae; Hong, Ki Ho; Kim, Taek Soo; Song, Sang Hoon; Roh, Kyoung Ho; Lee, Hyukmin; Kwon, Gye Cheol",Ann Lab Med,,109

CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices were subjected to ELF-EMFs stimulation with different frequencies (15 and 50 Hz), intensities (0.5, 1 and 2 mT) and durations (10, 20 and 30 min). The INa, IA and IK of neurons were recorded by a whole-cell patch-clamp method. ELF-EMFs stimulation enhanced INa densities, and depressed IA and IK densities. In detail, INa was more sensitive to the variation of intensities and frequencies of ELF-EMFs, whereas IA and IK were mainly affected by the variation of the duration of ELF-EMFs. ELF-EMFs stimulation altered activation and deactivation properties of INa, IA and IK. ELF-EMFs stimulation plays a role as a regulator rather than an inducer for ion channels. It might change the transition probability of ion channel opening or closing, and might also change the structure and function of the ion channel which need to be proved by the further technical method.","Zheng, Yu; Xia, Pei; Dong, Lei; Tian, Lei; Xiong, Chan",Electromagn Biol Med,,109

In the absence of a vaccine, this entails that a large proportion of the population will be infected to develop immunity that would limit the severity and/or extent of subsequent outbreaks. We argue that adopting such an approach should be avoided for several reasons. There are significant uncertainties about whether achieving herd immunity is possible. If possible, achieving herd immunity would impose a large burden on society. There are gaps in protection, making it difficult to shield the vulnerable. It would defeat the purpose of avoiding harm caused by the virus. Lastly, dozens of countries are showing that containment is possible.","Khalife, Jade; VanGennep, Derrick",Epidemiol Health,,109

METHODS: Urologists worldwide completed a Société Internationale d'Urologie online survey from 16 April 2020 until 1 May 2020. Analysis was carried out to evaluate their knowledge about protecting themselves and others in the workplace, including their confidence in their ability to remain safe at work, and any regional differences. RESULTS: There were 3488 respondents from 109 countries. Urologists who stated they were moderately comfortable that their work environment offers good protection against coronavirus disease 2019 showed a total mean satisfaction level of 5.99 (on a ""0 = not at all"" to ""10 = very"" scale). A large majority (86.33%) were confident about protecting themselves from coronavirus disease 2019 at work. However, only about one-third reported their institution provided the required personal protective equipment (35.78%), and nearly half indicated their hospital has or had limited personal protective equipment availability (48.08%).

This study documents the experiences of an international group of 10 physiology educators surrounding this transition. They wrote reflective narratives, framed by guiding questions, to answer the research question: ""What were the changes to physiology laboratories in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?"" These narratives probed educators' attitudes toward virtual laboratories before, during, and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19 only a few respondents had utilized virtual laboratories and most felt that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, most respondents transitioned from traditional labs to remote formats within a week or less. The most common remote delivery formats were commercially available online physiology laboratories, homemade videos, and sample experimental data. The main challenges associated with the rapid remote transition included workload and expertise constraints, disparities in online access and workspaces, issues with academic integrity, educator and student stress, changes in learning outcomes, and reduced engagement. However, the experience generated opportunities including exploration of unfamiliar technologies, new collaborations, and revisiting the physiology laboratory curriculum and structure. Most of the respondents reported planning on retaining some aspects of the remote laboratories postpandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and on-campus laboratories. This study concludes with recommendations for physiology educators as to how they can successfully develop and deliver remote laboratories.","Choate, Julia; Aguilar-Roca, Nancy; Beckett, Elizabeth; Etherington, Sarah; French, Michelle; Gaganis, Voula; Haigh, Charlotte; Scott, Derek; Sweeney, Terrence; Zubek, John",Adv Physiol Educ,,109

Since the transmission risk increases with close contact, some cosmetic procedures are considered high risk and majority of them had to be postponed or canceled in private dermatocosmetology clinics especially during the heavy period of the outbreak. AIMS: We aimed to document the medical and socioeconomic problems emerged in dermatocosmetology clinics in Turkey caused by COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss the management strategies taken by dermatologists. PATIENTS/METHODS: This survey research was conducted with 100 dermatologists who work in private dermatocosmetology clinics. The survey included 38 questions about office re-arrangements including patient admission and office environment, safety precautions taken for cosmetic procedures, management of clinic staff, and financial impact of the pandemic. RESULTS: A remarkable decrease in major cosmetic interest was reported in private clinics; meanwhile, there was an increase in applicants for noncosmetic dermatological complaints. The most avoided cosmetic procedures were application of skin care devices, lasers, chemical peeling, and thread lifting, while botulinum toxin injection was the most performed procedure. Nearly half of the participants had severe financial damage. Of the participants, 55% reported that they worked anxiously during this period and 60% believed that they managed the early period of the pandemic successfully. CONCLUSION: Private dermatocosmetology clinics have to work in a totally different period that they have never experienced before. The pandemic has had serious impacts on both medical and socioeconomic issues which had to be managed carefully.","Esme, Pelin; Akoglu, Gulsen; Erbil, Hakan",J Cosmet Dermatol,,109

METHODS: This study used relevant data from the National Health Emergency Operation Center to estimate general hospital and ICU beds surge capacity and tipping points under three distinct transmission scenarios. RESULTS: The study results reveal that hospitals in the KSA need to be supplied with additional 4,372 hospital beds to care for COVID-19 positive cases if the pandemic continues over six months period. At the same time, it requires additional 2,192 or 1,461 hospital beds if the pandemic persists over a 12- or 18-months period, respectively, to manage hospitalized COVID-19 overloads. The health system surge capacity would suffer from a shortage of 1,600, 797, and 540 ICU beds under the three transmission scenarios to absorb critical and intensive care COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the urgent need for additional hospital and ICU beds in the face of critical COVID-19 cases in KSA.

Personal protective equipment has been mandatory for healthcare workers in order to contain the outbreak of pandemic disease. Mild neurological disturbances such as headache have been related to the extensive utilization of facemask. This study aims to examine headache variations related to the intensive utilization of facemask among a cohort of healthcare professionals in a setting of low-medium risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare providers from different hospital and clinics in Italy. Each participant completed a specifically designed self-administered questionnaire. Headache features and outcome measures' change from baseline were evaluated over a 4-month period, in which wearing facemask has become mandatory for Italian healthcare workers. RESULTS: A total of 400 healthcare providers completed the questionnaire, 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. The majority were doctors, with a mean age of 33.4 ± 9.2 years old. Among 166/383 subjects, who were headache free at baseline, 44 (26.5%) developed de novo headache. Furthermore, 217/383 reported a previous diagnosis of primary headache disorder: 137 were affected by migraine and 80 had tension-type headache. A proportion (31.3%) of these primary headache sufferers experienced worsening of their pre-existing headache disorder, mainly for migraine frequency and attack mean duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the appearance of de novo associated facemask headache in previous headache-free subjects and an exacerbation of pre-existing primary headache disorders, mostly experienced by people with migraine disease.","Rapisarda, Laura; Trimboli, Michele; Fortunato, Francesco; De Martino, Antonio; Marsico, Oreste; Demonte, Giulio; Augimeri, Antonio; Labate, Angelo; Gambardella, Antonio",Neurol. sci,,109

367774,A case of postpartum thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"Memory consolidation involves the reactivation of memory traces during sleep. If different memories are reactivated each night, how much do they interfere with one another? We examined whether reactivating multiple memories incurs a cost to sleep-related benefits by contrasting reactivation of multiple memories versus single memories during sleep. First, participants learned the on-screen location of different objects. Each object was part of a semantically coherent group comprised of either one, two, or six items (e.g., six different cats). During sleep, sounds were unobtrusively presented to reactivate memories for half of the groups (e.g., ""meow""). Memory benefits for cued versus non-cued items were independent of the number of items in the group, suggesting that reactivation occurs in a simultaneous and promiscuous manner. Intriguingly, sleep spindles and delta-theta power modulations were sensitive to group size, reflecting the extent of previous learning. Our results demonstrate that multiple memories may be consolidated in parallel without compromising each memory's sleep-related benefit. These findings highlight alternative models for parallel consolidation that should be considered in future studies.","Schechtman, Eitan; Antony, James W; Lampe, Anna; Wilson, Brianna J; Norman, Kenneth A; Paller, Ken A",Commun Biol,,109

Biopsies of the olfactory epithelium were taken from patients with confirmed COVID-19 as well as uninfected controls. Levels of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1ß) were assessed using ELISA and compared between groups. Average TNF-&#945; levels were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, no differences in IL-1ß were seen between groups. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#945; were seen in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19.

As the world is slowly moving towards a recovery stage, T&amp;T is lagging in the recovery process, mainly because of people’s perception of safety and a new, more cautious behavior when buying products that are not essential for survival, such as T&amp;T products. In order to discover sustainable recovery paths for the industry and the real impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on consumer perceptions and purchasing behavior, the current quantitative research was developed on the basis of two different representative samples in two different moments: May 2020 and December 2020, with a focus on Romania’s population. The main results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced travel patterns and habits regarding philological and economic factors. Psychological factors, primarily the fear of contamination, impact travelers’ willingness to travel and the conditions and preferences for vacation destinations. At least in the medium term, people will avoid traveling in large groups and being in crowded places. Hygiene and health conditions in the host destination can represent essential factors in travel decisions. Confronted with a cautious clientele, tourism businesses (such as transport, accommodation, and catering) should further enhance their hygiene conditions to restore confidence. Moreover, communication is essential in these challenging times to tackle travelers’ fear and concerns.","Orîndaru, Andreea Popescu Maria-Floriana Alexoaei Alina Petronela Căescu Ștefan-Claudiu Florescu Margareta Stela Orzan Anca-Olguța",Sustainability,,109
374356,Comparison of two real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 from combined nasopharyngeal-throat swabs,2020,"Feed has been shown to be a vector for viral transmission. Four experiments were conducted to: 1) determine if medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are effective mitigants when applied to feed both pre- and post-porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) inoculation measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 2) evaluate varying levels and combinations of MCFA measured by qRT-PCR, and 3) evaluate selected treatments in bioassay to determine infectivity. In exp. 1, treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial with main effects of treatment (0.3% commercial formaldehyde [CF] product, Sal CURB [Kemin Industries, Inc.; Des Moines, IA], or 1% MCFA blend (Blend) of 1:1:1 C6:C8:C10 [PMI, Arden Hills, MN]) and timing of application (pre- or post-inoculation with PEDV) plus a positive control (PC; feed inoculated with PEDV and no treatment). All combinations of treatment and timing decreased detectable PEDV compared with the PC (P < 0.05). Pre-inoculation treatment elicited decreased magnitude of PEDV detection (cycle threshold value) compared with post-inoculation (P = 0.009). Magnitude of PEDV detection was decreased for CF compared with Blend (P < 0.0001). In exp. 2, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 5) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0, 6 to 8) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0, 9 to 11) 0.125% to 0.33% C10:0, and 12 to 15) 0.125% to 0.66% C5:0. Treating feed with 0.33% C8:0 resulted in decreased (P < 0.05) PEDV detection compared with all other treatments. Increasing concentration of each individual MCFA decreased PEDV detectability (P < 0.042). In exp. 3, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 7) 0.25% to 1% Blend, 8 to 10) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C8:0, 11 to 13) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C10:0, and 14 to 16) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0 + C10:0. Treating feed with CF, 0.5% Blend, 0.75% Blend, 1% Blend, all levels of C6:0+C8:0, 0.25% C6:0 + 0.25% C10:0, 0.33% C6:0 + 0.33% C10:0, 0.25% C8:0 + 0.25% C10:0, or 0.33% C8:0 + 0.33% C10:0 elicited decreased detection of PEDV compared with PC (P < 0.05). Increasing concentration of each MCFA combination decreased PEDV detectability (linear, P < 0.012). In exp. 4, feed was treated pre-inoculation with: 1) no treatment (PC), 2) 0.3% CF, 3) 0.5% Blend, or 4) 0.3% C8:0 and analyzed via qRT-PCR and bioassay. Adding 0.5% Blend or 0.3% C8:0 resulted in decreased PEDV compared with PC and only PC resulted in a positive bioassay. Therefore, MCFA can decrease detection of PEDV in feed. Further, inclusion of lower levels of MCFA than previously evaluated are effective against PEDV.","Lerner, Annie B; Cochrane, Roger A; Gebhardt, Jordan T; Dritz, Steve S; Jones, Cassandra K; DeRouchey, Joel M; Tokach, Mike D; Goodband, Robert D; Bai, Jianfa; Porter, Elizabeth; Anderson, Joe; Gauger, Phillip C; Magstadt, Drew R; Zhang, Jianqiang; Bass, Benjamin; Karnezos, Theodore; de Rodas, Brenda; Woodworth, Jason C",J. anim. sci,,109

However, there is little or no study to show the early empirical evidence on this relationship, most especially its impacts on FDI flows in the economies. This note provides a preliminary evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on FDI outflows. Our data cover cross-sectional first quarter, average data;between 1 January - 31 March, 2020 from 43 countries. Using Ordinary least square (OLS) and Quantile regressions, we document that there is a positive relationship between COVID-19 confirmed cases and FDI outflows. In addition, there is a positive impact of COVID-19 related confirmed deaths on FDI outflows across all quartiles estimations. This means that COVID-19 pandemic fuels the foreign direct investment outflows. The major causes could be the reduction in the ability of firms to invest due to a shortage in the number of skilled employees because they care for their health safety, a decline in corporate profits and increase in cost of finance. In addition, the propensities to invest have been widely affected negatively in most economies.

METHODS: Three healthcare workers received 30 µg BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Pfizer Vaccine, followed by a second identical dose, 21 days afterwards. Venous blood was drawn at baseline and at serial intervals, up to 63 days afterwards, for assessing total immunoglobulins (Ig) anti-RBD (receptor binding domain), anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG, anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM, and anti-S1 IgA. RESULTS: All subjects were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG levels increased between 91 and 368 folds until 21 days after the first vaccine dose, then reached a plateau. The levels raised further after the second dose (by â¼30-, â¼8- and â¼8-fold, respectively), peaking at day 35, but then slightly declining and stabilizing â¼50 days after the first vaccine dose. Anti-S1 IgA levels increased between 7 and 11 days after the first dose, slightly declined before the second dose, after which levels augmented by â¼24-fold from baseline. The anti-RBD and anti-N/S1 IgM kinetics were similar to that of anti-S1 IgA, though displaying substantially weaker increases and modest peaks, only 4- to 7-fold higher than baseline. Highly significant inter-correlation was noted between total Ig anti-RBD, anti-S1/S2 and anti-RBD IgG (all r=0.99), whilst other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies displayed lower, though still significant, correlations.

379311,Poor maternal–neonatal outcomes in pregnant patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection: analysis of 145 cases,2021,"Domestic migrant workers were stranded far from home when India declared nationwide lockdown to combat the pandemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). A large number of these workers were left with no economic support, no food and in many cases nowhere to live. The pandemic posed a serious health threat to these people, and the socioeconomic insecurity pushed them towards the edge of sustainability. Many of the migrants began walking home and accepted an uncertain fate if they could not return back home. The Government of India initiated efforts to provide transport support with special train services from the beginning of May 2020. While the migrants have started to return to their villages and towns, the states are facing the challenges of preventing the spread of COVID-19. The point-of-entry screening, quarantine and isolation facilities have increased substantially in capacity, although the quality of care remains a point of concern. Back at their homes, the migrants are enduring stigma, discrimination and poor social security. In order to avert the brewing humanitarian crisis, empathetic administration combined with political will is a must.

380675,Effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among health care workers in a geriatric care unit after a B.1.1.7-variant outbreak,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, masks became mandatory and shortages frequent, therefore the prevalence of non-CE (European Conformity Mark) approved masks increased in the general population. We aimed to quantify the prevalence of mask-related cutaneous side effects and the differences between CE and non-CE approved masks. METHODS: In this multicenter prospective observational study conducted from March 20, 2020 to May 12, 2020(during and after quarantine), patients attending emergency departments for a dermatological consult were clinically assessed and their masks were inspected to detect CE marks and UNI (Italian National Unification Entity) norms. Patients with history of facial dermatoses or under current treatment for facial dermatoses were excluded. RESULTS: We enrolled 412 patients (318 during quarantine and 94 after quarantine). CE-approved masks were observed 52.8% vs. 24.5%, whilst subsets of non-CE approved masks were 9.7% vs. 14.9% (Personal protective equipment (PPE)-masks), 16.4% vs. 12.8% (surgical masks [SM]), and 21.1% vs. 47.9%(non-PPE) and (non-SM masks), respectively during and after quarantine. Remarkably, non-CE-approved masks resulted in patients displaying a statistically significant higher incidence of facial dermatoses and irritant contact dermatitis compared to CE-approved masks, and these differences were mainly driven by non-PPE non-SM masks. Comparing quarantine and after quarantine periods, no statistically significant differences were found for CE-approved masks, whilst differences were detected in non-CE-approved masks regarding incidence of facial dermatoses (P<0.0001)and irritant contact dermatitis (P=0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: Masks are essential to prevent COVID-19 but at the same time higher awareness regarding mask specifications should be promoted in the general population. Non-PPE and non-SM masks should undergo more rigorous testing to prevent the occurrence of cutaneous side effects and future patients' lawsuit damages.","Damiani, Giovanni; Gironi, Laura C; Pacifico, Alessia; Cristaudo, Antonio; Malagoli, Piergiorgio; Allocco, Francesca; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Linder, Dennis M; Santus, Pierachille; Buja, Alessandra; Savoia, Paola; Pigatto, Paolo Dm",Ital J Dermatol Venerol,,109

Besides, they aim to find out the reason for such outbreaks occurring often in China. They make a hypothesis that the origin of the virus is embedded in the solar cycle. Next, they have proved the hypothesis by investigating the sunspot number, the cosmic ray flux data, the concentration of 10 Be in the ice core in Greenland and based on the occurrence of past pandemics and endemics. The study shows that whenever the Sun is in the magnetically quiescent state, the world witnesses viral diseases. The study shows that the outbreak of the Corona is because of the minimum sunspot number during 2019-2020 and the Corona is likely to stay in the whole of 2020. The study indicates the occurrence of viral diseases in every 11-13 years. It also reveals that as the stratospheric thickness is the minimum at Wuhan, the virus had chosen this place as the first entry point to the Earth.","Jaiswal, Rajasri Sen; Dobal, Richa; Laksmhi, K.

Despite important advances in methods that genuinely embody participatory research practices, attention to collaborative data collection, analysis, and dissemination are limited. Our aim is to describe the development and implementation of research practices to address these gaps through an emphasis on and understanding of the centrality of language in collaborative research processes. METHOD: Guided from the outset by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic research partnership recognized the importance of developing and intentionally studying our collaborative processes. As part of an ethnographic interview study with 24 Latinx/@ immigrants, a community-university research team developed innovative methods, including practices related to research team meetings, data collection, analysis, and dissemination, which we documented through ongoing discussion and reflection. RESULTS: The resulting participatory research processes were grounded in a theoretical framework of praxis and language and included six innovative and iterative stages: (a) Establishing the research team, (b) planning the interview process/data collection, (c) developing the data analysis methodology, (d) interpreting findings to adapt the intervention, (e) integrating results of the participatory process into the analysis, and (f) data analysis for dissemination. CONCLUSIONS: A focus on praxis and language revealed how the language of research structures' power, meaning, feeling, collaboration, analysis, and transformation. We also found that bilingual participatory analytic processes have important implications with respect to achieving genuine inclusion in rigorous research that moves toward equity for Latinx/@ immigrants and other populations.

403595,The Longest Infectious Virus Shedding in a Child Infected With the G614 Strain of SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a long period of stress on people worldwide and has been shown to significantly affect sleep duration across different populations. However, decreases in sleep quality rather than duration are associated with adverse mental health effects. Additionally, the one third of the general population suffering from poor sleep quality was underrepresented in previous studies. The current study aimed to elucidate effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on sleep quality across different levels of pre-pandemic sleep complaints and as a function of affect and worry. METHOD: Participants (n = 667) of the Netherlands Sleep Registry (NSR) were invited for weekly online assessment of the subjective severity of major stressors, insomnia, sleep times, distress, depression, and anxiety using validated scales. ANALYSIS: To investigate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep quality of people with and without a history of insomnia, we performed a mixed model analysis using pre-pandemic insomnia severity, negative affect, and worry as predictors. RESULTS: The effect of COVID -19 on sleep quality differs critically across participants, and depends on the pre-pandemic sleep quality. Interestingly, a quarter of people with pre-pandemic (clinical) insomnia experienced a meaningful improvement in sleep quality, whereas 20% of pre-pandemic good sleepers experienced worse sleep during the lockdown measures. Additionally, changes in sleep quality throughout the pandemic were associated with negative affect and worry. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that there is no uniform effect of the lockdown on sleep quality. COVID-19 lockdown measures more often worsened sleep complaints in pre-pandemic good sleepers, whereas a subset of people with pre-pandemic severe insomnia symptoms underwent a clinically meaningful alleviation of symptoms in our sample.","Kocevska, Desana; Blanken, Tessa F; Van Someren, Eus J W; Rösler, Lara",Sleep Med,,109

We have used well-established monitoring systems in two hospitals in England to investigate trends in self-harm presentations to hospitals during the early period of the pandemic. METHOD: Data collected in Oxford and Derby on patients aged 18 years and over who received a psychosocial assessment after presenting to the emergency departments following self-harm were used to compare trends during the three-month period following lockdown in the UK (23rd March 2020) to the period preceding lockdown and the equivalent period in 2019. RESULTS: During the 12 weeks following introduction of lockdown restrictions there was a large reduction in the number of self-harm presentations to hospitals by individuals aged 18 years and over compared to the pre-lockdown weeks in 2020 (mean weekly reduction of 13.5 (95% CI 5.6 - 21.4) and the equivalent period in 2019 (mean weekly reduction of 18.0 (95% CI 13.9 - 22.1). The reduction was greater in females than males, occurred in all age groups, with a larger reduction in presentations following self-poisoning than self-injury. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial decline in hospital presentations for self-harm occurred during the three months following the introduction of lockdown restrictions. Reasons could include a reduction in self-harm at the community level and individuals avoiding presenting to hospital following self-harm. Longer-term monitoring of self-harm behaviour during the pandemic is essential, together with efforts to encourage help-seeking and the modification of care provision.","Hawton, Keith; Casey, Deborah; Bale, Elizabeth; Brand, Fiona; Ness, Jennifer; Waters, Keith; Kelly, Samantha; Geulayov, Galit",J Affect Disord,,109
406238,"Response to comment on ""Early postoperative outcomes among patients with delayed surgeries after preoperative positive test for SARS-CoV-2: A case-control study from a single institution""",2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with a high rate of pulmonary embolism (PE) and its diagnosis can be changeling. In patients with contraindications for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or nondiagnostic on CTPA, perfusion single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (Q-SPECT/CT) is a diagnosis option in patients with COVID-19 disease. Our aim was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on QSPECT/ CT images of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic which is able to classify lung lesions to optimize PE diagnosis. METHODS: Single center study with a prospective observational branch with patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and underwent a perfusion SPECT-CT study for diagnosis of PE, from April to September 2020. The second branch is retrospective, with patients in pre-pandemic period who underwent Q-SPECT/CT for diagnosis of PE from January to December 2018. For each patient, a Q-SPECT/CT based on intravenous administration of 6 mCi (222MBq) of 99mTC-macroaggregates of human-albumin (99mTC-MAA) was performed, with the subsequent tomoscintigraphy (SPECT) and a CT. The entire image pre-processing (volume exploration, segmentation analysis, registration analysis) was conducted with MATLAB. The final diagnosis for each patient and the different tissue type segments were analyzed and validated by two senior nuclear physicians. Our Intelligent Radiomic System for the identification of patients with PE (with or without pneumonia) is based on a local analysis of SPECT-CT volumes that considers both CT and SPECT values for each volume point. Volumes are first co-registered and their intensity is normalized in [0, 1] to account for differences due to acquisition. A support vector machine (SVM) model was trained to discriminate among 4 different types of tissue: no pneumonia without PE (control group), no pneumonia with PE, pneumonia without PE and pneumonia with PE. We followed a k-fold (with k=30) scheme for statistical analysis of results. RESULTS: We collected 133 patients, 63 in prospective branch (26 with PE, 22 without PE, 15 indeterminate- PE) and 70 in retrospective branch (31 healthy/control, 39 PE). Concerning the local analysis, for all cases we obtain an average sensitivity and positive predictive value over 92%. CONCLUSION: This study represents a first step towards a complete intelligent radiomic system to optimize the diagnosis of PE by Q-SPECT/CT. The capability to detect alterations in perfusion for COVID-19 pneumonia encourages developing a tool in the cloud for clinical use and further investigates if it can also predict long term complications.","Baeza Mena, S.; Domingo, R.; Salcedo-Pujantell, M.; Moragas, G.; Deportós, J.; Garcia-Olivé, I.; Sanchez, C.; Gil, D.; Rosell, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,109

Those assessed after the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic showed increased odds of depressive symptoms (adjusted OR = 2.99, 95% CI = 1.41-6.35, p = 0.006) and depressive with comorbid anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR = 3.19, 95% CI = 1.37-7.45, p = 0.005), while the presence of comorbid stress increased the odds of depressive symptoms (adjusted OR = 16.00, 95% CI = 7.84-32.63, p < 0.001), anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR = 19.72, 95% CI = 9.75-39.89, p < 0.001), and depressive with comorbid anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR = 40.44, 95% CI = 15.90-102.87, p < 0.001). Higher psychological QoL reduced the odds of depressive symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.69-0.99, p = 0.032) and depressive with comorbid anxiety symptoms (adjusted OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68-0.98, p = 0.041), whereas higher physical health QoL (adjusted OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75-0.97, p = 0.021) and social relationship QoL (adjusted OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.55-0.90, p = 0.009) reduced the odds of anxiety symptoms. Based on our findings, we recommended several measures to curb psychological complications among the urban population, particularly as the battle to contain COVID-19 is ongoing.","Leong Bin Abdullah, Mohammad Farris Iman; Ahmad Yusof, Hazwani; Mohd Shariff, Noorsuzana; Hami, Rohayu; Nisman, Noor Farahiya; Law, Kim Sooi",Curr Psychol,,109

For a variety of reasons, tolerating wearing a mask is challenging for many individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). Therefore, we evaluated behavioral strategies to promote compliance with wearing a mask with six hospitalized individuals diagnosed with IDDs. One participant was compliant with wearing the mask for extended durations during baseline while engaging in various activities (e.g., academics, leisure). For the other five individuals, engagement in activities alone was ineffective. Blocking mask removal, reinforcement for mask wearing, and noncontingent access to preferred activities or competing stimuli were then evaluated using a changing-criterion design in which the duration participants were required to tolerate the mask gradually increased. Increases in compliance with mask wearing were achieved with all participants; however, the terminal duration was attained for only four of the five individuals.

This study aimed to determine whether Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Care of the Elderly Long-Term Care (COE-LTC): COVID-19, a virtual education program, was effective at delivering just-in-time learning and best practices to support LTC teams and residents during the pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed methods evaluation. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Interprofessional HCPs working in LTC homes or deployed to work in LTC homes primarily in Ontario, Canada, who participated in 12 weekly, 60-minute sessions. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative surveys assessing reach, satisfaction, self-efficacy, practice change, impact on resident care, and knowledge sharing. RESULTS: Of the 252 registrants for ECHO COE-LTC: COVID-19, 160 (63.4%) attended at least 1 weekly session. Nurses and nurse practitioners represented the largest proportion of HCPs (43.8%). Overall, both confidence and comfort level working with residents who were at risk, confirmed, or suspected of having COVID-19 increased after participating in the ECHO sessions (effect sizes &#8805; 0.7, Wilcoxon signed rank P < .001). Participants also reported impact on intent to change behavior, resident care, and knowledge sharing. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The results demonstrate that ECHO COE-LTC: COVID 19 effectively delivered time-sensitive information and best practices to support LTC teams and residents. It may be a critical platform during this pandemic and in future crises to deliver just-in-time learning during periods of constantly changing information.","Lingum, Navena R; Sokoloff, Lisa Guttman; Meyer, Raquel M; Gingrich, Shaen; Sodums, Devin J; Santiago, Anna Theresa; Feldman, Sid; Guy, Stacey; Moser, Andrea; Shaikh, Salma; Grief, Cindy J; Conn, David K",J.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical practice guidelines for bereavement care following pregnancy loss have been developed. However, there remains a lack of evidence to guide recommendations for providing appropriate care to parents at the time of diagnosis, and during the labor and birth of a stillborn baby. INCLUSION CRITERIA: The proposed review will consider studies, reports, guidelines, evidence syntheses, and other relevant literature that explore the experiences, needs, and care provided to bereaved parents during labor and birth of a stillborn baby. METHODS: The search strategy for the proposed scoping review will aim to locate both published and unpublished documents, using a three-step search strategy. An initial search will be conducted using the databases MEDLINE and CINAHL to identify relevant articles; a second search will be conducted across all included databases, incorporating identified keywords and index terms; and finally the reference lists of included studies will be screened for additional sources. Google Scholar and Web of Science will be searched for relevant gray literature. The search will restrict documents from 2000 to present to maintain clinical relevancy. Only studies published in English will be included. Results of the search will be exported into a template, where data will be categorized using five key domains (communication, recognition of parenthood, effective support, shared decision-making, and organizational response) summarized into positive, negative, or neutral outcomes, and further refined into common issues across these domains.

Poucos estudos avaliaram o efeito das condições socioeconômicas no sono no período da COVID-19. O objetivo foi analisar o aumento ou a incidência dos problemas do sono segundo condições demográficas e econômicas, prévias à pandemia, e segundo mudanças nas condições financeiras, ocupacionais e tarefas domésticas durante a pandemia. Estudo realizado via web, usando dados de 24 de abril a 24 de maio, com 45.160 brasileiros (18 ou mais), com amostra ponderada pelos dados da Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD). Mudança na qualidade do sono (desfecho), renda mensal, efeito na renda familiar, na ocupação/trabalho, sexo, faixa etária, situação conjugal e alteração no trabalho doméstico (exposições) foram reportados. Estimamos os percentuais de início ou aumento dos problemas com o sono e os OR ajustados. A chance de exacerbação dos problemas com o sono foi de 34%, 71% e duas vezes maior nas pessoas com renda inferior a um salário mínimo antes da pandemia, nas que perderam o emprego e naquelas que tiveram a renda muito diminuída/ficaram sem renda, respectivamente. A chance de piorar os problemas do sono foi 82% maior nas mulheres; três vezes maior (OR = 3,14) na população com 18 a 29 anos, em relação aos idosos; e maior com o incremento da quantidade de tarefas domésticas (OR = 2,21). Fatores financeiros e ocupacionais foram determinantes na deterioração da qualidade do sono autorreferida, demandando ações rápidas sobre essas condições a fim de minimizar esse impacto. Gênero, faixa etária e rotinas domésticas também merecem atenção em relação à qualidade do sono.","Lima, Margareth Guimarães; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; Szwarcwald, Celia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Romero, Dalia Elena; Werneck, André Oliveira; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de",Cad.

Thus, to control the emissions from CNG engines, the major advances are under development of and oxidation is one of them in catalytic converter. In literature, the catalysts such as noble and non-noble metals have been reported for separate oxidation of CO and CH4.. Experimentally, it was found that non-noble metal catalysts are preferred due to its low cost, good thermal stability, and molding tractability. In literature, several articles have been published for CO and CH4 oxidation but no review paper is still available. Thus, the present review provides a comprehensive overview of separate as well as simultaneous CO and CH4 oxidation reactions for CNG vehicular emission control.","Trivedi, Suverna; Prasad, Ram; Mishra, Ashuthosh; Kalam, Abul; Yadav, Pankaj",,,109

Owing to the increased co-morbidities and therefore worse COVID-19 outcomes for care home residents, it is important that we understand this increase and its future implications. We demonstrate the use of an SIS model where each nursing home is an infective unit capable of either being susceptible to an outbreak (S) or in an active outbreak (I). We use a generalized additive model to approximate the trend in growth rate of outbreaks in care homes and find the fit to be improved in a model where the growth rate is proportional to the number of current care home outbreaks compared with a model with a constant growth rate. Using parameters found from the outbreak-dependent growth rate, we predict a 73% prevalence of outbreaks in UK care homes without intervention as a reasonable worst-case planning assumption.

The present review attempted to figure out the update on this effective vaccine and discussed the other promising vaccines. Recent findings: A range of investigations on the SARS-CoV-2 genomics, on its similarities with SARS-CoV-1, and with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been accomplished and the host immune dodging mechanisms by the SARS-CoV-2 have been unraveled which in turn led the scientists around the world to work rigorously on the vaccine development. Working with various vaccine platforms so far revealed the efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine as the most effective one as resulted through the clinical trials which resulted in 95% positive output.

427663,Reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in an immunocompromised patient: a case report,2020,"Purpose: A major justification for the state subsidy of university education at public institutions (and, in some countries, of private universities too) is the economic and social benefits accruing to society as whole from a significantly university-educated workforce and citizenship Based upon a broad range of research findings, a particular societal benefit emanating from higher education relates to good citizenship: that it leads to more open mindedness and tolerant political attitudes We examined these issues using a representative sample of students from Israeli universities to clarify the extent to which these outcomes would be paralleled in the Israeli setting, where the university experience differs markedly from that found typically in the West Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a comparison of political tolerance levels between first- and final-year students enrolled in regular undergraduate study programs (of four days a week or more) However since a change in tolerance is likely to be contingent also on the amount of time that the student spends on campus during the study year, we introduce, as a control group, students enrolled in compressed study programs (of three days a week or less) and compare changes in their tolerance levels with tolerance changes of students enrolled in regular programs Research questionnaires were distributed to undergraduate students at three universities from the three major districts in Israel–north, south and center The achieved sample size was 329 students Findings: Using Difference-in-Differences techniques, we looked for any changes in students' general political tolerance, over the course of their studies Surprisingly, we found no such effect on political tolerance attitudes Israeli students are older and often married and though nominally full-time students, they often hold down a full-time job Thus they come and go to attend lectures but do not otherwise spend much time on campus Given the somewhat perfunctory nature of the university experience for most Israeli students, it does not to lead to more open-minded and tolerant political attitudes Practical implications: Some broader, practical applications of the research, beyond the Israeli case, are presented, particularly related to distance learning and to the impact of COVID-19 Attention is given to more recent “Cancel culture” developments on university campuses Originality/value: The results have wider implications, to other university setting in other countries Changes in political attitudes may occur in university settings where campus life is well developed, with opportunities for student interaction, formally in extra-curricular events or through social mixing outside the lecture hall Where the university experience is more minimally confined to attendance at lectures these desirable outcomes may not be forth coming These findings are relevant to other university frameworks where campus attendance is marginal, such as in open university education and, even more explicitly, in purely internet-based higher education study © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Dadon-Golan, Z.; Ziderman, A.; BenDavid-Hadar, I.",Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education,,109

Our study included all patients on dialysis recorded in the French REIN Registry in April 2020. Clinical characteristics at last follow-up and the evolution of COVID-19 illness severity over time were recorded for diagnosed cases (either suspicious clinical symptoms, characteristic signs on the chest scan or a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 1,621 infected patients were reported on the REIN registry from March 16th, 2020 to May 4th, 2020. Of these, 344 died. The prevalence of COVID-19 patients varied from less than 1% to 10% between regions. The probability of being a case was higher in males, patients with diabetes, those in need of assistance for transfer or treated at a self-care unit. Dialysis at home was associated with a lower probability of being infected as was being a smoker, a former smoker, having an active malignancy, or peripheral vascular disease. Mortality in diagnosed cases (21%) was associated with the same causes as in the general population. Higher age, hypoalbuminemia and the presence of an ischemic heart disease were statistically independently associated with a higher risk of death. Being treated at a selfcare unit was associated with a lower risk. Thus, our study showed a relatively low frequency of COVID-19 among dialysis patients contrary to what might have been assumed.","Couchoud, Cécile; Bayer, Florian; Ayav, Carole; Béchade, Clémence; Brunet, Philippe; Chantrel, François; Frimat, Luc; Galland, Roula; Hourmant, Maryvonne; Laurain, Emmanuelle; Lobbedez, Thierry; Mercadal, Lucile; Moranne, Olivier",Kidney int,,109

The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 may act as an effective target for drug development due to the conservation level. Herein, we have employed a rigorous literature review pipeline to enlist 3063 compounds from more than 200 plants from the Asian region. Therefore, the virtual screening procedure helps us to shortlist the total compounds into 19 based on their better binding energy. Moreover, the Prime MM-GBSA procedure screened the compound dataset further where curcumin, gartanin and robinetin had a score of (-59.439, -52.421 and - 47.544) kcal/mol, respectively. The top three ligands based on binding energy and MM-GBSA scores have most of the binding in the catalytic groove Cys145, His41, Met165, required for the target protein inhibition. The molecular dynamics simulation study confirms the docked complex rigidity and stability by exploring root mean square deviations, root mean square fluctuations, solvent accessible surface area, radius of gyration and hydrogen bond analysis from simulation trajectories. The post-molecular dynamics analysis also confirms the interactions of the curcumin, gartanin and robinetin in the similar binding pockets.

Nevertheless, the scientific literature still lacks an overview of how researchers have been covering the issue. This article presents a systematic review to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on work and workers of all occupations, reveal research gaps, and help managers to adapt to organizations amid the pandemic. This review is based on a sample of 258 papers from Web of Science and Scopus databases. Quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated a vast majority of studies focused on frontline healthcare workers and a lack of empirical investigation on managers' work. We show how literature has been addressing different aspects of work (e.g., workers' health, working conditions, procedures, protection equipment, remote working, etc.) in the various economic sectors. We discuss the results in light of ergonomics and psychodynamics of work, two disciplines that conceive work and organization as intimately connected, and that can assist managers in meeting the difficulties brought by the pandemic. We highlight that considering the construction of health, interindividual variability, subjective relation to work, supportive workplace environment, and organizational and individual capabilities can play a key role in successfully adapting and transforming organizations in the current scenario.","Sigahi, Tiago F A C; Kawasaki, Bruno C; Bolis, Ivan; Morioka, Sandra N",,,109

Chest CT findings have been described as an aid for COVID-19 diagnosis and management. We aimed to describe the CT imaging characteristics in a group of COVID-19 patients while we also intended to assess if any of these radiological features were associated with short-term prognosis. Materials and methods: CT examinations from 164 consecutive patients with at least one positive RT-PCR nucleic acid assay for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively analyzed. Numerous CT imaging features were recorded independently by two radiologists. Patients were grouped according to their status 14 days after the initial CT scan in either discharged/hospitalized in a non-ICU ward (favorable prognosis group) versus deceased/admitted to an intensive care unit (unfavorable prognosis group). Results: Ground-glass opacities (89.0 %) and consolidations (73.2 %) with multilobar involvement were the predominant imaging findings, while a nodular pattern (3.7 %) and cavitation (1.2 %) were uncommon. Mean age was higher in the mortality/ICU group. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were dominant in both groups, but distribution pattern of abnormalities was different, being more often diffuse in the mortality/ICU group. Linear opacities and opacities that were rounded in shape were more frequently observed in the favorable prognosis group. CT severity index was significantly higher in the mortality/ICU group. For assessing unfavorable prognosis, the best cut-off for CT severity index was 24 (sensitivity 78 %; specificity 59 %). Interobserver agreement for all CT findings was excellent. Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Porto, Portugal, manifests as multilobar ground-glass opacities and consolidations. Older age, diffuse distribution and increasing CT severity index are associated with worse short-term prognosis while linear opacities resembling organizing pneumonia and rounded opacities herald a more favorable prognosis.","Carvalho, A; Cunha, R; Lima, B A; Pereira, J M; Madureira, A J",Eur J Radiol Open,,109
436822,Disease course in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases: insights on the safety of immunosuppression during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy,2020,"The fourth outbreak of the Coronaviruses, known as the COVID-19, has occurred in Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in December 2019. We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31-February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4-15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19, 2020. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in locations with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of COVID-19.","Jiang, Xiandeng; Chang, Le; Shi, Yanlin",Sci Rep,,109

The present study applied the health action process approach (HAPA) to examine the process from intention to protective behaviors in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal online survey study was conducted among 229 individuals (61.6% females; M age = 25.37 years, SD age = 8.34 years) living in Hubei province, China. Action self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, risk perception, intention, planning and action control regarding facemask wearing and hand washing were assessed at baseline (Time 1), and behaviors were assessed a week later (Time 2). Data were collected from 30 January to 16 February 2020. Two structural equation models were specified to test the theory-driven determinants of the facemask wearing and hand washing respectively. The results showed that action self-efficacy predicted intentions to wear facemasks and wash hands. Intention and action control predicted both behaviors at Time 2. Associations between planning and behaviors were mixed. Mediation analyses revealed that action control significantly mediated the relationship between intention and both behaviors (facemask wearing: 90% CI [0.01, 0.12]; hand washing: 95% CI [0.01, 0.21]). Planning did not mediate the relationship between intention and the two behaviors. The findings illustrate that action self-efficacy is positively associated with intention to facemask wearing and hand washing, and action control contributes to bridging intention to behaviors. Both motivational and volitional factors warrant consideration in interventions to improve adherence to facemask wearing and hand washing in COVID-19.","Lao, Chao Kei; Li, Xinyi; Zhao, Nan; Gou, Mengke; Zhou, Guangyu",Curr Psychol,,109

A prospective study was conducted among 201 patients with COVID-19 in the Pakistan Military Hospital from April 1 to August 31, 2020, including non-critical cases and critical cases. COVID-19 patients were stratified as critical and non-critical according to the signs and symptoms severity; with those requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation as critical, and those did not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as non-critical. A total of 201 COVID-19 patients with critical and non-critical categories presented with myocardial injury. All patients with myocardial injury had an elevation in CKMB and Troponin-I levels. Of these patients, 43.7% presented with new electrocardiography (ECG) changes, and ST depression was typically observed in 36.3% patients. In addition, 18.7% patients presented with abnormal echocardiography findings, with right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction commonly seen among critical group patients. Results analyzed by a logistic regression model showing COVID-19 direct contribution to myocardial injury in these patients.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients at a single center with COVID-19 infection and shock who were treated with angiotensin II. The hemodynamic response to angiotensin II was estimated by recording the mean arterial pressure, norepinephrine equivalent dose (NED) and urine output. RESULTS: Ten patients with COVID-19 related shock were treated with angiotensin II. Over the initial 6 hours, the average the norepinephrine equivalent dose decreased by 30.4% (from 64.6 mcg/min to 44 mcg/min) without a significant change in the mean arterial pressure (0.7% decrease). Six patients experienced at least a 25% reduction in norepinephrine equivalent dose by 6 hours, and two experienced at least a 50% reduction. CONCLUSIONS: On average, the hemodynamic response to angiotensin II in COVID-19 related shock was favorable. Two patients had a marked rapid improvement. Given the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 with the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, further evaluation of angiotensin II for the treatment of COVID-19 related shock is warranted.","Ofosu-Barko, Kwadwo; Liu, Yi; Tamimi, Faisal Alkhatib; Al Husami, Wael; Ganatra, Sarju; Resnic, Frederic; Shah, Sachin P",Crit. pathw. cardiol,,109

466846,Rapid whole genome sequence typing reveals multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 spread,2020,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has begun to infect people. The virus first occurred in Wuhan, China, but the whole world is now struggling with the pandemic. Over 13 million confirmed cases and 571,000 deaths have been reported so far, and this number is growing. Older people, who constitute a notable proportion of the world population, are at an increased risk of infection because of altered immunity and chronic comorbidities. Thus, appropriate health care is necessary to control fatalities and spread of the disease in this specific population. The chapter provides an overview of diagnostic methods, laboratory and imaging findings, clinical features, and management of COVID-19 in aged people. Possible mechanisms behind the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the elderly include immunosenescence and related impaired antiviral immunity, mature immunity and related hyper-inflammatory responses, comorbidities and their effects on the functioning of critical organs/systems, and the altered expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that acts as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This evidence defines the herding behavior of COVID-19 in relation to ACE2 under the influence of immune dysregulation. Then, identifying the immunogenetic factors that affect the disease susceptibility and severity and as well as key inflammatory pathways that have the potential to serve as therapeutic targets needs to remain an active area of research.","Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,109

Deep serological profiling of 232 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls using VirScan revealed more than 800 epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, including 10 epitopes likely recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Preexisting antibodies in controls recognized SARS-CoV-2 ORF1, whereas only COVID-19 patient antibodies primarily recognized spike protein and nucleoprotein. A machine learning model trained on VirScan data predicted SARS-CoV-2 exposure history with 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity; a rapid Luminex-based diagnostic was developed from the most discriminatory SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Individuals with more severe COVID-19 exhibited stronger and broader SARS-CoV-2 responses, weaker antibody responses to prior infections, and higher incidence of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus 1, possibly influenced by demographic covariates. Among hospitalized patients, males produce stronger SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses than females.","Shrock, Ellen; Fujimura, Eric; Kula, Tomasz; Timms, Richard T; Lee, I-Hsiu; Leng, Yumei; Robinson, Matthew L; Sie, Brandon M; Li, Mamie Z; Chen, Yuezhou; Logue, Jennifer; Zuiani, Adam; McCulloch, Denise; Lelis, Felipe J N; Henson, Stephanie; Monaco, Daniel R; Travers, Meghan; Habibi, Shaghayegh; Clarke, William A; Caturegli, Patrizio; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Piechocka-Trocha, Alicja; Li, Jonathan Z; Khatri, Ashok; Chu, Helen Y; Villani, Alexandra-Chloé; Kays, Kyle; Goldberg, Marcia B; Hacohen, Nir; Filbin, Michael R; Yu, Xu G; Walker, Bruce D; Wesemann, Duane R; Larman, H Benjamin; Lederer, James A; Elledge, Stephen J",Science (Wash.),,109

471316,Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2 Co-Infection in newly diagnosed HIV-1 infection,2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic not only has created a health crisis across the world but is also expected to impact negatively the global economy and societies at a scale that is maybe larger than that of the 2008 financial crisis. Simultaneously, it has inevitably exerted many negative consequences on the geoenvironment on which human beings depend. The current paper articulates the role of environmental geotechnics in elucidating and mitigating the effects of the current pandemic. It is the belief of all authors that the Covid-19 pandemic presents not only significant challenges but also opportunities for the development of the environmental geotechnics field. This discipline should make full use of geoenvironmental researchers' and engineers' professional skills and expertise to look for development opportunities from this crisis, to highlight the irreplaceable position of the discipline in the global fight against pandemics and to contribute to the health and prosperity of communities, to serve humankind better. In order to reach this goal while taking into account the specificity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the uncertainty of its environmental effects, it is believed that more emphasis should be placed on the following research directions: pathogen-soil interactions;isolation and remediation technologies for pathogen-contaminated sites;new materials for pathogen-contaminated soil;recycling and safe disposal of medical wastes;quantification of uncertainty in geoenvironmental and epidemiological problems;emerging technologies and adaptation strategies in civil, geotechnical and geoenvironmental infrastructures;pandemic-induced environmental risk management;and modelling of pathogen transport and fate in geoenvironment, among others. Moreover, Covid-19 has made it clear to the environmental geotechnics community the importance of urgent international co-operation and of multidisciplinary research actions that must extend to a broad range of scientific fields, including medical and public health disciplines, in order to meet the complexities posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Tang, C.

Analysis was performed in spiked pools of qRT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The assay, composed of a combination of four monoclonal antibodies, allowed sensitive detection of both the wild-type and the analyzed VOCs, despite the accumulation of several mutations in the variants' S1 region.

A population-based study in coastal Ecuador,2020,"BACKGROUND: The role of humoral immunity in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood owing, in large part, to the complexity of antibodies produced in response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is a pressing need for serology tests to assess patient-specific antibody response and predict clinical outcome. METHODS: Using SARS-CoV-2 proteome and peptide microarrays, we screened 146 COVID-19 patients plasma samples to identify antigens and epitopes. This enabled us to develop a master epitope array and an epitope-specific agglutination assay to gauge antibody responses systematically and with high resolution. RESULTS: We identified linear epitopes from the Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N) protein and showed that the epitopes enabled higher resolution antibody profiling than the S or N protein antigen. Specifically, we found that antibody responses to the S(811-825), S(881-895) and N(156-170) epitopes negatively or positively correlated with clinical severity or patient survival. Moreover, we found that the P681H and S235F mutations associated with the coronavirus variant of concern B.1.1.7 altered the specificity of the corresponding epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: Epitope-resolved antibody testing not only affords a high-resolution alternative to conventional immunoassays to delineate the complex humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and differentiate between neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, it may potentially be used to predict clinical outcome. The epitope peptides can be readily modified to detect antibodies against variants of concern (VOC) in both the peptide array and latex agglutination formats.

481345,Prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Post-Quarantine Healthcare Workers,2020,"The ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic has caused a serious impact on patients suffering from cardiovascular disorders as they are predisposed to COVID infection as well as to exacerbation of their preexisting conditions which can prove to be fatal. Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (nCOVID-19) has a varied effect on the cardiac system ranging from myocardial injury to thromboembolic complications. A significant proportion of patients are noted to have comorbidities. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor is considered the target of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). SARS-Cov-2 leads to imbalance in RAAS activity which is responsible for target organ damage. Recombinant ACE 2 has been shown to restore ACE 2 levels in explanted hearts and restore balanced RAAS activity. nCOVID-19 can have varied cardiac manifestations ranging from acute coronary syndrome to heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary thromboembolism, and pericarditis. The current nCOVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in management strategies for cardiovascular diseases. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction can be fibrinolysed when a primary percutaneous coronary intervention facility with adequate protection is not available. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker needs to be continued in patients with hypertension. Continuity of care for patients with chronic cardiovascular illness needs to be maintained. Management of cardiovascular emergencies needs to be done in a way which ensures the safety of health-care professionals and prevents infection transmission. Strict prevention of infection and health control measures will help to prevent spread of infection and reduce disease incidence.","Mani, A.; Ojha, V.; Dubey, M.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January 1-April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option.

One remedy to facilitate surge capacity is to establish an Urgent Care Centre (UCC), i.e., a secondary ED, co-located and in close collaboration with an ED. This study investigates the outcome of treatment in an ED versus a UCC in terms of length of stay (LOS), time to physician (TTP) and use of medical services. If it was possible to make these parameters equal to or even less than the ED, UCCs could be used as supplementary units to the ED, improving sustainability. The results show reduced waiting times at the UCC, both in terms of TTP and LOS. In conclusion, creating a primary care-like facility in close proximity to the hospitals may not only relieve overcrowding of the hospital's ED in peacetime, but it may also provide an opportunity for use during MIDs and pandemics to facilitate the victims of the incident and society as a whole.","Raidla, A.; Darro, K.; Carlson, T.; Khorram-Manesh, A.; Berlin, J.; Carlstrom, E.",Sustainability,,109

DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: In-person follow-up visits (before COVID-19 outbreak) to a rehabilitation hospital in Spain and on-line during COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS: Community dwelling adults (&#8805; 18 years) with chronic SCI. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) and World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) were compared using the Wilcoxon ranked test or paired t-test when appropriate. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy five people with SCI assessed on-line between June 2020 and November 2020 were compared to their own assessments before COVID-19. Participants reported significantly decreased Social Integration during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic scores (Pâ =â 0.037), with a small effect size (dâ =â -0.15). Depression (measured using HADS) was significantly higher than before COVID-19 (Pâ <â 0.001) with a moderate effect size (dâ =â -0.29). No significant differences were found in any of the 4 WHOQOL-BREF dimensions (Physical, Psychological, Social and Environmental).Nevertheless, when all participants were stratified in two groups according to their age at on-line assessment, the younger group (19-54 years, Nâ =â 85) scored lower during COVID-19 than before, in WHOQOL-BREF Physical (Pâ =â 0.004), (dâ =â -0.30) and Psychological dimensions (Pâ =â 0.007) (dâ =â -0.29). The older group (55-88 years, Nâ =â 0) reported no significant differences in any dimension. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impacted HADS' depression and CIQ's social integration.

This inquiry aimed to describe beliefs about sensitive parenting among mothers of children with developmental disabilities and to examine how those beliefs relate to sociodemographic factors and perceived stress. Participants included 40 mothers with a child up to 7 years of age with a developmental disability. Mothers reported on sociodemographic factors and daily hassles and sorted an adapted version of the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort. Results revealed a strong convergence between maternal beliefs about the ideal mother and the attachment theory's concept of sensitivity. Daily hassles predicted beliefs about the ideal mother. These results underline the importance of implementing interventions in the context of child disability aimed at reducing parental stress.","Matoso, Leonor; Baião, Rita; Baptista, Joana",J Intellect Disabil,,109

We aimed to obtain a clear homeopathic clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and postulate the genus epidemicus of the disease in order to inform and enhance future treatment and prophylaxis options. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case series study, collecting data from 19 homeopaths in Catalonia, Spain, from patients who presented with fever and/or cough and/or breathlessness and/or confirmed COVID-19 infection or close contact with a confirmed case. We included 107 patients, and data were recorded through a checklist questionnaire on the day of the case analysis and at day 10-15 after commencing treatment. Symptoms were collected and analyzed with the help of homeopathic repertories. RESULTS: A total of 103 cases were mild or moderate; four were severe. The severe cases were excluded from the analysis and the 103 mild and moderate cases were analyzed and a clear overall clinical picture with mental, general, and particular symptoms was achieved. Eighty-eight cases had a complete recorded follow-up. The most prescribed medicines were Bry, Ars, Phos and Gels, whilst those with the best rates of good response were Sulph, Puls and Bry. Time to full recovery after homeopathic treatment ranged from 3.5 to 14.4 days, depending on the medicine used. The potency 200c was associated with faster rates of full recovery and a lesser need to change remedy. CONCLUSION: We have defined the symptomatic homeopathic characteristics of mild and moderate COVID-19 in Spain and established a set of medicines that might be useful to consider as effective genus epidemicus.","Clapers, Marc Lluís; Velat, Manuela; Clapers, Josep Maria; Vidal-Jové, Joan; Mora, Joan",Homeopathy,,109
508604,Late-Onset Encephalopathy Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2020,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the beginning has been a reason of fear among healthcare workers (HCWs) due to the increased mortality, especially in the HCWs themselves In this survey study, we aimed to explore the predictive factors associated with fear faced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify the areas which need to be addressed to reduce it Methods On May 14, 2020, we conducted an observational, cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire, consisting of the following two parts: (1) focused on factors associated with HCWs' fear of getting an infection and being a source of carrying the infection to whom they care, and (2) focused on factors associated with HCWs' fear of uncertainty and lack of support from concerned health authorities Results The mean age of the participants was 40 04 ± 12 92 years with 79 3% being males More than half (51 1%) of the participants were consultants The most important factors associated with fear included getting infected (84 8%), quarantined (69 6%), not getting medical treatment (62%), losing a life (56 8%), and infecting family members (94 2%) Another major factor associated with HCWs' fear was lack of support from concerned health authorities, 80 2% thought of solatium, and 71 7% believed that the job should be given to eligible family members of the deceased More than 82 2% were concerned about health expenses and around 97 6% felt an additional health risk allowance should be given Conclusion Our results indicate that the risk of getting infection to themselves and their families, along with a lack of support from concerned health authorities, was strongly associated with fear among HCWs We hope through these findings that the concerned health authorities will take notice and do something in this regard by developing appropriate policies and measures to make sure that HCWs and their families are cared for if they get infected","Kumar, J.; Katto, M.

508922,Follow-up of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to many countries and has been declared a global health emergency. Our center is located in the south of Italy where the infection rates were low and the clusters of COVID-19 positive patients were small and inhomogeneous. The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic. METHODS: The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments. The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency. RESULTS: A ""clean"" team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation. Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff. Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required. Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people. Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check. CONCLUSIONS: This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future. In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region. These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.","Pezzulla, Donato; Macchia, Gabriella; Taccari, Francesco; Sticca, Giovanna; Deodato, Francesco",Int J Gynecol Cancer,,109

However, less attention has been given to the assessment of intra-host diversity. RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 inhabit the host as a population of variants called quasispecies. We studied the quasispecies diversity in four of the main SARS-CoV-2 genes (ORF1a, ORF1b, S and N genes), using a dataset consisting of 210 next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples collected between January and early April of 2020 in the State of Victoria, Australia. We found evidence of quasispecies diversity in 68% of the samples, 76% of which was nonsynonymous variants with a higher density in the spike (S) glycoprotein and ORF1a genes. About one-third of the nonsynonymous intra-host variants were shared among the samples, suggesting host-to-host transmission. Quasispecies diversity changed over time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that some of the intra-host single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were restricted to specific lineages, highlighting their potential importance in the epidemiology of this virus. A greater effort must be made to determine the magnitude of the genetic bottleneck during transmission and the epidemiological and/or evolutionary factors that may play a role in the changes in the diversity of quasispecies over time.","Armero, Alix; Berthet, Nicolas; Avarre, Jean-Christophe",Viruses,,109

Our objective is to provide a framework of methodology for quantifying the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk of COVID-19 and other pandemics by leveraging different sets of parameters. Methods Three major categories of control measures on controlling importation risk were parameterized and modelled by the framework: 1) entry restrictions, 2) travel quarantine, and 3) domestic containment measures. Integrating the parameterized intensity of control measures, a modified SEIR model was developed to simulate the case importation and local epidemic under different scenarios of global epidemic dynamics. A web-based tool was also provided to enable interactive visualization of epidemic simulation. Results The simulated number of case importation and local spread modelled by the proposed framework of methods fitted well to the historical epidemic curve of China and Singapore. Based on the simulation results, the total numbers of infected cases when reducing 30% of visitor arrivals would be 88·4 (IQR 87·5-89·6) and 58·8 (IQR 58·3-59·5) times more than those when reducing 99% of visitor arrivals in mainland China and Singapore respectively, assuming actual time-varying Rt and travel quarantine policy. If the number of global daily new infections reached 100,000, 85%-91% of inbound travels should be reduced to keep the daily new infected number below 100 for a country with a similar travel volume as Singapore (daily 52,000 tourist arrivals in 2019). Whereas if the number was lower than 10,000, the daily new infected case would be less than 100 even with no entry restrictions. Discussions We proposed a framework that first estimated the intensity of travel restrictions and local containment measures for countries since the first overseas imported case. Our approach then quantified the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine using a modified SEIR model to simulate the potential epidemic spread under hypothetical intensities of these control measures. We also developed a web-based system that enables interactive simulation, which could serve as a valuable tool for health system administrators to assess policy effects on managing the importation risk. By leveraging different sets of parameters, it could adapt to any specific country and specific type of epidemic. Conclusions This framework has provided a valuable tool to parameterize the intensity of control measures, simulate both the case importation and local epidemic, and quantify the combined effects of entry restrictions and travel quarantine on managing the importation risk.","Chen, Tiange; Huang, Siwan; Li, Guanqiao; Zhang, Yuan; Li, Ye; Zhu, Jinyi; Shi, Xuanling; Li, Xiang; Xie, Guotong; Zhang, Linqi",J Biomed Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965636/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103800; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1532046421001295; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046421001295?v=s5,109

593506,"Detection and Genetic Characterization of Deltacoronavirus in Pigs, Ohio, USA, 2014",2014-07-11,"Abstract The success of RNA viruses as pathogens of plants, animals, and humans depends on their ability to reprogram the host cell metabolism to support the viral infection cycle and to suppress host defense mechanisms. Plus-strand (+)RNA viruses have limited coding potential necessitating that they co-opt an unknown number of host factors to facilitate their replication in host cells. Global genomics and proteomics approaches performed with Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model host have led to the identification of 250 host factors affecting TBSV RNA replication and recombination or bound to the viral replicase, replication proteins, or the viral RNA. The roles of a dozen host factors involved in various steps of the replication process have been validated in yeast as well as a plant host. Altogether, the large number of host factors identified and the great variety of cellular functions performed by these factors indicate the existence of a truly complex interaction between TBSV and the host cell. This review summarizes the advantages of using a simple plant virus and yeast as a model host to advance our understanding of virus–host interactions at the molecular and cellular levels. The knowledge of host factors gained can potentially be used to inhibit virus replication via gene silencing, expression of dominant negative mutants, or design of specific chemical inhibitors leading to novel specific or broad-range resistance and antiviral tools against (+)RNA plant viruses.","Nagy, Peter D.; Pogany, Judit",Advances in Virus Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065352710760048; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0065352710760048; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-3527(10)76004-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20965073/,109
593676,High-risk exposure without personal protective equipment and infection with SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers: results of the CoV-CONTACT prospective cohort,2020-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Gene therapy has emerged as a new strategy for cancer therapy. As an alternative nucleic acid material, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is being increasingly utilized in cancer gene therapy. However, unfulfilled requirements and a lack of ideal mRNA delivery vectors persist. METHODS: We developed an advanced mRNA delivery system, DMP-039, by fusing a cell-penetrating peptide, cRGD-R9, and a cationic nano-sized DMP backbone together. The DMP gene vector backbone was synthesized by the self-assembly of DOTAP lipid and mPEG-PCL polymer. Introduction of the cRGD-R9 peptide onto the DMP backbone was performed to elevate the mRNA delivery capacity, which resulted in a peptide-functionalized hybrid delivery system. RESULTS: The average size of the synthesized DMP-039 was 268.9 ± 12.4 nm (PDI = 0.382), with a potential of 17.4 ± 0.5 mV. The synthesized DMP-039 hybrid nanoparticles exhibited high mRNA delivery efficiency through multiple mechanisms during transmembrane transportation. By loading the encoding mRNA from the suicide gene Bim, a locally administered mBim/DMP-039 complex strongly inhibited growth in two colon cancer models. Moreover, intravenous administration of the mBim/DMP-039 complex efficiently suppressed C26 pulmonary metastatic tumor progression with high safety. The in vivo distribution, degradation, and excretion were also investigated in detail. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the DMP-039 peptide-functionalized hybrid nanoparticle is an advanced candidate for mRNA-based suicide gene therapy.","Gao, Yan; Men, Ke; Pan, Congbin; Li, Jingmei; Wu, Jieping; Chen, Xiaohua; Lei, Sibei; Gao, Xiang; Duan, Xingmei",Int J Nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s319092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366664/,109

Thus, we aimed to measure the effectiveness of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as medical students’ preferences regarding e-learning and classroom teaching, and the possibility of applying it post-pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of medical students (N = 376) in six medical schools was carried out after their second semester, from August 15 to 20, 2020. Ten parameters were measured for the effectiveness of e-learning based on a 5-point Likert-scale and five parameters were measured for satisfaction. RESULTS: e-learning was more or equally effective in four parameters such as assignment submission and meeting individual needs, but less effective in six parameters, including building skills and knowledge, and interaction level. Satisfaction was either high or neutral in all five parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have shown that e-learning can assist the teaching process in medical schools in some respects, but cannot be used for the entire teaching process.","AlQhtani, Abdullh; AlSwedan, Nasser; Almulhim, Abdullelah; Aladwan, Raghad; Alessa, Yara; AlQhtani, Kholoud; Albogami, Malak; Altwairqi, Khalid; Alotaibi, Fahad; AlHadlaq, Abdulmajeed; Aldhafian, Osama",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02888-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454493/,109

During this period the World Health Organisation issued a global alert about SARS and together with the Centre for Disease Control have coordinated their efforts to investigate its pathogenesis and treatment. The outbreak in Hong Kong has been dramatic due to its geographical proximity with Guangdong province, China where the first case of SARS was reported. SARS has been described as a rapidly progressive, sometimes fatal pneumonia with a case fatality rate of 7.6% requiring intensive care. The four case reports illustrate a number of important points concerning the recognition, treatment, management and prevention of SARS, and highlights the importance of considering vigilant assessment and monitoring of patients with SARS. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences in caring for critically ill patients with SARS in the intensive care unit to nurses globally in order to reduce SARS’ morbidity and mortality as well as to protect nurses and other healthcare workers from this disease that is so far threatening the community at large.","Lopez, Violeta; Chan, Keung Sum; Wong, Yuen Ching (Jonathan)",Int J Nurs Stud,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748903001378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748903001378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14967183/,109

595340,Quantification of occupational and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers in a large U.S. healthcare system,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND: Adequate personal protective equipment is needed to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers. Otolaryngology groups are recommending a higher level of personal protective equipment for aerosol-generating procedures than public health agencies. The objective of the review was to provide evidence that a.) demonstrates which otolaryngology procedures are aerosol-generating, and that b.) clarifies whether the higher level of PPE advocated by otolaryngology groups is justified. MAIN BODY: Health care workers in China who performed tracheotomy during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic had 4.15 times greater odds of contracting the virus than controls who did not perform tracheotomy (95% CI 2.75–7.54). No other studies provide direct epidemiological evidence of increased aerosolized transmission of viruses during otolaryngology procedures. Experimental evidence has shown that electrocautery, advanced energy devices, open suctioning, and drilling can create aerosolized biological particles. The viral load of COVID-19 is highest in the upper aerodigestive tract, increasing the likelihood that aerosols generated during procedures of the upper aerodigestive tract of infected patients would carry viral material. Cough and normal breathing create aerosols which may increase the risk of transmission during outpatient procedures. A significant proportion of individuals infected with COVID-19 may not have symptoms, raising the likelihood of transmission of the disease to inadequately protected health care workers from patients who do not have probable or confirmed infection. Powered air purifying respirators, if used properly, provide a greater level of filtration than N95 masks and thus may reduce the risk of transmission. CONCLUSION: Direct and indirect evidence suggests that a large number of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery procedures are aerosol generating. Otolaryngologists are likely at high risk of contracting COVID-19 during aerosol generating procedures because they are likely exposed to high viral loads in patients infected with the virus. Based on the precautionary principle, even though the evidence is not definitive, adopting enhanced personal protective equipment protocols is reasonable based on the evidence. Further research is needed to clarify the risk associated with performing various procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the degree to which various personal protective equipment reduces the risk.","Mick, Paul; Murphy, Russell",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40463-020-00424-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393346/,109
595481,Complete aortic thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-01-26,"Background The RT-qPCR assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus is the favorable approach to test suspected COVID-19 cases. However, discordant results can occur when two or more assays are compared. Variability in analytical sensitivities between assays, among other factors, may account for these differences in reporting. Methods The limits of detection (LOD) for the BD SARS-CoV-2 Reagents for BD MAXTM System ('MAX SARS-CoV-2 assay'), the Biomerieux BioFire(R) Respiratory Panel 2.1 ('BioFire SARS-CoV-2 assay'), the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay ('cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay'), and the Hologic Aptima(R) SARS-CoV-2 assay Panther(R) ('Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay') RT-qPCR systems were determined using a total of 84 contrived nasopharyngeal specimens with seven target levels for each comparator. The positive and negative percent agreement (PPA and NPA, respectively) for the MAX SARS-CoV-2 assay were compared to the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay in a post-market clinical study utilizing 708 paired nasopharyngeal specimens collected from suspected COVID-19 cases. Discordant results were further tested by the cobas and BioFire SARS-CoV-2 assays. Results The measured LOD for the MAX SARS-CoV-2 assay (251 copies/mL) was comparable to the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (298 copies/mL) and the BioFire SARS-CoV-2 assay (302 copies/mL); the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay had a LOD of 612 copies/mL. The MAX SARS-CoV-2 assay had a PPA of 100% (95%CI: [97.3%-100.0%]) and a NPA of 96.7% (95%CI: [94.9%-97.9%]) when compared to the Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay.

596310,Detection of SARS-associated Coronavirus in Throat Wash and Saliva in Early Diagnosis,2004-07-11,"Along with the socio-economic burden the COVID-19 pandemic carried, the strain it brought upon our health care system is unparalleled. In an attempt to conserve much needed personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as to free up available hospital beds to accommodate the significant influx of COVID-19 patients, many elective surgical cases were essentially put on hold. Furthermore, to taper the spread of this highly contagious virus and to protect the medical staff, surgical clinics were limited to urgent care that could not be managed through virtual platforms. Surgical trainees, such as residents and fellows, who solemnly rely on clinical and surgical exposure to hone their operative and clinical skills, were evidently left deprived. As the pandemic rapidly progressed, medical staff in the emergency departments and what is now known as the COVID wards and COVID ICUs quickly became overwhelmed and overworked. This new reality required surgical trainees to rapidly redeploy to help meet the rising hospital needs. With no clear end to this pandemic, surgical trainees worry they will not reach the appropriate milestones and acquire the amount of surgical experience required to become competent surgeons. As a result, a rapid solution should be found and applied to remedy this newly created gap in surgical education. The measures we recommend include access to regular webinars from world-renowned experts, increased implementation of surgical simulation, selective redeployment of residents to favor level-appropriate learning opportunities and lastly, the active participation of trainees in telemedicine with an increase in surgical exposure as soon as the restrictions are lifted.","ElHawary, Hassan; Salimi, Ali; Alam, Peter; Gilardino, Mirko S",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923672/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520951806,109

A cross-sectional questionnaire survey method was used to collect data by asking individuals quantitative and qualitative questions in person which included 6 structured open-ended questions. Participants include operators of purposively selected three classes of small businesses/self-employed services in South-Eastern Nigeria. This involves 120 fashion/event related businesses, 80 food related businesses and 100 general merchandise-a total of 300 small businesses. Quantitative data were analysed by frequencies and descriptive statistics while qualitative data were analysed using thematic/content analysis. It concludes that although COVID-19 lockdown policies are generally perceived to have negative effects on small businesses, these policies have particularly had positive effects on the chemist/pharmacies businesses compared with other small businesses. About 85% increase in patronage of chemist businesses compared with 63.7% decline in patronage of other small businesses is essentially linked to increasing rate of self-medication as a result of government's poor implementation of COVID-19 public health policies amidst lockdown measures-which limited people's access to hospitals and healthcare centres. The study proposes reformed pandemic-lockdown policies to increase people's access to healthcare services and reduce overreliance on self-medication and excessive patronage of roadside chemist/pharmacies.","Iwuoha, Victor Chidubem; Aniche, Ernest Toochi; Obiora, Charles Arinze; Umeifekwem, Uchenna T",The International journal of health planning and management,https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476845/,109

597785,Atypical SARS in Geriatric Patient,2004-02-11,"During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, fear of disease and its consequences, recommended lifestyle changes, and severe restrictions set by governments acted as stressors and affected people’s mood, emotions, mental health, and wellbeing. Many studies conducted during this crisis focused on affective and physiological responses to stress, but few studies examined how the crisis affected cognition. The present cross-sectional study examined the relationship between physiological, affective, and cognitive responses to the epidemic. In an online survey conducted at the height of the first wave of the epidemic in Slovenia (April 15–25, 2020), 830 Slovenian residents aged 18–85 years reported the effects of stressors (confinement, problems at home, problems at work, lack of necessities, and increased workload), experienced emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, changes in health, fatigue and sleep quality, and perceived changes in cognition during the epidemic. Risk factors for stress (neuroticism, vulnerability, general health, gender, and age) were also recorded. We hypothesized that stressors and stress risk factors will be related to subjective cognitive decline, with negative emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, and physical symptoms acting as mediator variables. On average, the results showed a mild subjective cognitive decline during the epidemic. In structural equation modeling, 34% of its variance was predicted by the mediator variables, with negative emotions and physical symptoms having the largest contribution. Stress risk factors were predictably related to the four mediator variables. Among the stressors, confinement showed the strongest effect on the four mediator variables, implying the importance of thoughtful communication about necessary restrictive measures during emergency circumstances. The results of this study indicate that the possibility of altered cognitive function should be considered when planning work and study activities during the epidemic.","Podlesek, Anja; Komidar, Luka; Kavcic, Voyko",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421707/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647971,109

This study assessed bystander interventions, EMS activities, and patient outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic era and compared them with those during the non-COVID-19 pandemic era in Osaka City, Japan, where public-access automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are well established. METHODS: We conducted this population-based cohort study that included all cases with non-traumatic OHCA treated by EMS personnel and excluded cases with no resuscitation attempt, traumatic cases, cases occurring in healthcare facilities, or cases witnessed by EMS personnel. Data were compared between the COVID-19 pandemic period (February 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020) and the non-COVID-19 pandemic period (February 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019).

Some of the after-effects of the Fukushima Daiichi earthquake could have been eased if sensors had been in place inside the four reactors and sensed the overheating causing meltdown and steam explosions. The key element of ultrasonic sensors is the piezoelectric wafer, which is usually derived from lead-zirconate-titanate (Pb(Zr, Ti)O3, PZT). This material loses its piezoelectrical properties at a temperature of about 200 °C. It also undergoes nuclear transmutation. Bismuth titanate (Bi4Ti3O12, BiTi) has been considered as a potential candidate for replacing PZT at the middle of this temperature range, with many possible applications, since it has a Curie-Weiss temperature of about 650 °C. The aim of this article is to describe experimental details for operation in gamma and nuclear radiation concomitant with elevated temperatures and details of the performance of a BiTi sensor during and after irradiation testing. In these experiments, bismuth titanate has been demonstrated to operate up to a fast neutron fluence of 5 × 1020 n/cm2 and gamma radiation of 7.23 × 1021 (gamma/cm2).

It started in China in December 2019, and it rapidly spread throughout Italy, which was the most affected country after China. The pandemic affected all countries with similarly negative effects on the population and health care structures. OBJECTIVE: The evolution of the COVID-19 infections and the way such a phenomenon can be characterized in terms of resources and planning has to be considered. One of the most critical resources has been intensive care units (ICUs) with respect to the infection trend and critical hospitalization. METHODS: We propose a model to estimate the needed number of places in ICUs during the most acute phase of the infection. We also define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future management of patients with COVID-19 by planning their reallocation in health structures of other regions. RESULTS: We applied and assessed the prediction method both at the national and regional levels. ICU bed prediction was tested with respect to real data provided by the Italian government. We showed that our model is able to predict, with a reliable error in terms of resource complexity, estimation parameters used in health care structures. In addition, the proposed method is scalable at different geographic levels. This is relevant for pandemics such as COVID-19, which has shown different case incidences even among northern and southern Italian regions.

In the midst of a statewide shutdown and social distancing recommendations, healthcare providers were encouraged to deliver patient care using telehealth platforms when medically appropriate. As the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to leverage digital mediums to increase patient access to healthcare, our pediatric pulmonary division sought out to measure patient satisfaction with a new telehealth platform. METHOD: A survey was sent to 281 pediatric pulmonary patients from March 2020 to April 2020. Parents were asked to rate their overall experience with telemedicine. RESULTS: 50 surveys were completed, and results indicated that overall initial satisfaction with care was high and participants were likely to use telehealth again in the future. DISCUSSION: 82% of participants either “strongly agreed” or “agreed” that they would use telehealth services again. These outcome measures may reflect increased patient comfort with integrating telehealth into routine pediatric pulmonary care services. Given high patient satisfaction ratings, we believe that the telehealth platform should be considered for use in routine practice after the COVID-19 pandemic has resolved.","Capusan, Karen Y.; Fenster, Talia",J Pediatr Health Care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2021.07.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891524521001875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417077/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891524521001875?v=s5,109

All these viruses were rescued in monkey (Vero E6) cells and were also infectious for human (Huh-7, Huh7.5.1 and CaCo-2) cell lines and for transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), indicating that none of these proteins is essential for the viral cycle. Furthermore, in Vero E6 cells, all the viruses showed the formation of particles with the same morphology as the wt virus, indicating that these proteins do not have a high impact in the final morphology of the virions. Nevertheless, in the absence of E protein, release of virus particles efficacy was reduced. Viruses lacking E protein grew about 100-fold lower than the wt virus in lungs of Tg infected mice but did not grow in the brains of the same animals, in contrast to the rSARS-CoV-Δ[6–9b] virus, which grew almost as well as the wt in both tissues. Viruses lacking E protein were highly attenuated in the highly sensitive hACE-2 Tg mice, in contrast to the minimal rSARS-CoV-Δ[6–9b] and wt viruses. These data indicate that E gene might be a virulence factor influencing replication level, tissue tropism and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, suggesting that ΔE attenuated viruses are promising vaccine candidates.","DeDiego, Marta L.; Pewe, Lecia; Alvarez, Enrique; Rejas, Maria Teresa; Perlman, Stanley; Enjuanes, Luis",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220800175X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220800175X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18452964/,109

However, the primary care system in South Korea is not well established, and primary care research is still in its infancy. This study aimed to show the benefits of regular doctors as primary care providers in South Korea by analyzing the effect of regular doctor visits on emergency room (ER) visits. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 11,293 adults aged 18 years and over collected from the 2013 Korea Health Panel Survey (beta version 1.0). We classified those participants with and without regular doctors into the treatment and control groups, respectively, and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of having a regular doctor on ER visits. We used counterfactual framework and propensity score analysis to adjust for unevenly distributed confounding covariates between treatments and control groups. RESULTS: The estimated conditional ATE of a regular doctor on ER visits was statistically insignificant in the general population (-0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 1.2) and in the subgroup of patients with hypertension (-1.8%; 95% CI, -4.5 to 0.9). However, in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the estimated ATE was statistically significant (-5.0; 95% CI, -9.2 to -0.7).

Surface expression of mutant proteins was evident by immunofluorescence analysis and surface biotinylation. Intracellularly retained S proteins only contained endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-glycans, whereas mutant proteins that migrated to the plasma membrane acquired N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type. Corresponding tyrosine residues are present in the cytoplasmic tails of the S proteins of other animal CoV but not in the tail portion of the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV. Changing the SEPV tetrapeptide in the cytoplasmic tail to YEPI resulted in intracellular retention of the S protein of SARS-CoV. As the S proteins of CoV have receptor binding and fusion activities and are the main target of neutralizing antibodies, the differences in the transport behavior of the S proteins suggest different strategies in the virus host interactions between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses.","Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Al-Falah, Marwan; Escors, David; Wang, Zai; Zimmer, Gert; Deng, Hongkui; Enjuanes, Luis; Naim, Hassan Y.; Herrler, Georg",J Biol Chem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820680358; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820680358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15304515/,109

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables timely treatment and the implementation of public health measures. We validated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, and robustness of the RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection and compared its performance with that of several EUA-approved kits. Our RT-qPCR assay was highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by not amplifying 13 other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. The assay showed high linearity using a viral isolate from a patient with known COVID-19 as well as plasmids containing target SARS-CoV-2 genes as templates. The assay showed good repeatability and reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of 3%, and a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection of 1 PFU/mL. The RT-qPCR-based assay is highly effective and can facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 without the use of EUA-approved kits or reagents in the Republic of Korea.","Chung, Yoon-Seok; Lee, Nam-Joo; Woo, Sang Hee; Kim, Jeong-Min; Kim, Heui Man; Jo, Hye Jun; Park, Ye Eun; Han, Myung-Guk",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94196-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285290/,109

The current paradigm for increasing the safety of the blood supply is the development and implementation of laboratory screening methods and restrictive donor criteria. When considering the large number of known pathogens and the fact that pathogens continue to emerge, it is clear that the utility of new tests and donor restrictions will continue to be a challenge when considering the cost of developing and implementing new screening assays, the loss of potential donors, and the risk of testing errors. Despite improving the safety of blood components, testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The contaminating organisms must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. In contrast, pathogen inactivation is a proactive strategy designed to inactivate a pathogen before it enters the blood supply. Almost all pathogen inactivation technologies target nucleic acids, allowing for the inactivation of a variety of nucleic acid–containing pathogens within plasma, platelets, or red blood cells thus providing the potential to reduce transfusion-transmitted diseases. However, widespread use of a pathogen inactivation technology can only be realized when proven safe and efficacious and not cost-prohibitive.","Allain, Jean Pierre; Bianco, Celso; Blajchman, Morris A.; Brecher, Mark E.; Busch, Michael; Leiby, David; Lin, Lily; Stramer, Susan",Transfus Med Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15852240/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887796304000823; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887796304000823,109
606191,Diagnose SARS‐CoV‐2 associated Guillain–Barre syndrome upon appropriate criteria and after exclusion of differentials,2021-06-10,"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has shown unprecedented response rates in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) hematological malignancies. While CAR-T therapy renders hope to heavily pre-treated patients, the rapid commercialization and cumulative immunosuppression predispose patients to infections for a prolonged period. CAR-T poses distinctive short- and long-term toxicities and infection risks among patients who receive CAR-T after multiple prior treatments, often including hematopoietic cell transplantation. The acute toxicities include cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. The long-term B-cell depletion, hypogammaglobulinemia, and cytopenia further predispose patients to severe infections and abrogate the remission success achieved by the living drug. These on-target-off-tumor toxicities deplete B-cells across the entire lineage and further diminish immune responses to vaccines. Early observational data suggest that patients with hematologic malignancies may not mount an adequate humoral and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this review, we summarize the immune comprising factors indigenous to CAR-T recipients. We discuss the immunogenic potential of different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the differences in the manufacturing platforms among CAR-T recipients. Given the lack of data related to the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in this distinctively immunosuppressed cohort, we summarize the infection risks associated with FDA-approved CAR-T constructs and the potential determinants of vaccine responses.

This study compared the performance of commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The diagnostic accuracy of five commercially available EIAs (Abbott, Euroimmun, EDI, ImmunoDiagnostics, and Roche) to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated from cross-sectional samples of potential CCP donors that had prior molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection for sensitivity (n=214) and pre-pandemic emergency department patients for specificity (n=1,102). Of the 214 potential CCP donors, all were sampled >14 days since symptom onset and only a minority had been hospitalized due to COVID-19 (n=16 [7.5%]); 140 potential CCP donors were tested by all five EIAs and a microneutralization assay. When performed according to the manufacturers’ protocol to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of each EIA ranged from 76.4% to 93.9%, and the specificity of each EIA ranged from 87.0% to 99.6%. Using a nAb titer cutoff of ≥160 as the reference positive test (n=140 CCP donors), the empirical area under receiver operating curve of each EIA ranged from 0.66 (Roche) to 0.90 (Euroimmun).

Subsequently, we verified that all the mutants at the residue 185, regardless of amino acid size (including Cys and Ser) and charge (including Glu and Lys), impaired nsp4 catalytic activity. However, when Asp185 in nsp4 was replaced by a similar structure amino acid Asparagine 185 (Asn185), nsp4 stayed but with a decreased protease activity.

Funding for other treatments, in particular new treatments, may become more constrained than previously expected. Therefore, a robust health technology assessment (HTA) system is vital. Many clinical trials carried out during the pandemic may have been temporarily halted, while others may have had to change their protocols. Even trials that continue as normal may experience external changes as other aspects of the healthcare service may not be available to the patients in the trial, or the patients themselves may contract COVID-19. Consequently, many limitations are likely to arise in the provision of robust HTAs, which could have profound consequences on the availability of new treatments. Therefore, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics Review Group wishes to discuss these issues and make recommendations for applicants submitting to HTA agencies, in ample time for these HTAs to be prepared and assessed. We discuss how the pandemic may affect the estimation of the treatment effect, costs, life-years, utilities, discontinuation rates, and methods of evidence synthesis and extrapolation. In particular, we note that trials conducted during the pandemic will be subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than before. It is vital that applicants clearly identify any parameters that may be affected by the pandemic.

Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the human coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2, indicate cytokine involvement. Our laboratory showed that an experimental murine coronavirus (MHV-A59) can be transmitted into the brain by intranasal or intracerebral exposure and that neurovirulence is mediated by cytokine secretion. In this study we investigated which cells in the brain produce cytokines, thus functioning as the brain's innate immune system. Using tissue cultures of microglia, and clonal populations of astrocytes, we found that microglia and type I astrocytes (but not types II and III), produced pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to MHV-A59 infection. A molecularly closely related, non-encephalitic strain of the virus (MHV-2) caused in vitro infection, but without cytokine induction. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that type I astrocytes and microglia have perivascular foot processes necessary for the formation of the perivascular glymphatic system, the anatomical site of the brain's innate immune system. Cytokine secretion by type I astrocytes and microglia, as part of the brain's glymphatic and innate immune system, contributes to the pathogenesis of an encephalitic coronavirus infection, and indicates the rationale for anti-cytokine therapies for COVID-19.","Lavi, Ehud; Cong, Lin",Exp Mol Pathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014480020304500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32454103/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2020.104474; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014480020304500?v=s5,109

As RIG-I is absent in chickens, MDA5 is hypothesized to be important in detecting viral nucleic acids in the cytoplasm. However, the molecular mechanism of the regulation of chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) expression has yet to be fully elucidated. With this in mind, a ∼2.5 kb chMDA5 gene promoter region was examined and PCR amplified to assess its role in immune response. A chMDA5 promoter reporter plasmid (piggybac-MDA5-DsRed) was constructed and transfected into DF-1 cells to establish a Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line. The MDA5 promoter activity was extremely low under basal condition, but was dramatically increased when cells were stimulated with polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), interferon beta (IFN-β) or Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV). The DsRed mRNA level represented the promoter activity and was remarkably increased, which matched the expression of endogenous MDA5. However, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to increase the MDA5 promoter activity and the expression of endogenous MDA5. The results indicated that the promoter and the Piggybac-MDA5-DsRed cell line could be utilized to determine whether a ligand regulates MDA5 expression.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mental health burden of the Turkish population and vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the effects of social support. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We assessed depression, anxiety, stress symptoms and perceived social support among 894 people all over Turkey, using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) two months after the declaration of the first COVID-19 case in Turkey. RESULTS: According to DASS-21 subscale scores, the findings showed that the prevalence of moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress-related symptoms was 24.8%, 21.9% and 12.6%, respectively. Female gender, being single, having a lifetime psychiatric disorder, lower education level and financial concerns were significantly associated with higher DASS-21 scores.

This hypothesis was revealed by an explainable artificial intelligence system unleashed on open public biomedical datasets. As a foundation for scientific rigor, we describe the data and the artificial intelligence system, document the provenance and methodology used to derive the hypothesis and also gather potentially relevant data/evidence from recent studies. We conclude that while correlations may not be reason for causation, correlations from multiple sources is more than a serendipitous co-incidence that is worthy of further and deeper investigation.","Rickett, Christopher D.; Maschhoff, Kristyn J.; Sukumar, Sreenivas R.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720332862?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110395; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720332862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33341328/,109

Emerging evidence and past experience from other coronaviruses suggests that people with underlying liver disease including viral hepatitis could be at risk of disease severity and mortality. However, with the present relatively low screening rates for the most prevalent viral hepatitis – Hepatitis B and C, many COVID‐19 cases especially in low middle income countries are unlikely to be screened for viral hepatitis coinfection. Without active screening, little will be known about the clinical and epidemiological manifestations which could negatively impact public health efforts.

This study investigated an alternative herbal feed additive, Guizhi Li-Zhong Tang (GLZ), for preventing pneumonia in weanling piglets. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that GLZ has high antioxidant capacity and low cytotoxicity toward Kupffer cells. In addition, GLZ treatment can alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced damage in Kupffer cells. A total of 94 4-week-old piglets were randomly divided into three groups, which received sham treatment, 0.2% Tilmicosin antibiotic (TAB) treatment, or 0.2% GLZ treatment. Piglets receiving the GLZ treatment had a higher survival rate and higher immunoglobulin G levels but lower allergy-related eosinophil levels and cough incidence than did piglets receiving the sham or 0.2% TAB treatments. Through immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis, we discovered that piglets receiving the 0.2% GLZ treatment had significantly higher expression of antioxidant-related SOD2 and lower expression of oxidative-stress-related 3-NT (p < 0.01), inflammation-related TNF-α (p < 0.01) and NF-κB (p < 0.05), and apoptosis-related caspase-3 (p < 0.01) in lung tissue than did piglets receiving the sham or 0.2% TAB treatment. Therefore, GLZ treatment is promising as an alternative to antibiotic medicine for weanling piglets because of its protective antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects in lung tissue.","Wang, Che-Hsuan; Wu, Wan-Jhen; Su, Li-Yu; Lu, Chen-Wen; Wang, Pei-Hwa; Lee, Ming-Chung; Chuang, Wu-Chang; Wang, Sheue-Er; Wu, Chung-Hsin",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539798/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/4978783,109

617814,School Closure to Reduce Influenza Transmission,2009-01-11,"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted on radiotherapy (RT) strategy for breast cancer patients, which might lead to increased distressing psychological symptoms. We performed a multi-center cross-section survey to investigate prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) and predictors for FCR in patients referred to RT during pandemic. METHODS: 542 patients were consecutively enrolled from three regions in China including Yangtze Delta River Region, Guangdong and Shanxi province. Patients’ characteristics were collected using an information sheet, Fear of progression questionnaire-short form, Hospital Anxiety/Depression Scale and EORTC QLQ-C30. The hierarchical multiple regression models were performed. RESULTS: 488 patients with complete data were eligible. The RT strategy was affected in 265 (54.3%) patients, including 143 with delayed RT initiation, 66 believing to have delayed RT initiation but actually not, 24 with RT interruptions, 19 shifting to local hospitals for RT and the remaining 13 influenced on both RT schedule and hospital level. The model explained 59.7% of observed variances in FCR (p<0.001) and showed that influence of RT strategy had significantly impacted on FCR (△R2 = 0.01, △F=2.966, p=0.019). Hospitals in Shanxi province (β=-0.117, p=0.001), emotional function (β=-0.19, p<0.001), social function (β=-0.111, p=0.006), anxiety (β=0.434, p<0.001) and RT interruption (β=0.071, p=0.035) were independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: RT strategy for breast cancer patients was greatly influenced during pandemic. RT interruption is an independent predictor for high FCR. Our findings emphasize the necessity to ensure continuum of RT, and efforts should be taken to alleviate FCR through psychological interventions.","Xie, Jinrong; Qi, Weixiang; Cao, Lu; Tan, Yuting; Huang, Jin; Gu, Xiaodong; Chen, Bingguang; Shen, Peipei; Zhao, Yutian; Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Qingwen; Huang, Hecheng; Wang, Yubin; Fang, Haicheng; Jin, Zhenjun; Li, Hui; Zhao, Xuehong; Qian, Xiaofang; Xu, Feifei; Ou, Dan; Wang, Shubei; Xu, Cheng; Li, Min; Jiang, Zefei; Wang, Yu; Huang, Xiaobo; Chen, Jiayi",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.650766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381703/,109

As parents are primary decision makers for their children, we aimed to assess parents’ perceptions and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination for their children, including for some underserved populations (e.g., newcomers, Indigenous peoples, and visible minority groups). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional national survey of Canadian parents in December 2020, just as COVID-19 vaccines were approved for adults, to assess intention to vaccinate their children (aged 0-17 years) against COVID-19, perceptions of COVID-19 disease and vaccines, previous uptake of influenza and routine vaccines, and sociodemographic characteristics. Binomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between parents' COVID-19 vaccination intention for their children and exposure variables. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of parents (1074/1702) intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Those employed part-time (compared to full-time) had lower intention to vaccinate their children (aOR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.06-2.84), while those who spoke languages other than English, French, or Indigenous languages were less likely to have low intention (aOR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.92). Low vaccination intention was also associated with children not receiving influenza vaccine pre-pandemic (aOR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.04-2.21), parents having low intention to vaccinate themselves against COVID-19 (aOR=9.22, 95% CI: 6.43-13.34), believing COVID-19 vaccination is unnecessary (aOR=2.59, 95% CI: 1.72-3.91) or unsafe (aOR=4.21, 95% CI: 2.96-5.99), and opposing COVID-19 vaccine use in children without prior testing (aOR=3.09, 95% CI: 1.87-5.24). INTERPRETATION: Parents’ COVID-19 vaccination intentions for their children are better predicted by previous decisions regarding influenza vaccination than routine childhood vaccines, and other perceptions of COVID-19 vaccine-related factors. Public communication should highlight the safety and necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in children to support a return to normal activities.

Method: We modelled the relationship of various predictors (health systems variables, population and population health indicators) together with variables indicating public health measures (school closures, border closures, country lockdown) in 40 European and other countries, using Generalized Linear Models and minimized information criteria to select the best fitting and most parsimonious models. Results: We fitted two models with log-linearly linked variables on gamma-distributed outome variables (CoV2 cases and Covid-19 related deaths, standardized on population). Population standardized cases were best predicted by number of tests, life-expectancy in a country, and border closure (negative predictor, i.e. preventive). Population standardized deaths were best predicted by time, the virus had been in the country, life expectancy, smoking (negative predictor, i.e. preventive), and school closures (positive predictor, i.e. accelerating). Model fit statistics and model adequacy were good. Discussion and Interpretation: Interestingly, none of the variables that code for the preparedness of the medical system, for health status or other population parameters were predictive. Of the public health variables only border closure had the potential of preventing cases and none were predictors for preventing deaths. School closures, likely as a proxy for social distancing, was associated with increased deaths. Conclusion: The pandemic seems to run its autonomous course and only border closure has the potential to prevent cases. None of the contributes to preventing deaths.","Walach, H.; Hockertz, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.18.20135012v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.18.20135012,109

Abnormal liver chemistry tests of varying severities occur in a majority of patients. However, there is a dearth of accompanying liver histologic studies in these patients. Methods: The current report details the clinical courses of two patients having severe COVID-19 hepatitis. Liver biopsies were analyzed under light microscopy, portions of liver tissue were hybridized with a target probe to the SARS-CoV-2 S gene, and small sections from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded liver tissue were processed for electron microscopy. Results The liver histology of both cases showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with prominent bile duct damage, endotheliitis and many apoptotic bodies. In-situ hybridization and electron microscopy suggest the intrahepatic presence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the findings of which may indicate the possibility of direct cell injury. Conclusions Based on the abundant apoptosis and severe cholangiocyte injury, these histopathological changes suggest a direct cytopathic injury. Furthermore, some of the histopathological changes may resemble acute cellular rejection occurring after liver transplantation. These two cases demonstrate that severe COVID-19 hepatitis can occur even in the absence of significant involvement of other organs.","Fiel, M.

Virus transmission in humans was quickly halted by public health measures and human infections of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have not been observed since. However, other coronaviruses still pose a continuous threat to human health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans. The work on SARS-CoV widens our knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and immunology of coronaviruses and may shed light on MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It has been confirmed that T-cell immunity plays an important role in recovery from SARS-CoV infection. Herein, we summarize T-cell immunological studies of SARS-CoV and discuss the potential cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-specific immunity against MERS-CoV, which may provide useful recommendations for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against coronavirus infections.","Liu, William J.; Zhao, Min; Liu, Kefang; Xu, Kun; Wong, Gary; Tan, Wenjie; Gao, George F.",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216304016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216304016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840203/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.11.006,109

Although many models have been developed all around the world, transparent models that allow interacting with the assumptions will become more important as we test various strategies for lockdown, testing and social interventions and enable effective policy decisions. In this paper we developed a suite of models to guide development of policies under different scenarios when the lockdown opens. These had been deployed to create an interactive dashboard called COVision which includes the Agent based Models (ABM) and classical compartmental models i.e Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) approaches. Our tool allows simulation of scenarios by changing strength of lockdown, basic reproduction number(R0), asymptomatic spread, testing rate, contact rate (Beta), recovery rate (Gamma), incubation period and starting number of cases. We optimized ABMs and classical compartmental models to fit the actual data, both of which performed well in terms of R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Out of the three models in our suite, ABM was able to capture the data better than SIR and SEIR and achieved an RSQ of 92.3% for India and 89% for Maharashtra for the next 30 days. We also computed R0 using SIR and SEIR models which were found to be decreasing over the different periods of lockdown indicating the effectiveness of policies and interventions. Finally, we formulated ICU bed requirements using our best models. Our evaluation suggests that ABM models were able to capture the dynamic nature of the epidemic for a longer duration of time while classical SIR and SEIR models performed inefficiently for longer terms. The visual interactivity and ability to simulate outcomes under different parameters will allow the policymakers to make informed decisions for estimating the strength of lockdown to be implemented and testing rates. Further, our models were able to highlight the differences at state level for the parameters such as R0 and contact rates and hence can be applied for state specific decision making.

Medical students could not remain uninvolved. Our aim is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health, and to evaluate their awareness and aptitude for contributing to the fight against COVID-19. METHODS: An in-depth search of the literature was performed in Pubmed database, for studies investigating the preferred source of information about COVID-19, the knowledge on virus transmission, COVID-19 clinical symptoms and preventive measures against its spread, and the impact of COVID-19 on mental health among medical students. Their potential roles during the COVID-19 pandemic were also investigated. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included. The majority of medical students prefer social media to acquire knowledge about COVID-19. They are adequately informed about COVID-19 transmission and symptoms, as well as preventive measures against COVID-19, although wearing a face-mask is not so popular among them. Their mental health is affected, mainly expressed as a fear of infection. Possible alternative roles of students during pandemic may be providing information to the public and tracing contacts of infected people. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students have an adequate level of knowledge upon COVID-19 and implement proper strategies to prevent its spread.

From the adoption of electronic medical records to mobile health apps and other disruptive technologies, digital health solutions have promised a better quality of care at a more sustainable cost. However, the widescale adoption of these solutions is lagging behind. The most adverse scenarios often provide an opportunity to develop and test the capacity of digital health technologies to increase the efficiency of health care systems. Catalonia (Northeast Spain) is one of the most advanced regions in terms of digital health adoption across Europe. The region has a long tradition of health information exchange in the public health care sector and is currently implementing an ambitious digital health strategy. In this viewpoint, we discuss the crucial role digital health solutions play during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic to support public health policies. We also report on the strategies currently deployed at scale during the outbreak in Catalonia.","Pérez Sust, Pol; Solans, Oscar; Fajardo, Joan Carles; Medina Peralta, Manuel; Rodenas, Pepi; Gabaldà, Jordi; Garcia Eroles, Luis; Comella, Adrià; Velasco Muñoz, César; Sallent Ribes, Josuè; Roma Monfa, Rosa; Piera-Jimenez, Jordi",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/19106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339998/,109

Mapping this health emergency in scientific publications demands multiple approaches to obtain a picture as complete as possible. To progress in the knowledge of this pandemic and to control its effects, international collaborations between researchers are essentials, as well as having open and immediate access to scientific publications, what we called “coopetition”. Our main objectives are to identify the most productive countries in coronavirus publications, to analyse the international scientific collaboration on this topic, and to study the proportion and typology of open accessibility to these publications. We have analyzed 18,875 articles indexed in Web of Science. We performed the descriptive statistical analysis in order to explore the performance of the more prolific countries and organizations, as well as paying attention to the last 2 years. Registers have been analyzed separately via the VOSviewer software, drawing a network of links among countries and organizations to identify the starred countries and organizations, and the strongest links of the net. We have explored the capacity of researchers to generate scientific knowledge about a health crisis emergency, and their global capacity to collaborate among them in a global emergency. We consider that science is moving rapidly to find solutions to international health problems but access to this knowledge by society is not so quick due to several limitations (open access policies, corporate interests, etc.). We have observed that papers from China in the last 3 months (from January 2020 to March 2020) have a strong impact compared with papers published in years before. The United States and China are the major producers of documents of our sample, followed by all European countries, especially the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and France. At the same time, the leading role of Saudi Arabia, Canada or South Korea should be noted, with a significant number of documents submitted but very different dynamics of international collaboration. The proportion of international collaboration is growing in all countries in 2019–2020, which contrasts with the situation of the last two decades. The organizations providing the most documents to the sample are mostly Chinese. The percentage of open access articles on coronavirus for the period 2001–2020 is 59.2% but if we focus in 2020 the figures increase up to 91.4%, due to the commitment of commercial publishers with the emergency.","Belli, Simone; Mugnaini, Rogério; Baltà, Joan; Abadal, Ernest",Scientometrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836526/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03590-7,109

Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. In addition, experimental results on large scale 2D dataset with CT slices show that our method significantly outperforms cutting-edge segmentation methods on all evaluation metrics. Our proposed method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.","Zhang, Yichi; Liao, Qingcheng; Yuan, Lin; Zhu, He; Xing, Jiezhen; Zhang, Jicong",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415840/; https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2021.3106341,109

People from different ethnic backgrounds are experiencing different outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several cohort studies reported the common neurological manifestations and complications associated with COVID-19 disease around the world however, the prevalence of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Arab countries and Saudi Arabia is still unknown. Objective: To study the prevalence, risk factors, and characteristics of the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 and their relationship with clinical outcomes. Methods: We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational, cohort study of consecutive hospitalized adults COVID-19 patients with and without neurological manifestation admitted between March 2020 until the end of December 2020. Data was collected prospectively using electronic medical records; Cases and controls were observed until they either get discharged from the hospital or died. The primary outcomes were death, survival, and survival with sequalae. Results: Among 497 patients with COVID-19, 118 patients (23.7%) had neurological complications, 94 patients (18.9%) had encephalopathy, and 16 patients (3.2%) had cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Patients with COVID-19-related neurological complications were older and more likely to have a pre-existing neurological disease. The most common neurological syndrome associated with COVID-19 were encephalopathy (18.9%) and headache (13.7%). Pre-existing neurological disease and an elevated neutrophil count were the strongest predictors of developing any neurological complications. Death form COVID-19 was associated with age (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.10, P = 0.001), invasive ventilation (OR 37.12, 95% CI 13.36–103.14), COVID-19-related-neurological complications (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.28–8.21, P = 0.01), and elevated CRP level (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.01, P = 0.01). Conclusions: COVID-19 is associated with a wide range of neurological manifestations in people living in Saudi Arabia, with older individuals and those with underlying neurological disorders being most at risk.

625066,Are SARS Superspreaders Cloud Adults?,2005-04-11,"Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are either highly prevalent or increasing rapidly in Hong Kong and China. Treatment options for these bacteria are generally limited, less effective and more expensive. The emergence and dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria circulating between animals, the environment and humans are not entirely known. Nonetheless, selective pressure by antibiotics on the microbiomes of animal and human, and their associated environments (especially farms and healthcare institutions), sewage systems and soil are likely to confer survival advantages upon bacteria with antimicrobial-resistance genes, which may be further disseminated through plasmids or transposons with integrons. Therefore, antibiotic use must be tightly regulated to eliminate such selective pressure, including the illegalization of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed and regulation of antibiotic use in veterinary practice and human medicine. Heightened awareness of infection control measures to reduce the risk of acquiring resistant bacteria is essential, especially during antimicrobial use or institutionalization in healthcare facilities. The transmission cycle must be interrupted by proper hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, avoidance of undercooked or raw food and compliance with infection control measures by healthcare workers, visitors and patients, especially during treatment with antibiotics. In addition to these routine measures, proactive microbiological screening of hospitalized patients with risk factors for carrying resistant bacteria, including history of travel to endemic countries, transfer from other hospitals, and prolonged hospitalization; directly observed hand hygiene before oral intake of drugs, food and drinks; and targeted disinfection of high-touch or mutual-touch items, such as bed rails and bed curtains, are important. Transparency of surveillance data from each institute for public scrutiny provides an incentive for controlling antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings at an administrative level.","Cheng, Vincent CC; Wong, Sally CY; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038766/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2015.8,109

Design: An outbreak investigation. Setting: 4 nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. Participants: 394 residents and 70 staff in nursing homes. Interventions: Two point-prevalence surveys one week apart where residents underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing and had relevant symptoms documented. Asymptomatic staff from three of the four homes were also offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality, and mortality attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in residents and staff. Results: Overall, 26% (95% confidence interval 22 to 31) of residents died over the two-month period. All-cause mortality increased by 203% (95% CI 70 to 336). Systematic testing identified 40% (95% CI 35 to 46) of residents, of whom 43% (95% CI 34 to 52) were asymptomatic and 18% (95% CI 11 to 24) had atypical symptoms, as well as 4% (95% CI -1 to 9) of asymptomatic staff who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

There is no specific therapy. The current therapies have mainly been adapted from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir–ritonavir or mycophenolate mofetil, and have not been subject to well-organized clinical trials. The development of specific therapies and vaccines is therefore urgently required. We examine existing and potential therapies and vaccines from a molecular perspective. These include viral S protein targeting; inhibitors of host proteases, including TMPRSS2, cathepsin L and furin protease, and of viral M(pro) and the PL(pro) proteases; convalescent plasma; and vaccine candidates. The Medline database was searched using combinations and variations of terms, including ‘Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus’, ‘MERS-CoV’, ‘SARS’, ‘therapy’, ‘molecular’, ‘vaccine’, ‘prophylactic’, ‘S protein’, ‘DPP4’, ‘heptad repeat’, ‘protease’, ‘inhibitor’, ‘anti-viral’, ‘broad-spectrum’, ‘interferon’, ‘convalescent plasma’, ‘lopinavir ritonavir’, ‘antibodies’, ‘antiviral peptides’ and ‘live attenuated viruses’. There are many options for the development of MERS-CoV-specific therapies. Currently, MERS-CoV is not considered to have pandemic potential. However, the high mortality rate and potential for mutations that could increase transmissibility give urgency to the search for direct, effective therapies. Well-designed and controlled clinical trials are needed, both for existing therapies and for prospective direct therapies.","Rabaan, Ali A.; Alahmed, Shamsah H.; Bazzi, Ali M.; Alhani, Hatem M.",Journal of Medical Microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.000565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28855003/,109

Additionally, the pedagogical concerns of lecturers have been extensively described and focus on the belief that recording lectures will impact on attendance and will reduce interactivity and active learning activities in lectures. However, little work has looked at the relationship between attitudes towards lecture capture and broader conceptions of learning and teaching. In this pre-registered study, we administered the Conceptions of Learning and Teaching scale and a novel lecture capture attitude scale to 159 higher education teachers. We found that appreciation of active learning predicted more positive attitudes towards lecture recordings as an educational support tool, whilst higher teacher-centred scores predicted greater concern about the negative educational impact of recordings. The effects observed were small; however, they are strong evidence against the view that it is instructors who value participatory and active learning that are opposed to lecture capture. Exploratory analyses also suggested that those who did not view recordings as an essential educational resource record fewer of their lectures, highlighting the real-world impact that attitudes can have, and further strengthening the need for staff to be provided with evidence-based guidance upon which to base their teaching practice.

However, despite a lower risk of children becoming acutely ill with COVID-19, there nevertheless may be significant and potentially sustained effects of COVID-19 on the physical, psychological, and emotional health and well-being of children. Focusing on the context of children’s cancer care, and specifically bone marrow transplant (BMT), we describe some of these effects and then address one specific ethical challenge that arises. That is the question of what and how much to tell children whose cancer treatment has been changed because of COVID-19. Drawing on our previous work on the ethical reasons for telling the truth to younger children (aged 5-12) we link different ethical reasons to the different types of information that could be given to children in this context. We argue that children should be given an explanation of the changes that they will directly experience, including some changes to the process of their actual medical treatment; but not about increased risk associated with these changes, unless they specifically ask for this information.","Gillam, Lynn; Spriggs, Merle; Delany, Clare; Conyers, Rachael; McCarthy, Maria",J Bioeth Inq,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10052-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169257/,109

This study evaluated patient demographic factors associated with delayed breast imaging or procedure appointments due to COVID-19. Methods: Patients attending a breast imaging or procedure appointment at the Pennsylvania Hospital Breast Center from December 28, 2020 to January 31, 2021 were asked to complete a voluntary and anonymous survey on the impact of COVID-19. Chi-squared and two-sample t-tests were used to analyze correlations between having a delayed appointment and various demographic variables. Results: Five hundred seventy patients completed the survey. Participants were more likely to have delayed a breast imaging or procedure appointment if they were younger (53.9 versus 57.4 years old, p=0.014), had more total household residents (2.7 versus 2.2, p=0.019) or children (0.8 versus 0.4, p=0.016), personally had COVID-19 (p=0.04), or personally had to quarantine (p<0.01). Race, ethnicity, education, income level, and marital status were not found to statistically significantly correlate with having a delayed appointment. Conclusion: This study found that younger age, a greater number of residents and children in the household, and having a personal history of COVID-19 infection or quarantining were factors significantly correlated with delaying a breast imaging or procedure appointment. As radiology practices prepare to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on screening practices and cancer outcomes, these findings may help imaging centers refine patient outreach efforts and policy accommodations to protect the most vulnerable populations.","Li, Shiyi; O'Brien, Sophia; Murphy, Christina; Nabil, Calisi",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540462/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17235,109

Later, SARS-CoV-2 infections in mink were reported in many European and North American countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples from 590 mink from a total of 28 farms were tested by real-time RT-PCR. Whole genome sequences from one positive farm were generated and genetic relatedness was established. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on a breeder farm with stock of 5,850 mink. Active viraemia was confirmed in individually tested samples with Ct values respectively between 19.4 and 29.6 for E and N gene fragments. Further testing of samples from culled animals revealed 70% positivity in throat swabs and 30% seropositivity in blood samples. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length nucleotide sequences of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates revealed that they belong to the 20B Nextstrain clade. Several nucleotide mutations were found in analysed samples compared to the reference Wuhan HU-1 strain and some of them were nonsynonymous.

640667,Laboratory Analysis of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Pregnant Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,2021-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Low-value care, or patient care that offers no net benefit in specific clinical scenarios, is costly and often associated with patient harm. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Grade D recommendations represent one of the most scientifically sound and frequently delivered groups of low-value services, but a more contemporary measurement of the utilization and spending for Grade D services beyond the small number of previously studied measures is needed. OBJECTIVE: To estimate utilization and costs of seven USPSTF Grade D services among US Medicare beneficiaries. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study of data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) from 2007 to 2016 to identify instances of Grade D services. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: NAMCS is a nationally representative survey of US ambulatory visits at non-federal and non-hospital-based offices that uses a multistage probability sampling design. We included all visits by Medicare enrollees, which included traditional fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage, supplemental coverage, and dual-eligible Medicare-Medicaid enrollees. MAIN MEASURES: We measured annual utilization of seven Grade D services among adult Medicare patients, using inclusion and exclusion criteria from prior studies and the USPSTF recommendations. We calculated annual costs by multiplying annual utilization counts by mean per-unit costs of services using publicly available sources. KEY RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 95,121 unweighted Medicare patient visits, representing approximately 2.4 billion visits. Each year, these seven Grade D services were utilized 31.1 million times for Medicare beneficiaries and cost $477,891,886. Three services—screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria, vitamin D supplements for fracture prevention, and colorectal cancer screening for adults over 85 years—comprised $322,382,772, or two-thirds of the annual costs of the Grade D services measured in this study. CONCLUSIONS: US Medicare beneficiaries frequently received a group of rigorously defined and costly low-value preventive services. Spending on low-value preventive care concentrated among a small subset of measures, representing important opportunities to safely lower US health care spending while improving the quality of care.

641114,The epidemiology of hospital inpatient exposure to SARS-CoV-2: A cohort study,2021-09-04,"COVID-19 outbreak poses a severe health emergency to the global community. Due to availability of limited data, the selection of an effective treatment is a challenge. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a chloroquine (CQ) derivative administered for malaria and autoimmune diseases, has been shown to be effective against both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2. Apart from the known adverse effects of these drugs, recently the use of CQ and HCQ as a potential treatment for COVID-19 is under flux globally. In this study, we focused on identifying a more potent analogue of HCQ and CQ against the spike protein of SAR-CoV-2 that can act as an effective antiviral agent for COVID-19 treatment. Systematic pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, basicity predictions virtual screening and molecular dynamics analysis (200 ns) were carried out to predict the inhibition potential of the analogous compounds on the spike protein. This work identifies the six potential analogues, out of which two compounds, namely 1-[1-(6-Chloroquinolin-4-yl) piperidin-4-yl]piperidin-3-ol and (1R,2R)-2-N-(7-Chloroquinolin-4-yl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine interact with the active site of the spike protein similar to HCQ and CQ respectively with augmented safety profile.","Sinha, Meetali; Gupta, Anshika; Gupta, Shristee; Singh, Prakrity; Pandit, Shraddha; Chauhan, Shweta Singh; Parthasarathi, Ramakrishnan",Comput Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521000160?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535144/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521000160; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104222,109

It has not been evaluated if the original predictive performance of these scores holds true nor compared it against Clinical Gestalt predictions. We tested the current predictive accuracy of six COVID-19 scores and compared it with Clinical Gestalt predictions. Methods: 200 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Mexico City between September and December 2020. Clinical Gestalt predictions of death (as a percentage) and LOW-HARM, qSOFA, MSL-COVID-19, NUTRI-CoV and NEWS2 were obtained at admission. We calculated the AUC of each score and compared it against Clinical Gestalt predictions and against their respective originally reported value. Results: 106 men and 60 women aged 56+/-9 and with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The observed AUC of all scores was significantly lower than originally reported; LOW-HARM 0.96 (0.94-0.98) vs 0.76 (0.69-0.84), qSOFA 0.74 (0.65-0.81) vs 0.61 (0.53-0.69), MSL-COVID-19 0.72 (0.69-0.75) vs 0.64 (0.55-0.73) NUTRI-CoV 0.79 (0.76-0.82) vs 0.60 (0.51-0.69), NEWS2 0.84 (0.79-0.90) vs 0.65 (0.56-0.75), Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio 0.74 (0.62-0.85) vs 0.65 (0.57-0.73). Clinical Gestalt predictions were non-inferior to mortality scores (AUC=0.68 (0.59-0.77)). Adjusting the LOW-HARM score with locally derived likelihood ratios did not improve its performance. However, some scores performed better than Clinical Gestalt predictions when clinician's confidence of prediction was <80%. Conclusion: No score was significantly better than Clinical Gestalt predictions. Despite its subjective nature, Clinical Gestalt has relevant advantages for predicting COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Soto-Mota, A.; Marfil-Garza, B.

This study aimed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on orthodontists and orthodontic residents in Nigeria. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among consenting orthodontists and orthodontic residents. The respondents were contacted through the WhatsApp group of the Nigerian Association of Orthodontists to fill the self-administered online questionnaires (Google forms). The questionnaire had two sections: A, Sociodemographics; B, Perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive statistics were used to compute mean and standard deviation and chi-square for association. Level of significance was set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: This study population comprised 98 people; however, only 73 participants responded, which represented a response rate of 74.5%. Approximately 60% (44) of the respondents thought that the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a reduction in the number of orthodontic patients in the future, whereas almost all the respondents reported that it would affect their future practice of orthodontics. Most of the respondents (63.0%) reported that the pandemic had recorded a moderate to severe negative economic impact on them. Significant gender differences were recorded, in the social life of respondents, in addition to economic and psychosocial effects. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all respondents reported that they would change their future practice of orthodontics, particularly with respect to placing a greater emphasis on infection control.

For any infectious disease, there are three kinds of way to control the epidemic of infectious disease-that is, to control the source of infection, to cut off transmission routes, and to protect the susceptible population. As a new infectious disease, it is difficult to develop a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 in a short period of time. So, it is not possible to protect susceptible population at present. Social distancing is one of the main ways to cut off transmission routes - people cannot pass on infection if they do not come into contact with other people.

We compared the epidemiology and severity of RVI in Ecuador during 2009–2016. METHODS: Respiratory specimens collected within the national surveillance system were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. Overall and virus-specific positive detection rate (PDR) were calculated and compared the timing of epidemics caused by the different viruses. Logistic regression models were used to compare the age distribution and risk of death across respiratory viruses. RESULTS: A total of 41,172 specimens were analyzed: influenza (PDR = 14.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (PDR = 9.5%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Influenza epidemics typically peaked in December–January and RSV epidemics in March; seasonality was less evident for the other viruses. Compared to adults, children were more frequently infected with RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza B, while the elderly were less frequently infected with influenza A(H1N1)p. The age-adjusted risk of death was highest for A(H1N1)p (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.38–2.17), and lowest for RSV (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57–0.98).

We present the cases of 2 pregnant women in their third trimester who were admitted for delivery by cesarean delivery and who, through universal screening, tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019. The maternal and fetal sides of the placenta were sectioned from both patients for viral analysis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the placental-extracted RNA revealed a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on the fetal side of the placenta in both patients. The virus was isolated from the patient with the lowest cycle threshold value on the fetal side of the placenta. Whole genome sequencing showed that the virus detected in this placenta was from the B1 lineage. Immunohistochemical analysis of the placental tissue detected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the endothelial cells of chorionic villi vessels proximal to both the maternal and fetal sides, with a granular cytoplasmic pattern and perinuclear reinforcement. Histologic examination of the placenta also detected a dense infiltrate of lymphoid cells around decidual vessels and endothelial cells with cytopathic changes, especially on the maternal side. Nasopharyngeal swabs from the infants that were subjected to reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at 24 hours after birth.

We aimed to assess this in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We studied in 565 patients with type 2 diabetes in the CovidPredict Clinical Course Cohort whether use of a DPP-4 inhibitor prior to hospital admission due to COVID-19 was associated with improved clinical outcomes. Using crude analyses and propensity score matching (on age, sex and BMI), 28 patients using a DPP-4 inhibitor were identified and compared to non-users. RESULTS: No differences were found in the primary outcome mortality (matched-analysis = odds-ratio: 0,94 [95% confidence interval: 0,69 – 1,28], p-value: 0,689) or any of the secondary outcomes (ICU admission, invasive ventilation, thrombotic events or infectious complications). Additional analyses comparing users of DPP-4 inhibitors with subgroups of non-users (subgroup 1: users of metformin and sulphonylurea; subgroup 2: users of any insulin combination), allowing to correct for diabetes severity, did not yield different results.

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7, a variant identified in the UK in late 2020, contains a higher than typical level of point mutants across its genome, including P681H in the spike S1/S2 cleavage site. Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from Wuhan-Hu1 and B.1.1.7 and observed no definitive difference in furin cleavage between Wuhan-Hu1 and B.1.1.7 in vitro. We performed functional assays using pseudo-typed particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed no significant differences between Wuhan-Hu1, Wuhan-Hu1 P681H or B.1.1.7 spike-carrying pseudo-typed particles in VeroE6 or Vero-TMPRSS2 cells, despite the spikes containing P681H being more efficiently cleaved. Likewise, we or show no differences in cell-cell fusion assays using the spike P681H-expressing cells. Our findings suggest that while the introduction of P681H in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant may increase spike cleavage by furin-like proteases, this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.

METHODS: Here, we use systematic review to develop a comprehensive dataset of respiratory viral loads (rVLs) of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. We then comparatively meta-analyze the data and model individual infectiousness by shedding viable virus via respiratory droplets and aerosols. RESULTS: The analyses indicate heterogeneity in rVL as an intrinsic virological factor facilitating greater overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 pandemic than A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 influenza pandemic. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period, including for pediatric and asymptomatic infections. Hence, many COVID-19 cases inherently present minimal transmission risk, whereas highly infectious individuals shed tens to thousands of SARS-CoV-2 virions/min via droplets and aerosols while breathing, talking and singing. Coughing increases the contagiousness, especially in close contact, of symptomatic cases relative to asymptomatic ones. Infectiousness tends to be elevated between 1 and 5 days post-symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic case variation in rVL facilitates overdispersion in the transmissibility of emerging respiratory viruses.

Here we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that spike (S) protein potently induces inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2, but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages. No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane (M), envelope (E), and neucleocapsid (N) proteins. When stimulated with extracellular S protein, human lung epithelial cells A549 also produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly are non-inflammatory, but elicit an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured. Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-κB pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner. Further, such an activation of the NF-κB pathway is abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages. Consistently, administration of S protein induces IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in wild-type, but not Tlr2-deficient mice. Together these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Khan, Shahanshah; Shafiei, Mahnoush S.; Longoria, Christopher; Schoggins, John; Savani, Rashmin C.; Zaki, Hasan",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758854/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.16.435700,109

Here, we investigated the effects of CTSL on SIgA responses and invariant chain (Ii) degradations in the co-cultured swine dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells system in vitro. When the cells system were transfected with vector CTSL-GFP or incubated with recombinant CTSL (rCTSL) before they were infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hp), SIgA significantly increased and Ii chain was degraded into smaller intermediates, while SIgA decreased when CTSL was knockdown or inhibited with E64. To confirm the SIgA responses promoted by CTSL contribute to the resistance to mycoplasma pneumonia, pigs injected with rCTSL before they were challenged with M.hp, showed milder clinical symptoms and histopathological damage of lungs, less mycoplasma burden together with higher secretion of SIgA, percentages of CD4(+) T cells and level of MHC II molecules comparing with the group without rCTSL. Collectively, these results suggested that rCTSL could provide effective protection for piglets against mycoplasma pneumonia by enhancing M.hp-specific mucosal immune responses through its role in antigen presentation by processing the invariant chain.","Zhang, Ning; Gao, Peng; Yin, Bao; Li, Jiahe; Wu, Tong; Kuang, Yu; Wu, Wenxue; Li, Jinxiang",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986254/,109

650888,#27: Comparison of RT-PCR Cycle Threshold Values from Respiratory Specimens in Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Children with SARS CoV-2 Infection,2021-06-28,"Emission benefits of transit buses depend on ridership. Declines in ridership caused by COVID-19 leads uncertainty about the emission reduction capacity of buses. This paper provides a method framework for analyzing spatio-temporal emission patterns of buses in combination with real-time ridership and potential emission changes in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on GPS trajectory and Smart Card data of 2056 buses from 278 routes covering 1.5 million ridership in Qingdao, China, spatio-temporal emissions characteristics of buses are studied. 7589 taxis with 0.2 million passengers’ trips are used for acquiring private cars’ emissions to evaluate the emissions difference between buses and cars. Empirical results show that the average difference between buses and cars with 2 persons can reach up to 117 g/km-person during 7:00–8:59 and 115 g/km-person during 17:00–18:59. However, buses have various emission benefits around the city at different periods. A double increase in emissions during non-rush hours can be observed compared with rush hours. 224 online survey data are used to study the potential ridership reduction trend in post-COVID-19. Results show that 56.3% of respondents would decrease the usage of buses in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on this figure, our analysis shows that per kilometer-person emissions of buses are higher than cars during non-rush hours, however, still lower than cars during rush hours. We conclude that when ridership reduces by more than 40%, buses cannot be “greener” travel modal than cars as before. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for this potential challenge. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the emission patterns of buses, to support better buses investment decisions and promotion on eco-friendly public transport service in the post-COVID-19 future.","Sui, Yi; Zhang, Haoran; Shang, Wenlong; Sun, Rencheng; Wang, Changying; Ji, Jun; Song, Xuan; Shao, Fengjing",Appl Energy,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261920314185; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052166/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261920314185,109
651267,Encephalopathy as neurological involvement of SARS-COV-2 infection,2020-06-26,"Tens of millions of individuals go to gasoline stations on a daily basis in the United States. One of the constituents of gasoline is benzene, a Group 1 carcinogen that has been strongly linked to both occupational and non-occupational leukemias. While benzene content in gasoline is federally regulated, there is approximately a thirty-year data gap in United States research on benzene exposures from pumping gasoline. Using a novel self-sampling protocol with whole air canisters, we conducted a gasoline pumping exposure assessment for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) on Baltimore, MD consumers. Geometric mean exposures (geometric standard deviations) were 3.2 (2.7) ppb,9.5 (3.5) ppb, 2.0 (2.8) ppb, and 7.3 (3.0) ppb, respectively, on 32 samples. Using the benzene exposures, we conducted consumer and occupational probabilistic risk assessments and contextualized the risk with ambient benzene exposure risk. We found that the consumer scenarios did not approach the 1:1,000,000 excess risk management threshold and that the occupational scenario did not exceed the 1:10,000 excess risk management threshold. Further, in all Monte Carlo trials, the ambient risk from benzene exposure exceeded that of pumping risk for consumers, but that in approximately 30% of occupational trials, the pumping risk exceeded the ambient risk.","Patton, Andrew N.; Levy-Zamora, Misti; Fox, Mary; Koehler, Kirsten",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671888/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041872,109

METHODS: A cross‐sectional study was conducted between 18 and 31 March 2020. COVID‐19 suspected cases admitted to pandemic policlinic who had nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested for both SARS‐CoV‐2 and other respiratory viral pathogens were included. RESULTS: Within 112 patients SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in 34 (30%). Among the non‐SARS‐CoV‐2 viruses (n=25, 22%), metapneumovirus (n=10), was the most frequent agent. There were two co‐infections with SARS‐CoV‐2. Sputum was less in the SARS‐CoV‐2 group (p=0.003). The leukocyte, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte count and C‐reactive protein levels were lowest in the SARS‐CoV‐2 group (p<0.001, p=0.04, p<0.001, p=0.007 respectively). Peripheral involvement (80% vs. 20%, p=<0.001), pure ground‐glass opacity (65% vs. 33%, p=0.04), apicobasal gradient (60% vs. 40%, p=0.08), involvement of ≥3 lobes (80% vs. 40%, OR:6.0, 95%CI,1.33‐27.05, p=0.02) and consolidation with accompanying ground‐glass opacity (4% vs. 33%, p=0.031) were more common in SARS‐CoV‐2 group. CONCLUSION: Some clinical, laboratory and radiological findings may help in the differential diagnosis of non‐SARS‐CoV‐2 viruses from COVID‐19. However, co‐infections may occur, and a non‐SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogen positivity does not exclude accompanying COVID‐19. This article is protected by copyright.

A common feature of most – if not all – families of human and non-human viruses concerns their interaction with the nucleolus. The nucleolus is a multifunctional nuclear domain, which, in addition to its well-known role in ribosome biogenesis, plays several crucial other functions. Viral infection induces important nucleolar alterations. Indeed, during viral infection numerous viral components localize in nucleoli, while various host nucleolar proteins are redistributed in other cell compartments or are modified, and non-nucleolar cellular proteins reach the nucleolus. This review highlights the interactions reported between the nucleolus and some human or animal viral families able to establish a latent or productive infection, selected on the basis of their known interactions with the nucleolus and the nucleolar activities, and their links with virus replication and/or pathogenesis.

653237,The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Hesitancy Among the General Population: A Large Cross-Sectional Study From Kuwait,2021-07-08,"Cytolytic T-cells play an essential role in the adaptive immune system by seeking out, binding and killing cells that present foreign antigens on their surface. An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface.","Li, Guangyuan; Iyer, Balaji; Prasath, V B Surya; Ni, Yizhao; Salomonis, Nathan",Brief Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009266/,109

Identification of the virus receptors is still challenging at present. Our previous study has shown that human virus receptor proteins have some unique features including high N-glycosylation level, high number of interaction partners and high expression level. Here, a random-forest model was built to identify human virus receptorome from human cell membrane proteins with an accepted accuracy based on the combination of the unique features of human virus receptors and protein sequences. A total of 1424 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome of the human-infecting virome. In addition, the combination of the random-forest model with protein–protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies enabled further prediction of the receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses, such as the enterovirus, norovirus and West Nile virus. Finally, the candidate alternative receptors of the SARS-CoV-2 were also predicted in this study. As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to predict the receptorome for the human-infecting virome and would greatly facilitate the identification of the receptors for viruses.

The inflammatory underpinnings of MIS-C have not been examined in detail. METHODS: We examined the plasma levels of acute phase proteins and microbial translocation markers in children with MIS-C, children with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, SARS-CoV-2-seropositive children, and controls. RESULTS: MIS-C children exhibited significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha2 macroglobulin (α2M), serum amyloid P (SAP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), sCD14, and LPS binding protein (LBP) and significantly lower levels of haptoglobin (Hp) in comparison with seropositive, control, and/or COVID-19 children. In addition, COVID-19 children exhibited significantly higher levels of most of the above markers in comparison with seropositive and control children. Principal component analysis using a set of these markers could clearly discriminate MIS-C and COVID-19 from seropositive and control children. MIS-C children requiring pediatric intensive care unit admission and COVID-19 children with severe disease had higher levels of CRP, SAP, and/or sCD14 at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the role of systemic inflammation and microbial translocation markers in children with MIS-C and COVID-19 and therefore helps in advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis of different presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children.","Kumar, Nathella Pavan; Venkataraman, Aishwarya; Hanna, Luke Elizabeth; Putlibai, Sulochana; Karthick, M; Rajamanikam, Anuradha; Sadasivam, Kalaimaran; Sundaram, Balasubramanian; Babu, Subash",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322566/,109

However, limited data exist on the risk factors for childhood asthma phenotypes. Objective We sought to identify risk factors at the first severe wheezing episode for current asthma 7 years later and separately for atopic and nonatopic asthma. Methods One hundred twenty-seven steroid-naive children with the first severe wheezing episode (90% hospitalized/10% emergency department treated) were followed for 7 years. The primary outcome was current asthma at age 8 years, which was also analyzed separately as atopic and nonatopic asthma. Risk factors, including sensitization, viral cause, and other main asthma risk factors, were analyzed. Results At study entry, median age was 11 months (interquartile range, 6-16 months); 17% were sensitized, and 98% were virus positive. Current asthma (n = 37) at 8 years was divided into atopic (n = 19) and nonatopic (n = 18) asthma. The risk factors for current atopic asthma at study entry were sensitization (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 12; P < .001), eczema (adjusted OR, 4.8; P = .014), and wheezing with rhinovirus (adjusted OR, 5.0; P = .035). The risk factors for nonatopic asthma were the first severe respiratory syncytial virus/rhinovirus–negative wheezing episode (adjusted OR, 8.0; P = .001), first wheezing episode at age less than 12 months (adjusted OR, 7.3; P = .007), and parental smoking (adjusted OR, 3.8; P = .028). Conclusions The data suggest diverse asthma phenotypes and mechanisms that can be predicted by using simple clinical markers at the time of the first severe wheezing episode.

Virtual appointments can provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional office appointments for managing chronic conditions. Advances in information technology infrastructure, communication, and connected medical devices are enabling providers to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients remotely. In this study, we build a capacity allocation model to study the use of virtual appointments in a chronic care setting. We consider a cohort of patients receiving chronic care and model the flow of the patients between office and virtual appointments using an open migration network. We formulate the planning of capacity needed for office and virtual appointments with a newsvendor model to maximize long-run average earnings. We consider differences in treatment and diagnosis effectiveness for office and virtual appointments. We derive optimal capacity allocation policies and implement numerical experiments.

The objective of this study was to analyze the immunological and pathological responses after infection with the European subtype 3 strain Lena in comparison to subtype 1 strains Belgium A and Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV). Sixteen pigs were inoculated per strain, and sixteen pigs with PBS. At days 7 and 21 post-inoculation (p.i.), four pigs per group were immunized with an Aujeszky disease vaccine (ADV) to study the immune competence after PRRSV infection. Infection with the Lena strain resulted in fever and clinical signs. This was not observed in the Belgium A or LV-infected pigs. Infection with the Lena strain resulted in high virus titers in serum, low numbers of IFN-γ secreting cells, a change in leukocyte populations and a delayed antibody response to immunization with ADV. Levels of IL-1β, IFN-α, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ mRNA of the Lena-infected pigs were increased during the first week of infection. For pigs infected with the Belgium A or LV strain, the effects of infection on these parameters were less pronounced, although for the Belgium A-infected pigs, the level of the analyzed cytokines, except for TNF-α, and leukocyte populations were comparable to the Lena-infected pigs. These results suggest that while the outcome of infection for the three strains was comparable, with mostly clearance of viremia at day 33 p.i, differences in immune responses were observed, perhaps contributing to their virulence.","Weesendorp, Eefke; Morgan, Sophie; Stockhofe-Zurwieden, Norbert; Graaf, Ditta J.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted in the hub COVID-19 center in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020. All patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit on invasive mechanical ventilation and treated with prone positioning were included. Association between prone-related pressure ulcers and selected variables was explored by the means of logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 219 proning cycles were performed on 63 patients, aged 57.6 (10.8) and predominantly obese males (66.7%). The main complications recorded were: prone-related pressure ulcers (30.2%), bleeding (25.4%) and medical device displacement (12.7%), even if none unplanned extubation was recorded. Bleeding of upper airways represented the most common site (17.5%). Only 15 prone positioning cycles (6.8%) were interrupted, requiring staff to roll the patient back in the supine position. The likelihood of pressure ulcers development was independently associated with the duration of prone positioning, once adjusting for age, hypoxemic level, and nutritional status (OR 1.9, 95%CI 1.04 to 3.6). CONCLUSION: The use of prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 was a safe and feasible treatment, also in obese patients, who might deserve more surveillance and active prevention by intensive care unit staff.","Binda, Filippo; Galazzi, Alessandro; Marelli, Federica; Gambazza, Simone; Villa, Lucia; Vinci, Elisa; Adamini, Ileana; Laquintana, Dario",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096433972100077X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34244027/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096433972100077X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2021.103088,109

A total of 162 fecal samples were cultivated for E. coli. Samples were also subcultivated to detect E. coli with extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion using a panel of 16 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 to mcr-5. Samples from 20 (12.4%) of the camels contained antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli, and 85% of the AMR isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The highest frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Two (1.2%) of the isolates showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin, and 86.4% of the isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study. The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL producing E. coli was 0.6%. PCR and amplicon sequencing showed that the ESBL producer belonged to E. coli phylogenetic group A, sequence type (ST) 48, and harbored bla CTX-M-15. None of the isolates contained mcr genes. The results indicate that dromedary camels in Kenya may be reservoirs of AMR E. coli, including ESBL producers, that could potentially be transmitted to humans by direct contact or via the food chain.","Nüesch-Inderbinen, Magdalena; Kindle, Patrick; Baschera, Melinda; Liljander, Anne; Jores, Jörg; Corman, Victor Max; Stephan, Roger",Scientific African,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227620300120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468227620300120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171008/,109

As societies were isolated to control viral spread, access to facilities became limited. Remote sample collection with a volumetric microsampling approach, using Mitra(®) devices based on VAMS(®) technology, proved to be highly effective. It allowed people to collect high-quality samples at home and post them to a laboratory. This enabled scientists to conduct large serosurveillance studies, with results showing that seroprevalence of COVID-19 was higher than initially expected. Furthermore, remote microsampling studies by several institutions were conducted to measure the relationship between antigen levels and antibody response and duration. VAMS technology was also used in COVID-19 clinical trials. In summary, the independent research reviewed in this paper proved that VAMS is an effective sample collection alternative.","Rudge, James; Kushon, Stuart",Bioanal.

Although much has been learned from these studies, an understanding of the complex interactions between human viruses and the human intestinal epithelium was initially limited by the lack of nontransformed culture systems, which recapitulate the relevant heterogenous cell types that comprise the intestinal villus epithelium. New investigations using multicellular, physiologically active, organotypic cultures produced from intestinal stem cells isolated from biopsies or surgical specimens provide an exciting new avenue for understanding human specific pathogens and revealing previously unknown host–microbe interactions that affect replication and outcomes of human infections.

662383,Role of Multisector Partnerships in Controlling Emerging Zoonotic Diseases,2005-12-11,"BACKGROUND: After experiencing a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic, South Korea rapidly controlled transmission while implementing less stringent national social distancing measures than countries in Europe and the USA. This has led to substantial interest in their “test, trace, isolate” strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea’s outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, R(t), using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, R(t) dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64–2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, R(t) was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent “lockdown” measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea’s successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.","Dighe, Amy; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Skarp, Janetta; Imai, Natsuko; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Gaythorpe, Katy A.

However, attempts to fit real-world observations need more sophisticated structures (e.g., multilayer networks), rules (e.g., Achlioptas processes), and projections onto geometric, social, or geographic spaces. The p-adic number system offers a natural representation of hierarchical organization of complex networks. The p-adic random graph interprets n as the cardinality of a set of p-adic numbers. Constructing a vast space of hierarchical structures is equivalent for combining number sequences. Although the giant component is vital in dynamic evolution of networks, the structure of multiple big components is also essential. Fitting the sizes of the few largest components to empirical data was rarely demonstrated. The p-adic ultrametric enables the ER model to simulate multiple big components from the observations of genetic interaction networks, social networks, and epidemics. Community structures lead to multimodal distributions of the big component sizes in networks, which have important implications in intervention of spreading processes.","Hua, Hao; Hovestadt, Ludger",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33420128/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79507-4,109

This study had as objectives characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil from Piper caldense (EOPC), evaluate its potential antimicrobial activity, and investigate the synergistic effect with Norfloxacin against multidrug-resistant S. aureus overproducing efflux pumps, as well as, verify the EOPC ability to inhibit the Candida albicans filamentation. EOPC was extracted by hydrodistillation, and the chemical constituents were identified by gas chromatography, allowing the identification of 24 compounds (91.9%) classified as hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (49.6%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (39.5%). Antimicrobial tests were performed using a 96-well plate microdilution method against C. albicans ATCC 10231, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 standard strains, as well as against multidrug-resistant strains S. aureus SA1199B (overexpressing norA gene), S. aureus K2068 (overexpressing mepA gene) and S. aureus K4100 (overexpressing qacC gene). The oil showed activity against C. albicans ATCC 10231 (≥ 512 µg/mL) and was able to inhibit hyphae formation, an important mechanism of virulence of C. albicans. On the other hand, EOPC was inactive against all bacterial strains tested (≤ 1,024 µg mL). However, when combined with Norfloxacin at subinhibitory concentration EOPC reduced the Norfloxacin and Ethidium bromide MIC values against S. aureus strains SA1199B, K2068 and K4100.

This in turn could reverse all the progress achieved over the years in reducing maternal and child mortality. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the indirect effect of the pandemic on maternal and child health services in public health facilities. METHODS: Data pertaining to maternal and child health services being provided under specific Government programmes, were collected from public health facilities of District Sant Kabir Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, India. Comparative analysis of the data from the pandemic phase with data from the year 2019 was done to determine the impact on services. RESULTS: Reduced coverage across all maternal and child health interventions was observed in the study. There was an overall decrease of 2.26 % in number of institutional deliveries. Antenatal care services were the worst affected with 22.91% decline. Immunization services were also dramatically decreased by more than 20%. CONCLUSION: The response of the public healthcare delivery system to the Covid-19 Pandemic is negatively affecting both the provision and utilization of maternal and child healthcare services. It is deterrent to the progress achieved in maternal and child health parameters over the years.

A decision tree is popular due to its simplicity and straightforward visualization capability for all types of datasets. Decision tree forest is an ensemble of decision trees. The prediction accuracy of the decision tree forest is more than a decision tree algorithm. Constant efforts are going on to create accurate and diverse trees in the decision tree forest. In this paper, we propose Tangent Weighted Decision Tree Forest (TWDForest), which is more accurate and diverse than random forest. The strength of this technique is that it uses a more accurate and uniform tangent weighting function to create a weighted decision tree forest. It also improves performance by taking opinions from previous trees to best fit the successor tree and avoids the toggling of the root node. Due to this novel approach, the decision trees from the forest are more accurate and diverse as compared to other decision forest algorithms. Experiments of this novel method are performed on 15 well known, publicly available UCI machine learning repository datasets of various sizes. The results of the TWDForest method demonstrate that the entire forest and decision trees produced in TWDForest have high prediction accuracy of 1–7% more than existing methods.

To date, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread to over 200 countries, leading to over 1.6 million cases and over 99,000 deaths. Given that there is neither a vaccine nor proven treatment for COVID-19, there is currently an urgent need for effective pharmacotherapy. To address the need for an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the worldwide pandemic, this systematic review of intravenous (IV) remdesivir was performed. Remdesivir, an anti-viral prodrug originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease, has shown broad spectrum activity against the Coronavirus family. A recent case report reported improvement of clinical symptoms with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19. After conducting a systematic search of 18 clinical trial registries and three large scientific databases, we identified 86 potentially eligible items. Following removal of duplicates (n = 21), eligible studies were reviewed independently by two authors. After the first round of screening, inter-rater agreement was 98.5% (κ = 0.925). After the second round of full-text screening, inter-rater agreement was 100%. A total of seven ongoing and recruiting clinical trials of remdesivir (100–200 milligrams, intravenous [IV]) were included. We identified the following primary outcomes: patients discharged (n = 2); time to clinical status improvement (n = 2); improved O2 saturation (n = 2); body temperature normalization (n = 2); and clinical status (n = 1). Secondary outcomes in all identified studies included documentation of adverse events. Phase 3 trials are expected to be completed between April 2020–2023.

We aimed to determine whether NPIs led to the decline in the incidences of respiratory infections. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, ecological study using a nationwide notifiable diseases database and a respiratory virus sample surveillance collected from January 2016 through July 2020 in the Republic of Korea. Intervention period was defined as February–July 2020, when the government implemented NPIs nationwide. Observed incidences in the intervention period were compared to the predicted incidences by autoregressive integrated moving average model and the 4-year mean cumulative incidences (CuIs) in the same months of the pre-intervention period. RESULTS: Five infectious diseases met the inclusion criteria: chickenpox, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease, scarlet fever, and pertussis. The incidences of chickenpox and mumps during the intervention period were significantly lower than the prediction model. The CuIs of chickenpox and mumps were 36.4% (95% CI, 23.9–76.3) and 63.4% (95% CI, 48.0–93.3) of the predicted values. Subgroup analysis showed that the decrease in the incidence was universal for chickenpox, while mumps showed a marginal reduction among those aged <18 years, but not in adults. The incidence of respiratory viruses was significantly lower than both the predicted incidence (19.5%; 95% CI, 11.8–55.4%) and the 4-year mean CuIs in the pre-intervention period (24.5%; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of NPIs was associated with a significant reduction in the incidences of several respiratory infections in Korea.","Huh, Kyungmin; Jung, Jaehun; Hong, Jinwook; Kim, MinYoung; Ahn, Jong Gyun; Kim, Jong-Hun; Kang, Ji-Man",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150393/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1682,109

As the scientific community navigates through the overwhelming avalanche of information on the multiple health impacts caused by the pandemic, new reports start to emerge on significant ancillary effects associated with the treatment of the virus. Besides the evident health impacts, other emerging impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as water-related impacts, merits in-depth investigation. This includes strategies for the identification of these impacts and technologies to mitigate them, and to prevent further impacts not only in water ecosystems, but also in relation to human health. This paper has critically reviewed currently available knowledge on the most significant potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wastewater pathway into surface water, as well as technologies that may serve to counteract the major threats posed, key perspectives and challenges. Additionally, current knowledge gaps and potential directions for further research and development are identified. While the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing and rapidly evolving situation, compiling current knowledge of potential links between wastewater and surface water pathways as related to environmental impacts and relevant associated technologies, as presented in this review, is a critical step to guide future research in this area.","Bandala, Erick R.; Kruger, Brittany R.; Cesarino, Ivana; Leao, Alcides L.; Wijesiri, Buddhi; Goonetilleke, Ashantha",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721006549?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145586; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721006549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33607440/,109

Tissue and faecal samples collected post mortem from cats diagnosed with or without FIP were subjected to RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect FCoV RNA. In cats with FIP, 95% of tissue, and 81% of faecal samples were PCR-positive, as opposed to 22% of tissue, and 60% of faecal samples in cats without FIP. Relative FCoV copy numbers were significantly higher in the cats with FIP, both in tissues (P < 0.001) and faeces (P = 0.02). PCR-positive samples underwent pyrosequencing encompassing position 1058 of the FCoV spike protein. This identified a methionine codon at position 1058, consistent with the shedding of an enteric form of FCoV, in 77% of the faecal samples from cats with FIP, and in 100% of the samples from cats without FIP. In contrast, 91% of the tissue samples from cats with FIP and 89% from cats without FIP had a leucine codon at position 1058, consistent with a systemic form of FCoV. These results suggest that the methionine to leucine substitution at position 1058 in the FCoV spike protein is indicative of systemic spread of FCoV from the intestine, rather than a virus with the potential to cause FIP.","Porter, Emily; Tasker, Séverine; Day, Michael J; Harley, Ross; Kipar, Anja; Siddell, Stuart G; Helps, Christopher R",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767677/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-45-49,109

This study explored how dietary fat intake was impacted in a sample of the UK public who were social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected from a UK COVID-19 online survey. Fat intake was measured using the Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education questionnaire. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using Becks’ Anxiety and Depression Inventories, while the short-form Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale assessed mental well-being. Differences between individuals who increased versus decreased fat intake were explored using chi-square or independent sample t-tests. Association between fat intake and mental health was explored using adjusted linear regression models. RESULTS: Eight hundred and eighty-seven adults were included. Approximately, 34% recorded medium-to-high levels of fat consumption during social distancing. Around 48% reported decreased fat intake during social distancing compared to usual levels, while 41.3% documented increased fat intake. Fat intake was not significantly associated (P > 0.05) with any measures of mental health. CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of a sample of UK adults social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic recorded decreased fat intake when compared to levels prior to social distancing. There appeared to be no associations between fat intake and mental health.","Wilson, Jason J; McMullan, Ilona; Blackburn, Nicole E; Klempel, Natalie; Yakkundi, Anita; Armstrong, Nicola C; Brolly, Colette; Butler, Laurie T; Barnett, Yvonne; Jacob, Louis; Koyanagi, Ai; Smith, Lee; Tully, Mark A",J Public Health (Oxf),https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667296/,109

A population-based study in coastal Ecuador,2020-07-27,"The rapid rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine global raises the question of whether and when the ongoing pandemic could be eliminated with vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Despite advances in the impact of NPIs and the conceptual belief that NPIs and vaccination control COVID-19 infections, we lack evidence to employ control theory in real-world social human dynamics in the context of disease spreading. We bridge the gap by developing a new analytical framework that treats COVID-19 as a feedback control system with the NPIs and vaccination as the controllers and a computational and mathematical model that maps human social behaviors to input signals. This approach enables us to effectively predict the epidemic spreading in 381 Metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US by learning our model parameters utilizing the time series NPIs (i.e., the stay-at-home order, face-mask wearing, and testing) data. This model allows us to optimally identify three NPIs to predict infections actually in 381 MSAs and avoid overfitting. Our numerical results universally demonstrate our approach's excellent predictive power with R2>0.9 of all the MSAs regardless of their sizes, locations, and demographic status. Our methodology allows us to estimate the needed vaccine coverage and NPIs for achieving Re to the manageable level and the required days for disease elimination at each location. Our analytical results provide insights into the debates on the aims for eliminating COVID-19. NPIs, if tailored to the MSAs, can drive the pandemic to an easily containable level and suppress future recurrences of epidemic cycles.","ZHONG, L.; Diagne, M.; Wang, Q.; Gao, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.18.21257362v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257362,109
672013,"Risk factors for outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infection at retirement homes in Ontario, Canada: a population-level cohort study",2021-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic. METHODS: The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Santé study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: Between April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4·8% (95% CI 2·4–8·0, n=341). The estimate increased to 8·5% (5·9–11·4, n=469) in the second week, to 10·9% (7·9–14·4, n=577) in the third week, 6·6% (4·3–9·4, n=604) in the fourth week, and 10·8% (8·2–13·9, n=775) in the fifth week. Individuals aged 5–9 years (relative risk [RR] 0·32 [95% CI 0·11–0·63]) and those older than 65 years (RR 0·50 [0·28–0·78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20–49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11·6 infections in the community. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over <2·5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5–9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10–64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

Los últimos fueron los coronavirus en la década de los años sesenta. No hubo más descubrimientos hasta 2001 con el metapneumovirus humano asociado a brotes de bronquiolitis en niños. Un año después, en noviembre de 2002, apareció el síndrome respiratorio agudo grave (SRAG) definido como una neumonía atípica, al que se asoció un nuevo virus como agente etiológico perteneciente a la familia de los coronavirus. En 2004 se descubrió otro coronavirus (CoV-NL63) y en 2005 se ha publicado el descubrimiento de un tercer coronavirus humano (CoV-HKU1). Además, varios subtipos del virus de la gripe A, que hasta ahora se pensaba que eran patógenos exclusivos de aves, se han transmitido directamente al ser humano. Si la infección respiratoria ha sido importante para el ser humano desde hace siglos, el conocimiento de nuevos virus asociados a ella se presenta en el siglo XXI como un importante campo de trabajo. Beginning in the 1950s respiratory viruses have been gradually discovered by isolation in cell cultures The last were the coronaviruses in the 1960s. No new respiratory viruses were discovered until 2001 when human metapneumovirus was found in respiratory specimens from children with bronchiolitis. A year later, in November 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suddenly appeared as atypical pneumonia. A novel virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family was found to be a cause of this infection. In 2004, a second coronavirus was discovered (CoV-NL63) and in 2005 a third new coronavirus was described (CoV-HKU1). In addition, several subtypes of the influenza A virus, previously known to infect only poultry and wild birds, were recently found to have been directly transmitted to humans. Respiratory infection has been a considerable problem for humans for centuries.

However, allowing local land use decisions to proceed as usual represents a major gap in the state’s climate policy framework. Climate mitigation rules and formulae are utilized to claim zero net emissions for large-scale land development at the urban fringe. Such developments continue to destroy habitats and radically transform landscapes. Newhall Ranch, a subdevelopment at the edge of urbanized Los Angeles County, has claimed emissions offsets such that the development of 60,000 homes will have less than zero greenhouse gas emissions. Offsets largely rely on using disadvantaged communities, and significant threats to endangered species on site are compensated by payments to the project's environmental opponents. The net result is land development as usual, with a veneer of solarization and investments in GHG mitigation projects with poor quantification and verification. This situation demonstrates the enduring structures of land use development that drive GHG emissions and environmental change, and calls for stronger requirements for local compliance with state emissions-reductions targets.","Pincetl, Stephanie; Kennedy, Sean",GeoJournal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-021-10458-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334883/,109

This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission. FINDINGS: From March 18, to April 26, 2020, we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52%) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28%) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 9·42 [95% CI 6·56–10·02]; p<0·0001), being male (1·67 [1·19–2·34]; p=0·003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (1·95 [1·36–2·80]; p<0·001) and cardiovascular disease (2·32 [1·47–3·64]). 281 (35%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (1·18 [0·81–1·72]; p=0·380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) penetrates respiratory epithelium through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding, the association between RASi and poorer outcomes has been questioned. Purpose This study aimed to provide insight on the impact of RASi on SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in a population of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of consecutively hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive rtPCR) admitted to the University Hospital of Strasbourg from the 25th Feb, 2020 to the 1st Apr, 2020. Patients hospitalized for less than 24h were excluded and the observation period ended at hospital discharge. Results During the study period, 943 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in our institution, of whom 772 were included in this analysis. Among them, 431 patients had previously known hypertension. The median age was 68 (56–79). The cohort was divided into two subgroups based on RASi treatment on admission: “RASi” (n =282) and “RASi-free” (n =490). Both groups had similar clinical presentations and equivalent recourse to endotracheal intubation, high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Overall, 220 patients were placed under mechanical ventilation of whom 30% died. Severe pneumonia (defined as either leading to death, and/or requiring intubation, HFNO, NIV and/or requiring an oxygen rate flow ≥5l/min) and death occurred more frequently in RASi treated patients (63% vs. 53% and respectively 27.3% versus 18.2%). In a multivariate logistic-regression model, neither severe pneumonia nor death were associated with RASi treatment.

By protein chip array profiling technology, a number of serum biomarkers that might be useful in monitoring the clinical course of SARS patients were identified. This book chapter describes how the protein chip array profiling was carried out for this study. Briefly, SARS patients’ serum samples were first fractionated in Q Ceramic HyperD ion exchange sorbent beads by buffers at different pH. Serum protein fractions thus obtained were then bound onto a copper (II) immobilized metal affinity capture (IMAC30 Cu [II]) ProteinChip® Array or a weak cation-exchange (CM10) ProteinChip Array. After washing and addition of sinapinic acid, the chips were read in a Protein Biological System (PBS) IIc mass spectrometer. Ions were generated by laser shots and flied in a time of flight mode to the ion detector according to their mass over charge (m/z) ratio. The serum profiling spectra in SARS patients were acquired, baseline subtracted and analyzed in parallel with those from the control subjects by Ciphergen ProteinChip Software 3.0.2 with their peak intensities compared by a nonparametric two sample Mann-Whitney-U test. More than twelve peaks were differentially expressed in SARS patients with one at m/z of 11,695 (later identified to be serum amyloid A protein), which had increase in peak intensity correlating with the extent of SARS-coronavirus induced pneumonia as defined by a serial chest X-ray opacity score. The remaining biomarkers could also be useful in the study of other clinical parameters in SARS patients.","Yip, Timothy T. C.; Cho, William C. S.; Cheng, Wai Wai; Chan, Johnny W. M.; Ma, Victor W.

Recently, large-scale structure probing (SP) studies have enabled assessment of global structure-function relationships via standard data summarizations or local folding. Here, we approach structure quantification from a hairpin-centric perspective where putative hairpins are identified in SP datasets and used as a means to capture local structural effects. This has the advantage of rapid processing of big (e.g. transcriptome-wide) data as RNA folding is circumvented, yet it captures more information than simple data summarizations. We reformulate a statistical learning algorithm we previously developed to significantly improve precision of hairpin detection, then introduce a novel nucleotide-wise measure, termed the hairpin-derived structure level (HDSL), which captures local structuredness by accounting for the presence of likely hairpin elements. Applying HDSL to data from recent studies recapitulates, strengthens and expands on their findings which were obtained by more comprehensive folding algorithms, yet our analyses are orders of magnitude faster. These results demonstrate that hairpin detection is a promising avenue for global and rapid structure-function analysis, furthering our understanding of RNA biology and the principal features which drive biological insights from SP data.","Radecki, Pierce; Uppuluri, Rahul; Aviran, Sharon",NAR Genom Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqab073; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34447931/,109

Rather, to understand the virus and the pandemic we need to understand both as intimately connected to our own social and historical condition.

Prompted by the profound changes in retail supply and demand due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this study expands knowledge in two ways: uncovering new relationships and replicating some of the critical findings previously demonstrated in the pre-pandemic context. Two studies (Study 1 scenario and Study 2 actual shopping trip) show that higher levels of human crowding results in lower levels of shopping satisfaction, and this effect is mediated by a new construct introduced into the crowding literature, namely, customer rapport with employees, emerging as a significant factor in the pandemic era. Importantly, the results show that these relationships differ according to customers’: a) perceptions about the appropriateness of retailer precautions, b) beliefs about the severity of threat that the pandemic presents, and c) perceived vulnerability to Covid-19, all of them new to crowding dynamics during the time of Covid. Finally, with Study 2, we replicate and extend selected findings from prior research on crowding.

Combating the viral pandemics requires a coordinated effort to develop therapeutic protocols adaptable to the disease severity. In this review article, we summarize a graded approach aiming to shield cells from SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection, inhibit excess inflammation and evasion of the immune response, and ultimately prevent systemic organ failure. Moreover, we focus on mesenchymal stem cell therapy, which has shown safety and efficacy as a treatment of inflammatory and immune diseases. The cell therapy approach is now repurposed in patients with severe COVID-19. Numerous trials of mesenchymal stem cell therapy are ongoing, especially in China and the USA. Leader companies in cell therapy have also started controlled trials utilizing their quality assessed cell products.

The purpose of understanding the interactions between microbiota, virus, and host is to identify practical, effective, and safe approaches that target microbiota for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases in humans and animals, as currently there are few effective and reliable antiviral therapies available. The initial step for achieving this goal is to gather clinical evidences, focusing on the viral pathogens—from human and animal studies—that have already been shown to interact with microbiota. The subsequent step is to identify mechanisms, through experimental evidences, to support the development of translational applications that target microbiota. In this chapter, we review evidences of virus infections altering microbiota and of microbiota enhancing or suppressing infectivity, altering host susceptibility to certain viral diseases, and influencing vaccine immunogenicity in humans and farm animals.","Yuan, Lijuan; Hensley, Casey; Mahsoub, Hassan M.; Ramesh, Ashwin K.; Zhou, Peng",Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475521/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877117320300491; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877117320300491,109

Their functions include the control of inflammatory responses, the promotion of tolerance, cross-presentation, immune cell recruitment and the production of antiviral cytokines. Based primarily on the available literature that characterizes the behaviour of many DC subsets during Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we speculated possible mechanisms through which DC could contribute to COVID-19 immune responses, such as dissemination of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to lymph nodes, mounting dysfunctional inteferon responses and T cell immunity in patients. We highlighted gaps of knowledge in our understanding of DC in COVID-19 pathogenesis and discussed current pre-clinical development of therapies for COVID-19.","Alamri, Abdulaziz; Fisk, Derek; Upreti, Deepak; Kung, Sam K.

The aim of this study was to find out the radiograph rejection and its causes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics as there was fear of coronavirus disease infection among the technical staff from the incoming patients in a busy, high volume public sector tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This descriptive study was conducted at Radiology Department, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar from August to November, 2020. The rejected radiographs and their causes were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 15,000 X-ray procedures were conducted during study period out of which 2550 cases were repeated making the total rejection 17%. Rejection in male and female were 74.3 and 25.7%, respectively, while rejection in adults was (80.1%) and (19.9%) in pediatric age group of the total rejection. The main cause of rejection was positioning (30.5%) followed by artifacts (22.4%), motion (12.1%), improper collimation (10%), wrong labeling (8.4%), exposure errors (6.9%), detector errors (3.7%), machine faults (2.8%), re-request from referring physician (1.7%), and PACS issues (1.5%). In terms of body anatomical parts, the highest rejection was observed in extremities (44.1%), followed by chest radiography (23.3%), spine (11.4%), abdomen (6.4%), skull (5.9%), pelvis (4.7%), KUB (3.7%), and neck (0.6%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiograph rejection is common problem in every diagnostic facility but significant reduction can be achieved by implementing rejection analysis as basic quality indicator, and conducting technologist/s specific training programs for their knowledge and skill enhancement.","Ali, Amir; Yaseen, Muhammad",Chin J Acad Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42058-021-00070-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124580/,109

In addition to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS), B cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia are common toxicities predisposing these patients to infections. We analyzed 60 patients with DLBCL treated with FDA-approved CD19 CAR T cells and report the incidence, risk factors, and management of infections during the first year after treatment. A total of 101 infectious events were observed, including 25 mild, 51 moderate, 23 severe, 1 life-threatening, and 1 fatal infection. Bacteria were the most common causative pathogens. The cumulative incidence of overall, bacterial, severe bacterial, viral, and fungal infection at 1 year were 63.3%, 57.2%, 29.6%, 44.7%, and 4%, respectively. In multivariate analyses, the use of systemic corticosteroids for the management of CRS or ICANS was associated with an increased risk of infections and prolonged admission. Impaired performance status and history of infections within 30 days before CAR T cell therapy was a risk factor for severe bacterial infection. In conclusion, infections were common within the first 60 days after CAR T cell therapy, however, they were not associated with an increased risk of death.","Wudhikarn, Kitsada; Palomba, M.

During a very complex and confusing time, in which public health services in multiple countries have been completely overwhelmed, and in some cases even collapsed, these first-line household responses have been quintessential for building physical, mental, and social resilience, and for improving individual and community health. This editorial discusses the outcomes of a rapid-response preliminary survey during the first phase of the pandemic among social and community contacts in five metropolises heavily affected by the COVID-19 health crisis (Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York, and Rio de Janeiro), and in twelve rural areas or countries initially less affected by the pandemic (Appalachia, Jamaica, Bolivia, Romania, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Georgia, Turkey, Pakistan, Cambodia, and South Africa). We summarized our perspectives as 17 case studies, observing that people have relied primarily on teas and spices (“food-medicines”) and that there exist clear international plant favorites, popularized by various new media. Urban diasporas and rural households seem to have repurposed homemade plant-based remedies that they use in normal times for treating the flu and other respiratory symptoms or that they simply consider healthy foods. The most remarkable shift in many areas has been the increased consumption of ginger and garlic, followed by onion, turmeric, and lemon. Our preliminary inventory of food medicines serves as a baseline for future systematic ethnobotanical studies and aims to inspire in-depth research on how use patterns of plant-based foods and beverages, both “traditional” and “new”, are changing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our reflections in this editorial call attention to the importance of ethnobiology, ethnomedicine, and ethnogastronomy research into domestic health care strategies for improving community health.

In response to the first cases identified in the United States, close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases were investigated to enable early identification and isolation of additional cases and to learn more about risk factors for transmission. Close contacts of nine early travel-related cases in the United States were identified and monitored daily for development of symptoms (active monitoring). Selected close contacts (including those with exposures categorized as higher risk) were targeted for collection of additional exposure information and respiratory samples. Respiratory samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Four hundred four close contacts were actively monitored in the jurisdictions that managed the travel-related cases. Three hundred thirty-eight of the 404 close contacts provided at least basic exposure information, of whom 159 close contacts had ≥1 set of respiratory samples collected and tested. Across all actively monitored close contacts, two additional symptomatic COVID-19 cases (i.e., secondary cases) were identified; both secondary cases were in spouses of travel-associated case patients. When considering only household members, all of whom had ≥1 respiratory sample tested for SARS-CoV-2, the secondary attack rate (i.e., the number of secondary cases as a proportion of total close contacts) was 13% (95% CI: 4–38%). The results from these contact tracing investigations suggest that household members, especially significant others, of COVID-19 cases are at highest risk of becoming infected. The importance of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers is also underlined. Isolation of persons with COVID-19, in combination with quarantine of exposed close contacts and practice of everyday preventive behaviors, is important to mitigate spread of COVID-19.","Burke, Rachel M.; Balter, Sharon; Barnes, Emily; Barry, Vaughn; Bartlett, Karri; Beer, Karlyn D.; Benowitz, Isaac; Biggs, Holly M.; Bruce, Hollianne; Bryant-Genevier, Jonathan; Cates, Jordan; Chatham-Stephens, Kevin; Chea, Nora; Chiou, Howard; Christiansen, Demian; Chu, Victoria T.; Clark, Shauna; Cody, Sara H.; Cohen, Max; Conners, Erin E.; Dasari, Vishal; Dawson, Patrick; DeSalvo, Traci; Donahue, Matthew; Dratch, Alissa; Duca, Lindsey; Duchin, Jeffrey; Dyal, Jonathan W.; Feldstein, Leora R.; Fenstersheib, Marty; Fischer, Marc; Fisher, Rebecca; Foo, Chelsea; Freeman-Ponder, Brandi; Fry, Alicia M.; Gant, Jessica; Gautom, Romesh; Ghinai, Isaac; Gounder, Prabhu; Grigg, Cheri T.; Gunzenhauser, Jeffrey; Hall, Aron J.; Han, George S.; Haupt, Thomas; Holshue, Michelle; Hunter, Jennifer; Ibrahim, Mireille B.; Jacobs, Max W.; Jarashow, M.

In all, 90 participants were divided into the GAGLESS mouthpiece and conventional mouthpiece groups. The primary endpoint was the severity of pain using the visual analog scale (VAS), and secondary endpoints were examination time, past history of endoscopy, success of the procedure, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulse rate before and after EGD, and adverse events. Endoscopy was completed in all cases, and no complications were observed. VAS, when passing the scope through the pharynx, was 2.5 ± 2.4 and 2.0 ± 1.9 cm (p = 0.24) in the conventional and GAGLESS groups, respectively, and that, throughout the examination, was 2.5 ± 2.4 and 1.7 ± 1.5 cm (p = 0.06), respectively. The difference in blood pressure between the GAGLESS and conventional groups was not significant for SBP (p = 0.08) and significant for DBP (p = 0.03).

Yet, the success of the intervention is contingent on attitudes toward vaccination and the design of vaccination policies. Methods: We conduct cross-sectional analyses of policy-relevant attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination using survey data of a representative sample of Austrian residents collected by the Austrian Corona Panel Project (ACPP). As outcomes, we examine the individual readiness to get vaccinated, the support for compulsory vaccinations, and the preference for making the vaccine available free of charge. The independent variables include demographics, objective and perceived health risks, and social and political factors. Results: Although there is broad public support for making the vaccine available free of charge, vaccine hesitancy and the opposition to a vaccine mandate are widespread. The protective function of the vaccine for the individual only motivates limited support for vaccinations. Opposition to COVID-19 vaccination also stems from a lack of sense of community and an ongoing politicization of the issue through conspiracy theories and party politics. Conclusion: We propose that overcoming the inherent free-rider problem of achieving sufficiently high vaccination rates poses a potential dilemma for policymakers: Given the politicized nature of the issue, they may find themselves having to choose between making vaccinations compulsory at political costs and a lingering pandemic at high costs for public health and the economy. We propose that promoting a sense of community and addressing potential practical constraints will be key in designing an effective COVID-19 vaccination policy.","Paul, Katharina T.; Eberl, Jakob-Moritz; Partheymüller, Julia",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.671896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295869/,109

684246,SARS-CoV-2-Immune-Microbiome Interaction: Lessons from Respiratory Viral Infections,2021-02-18,"IMPORTANCE: Numerous prognostic models of suicide risk have been published, but few have been implemented outside of integrated managed care systems. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate performance of a suicide attempt risk prediction model implemented in a vendor-supplied electronic health record to predict subsequent (1) suicidal ideation and (2) suicide attempt. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study evaluated implementation of a suicide attempt prediction model in live clinical systems without alerting. The cohort comprised patients seen for any reason in adult inpatient, emergency department, and ambulatory surgery settings at an academic medical center in the mid-South from June 2019 to April 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary measures assessed external, prospective, and concurrent validity. Manual medical record validation of coded suicide attempts confirmed incident behaviors with intent to die. Subgroup analyses were performed based on demographic characteristics, relevant clinical context/setting, and presence or absence of universal screening. Performance was evaluated using discrimination (number needed to screen, C statistics, positive/negative predictive values) and calibration (Spiegelhalter z statistic). Recalibration was performed with logistic calibration. RESULTS: The system generated 115 905 predictions for 77 973 patients (42 490 [54%] men, 35 404 [45%] women, 60 586 [78%] White, 12 620 [16%] Black). Numbers needed to screen in highest risk quantiles were 23 and 271 for suicidal ideation and attempt, respectively. Performance was maintained across demographic subgroups. Numbers needed to screen for suicide attempt by sex were 256 for men and 323 for women; and by race: 373, 176, and 407 for White, Black, and non-White/non-Black patients, respectively. Model C statistics were, across the health system: 0.836 (95% CI, 0.836-0.837); adult hospital: 0.77 (95% CI, 0.77-0.772); emergency department: 0.778 (95% CI, 0.777-0.778); psychiatry inpatient settings: 0.634 (95% CI, 0.633-0.636). Predictions were initially miscalibrated (Spiegelhalter z = −3.1; P = .001) with improvement after recalibration (Spiegelhalter z = 1.1; P = .26). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, this real-time predictive model of suicide attempt risk showed reasonable numbers needed to screen in nonpsychiatric specialty settings in a large clinical system. Assuming that research-valid models will translate without performing this type of analysis risks inaccuracy in clinical practice, misclassification of risk, wasted effort, and missed opportunity to correct and prevent such problems. The next step is careful pairing with low-cost, low-harm preventive strategies in a pragmatic trial of effectiveness in preventing future suicidality.","Walsh, Colin G.; Johnson, Kevin B.; Ripperger, Michael; Sperry, Sarah; Harris, Joyce; Clark, Nathaniel; Fielstein, Elliot; Novak, Laurie; Robinson, Katelyn; Stead, William W.",JAMA Netw Open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710291/,109

Among them the whole economical sphere of human activity seems to be the most interrelated and complex. All financial markets, including the youngest one, the cryptocurrency market, belong to this sphere. The complexity of the cryptocurrency market can be studied from different perspectives. First, the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rates to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can be studied and quantified by means of multifractal formalism. Second, coupling and decoupling of the cryptocurrencies and the conventional assets can be investigated with the advanced cross-correlation analyses based on fractal analysis. Third, an internal structure of the cryptocurrency market can also be a subject of analysis that exploits, for example, a network representation of the market. In this work, we approach the subject from all three perspectives based on data from a recent time interval between January 2019 and June 2020. This period includes the peculiar time of the Covid-19 pandemic; therefore, we pay particular attention to this event and investigate how strong its impact on the structure and dynamics of the market was. Besides, the studied data covers a few other significant events like double bull and bear phases in 2019. We show that, throughout the considered interval, the exchange rate returns were multifractal with intermittent signatures of bifractality that can be associated with the most volatile periods of the market dynamics like a bull market onset in April 2019 and the Covid-19 outburst in March 2020. The topology of a minimal spanning tree representation of the market also used to alter during these events from a distributed type without any dominant node to a highly centralized type with a dominating hub of USDT.

687971,Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV2 Antibodies in Umbrian Persons Living with HIV,2020-11-01,"PURPOSE: To describe a case of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) in a patient immediately following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. OBSERVATIONS: The patient complained of paracentral scotoma supported by paracentral visual field loss on multiple Humphrey visual fields that corresponded to outer retinal pathology on optical coherence tomography. The patient's symptoms resolved without treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: We conclude that the clinical testing demonstrated findings consistent with AMN. AMN may be an exceedingly rare adverse ocular effect of a novel vaccine and likely only in the setting of multiple other risk factors. Despite this, we strongly recommend vaccination against COVID-19.","Valenzuela, Daniel A.; Groth, Sylvia; Taubenslag, Kenneth J.; Gangaputra, Sapna",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485760/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451993621002097; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451993621002097; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajoc.2021.101200,109
688848,Coincidental SARS-CoV-2 infection and mRNA vaccination: a case report addressing the most important clinical questions,2021-05-07,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of research fields is speeding up multiple digital revolutions, from shifting paradigms in healthcare, precision medicine and wearable sensing, to public services and education offered to the masses around the world, to future cities made optimally efficient by autonomous driving. When a revolution happens, the consequences are not obvious straight away, and to date, there is no uniformly adapted framework to guide AI research to ensure a sustainable societal transition. To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes.","Kusters, Remy; Misevic, Dusan; Berry, Hugues; Cully, Antoine; Le Cunff, Yann; Dandoy, Loic; Díaz-Rodríguez, Natalia; Ficher, Marion; Grizou, Jonathan; Othmani, Alice; Palpanas, Themis; Komorowski, Matthieu; Loiseau, Patrick; Moulin Frier, Clément; Nanini, Santino; Quercia, Daniele; Sebag, Michele; Soulié Fogelman, Françoise; Taleb, Sofiane; Tupikina, Liubov; Sahu, Vaibhav; Vie, Jill-Jênn; Wehbi, Fatima",Front Big Data,https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2020.577974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33693418/,109
689992,Decision-Making and Interventions During Interfacility Transport of High Acuity Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-04-05,"In the pathogenesis of the infectious process in the respiratory tract by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses, two stages can be distinguished: early (etiotropic) and late (pathogenetic) ones. In the first stage, when the virus multiplication and accumulation are prevalent under insufficient host immune response, the use of chemotherapeutic agents blocking the reproduction of the virus is reasonable to suppress the development of the disease. This article considers six major chemotherapeutic classes aimed at certain viral targets: inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase, inhibitors of viral protease Mpro, inhibitors of proteolytic activation of viral protein S allowing virus entry into the target cell, inhibitors of virus uncoating in cellular endosomes, compounds of exogenous interferons, and compounds of natural and recombinant virus-neutralizing antibodies. In the second stage, when the multiplication of the virus decreases and threatening pathological processes of excessive inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and secondary bacterial pneumonia and sepsis events develop, a pathogenetic therapeutic approach including extracorporeal blood oxygenation, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial therapy seems to be the most effective way for the patient’s recovery.","Zhirnov, O.
