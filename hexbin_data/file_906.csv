94830,"Technology, Social Engineering, and Clinical Anesthesiology: Present and Future.",2015,"Respiratory infections are a significant burden at any age, but especially in childhood and aging. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the issue since there is no specific treatment and vaccine is not available. Moreover, respiratory symptoms cause social stigma in subjects suffering from an infection of any kind. As new drugs require a very long time to be marketed, a natural compound's interest is growing. In this regard, lactoferrin is a multifunctional protein present in secretions, mainly in breast milk. Lactoferrin has marked antimicrobial activity, including antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic, and antifungal. Moreover, lactoferrin strongly affects immune response and cellular control activity. Therefore, this natural component could provide a promising effect in preventing respiratory infections and potentially also for COVID-19.","Passali, D; Damiani, V; Cianfrone, F; Passali, G C; Bellussi, L M; Ciprandi, G",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/21-1supp2-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982532/,906

105595,Interactions of childhood maltreatment and genetic variations in adult depression: A systematic review.,2020-07-15,"The socio-economic and health consequences of our ageing population are well documented, with older adults living in long-term care facilities amongst the frailest possessing specific and significant healthcare and social care needs. These needs may be exacerbated through the sedentary behaviour which is prevalent within care home settings. Reducing sedentary time can reduce the risk of many diseases and improve functional health, implying that improvements in health may be gained by simply helping older adults substitute time spent sitting with time spent standing or in light-intensity ambulation. This study identified the impact of 1 year of lifestyle intervention in a group of older adults living in a long-term care setting in Italy. One hundred and eleven older adults (mean age, 82.37 years; SD = 10.55 years) participated in the study. Sixty-nine older adults were in the intervention group (35 without severe cognitive decline and 34 with dementia) and 42 older adults were in the control group. Data on physical functioning, basic activities of daily living (BADL) and mood were collected 4 times, before, during (every four months) and after the 1 year of intervention. The lifestyle intervention focused on improving the amount of time spent every week in active behaviour and physical activity (minimum 150 min of weekly activities). All participants completed the training program and no adverse events, related to the program, occurred. The intervention group showed steady and significant improvements in physical functioning and a stable situation in BADL and mood following the intervention in older adults with and without dementia, whilst the control group exhibited a significant decline over time. These results suggest that engagement in a physical activity intervention may benefit care home residents with and without dementia both physically and mentally, leading to improved social care and a reduced burden on healthcare services.","Magistro, Daniele; Carlevaro, Fabio; Magno, Francesca; Simon, Martina; Camp, Nicola; Kinrade, Noel; Zecca, Massimiliano; Musella, Giovanni",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300062/,906

The purpose of this theory-guided COVID-19 project was to address the self-care needs of caregivers so they could better care for patients/families who are confronting daily pandemic demands. Study design: The organization's professional practices are guided by Watson's theory of human caring and Caritas Processes. This setting has 16 Caritas Coaches® who have acquired expertise in human caring from an accredited program of the Watson Caring Science Institute (www.watsoncaringscience.org). Methods: Caritas Coaches® were mobilized to implement holistic caring-healing modalities such as aromatherapy and mindfulness meditation throughout the organization. Findings: By addressing the self-care needs of caregivers, the organizational culture shifted from fear, fatigue, stress, and burnout, to more intentional conscious, mindful, caring presence, gratitude, and purpose. Conclusion: This study has implications for other institutions regarding theory-guided practice and system responses to self-care needs of staff.

162960,Ehealth literacy and self-care behavior during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic among youths: A path analysis,2021,"Background: Public and patient involvement (PPI) improves quality and relevance of research (1). PPI is advocated by policy makers and funding bodies and is supported by EULAR (2). Arthritis Research Limerick (ARL) is a partnership between researchers at the University of Limerick and clinicians at University Hospitals Limerick. PPI representatives have been involved in ARL projects, however no formal PPI network had been established prior to 2020. The need for a formal PPI network to collaborate with ARL was identified by both ARL and patient representatives. This need arose from a joint ambition to promote meaningful involvement of the public and patients in ARL projects and to develop a platform through which researchers and PPI representatives could collaboratively set research priorities. Objectives: The aim of this project was to create a formal PPI network to engage with people living with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and their families and to identify collaborative research opportunities between ARL and PPI representatives. Methods: A face-to-face PPI seminar was planned for October 2020. The seminar consisted of speakers from ARL providing an overview of research projects and a World Café research ideas session. Funding was obtained through a competitive, peer-review funding call from the PPI Ignite group at the University of Limerick to support the PPI seminar. The funding application was a joint application between ARL members and a PPI partner (iCAN -Irish Children's Arthritis Network). The seminar was advertised through national patient organisations (iCAN and Arthritis Ireland), social media and ARL research networks. Results: Due to Covid-19 public health restrictions the PPI seminar was held virtually. The ARL PPI inaugural seminar was attended by N=19 researchers and people living with RMDs. The seminar speakers included ARL researchers and a PPI representative. The World Café event was modified to adapt to the virtual seminar delivery. Research ideas were noted by the seminar organiser and summarised for attendees at the end of the research ideas and priorities session. An ARL PPI mailing list was set-up post seminar as a means of communicating with seminar attendees and will serve as a formal PPI network for ARL. Research updates and opportunities will be communicated via this formal network to people living with RMDs and researchers alike. Conclusion: This was the first PPI seminar organised by ARL in collaboration with a PPI seminar, and has led to the creation of a formal PPI network. Delivery mode of the PPI seminar was changed due to Covid-19 public health restrictions. This change may also have impacted engagement and attendance at the PPI seminar, given that virtual events are not accessible to all of the RMD population. Future PPI seminars will consider a hybrid approach of face-to-face and virtual attendance, to enhance accessibility. A formal PPI communication network has been established. Future work will focus future collaborative opportunities between the PPI panel and the ARL group, including project development, co-led research funding applications and joint research dissemination.","Larkin, L.; Moses, A.; Raad, T.; Tierney, A.; Kennedy, N.; Costello, W.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.442,906
167563,Assessment of psychological distress among the general public in saudi arabia during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic,2021,"Molecular knowledge of biological processes is a cornerstone in the analysis of omics data. Applied to single-cell data, such analyses can provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across different resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources in a single database. It covers the interactions and roles of proteins in inter- and intracellular signal transduction, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We also provide a comprehensive collection of protein complexes and rich annotations on the properties of proteins, including function, localization, and role in diseases. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data is accessible via OmniPath’s web service, a Cytoscape plugin, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing convenient access options for both computational and experimental scientists. Our resource provides a single access point to knowledge spanning intra- and intercellular processes for data analysis, as we demonstrate in applications to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and ulcerative colitis.","Türei, Dénes; Valdeolivas, Alberto; Gul, Lejla; Palacio-Escat, Nicolàs; Ivanova, Olga; Gábor, Attila; Módos, Dezső; Korcsmáros, Tamás; Saez-Rodriguez, Julio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.03.221242,906

Conserved Trp2 and Trp4 residues in type II cadherins anchor the EC1 A-strand intermolecularly in strand-swapped dimers. Herein, NMR spectroscopy is used to elucidate the roles of Trp2 and Trp4 in Cadherin-11 dimerization. The monomeric state, with the A-strand and Trp side chains packed intramolecularly, is in equilibrium with sparsely populated partially and fully A-strand-exposed states, in which Trp2 (and Trp4, respectively) side-chain packing is disrupted. Exchange kinetics between the major state and the partially (fully) A-strand-exposed state is slow-intermediate (intermediate-fast). A separate very fast process exchanges ordered and random-coil BC loop conformations with populations dependent on A-strand exposure and dimerization status. Additionally, very slow processes connect the folded A-strand-exposed conformation to partially unfolded states, which may represent additional domain-swapping intermediates. The dimerization mechanism of type II cadherins is revealed as coupled folding and strand-swapping.","Koss, Hans; Honig, Barry; Shapiro, Lawrence; Palmer, Arthur G",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423864,906

However, engineers reported gratitude for family, increased flexibility, being employed, and team support. People who reported no gratitude were 22% (p-value=.000007) less likely to report being satisfied that day. Many people also reported that the simple act of reflecting nightly during the studs was helpful to them. Our management used the anonymized, aggregate data to create new programs (such as No Meeting Friday) to address these challenges. We then saw immediate feedback on these programs in the diaries and used that to inform future decisions.","Butler, J.; Jaffe, S.; Ieee Comp, S. O.

Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37e−05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease. Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2.","Basu, Anamika; Sarkar, Anasua; Maulik, Ujjwal",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.116780,906
173124,The effect of calendarized drug package on patients compliance with antibiotics,2021,"This article compares the production and growth times of three types of lettuce and in three cultivation systems NFT-I, RF and soil with Worm Humus. Additionally, it describes the NFT-I cultivation system, which is a cultivation technique supported by the Internet of Things (IoT). NFT-I allows to measure and store the data of three parameters: ambient temperature, pH level and electrical conductivity;the advantage is that this system allows notifying the farmer about the current status of each variable and notifying through the social network Telegram (through bots). The methodology used was to start the planting process in the three systems on the same day, then the NFT-I system was saving data read by the sensors, and later measurements were made of the time and growth of each of the planted lettuces. The results show that this system can reduce electricity consumption by 91.6%;on the other hand, it helps farmers monitor plant growth. On the other hand, regarding the harvest time, it can be verified that the RF system, NFT-I and land were harvested in 61, 69 and 105 days respectively, which shows that RF is the most efficient;In terms of size, the number of leaves, length and width, RF is also of better size than the NFT-I crop and soil. Finally, in these times of confinement due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in which the economy has slowed and the needs are multiple, this NFT-I system could help people create their vegetable growing system of quickly and cheaply. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ibarra, M.

174446,The impact of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic on sexual behavior of marriage people in Indonesia,2021,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), while highly restricted for the human species, infects an unlimited array of cell types in the host. Patterns of infection are dictated by the cell type infected, but cell type-specific factors and how they impact tropism for specific cell types is poorly understood. Previous studies in primary endothelial cells showed that HCMV infection induces large multivesicular-like bodies that incorporate viral products including dense bodies and virions. Here we define the nature of these large vesicles using a recombinant virus where UL32, encoding the pp150 tegument protein, is fused in frame with green fluorescent protein (GFP, TB40/E-UL32-GFP). Cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies against subcellular compartment markers and imaged using confocal and super-resolution microscopy. In fibroblasts, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles were marked with classical markers of MVBs, including CD63 and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), both classical MVB markers, as well as the clathrin and LAMP1. Unexpectedly, UL32-GFP-positive vesicles in endothelial cells were not labeled by CD63, and LBPA was completely lost from infected cells. We defined these UL32-positive vesicles in endothelial cells using markers for the cis-Golgi (GM130), lysosome (LAMP1), and autophagy (LC3B). These findings suggest that virus-containing MVBs in fibroblasts are derived from the canonical endocytic pathway and takeover classical exosomal release pathway. Virus containing MVBs in HMVECs are derived from the early biosynthetic pathway and exploit a less characterized early Golgi-LAMP1-associated non-canonical secretory autophagy pathway. These results reveal striking cell-type specific membrane trafficking differences in host pathways that are exploited by HCMV. Importance Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that, like all herpesvirus, that establishes a life long infection. HCMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised and HCMV seropositivity is associated with increased risk vascular disease. HCMV infects many cells in the human and the biology underlying the different patterns of infection in different cell types is poorly understood. Endothelial cells are important target of infection that contribute to hematogenous spread of the virus to tissues. Here we define striking differences in the biogenesis of large vesicles that incorporate virions in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In fibroblasts, HCMV is incorporated into canonical MVBs derived from an endocytic pathway, whereas HCMV matures through vesicles derived from the biosynthetic pathway in endothelial cells. This work defines basic biological differences between these cell types that may impact the outcome of infection.","Momtaz, Samina; Molina, Belen; Mlera, Luwanika; Goodrum, Felicia; Wilson, Jean M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.10.420711,906

The feeling of loneliness linked to the social isolation (SI) or a lack of social opportunity activate a stressful condition associated to an increase of social dependence. This ‘learned social helplessness’ can be dangerous so that it is associated with an increased prevalence of suicides (Cacioppo and Cacioppo, 2018;Bzdok and Dunbar, 2020). Considering the impact of loneliness on the mental health we can assume that the COVID-19 forced SI affects the state of health and psychosocial well-being.ObjectivesTo evaluate the psychosocial impact of the SI in Italy.MethodsAn ad hoc survey have been sent from May to June 2020.ResultsThese results refer to the Italian survey of a multicenter investigation with partnership of Spain and Portugal universities. The investigation is in progress being a longitudinal study. Of the total 292 subjects investigated (age xM: 34;sD14.13), 118 (40,41%) had been in SI. Subjects forced into SI report more interference in the life satisfaction (p=0.003) though no more anxiety, depression and hostility we found in the SI group.ConclusionsDuring the phase 2 of Italian COVID-19 diffusion, we found an impact on the life satisfaction more than psychopathology. We can assume that the impact of mental health it may occur as the reduction in life satisfaction associated with forced SI continues.","Ciaramella, A.; Rossi, M.; Jarego, M.; Ferreira-Valente, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.837,906

The approved vaccines are lifesaving yet temporary solutions to such a devastating pandemic. Viroporins are important players of the viral life cycle of SARS-Cov-2 and one of the primary determinants of its pathogenesis. We studied the two prominent viroporins of SARS-CoV-2 (i) Orf3a and (ii) Envelope (E) protein from a structural point of view. Orf3a has several hotspots of mutations which has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 with respect to SARS-CoV-1. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a channel forming residues enhances the formation of a prominent the inter-subunit channel, which was not present in the SARS-CoV-1 Orf3a. This enhanced structural feature can be correlated with higher channelling activity in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1. On the other hand, E protein is one of the most conserved protein among the SARS-CoV proteome. We found that the water molecules form networks of electrostatic interactions with the polar residues in the E protein putative wetted condition while no water channel formation was observed in the putative dewetted condition. This aqueous medium mediates the non-selective translocation of cations thus affecting the ionic homeostasis of the host cellular compartments. This ionic imbalance leads to increased inflammatory response in the host cell. Our results shed light into the mechanism of viroporin action, which can be leveraged for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, our results corroborate with previously published transcriptomic data from COVID-19 infected lung alveolar cells where inflammatory responses and molecular regulators directly impacted by ion channelling were upregulated. These observations overlap with transcript upregulation observed in diseases having acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). One Sentence Summary Membrane permeation of Orf3a is significantly more in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1 which might contribute to increased viral contagion.","Sarkar, Manish; Etheimer, Paul; Saha, Soham",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.461873,906
181553,Assessing the level of economic consciousness and the level of health consciousness of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Indonesia,2021,"Background: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. Due to its high rate of interpersonal transmission the disease rapidly spread in China resulting in an epidemic and subsequently a pandemic with severe impact on social, economic and medical systems globally. Our understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its effects on the human body continues to evolve as new information becomes available. This paper is an overview of ongoing clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on August 3, 2020 to guide future research and clinical practice. Our objective is to do a systematic review of the existing trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov related to COVID-19 and the cardiovascular (CV) system. The aim of this is to describe the ongoing research in order to guide future practice and evaluate areas of deficiencies. Methods: We conducted our search on ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) on August 3, 2020 and used the key terms “COVID-19” and “cardiovascular. An independent two-person review was carried out for exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria was defined as studies that were terminated, withdrawn, suspended, of unknown status, or had no connection to the CV system. Three duplicate studies were removed;141 studies were removed after an independent two person review determined that it did not hold any relevant connection to the CV system and two studies were removed from the data as they were withdrawn and suspended respectively. There were no conflicting opinions between the two researchers regarding the 141 clinical trials excluded. The remaining 122 studies included were then grouped together based on their primary and secondary objectives. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. No experiments involving humans were done by the researchers and therefore ethical approval was not required. Results: We found 122 studies applicable to our search criteria and then grouped them together based on topics of investigation as identified by primary and secondary objectives. The identified studies varied from observational, registry based and interventional with most of them falling into the first two categories. The studies were ongoing at that point and did not have results to report or analyze. Conclusions: Our search on ClinicalTrials.gov produced a variety of studies that investigate relationships between COVID-19 and the CV system. Our search identified the main areas with ongoing research that has the ability to resolve controversies regarding current management of patients with COVID-19 including the ideal thromboprophylaxis regimen;arrhythmogenic potential of patients with COVID-19 and appropriate monitoring of these patients and long term morbidity related to COVID-19 and the CV system. The key finding of our analysis is that the majority of the ongoing studies are observational in nature and not randomized controlled trials. Review of these ongoing studies can aid medical professionals and researchers in outlining current areas of clinical equipoise and help with planning prospective research study topics and design. © Journal of Xiangya Medicine.

Edward Zigler was among the first to recognize the importance of levels of adaptation to intellectual deficiency, arguing from early on that intellectual challenges needed to be recognized not just in terms of IQ but also in terms of adaptive functioning. Adaptive intelligence is compared to and contrasted with general intelligence, which is usually defined as the first factor in a factor analysis of psychometric tests. I first introduce the main issues in the article. Then I discuss how one even would decide what intelligence is. Next I discuss broader theories of intelligence and especially the theory of adaptive intelligence. Then I talk about the perishability of theories of intelligence and other things-to what extent are they set up so that people are willing and able to move beyond them?

Government trust was positively associated with both officially recommended (b = 0.12; 95%CI = 0.18, 0.25) and excessive preventive behaviors (b = 0.07; 95%CI = 0.03, 0.10). The positive relationship between trust and excessive preventive behaviors was found to be statistically significant only among those with low levels of COVID-19 knowledge. Officially recommended preventive behavior is most likely to happen when there is a combination of high levels of government trust and low levels of negative emotion. Therefore, government trust increases both official and excessive (sometimes unscientific) preventive behaviors. Interventions shall aim to enhance people's COVID-19 knowledge and to reduce negative emotions.","Min, Chen; Shen, Fei; Yu, Wenting; Chu, Yajie",Prev Med,,906

234169,Ruling Out SARS-CoV-2 Infeciton Using Exhaled Breath Analysis by Electronic Nose in a Public Health Setting,2021,"MAIN CONCLUSION: 46 monocot chimeric jacalins (MCJs) were mined from wheat genome. They were divided into three subfamilies with the activity of mannose-specific lectins and had effects on dehydration tolerance or disease resistance. Monocot chimeric jacalin (MCJ) is a newly identified subfamily of plant lectins that exclusively exists in Poaceae. The MCJs are modular proteins consisting of a dirigent domain and a jacalin-related lectin domain. Their unique evolution and various functions are not fully understood as only few members of MCJ have so for been investigated. From wheat, 46 MCJs were identified and phylogenetically classified into three subfamilies, in which subfamily I represented the early evolutionary cluster. MCJ genes are evenly distributed among three subgenomes of wheat, indicating that MCJ might be an ancient gene in Poaceae. qRT-PCR analysis showed that TaMCJ1 and TaMCJ2 were mainly expressed in leaves while TaMCJ3 in root tissues. All these TaMCJ genes are JA or ABA inducible. All three proteins exhibited agglutinating activity but different preference to mannose-binding. The overexpression of TaMCJ3 in tobacco increased dehydration tolerance, while TaMCJ1 enhanced wildfire disease resistance. The lignin biosynthetic genes were temporarily induced after pathogen inoculation in transgenic tobacco overexpressing TaMCJ, but the specific association with TaMCJ was not established. This evidence argued against the notion that the dirigent domain in TaMCJ is directly linked with lignin metabolism. Taken together, these results pave the way for a better understanding of the manifold functionality of MCJs and offer important insights to the evolutionary history of MCJ.","Ma, Qing-Hu; Han, Jia-Qi",Planta,,906
235083,Insufficient sleep impairs T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2,2021,"Background: Substances that can be vaped include nicotine, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and a range of synthetic drugs called new psychoactive substances (NPS). Due to the rising popularity of vaping among adolescents, it is crucial to understand the relationships between vaping and illicit drug use. Objectives: This paper examined the prevalence and trends of using vaping devices, marijuana vaping, marijuana products, synthetic cannabinoids and mist contents among youth. Methods: The study utilized 5 sets of public cross-sectional national data from the ""Monitoring the Future"" surveys during 2014-2018. It employed logistic regression to analyze the data. Results: There was an increase from 10.5% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2018 for the past 30-day use of vaping devices among 12th graders. Furthermore, there was an increase from 21.6% in 2017 to 34.5% in 2018 for the past 12-month use of marijuana via vaping device among 12th-grade marijuana users. Additionally, there were significant associations between vaping device use and marijuana vaping, between vaping device use and marijuana use, between vaping device use and synthetic cannabinoids use, and between marijuana use and synthetic cannabinoids use from 2016 to 2018. Conclusions: Vaping emerged as another major route of marijuana administration among youth. Adolescent marijuana users had higher odds of using synthetic cannabinoids. This finding highlighted the importance of understanding what adolescent substance consumption pattern would be where marijuana was legalized. It also supported the hypothesis that vaping devices use correlates with, or is associated with, marijuana and synthetic cannabinoids use.","Tai, Hsiangyi; Swartz, Michael D; Marsden, David; Perry, Cheryl L",Subst Use Misuse,,906

242309,Excess mortality in a nephrology clinic during first months of coronavirus disease-19 pandemic: A pragmatic approach,2020,"BACKGROUND: Study of telemedicine and telerounding in surgical specialties is limited. The push for telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the face-to-face rounding paradigm and creates an opportunity for reflection on the benefits of telemedicine, especially for balancing competing corporate and clinical demands. METHODS: The 117-month video-based inpatient telerounding experience of a colorectal surgeon in an academic medical system was recorded, including patient characteristics, diagnoses, technology, content of telerounding encounters, and logistical considerations. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 163 patients were seen in 201 telerounding encounters, primarily for routine postoperative care (90.5%). Most were admitted for inflammatory bowel disease (63.2%). Changes were made to plans of care during 28.9% of encounters, and discharge planning was part of 26.4%. Encounters were conducted primarily from the surgeon's administrative office (68.7%) or other work-related locations (10.9%), while 6.5% originated from the surgeon's home. Technologic issues occurred in 5.5% of encounters. 89.1% of patient feedback was positive and none was negative. CONCLUSION: Telerounding is technologically feasible and has clinical value, including for patients with complex surgical problems. Technologic problems are rare and patient satisfaction is high. Surgeons should consider telerounding as a means to balance competing demands.","Nicholson, Kristina J; Rosengart, Matthew R; Watson, Andrew R",Am Surg,,906

Based on a preliminary study of human periosteum allografts from this laboratory, the present work has extensively investigated the use of human cadaveric tissue-engineered periosteum-allograft constructs as an approach to healing such serious orthopedic surgical situations. In this current report, human cadaveric periosteum-wrapped bone allografts and counterpart controls without periosteum were implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice (nu/nu) for 10, 20, and, for the first time, 40 weeks. Specimens were then harvested and assessed by histological and gene expression analyses. Compared to controls, the presence of new bone formation and resorption in periosteum-allograft constructs was indicated in both histology and gene expression results over 40 weeks of implantation. Of several genes also examined for the first time, RANKL and SOST expression levels increased in a statistically significant manner, data suggesting that bone formation and the presence of increasing numbers of osteocytes in bone matrices had increased with time. The tissue-engineering strategy described in this study provides a possible means of improving delayed-union or non-union at the healing sites of segmental bone defects or bone fractures. The potential of periosteum and its resident cells could thereby be utilized effectively in tissue-engineering methods and tissue regenerative medicine.","Yu, Qing; DiFeo Jacquet, Robin; Landis, William J",Cells Tissues Organs,,906

The direct seeded rice (DSR) emerged as economically viable option for timely rice establishment, but several farmers faced difficulties in DSR during kharif--2020 and therefore, adopted diverse crop production and management practices. A detailed survey was conducted in different blocks of Kapurthala district (Punjab) and data were collected from randomly selected 106 farmers. The results showed that 13.2 per cent of total farmers completely failed in DSR. There was large variation in different crop production and management practices followed by the farmers. Seed rate varied between 19.9 and 22.2 kg ha-1 and was significantly higher in Kapurthala, while lowest in Dhilwan block. Nitrogenous fertilizer application was higher by 13.0 and 5.7 per cent in Sultanpur Lodhi and Nadala blocks than the district average of 167.9 kg N ha-1. Phosphoric and potash fertilizer application rates varied between 6.7 and 12.1 kg P ha-1 and 3.3 and 9.7 kg K ha-1, respectively. Rice grain yield varied between 64.3 and 70.2 q ha-1 under DSR, as compared with 71.3 and 76.3 q ha-1 under puddled transplanted rice (PTR). The irrigation water productivity varied between 3.6 and 4.4 kg ha-1 mm-1 in DSR, compared with 3.3 and 3.6 kg ha-1 mm-1 under PTR. The results highlight the lack of proper knowledge and adoption of recommended practices for DSR technology among farmers, which require further intensive extension efforts for creating awareness in between them.","Rajan, Bhatt Singh P.",Indian Journal of Extension Education,,906

295520,Food consumption patterns of male and female undergraduate students in indonesia during new normal implementation of pandemic covid-19 era,2021,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) have increasingly become the backbone of many critical knowledge-centric applications. Most large-scale KGs used in practice are automatically constructed based on an ensemble of extraction techniques applied over diverse data sources. Therefore, it is important to establish the provenance of results for a query to determine how these were computed. Provenance is shown to be useful for assigning confidence scores to the results, for debugging the KG generation itself, and for providing answer explanations. In many such applications, certain queries are registered as standing queries since their answers are needed often. However, KGs keep continuously changing due to reasons such as changes in the source data, improvements to the extraction techniques, refinement/enrichment of information, and so on. This brings us to the issue of efficiently maintaining the provenance polynomials of complex graph pattern queries for dynamic and large KGs instead of having to recompute them from scratch each time the KG is updated. Addressing these issues, we present HUKA which uses provenance polynomials for tracking the derivation of query results over knowledge graphs by encoding the edges involved in generating the answer. More importantly, HUKA also maintains these provenance polynomials in the face of updates---insertions as well as deletions of facts---to the underlying KG. Experimental results over large real-world KGs such as YAGO and DBpedia with various benchmark SPARQL query workloads reveals that HUKA can be almost 50 times faster than existing systems for provenance computation on dynamic KGs.","Gaur, Garima; Bhattacharya, Arnab; Bedathur, Srikanta",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14864v1.pdf,906

The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. RESULTS: Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity (p=0.92). There were also no significant differences in the levels of SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG antibody production between the two groups (p=0.13, 0.62). There were 45 cases were discharged from the hospital, and no patients died at the time of this clinical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Risk-adapted treatment strategy was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery. In severe COVID-19 patients, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone was beneficial and did not delay SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid clearance and influence IgG antibody production.","Zheng, Changcheng; Wang, Jinquan; Guo, Hui; Lu, Zhaohui; Ma, Yan; Zhu, Yuyou; Xia, Daqing; Wang, Yinzhong; He, Hongliang; Zhou, Jian; Wang, Yong; Fei, Mingming; Yin, Yihong; Zheng, Mao; Xu, Yehong",Int J Infect Dis,,906

We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. METHODS: All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to web-based surveys assessing individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status (May 5 - September 7, 2020). We report: probable current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8&#8805;10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7&#8805;10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5&#8805;7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AID&#8805;2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify probable ""disabling"" current mental disorders. RESULTS: 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder.

In early-stage cervical cancer, postponing hysterectomy for 6-8 weeks is suggested as a possible option in the Covid-19 burdened hospitals. Yet, literature examining the impact of surgery wait-time on survival in early-stage cervical cancer remains scarce. This study examined the association between surgery wait-time of 8 weeks and oncologic outcome in women with early-stage cervical cancer. METHODS: This is a single institution retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral medical center examining women who underwent primary hysterectomy or trachelectomy for clinical stage IA-IIA invasive cervical cancer between 2000 and 2017 (N = 217). Wait-time from the diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer via biopsy to definitive surgery was categorized as: short wait-time (<8 weeks; n = 110) versus long wait-time (&#8805;8 weeks; n = 107). Propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance the measured demographics between the two groups, and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. A systematic literature review with meta-analysis was additionally performed. RESULTS: In a weighted model (median follow-up, 4.6 years), women in the long wait-time group had DFS (4.5-year rates, 91.2% versus 90.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-2.59, P = 0.818) and OS (95.0% versus 97.4%, HR 1.47, 95%CI 0.50-4.31, P = 0.487) similar to those in the short wait-time group. Three studies were examined for meta-analysis, and a pooled HR for surgery wait-time of &#8805;8 weeks on DFS was 0.96 (95%CI 0.59-1.55). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that wait-time of 8 weeks for hysterectomy may not be associated with short-term disease recurrence in women with early-stage cervical cancer.","Matsuo, Koji; Novatt, Hilary; Matsuzaki, Shinya; Hom, Marianne S; Castaneda, Antonio V; Licon, Ernesto; Nusbaum, David J; Roman, Lynda D",Gynecol Oncol,,906

417429,Managing the myopia epidemic and digital eye strain post COVID-19 pandemic - What eye care practitioners need to know and implement?,2020,"The novel corona virus (Covid-19) has become a great challenge worldwide since 2019, as no drug has been reported yet. Different clinical trials are still under way. Among them is Ivermectin (IVM), an FDA approved drug which was recently reported as a successful candidate to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load by inhibiting Importin-&#945;1 (IMP-&#945;1) protein which subsequently affects nuclear transport of viral proteins but its basic binding mode and inhibitory mechanism is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to explore the inhibitory mechanism and binding mode of IVM with IMP-&#945;1 via different computational methods. Initially, comparative docking of IVM was performed against two different binding sites (Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) major and minor sites) of IMP-&#945;1 to predict the probable binding mode of IVM. Then, classical MD simulation was performed (IVM/NLS-Major site and IVM/NLS-Minor site), to predict its comparative stability dynamics and probable inhibitory mechanism. The stability dynamics and biophysical analysis of both sites highlighted the stable binding of IVM within NLS-Minor site by establishing and maintaining more hydrophobic contacts with crucial residues, required for IMP-&#945;1 inhibition which were not observed in NLS-major site. Altogether, these results recommended the worth of IVM as a possible drug to limit the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and consequently reduces its progression.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A 73-year-0ld woman with COVID-19 pneumonia was treated with dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine. Her home medications, citalopram and donepezil, were continued. The ECG prior to starting hydroxychloroquine showed normal sinus rhythm with prolonged corrected QT (QTc) of 497 ms, due to citalopram and donepezil therapy. Repeat ECG on days 3 and 4 of hydroxychloroquine therapy showed significantly prolonged QTc of 557 ms and 538 ms, respectively, despite normal serum electrolytes. All QT-prolonging medications including hydroxychloroquine were discontinued on day 4; however, she suffered a transient torsades de pointes lasting for about 15 s, which resolved before any intervention. QTc improved to 477 ms, after discontinuation of QT-prolonging medications. The patient had QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes due to therapy with multiple QT-prolonging medications.

453317,Changes in Stress and Workplace Shortages Reported by U.S. Critical Care Physicians Treating Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients,2021,"The transcriptional repressor Rev-erb&#945; is known to down-regulate fatty acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis gene expression. In animal models, disruption of Rev-erb&#945; results in global changes in exercise performance, oxidative capacity, and blood glucose levels. However, the complete extent to which Rev-erb&#945;-mediated transcriptional repression of metabolism impacts cell function remains unknown. We hypothesized that loss of Rev-erb&#945; in a mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) model would result in global changes in metabolism. MEFs lacking Rev-erb&#945; exhibited a hypermetabolic phenotype, demonstrating increased levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Rev-erb&#945; deletion increased expression of hexokinase II, transketolase, and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase genes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and these effects were not mediated by the transcriptional activator BMAL1. Upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation was not accompanied by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis or numbers. Rev-erb&#945; repressed proliferation via glycolysis, but not the PPP. When treated with H2O2, cell viability was reduced in Rev-erb&#945; knockout MEFs, accompanied by increased ratio of oxidized/reduced NADPH, suggesting that perturbation of the PPP reduces capacity to mount an antioxidant defense. These findings uncover novel mechanisms by which glycolysis and the PPP are modulated through Rev-erb&#945;, and provide new insights into how Rev-erb&#945; impacts proliferation.","Gillis, Sean P; Yao, Hongwei; Rizal, Salu; Maeda, Hajime; Chang, Julia; Dennery, Phyllis A",Sci Rep,,906
453364,Coronavirus disease-19 and liver injury,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 has had a huge impact on people's daily life. Many restaurant businesses have been greatly affected by it. Consumers' preferences for catering industry in China have changed, such as environmental hygiene, variety of dishes, and service methods. Therefore, the analysis of consumer preference differences and changes before and after the epidemic can not only provide emergency strategies for the catering industry but further improve the catering industry's ability to deal with public health emergencies. This paper takes five cities in China as representatives to explore the impact of COVID-19 on China's catering industry. Based on catering review data from August 2019 to April 2020, this paper first carries out Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic analysis and SNOWNLP (A Python library for processing Chinese text) sentiment analysis. Then this paper compares the results of topic classification and sentiment analysis before and after the epidemic. Furthermore, differences and changes of consumer preferences are obtained and preferences of consumers under COVID-19 are analyzed and forecasted. The results of LDA thematic analysis before the outbreak of COVID-19 show that consumers tend to punch in cyber celebrity restaurants and pay more attention to the taste of dishes, whereas after it consumers pay more attention to the changes of dishes, dining environment as well as epidemic prevention. The number of packages and takeout was also increasing. However, the waiting time is constantly considered by consumers before and after COVID-19. Firstly, to our surprise, final outcome of emotional analysis showed that consumers' emotional state was more positive after the epidemic than before. COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle of consumers, consumption concepts, and consumption habits. Therefore, businesses also need to take positive and flexible measures to actively get feedback from consumers to adjust dishes and business methods. Secondly, the psychological attitude of catering consumers is relatively positive during the epidemic period, which indicates that consumers have great confidence in the recovery and development of the catering industry. Businesses can comply with consumers' psychology and combine consumption vouchers with restaurant discounts to promote consumers' consumption. Finally, the environment and service play more and more important effect on consumers' emotional scores at present, which indicates that dining state and comfortable mealtime environment are becoming increasingly valuable. Therefore, businesses need to improve service standards.","Zhang, C.; Jiang, J.; Jin, H.; Chen, T.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,906

In response, many countries have implemented non pharmaceutical methods of intervention, such as social distancing and lockdowns. This study aims to investigate the relationship of four dimensions of social capital (community attachment, social trust, family bond, and security) and several control variables with COVID-19 deaths. METHODS: We retrieved data from open access databases and a survey. COVID-19 death-related data were collected from the website ""Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University"". Social capital-related data were collected from a large-scale survey that included web-based and face-to-face surveys covering 100,956 respondents across all regions/provinces/states of 37 countries in 2017. Data regarding population density, number of hospital beds, and population aged 65 or older were retrieved from the World Development Indicators (WDIs). Data on country lockdowns were obtained from the website ""National responses to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic"". Linear regressions were applied to identify the relationship between social capital and COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 deaths were associated with social capital both positively and negatively. Community attachment and social trust were associated with more COVID-19 deaths, and family bond and security were associated with fewer deaths. COVID-19 deaths were positively associated with population density, ageing population, and interactions between four dimensions of social capital-related factors and the ageing population. Furthermore, the number of hospital beds and early lockdown policy were negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the role of social capital in dynamically evolving threats, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, is not always negative or positive. Therefore, people's behaviour should be changed to support countries' response to the COVID-19 threat.","Imbulana Arachchi, Janaki; Managi, Shunsuke",BMC Public Health,,906

The aim of this study was to report on QoL and other functional outcomes in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study. Two samples of older patients (>60 years old) either conservatively managed (CM) or receiving hospital-based haemodialysis (HD), compared Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL-36) outcomes. RESULTS: Data from 263 CM patients (CKD 4 n=188, mean age 73.6 years, 48 women; CKD 5 n=75, mean age 74.4 years, 26 women) and 74 patients on HD (mean age 73.8 years, 24 women) were analysed. Significant group differences were identified for two subscales of KDQoL-36. Symptoms/Problems List subscale was significantly better for those receiving HD compared with those CM with CKD 5 (p=<0.001). Symptom/Problem List scores of CM CKD stage 4 patients were not significantly different compared with HD patients but were significantly better than CM CKD stage 5 patients (p<0.001). Burden of Kidney Disease subscale was significantly better for both CKD 4 (p<0.001) and CKD 5 (p<0.001) CM patients when compared with those receiving HD. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of advanced CKD significantly impact QoL for patients CM with CKD stage 5. Conversely, QoL is significantly impacted for those in receipt of HD due to the burden of treatment. These findings provide evidence for the use of QoL tools to help with clinical prognostication in advanced CKD. Using QoL tools will ensure specialist support is available for appropriate management of patients with CKD.","McKeaveney, Clare; Witham, Miles; Alamrani, Abrar O; Maxwell, Alexander Peter; Mullan, Robert; Noble, Helen; Shields, Joanne; Reid, Joanne",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),,906

Mindfulness has been shown to improve life satisfaction, resilience to stress, self-compassion, compassion and general well-being in healthcare workers. Based on their clinical experience, the authors present mindfulness moments for clinicians (MMFC), a selection of short, simple and accessible mindfulness practices to promote resilience and compassion among clinicians working in this pandemic. The practices can be used on the job and are accessible to both novice and experienced meditators. Most of these practices are extracted from evidence-based mindfulness programmes. Further research is indicated to assess the effectiveness of using MMFC to support clinicians in their work and to promote resilience.","Hedderman, E; O039,; Doherty, V; Connor, S",Ir J Psychol Med,,906

PATIENTS/METHODS: In University Hospital La Paz (Madrid, Spain), we reviewed the clinical and demographic characteristics of 10 patients with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR and Aspergillus spp. isolate in respiratory samples. We also recovered results of galactomannan tests in serum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. RESULTS: Eight male and two female from 51 to 76 years were recovered. They had reported risk factors to develop IPA (haematological malignancies, immunosuppression, diabetes, obesity, intensive care unit stay, among others). Azole susceptible Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated in nine patients and Aspergillus nidulans was isolated in one patient. Only one case was classified as probable aspergillosis, seven cases as putative aspergillosis, and two cases were not classifiable. Eight patients received antifungal treatment. Seven patients died (70%), two are still inpatient due to nosocomial infections and one was discharged referred to another institution. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical entity has high mortality, and therefore, it should be performed surveillance with early galactomannan tests and cultures in respiratory samples in order to improve the outcome of the patients with this condition.","Falces-Romero, Iker; Ruiz-Bastián, Mario; Díaz-Pollán, Beatriz; Maseda, Emilio; García-Rodríguez, Julio",Mycoses,,906

494647,Assessing relative COVID-19 mortality: a Swiss population-based study,2021,"In November 2019, scholars and practitioners from ten higher education institutions celebrated the launch of the iKudu project. This project, co-funded by Erasmus+1, focuses on capacity development for curriculum transformation through internationalisation and development of Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) virtual exchange. Detailed plans for 2020 were discussed including a series of site visits and face-toface training. However, the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the plans in ways that could not have been foreseen and new ways of thinking and doing came to the fore. Writing from an insider perspective as project partners, in this paper we draw from appreciative inquiry, using a metaphor of a mosaic as our identity, to first provide the background on the iKudu project before sharing the impact of the pandemic on the project's adapted approach. We then discuss how alongside the focus of iKudu in the delivery of an internationalised and transformed curriculum using COIL, we have, by our very approach as project partners, adopted the principles of COIL exchange. A positive impact of the pandemic was that COIL offered a consciousness raising activity, which we suggest could be used more broadly in order to help academics think about international research practice partnerships, and, as in our situation, how internationalised and decolonised curriculum practices might be approached.","Jacobs, L.; Wimpenny, K.; Mitchell, L.; Hagenmeier, C.; Beelen, J.; Hodges, M.; George, V.; Dewinter, A.; Slambee, C.; Obadire, S.; Viviani, A.; Samuels, L.; Jackson, L.

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, the impact of sex and age on these profiles is still unknown. METHODS: A multidimensional analysis was performed involving millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178 887 individuals from Brazil, of whom 33 266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Analyzed data included those relating to complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others. FINDINGS: COVID-19 induced similar alterations in laboratory parameters in males and females. CRP and ferritin were increased, especially in older men with COVID-19, whereas abnormal liver function tests were common across several age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils were more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units displayed alterations in the coagulation system, and higher values for neutrophils, CRP, and lactate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered the laboratory profiles of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients, which formed the basis of discrepancies influenced by aging and biological sex. These profiles directly linked COVID-19 disease presentation to an intricate interplay between sex, age, and immune activation.","Ten-Caten, Felipe; Gonzalez-Dias, Patrícia; Castro, Ícaro; Ogava, Rodrigo L T; Giddaluru, Jeevan; Silva, Juan Carlo S; Martins, Felipe; Gonçalves, André N A; Costa-Martins, André G; Araujo, José D; Viegas, Ana Carolina; Cunha, Fernando Q; Farsky, Sandra; Bozza, Fernando A; Levin, Anna S; Pannaraj, Pia S; de Silva, Thushan I; Minoprio, Paola; Pinheiro da Silva, Fabiano; Andrade, Bruno B; Nakaya, Helder I",Int J Infect Dis,,906

Identifying the characteristics of impaired drivers is essential for planning preventive actions. OBJECTIVE: To compare drug use and driving behavior profiles of drivers with and without alcohol-related infractions. METHODS: 178 drivers stopped at routine roadblocks were assessed by traffic agents who conducted standard roadblock procedures (document verification; request of a breathalyzer test [BT]). Drug use and driving behavior data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Subjects were divided into three groups: drivers who refused the BT (RDs, n = 72), drivers who tested positive on the BT (PDs, n = 34), and drivers who had committed other infractions (ODs, n = 72). RESULTS: The proportion of alcohol use in the last year was higher among RDs (100%) than in the PD and OD groups (97.1% and 72.2% respectively, p < 0.001). Lifetime prevalence of cannabis and cocaine use for the overall sample was 44.3% and 18.2%, respectively. Fewer individuals in the OD group (31.5%) reported having been stopped at roadblocks in the previous year compared to the PDs (55.9%) and RDs (48.6%, p = 0.03). However, a higher proportion of RDs reported drunk driving in the same period (87.5%; PD 69.7%; OD 26.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Essential differences among groups were observed. RDs had a higher proportion of alcohol use and drunk driving in the previous year; drivers who fit into this particular group may be unresponsive or less responsive to social deterrence and enforcement actions.","Scherer, Juliana N; Schuch, Jaqueline B; Rocha, Marcelo R; Assunção, Vanessa; Silvestrin, Roberta B; Roglio, Vinícius S; Limberger, Renata P; Sousa, Tanara R V; Pechansky, Flavio",Trends Psychiatry Psychother,,906

The increasing number of critically ill patients and deaths have fueled a desperate search for treatments that can halt the course of the disease. Currently, there are several experimental therapies with demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19 used in clinical practice, including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, and convalescent plasma; however, to date no agent has proven efficacy against COVID-19. In the case of convalescent plasma, this therapy consists in obtaining neutralizing antibodies from previously infected individuals by plasmapheresis and administering them to patients with severe disease. Recently, the use of convalescent plasma has shown promising results in preliminary studies, with case series reporting a decrease in temperature, and viral load, as well as improvement in clinical parameters among patients receiving this treatment. However, there are still unmet needs regarding the safety profile, tolerability, dosage, and timing this therapy should be given. Based on this, the objective of our study was to develop and propose a practical approach for the compassionate use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, given the constrains and limitations of developing countries. We encourage health professionals in developing countries to use the current evidence and approaches to experimental treatments for patients with COVID-19, adapting them to their conditions, and always based on a thorough risk-benefit evaluation for each patient, and whenever possible to design and promote the much needed research in this field.","Sabando Vélez, Brenner Elías; Plaza Meneses, Carlos; Felix, Miguel; Vanegas, Emanuel; Mata, Valeria L; Romero Castillo, Horacio; Oliveros Alvear, Jorge W; Boloña, Enrique; Alejandra Posligua, Maria; Layedra Bardi, Luis Renato; Vera Paz, Carlos; Cherrez-Ojeda, Ivan",J Infect Dev Ctries,,906

Here, we report the clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced ITP cases. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 3255 COVID-19 patients. COVID-19-induced ITP was diagnosed after excluding possible common causes. Bleeding severity was assessed based on the modified World Health Organization (WHO) bleeding severity score. RESULTS: We identified 11 (0.34%) patients with COVID-19-induced ITP. Of all patients, 63.6% were males and the median age was 63 years. The median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to the onset of ITP was 10 days. Bleeding observed in 63.6% of the patients. Clinically significant bleeding (WHO Grade 3) occurred in single patient who required blood transfusion. Standard treatment with glucocorticoids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was effective in achieving excellent response in most cases. Of all patients, complete response and response to treatment were achieved in 45.5% and 27.3% patients, respectively. The median time to ITP recovery was 4 days. Eltrombopag was used in three patients who relapsed. Four patients required mechanical ventilation, and none of them survived secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: ITP secondary to COVID-19 usually presents after the first week of symptoms beginning. Most of our patients had WHO Grade 1-2 bleeding scores. Standard treatment with glucocorticoids and IVIG is effective in achieving an excellent response. The safety of eltrombopag is not very well established in COVID-19 patients, and additional studies are needed for a better safety profile.","Kewan, Tariq; Gunaratne, Tarini N; Mushtaq, Komal; Alayan, Dina; Daw, Hamed; Haddad, Abdo",Transfusion,,906

Most recently, developing nations expedited smart education implementation to combat the negative effects COVID-19 has on education; thus, presenting managerial issues. A review of the literature on smart education shows that past studies focused primarily on the smart learning environment, substantially ignoring the importance of leadership and human resources capacity in the management of smart education. This study addresses the deficiency observed in the literature as it relates to the key factors that enable success in the management of smart education. The study applied a quantitative approach that derived data from a structured survey of probability simple random sampled Grenadian employees belonging to tertiary education. The Hayes multiple moderated mediation, Model 23, supported by SPSS-PROCESS Macro software was used to examine the study’s model. Results showed that human resources capacity has a conditional indirect effect on smart education through the mediating variable of leadership capacity. Additionally, the moderating variables of additional investment in the ‘ɑ’ path and student demographics in the ‘ɓ’ path both displayed significant moderating effects. The findings of the study have provided several valuable insights into the theoretical and practical implications of the influence of leadership and human resources capacity in the implementation of smart education.

601496,Collaboration Between Tele-ICU Programs Has the Potential to Rapidly Increase the Availability of Critical Care Physicians—Our Experience Was During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Nomenclature,2021-03-05,"Abstract Background: Arbidol is an antiviral drug indicated for the prevention and treatment of all types of influenza infection and some other kinds of acute respiratory infections, specifically against influenza groups A and B, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. It is used to help prevent influenza infection as long as necessary with little risk for influenza mutation rendering it less effective. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability, and to determine bioequivalence, of a newly developed generic dispersible tablet formulation (test) and a branded capsule formulation (reference) of arbidol 200 mg in healthy Chinese fasted male volunteers. Methods: This open-label, single-dose, randomized-sequence, 2-period crossover study was conducted in healthy native Chinese male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 200-mg dose of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 1-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. The study drugs were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. After the study drug administration, serial blood samples were collected for 72 hours after administration. Plasma drug concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Several pharmacokinetic pararameters, including Cmax, Tmax, t½, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞, were determined from the plasma concentrations of the 2 formulations of arbidol using noncom-partmental analysis. The formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the log-transformed ratios of Cmax and AUC were within the predetermined bioequivalence range of 80% to 125% established by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of the People's Republic of China. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and electrocardiography), laboratory analysis (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis), and subject interview on adverse events. Results: Twenty subjects were enrolled and completed the study (mean [SD] age, 21.1 [1.1] years; weight, 64.7 [5.1] kg; and height, 172.3 [3.1] cm). Neither period nor sequence effect was observed. The main pharmacokinetic properties with the test and reference formulations were as follows: Cmax, 417.4 (107.6) and 414.8 (95.1) ng/mL, respectively (P = NS); median (range) Tmax, 0.63 (0.25–1.0) and 0.75 (0.5–1.5) hours (P = 0.035); AUC0-t, 2033.6 (564.9) and 1992.0 (483.3) ng/mL/h (P = NS); AUC0-∞, 2285.4 (597.7) and 2215.2 (604.0) ng/mL/h (P = NS); and t1/2, 6.9 (4.2) and 6.1 (5.2) hours (P = NS). The 90% CIs for the log-transformed ratios of Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were 91.7% to 109.7%, 91.0% to 112.8%, and 92.0% to 116.3%, respectively (all, P < 0.05), which were within the predetermined range for bioequivalence. No adverse events were found on analysis of vital signs or laboratory tests or reported by subjects in this study. Conclusion: In this study in healthy Chinese male volunteers, the dispersible tablet formulation and the 200-mg capsule formulation of arbidol met the SFDA's regulatory definition of bioequivalence based on the rate and extent of absorption.","Liu, Ming-Yan; Wang, Shuang; Yao, Wei-Fan; Wu, Hui-zhe; Meng, Sheng-Nan; Wei, Min-Jie",Clinical Therapeutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19446151/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.04.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291809001258; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291809001258,906
