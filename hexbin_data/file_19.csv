19,Bioinformatic mapping of AlkB homology domains in viruses,2005-01-03,"BACKGROUND: AlkB-like proteins are members of the 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily. In Escherichia coli the protein protects RNA and DNA against damage from methylating agents. 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine are repaired by oxidative demethylation and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its unmethylated form. Genes for AlkB homologues are widespread in nature, and Eukaryotes often have several genes coding for AlkB-like proteins. Similar domains have also been observed in certain plant viruses. The function of the viral domain is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be involved in protecting the virus against the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system found in plants. We wanted to do a phylogenomic mapping of viral AlkB-like domains as a basis for analysing functional aspects of these domains, because this could have some relevance for understanding possible alternative roles of AlkB homologues e.g. in Eukaryotes. RESULTS: Profile-based searches of protein sequence libraries showed that AlkB-like domains are found in at least 22 different single-stranded RNA positive-strand plant viruses, but mainly in a subgroup of the Flexiviridae family. Sequence analysis indicated that the AlkB domains probably are functionally conserved, and that they most likely have been integrated relatively recently into several viral genomes at geographically distinct locations. This pattern seems to be more consistent with increased environmental pressure, e.g. from methylating pesticides, than with interaction with the PTGS system. CONCLUSIONS: The AlkB domain found in viral genomes is most likely a conventional DNA/RNA repair domain that protects the viral RNA genome against methylating compounds from the environment.","Bratlie, Marit S; Drabløs, Finn",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544882/,19
99,Transcript-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets improves the interpretation of gene expression data,2007-06-11,"BACKGROUND: The wide use of Affymetrix microarray in broadened fields of biological research has made the probeset annotation an important issue. Standard Affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level, i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene, and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression. The increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants clearly brings up the necessity of updating this gene-level annotation to a refined transcript-level. RESULTS: Through performing rigorous alignments of the Affymetrix probe sequences against a comprehensive pool of currently available transcript sequences, and further linking the probesets to the International Protein Index, we generated transcript-level or protein-level annotation tables for two popular Affymetrix expression arrays, Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array and Human Genome U133A Array. Application of our new annotations in re-examining existing expression data sets shows increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and strengthened expression correlation between interacting proteins. CONCLUSION: By refining the standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level, one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data, which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism.","Yu, Hui; Wang, Feng; Tu, Kang; Xie, Lu; Li, Yuan-Yuan; Li, Yi-Xue",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1913542/,19
169,Temporal trends in the discovery of human viruses,2008-05-27,"On average, more than two new species of human virus are reported every year. We constructed the cumulative species discovery curve for human viruses going back to 1901. We fitted a statistical model to these data; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete. We generated a 95% credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38–562. We extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10–40 new species to be discovered by 2020. Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning. More systematic virus discovery programmes, covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses, should be considered.","Woolhouse, Mark E.J; Howey, Richard; Gaunt, Eleanor; Reilly, Liam; Chase-Topping, Margo; Savill, Nick",Proc Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2475551/,19
225,Transmission Dynamics and Prospects for the Elimination of Canine Rabies,2009-03-10,"Rabies has been eliminated from domestic dog populations in Western Europe and North America, but continues to kill many thousands of people throughout Africa and Asia every year. A quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations provides critical information to assess whether global elimination of canine rabies is possible. We report extensive observations of individual rabid animals in Tanzania and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission biology, which explains important epidemiological features, including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories. We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R(0), is very low in our study area in rural Africa (∼1.2) and throughout its historic global range (<2). This finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain population-level immunity between campaigns. Nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained, international commitment, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal.","Hampson, Katie; Dushoff, Jonathan; Cleaveland, Sarah; Haydon, Daniel T; Kaare, Magai; Packer, Craig; Dobson, Andy",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2653555/,19
430,Calciomics: prediction and analysis of EF-hand calcium binding proteins by protein engineering,2010-02-07,"Ca(2+) plays a pivotal role in the physiology and biochemistry of prokaryotic and mammalian organisms. Viruses also utilize the universal Ca(2+) signal to create a specific cellular environment to achieve coexistence with the host, and to propagate. In this paper we first describe our development of a grafting approach to understand site-specific Ca(2+) binding properties of EF-hand proteins with a helix-loop-helix Ca(2+) binding motif, then summarize our prediction and identification of EF-hand Ca(2+) binding sites on a genome-wide scale in bacteria and virus, and next report the application of the grafting approach to probe the metal binding capability of predicted EF-hand motifs within the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor (Shr) of Streptococcus pyrogenes and the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) of Sindbis virus. When methods such as the grafting approach are developed in conjunction with prediction algorithms we are better able to probe continuous Ca(2+)-binding sites that have been previously underrepresented due to the limitation of conventional methodology.","Chen, YanYi; Xue, ShengHui; Zhou, YuBin; Yang, Jenny Jie",Sci China Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2926812/,19
657,Protein Disulfide Isomerase and Host-Pathogen Interaction,2011-10-11,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by immunological cells is known to cause damage to pathogens. Increasing evidence accumulated in the last decade has shown, however, that ROS (and redox signals) functionally regulate different cellular pathways in the host-pathogen interaction. These especially affect (i) pathogen entry through protein redox switches and redox modification (i.e., intra- and interdisulfide and cysteine oxidation) and (ii) phagocytic ROS production via Nox family NADPH oxidase enzyme and the control of phagolysosome function with key implications for antigen processing. The protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family of redox chaperones is closely involved in both processes and is also implicated in protein unfolding and trafficking across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and towards the cytosol, a thiol-based redox locus for antigen processing. Here, we summarise examples of the cellular association of host PDI with different pathogens and explore the possible roles of pathogen PDIs in infection. A better understanding of these complex regulatory steps will provide insightful information on the redox role and coevolutional biological process, and assist the development of more specific therapeutic strategies in pathogen-mediated infections.","Stolf, Beatriz S.; Smyrnias, Ioannis; Lopes, Lucia R.; Vendramin, Alcione; Goto, Hiro; Laurindo, Francisco R.

681,"Agricultural intensification, priming for persistence and the emergence of Nipah virus: a lethal bat-borne zoonosis",2012-01-07,"Emerging zoonoses threaten global health, yet the processes by which they emerge are complex and poorly understood. Nipah virus (NiV) is an important threat owing to its broad host and geographical range, high case fatality, potential for human-to-human transmission and lack of effective prevention or therapies. Here, we investigate the origin of the first identified outbreak of NiV encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore. We analyse data on livestock production from the index site (a commercial pig farm in Malaysia) prior to and during the outbreak, on Malaysian agricultural production, and from surveys of NiV's wildlife reservoir (flying foxes). Our analyses suggest that repeated introduction of NiV from wildlife changed infection dynamics in pigs. Initial viral introduction produced an explosive epizootic that drove itself to extinction but primed the population for enzootic persistence upon reintroduction of the virus. The resultant within-farm persistence permitted regional spread and increased the number of human infections. This study refutes an earlier hypothesis that anomalous El Niño Southern Oscillation-related climatic conditions drove emergence and suggests that priming for persistence drove the emergence of a novel zoonotic pathogen. Thus, we provide empirical evidence for a causative mechanism previously proposed as a precursor to widespread infection with H5N1 avian influenza and other emerging pathogens.","Pulliam, Juliet R.

841,Targets and Intracellular Signaling Mechanisms for Deoxynivalenol-Induced Ribosomal RNA Cleavage,2012-04-05,"The trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), a known translational inhibitor, induces ribosomal RNA (rRNA) cleavage. Here, we characterized this process relative to (1) specific 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage sites and (2) identity of specific upstream signaling elements in this pathway. Capillary electrophoresis indicated that DON at concentrations as low as 200 ng/ml evoked selective rRNA cleavage after 6 h and that 1000 ng/ml caused cleavage within 2 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that DON exposure induced six rRNA cleavage fragments from 28S rRNA and five fragments from 18S rRNA. When selective kinase inhibitors were used to identify potential upstream signals, RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck), and p38 were found to be required for rRNA cleavage, whereas c-Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were not. Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation was suppressed by the p53 inhibitors pifithrin-α and pifithrin-μ as well as the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Concurrent apoptosis was confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and flow cytometry. DON activated caspases 3, 8, and 9, thus suggesting the possible coinvolvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in rRNA cleavage. Satratoxin G (SG), anisomycin, and ricin also induced specific rRNA cleavage profiles identical to those of DON, suggesting that ribotoxins might share a conserved rRNA cleavage mechanism. Taken together, DON-induced rRNA cleavage is likely to be closely linked to apoptosis activation and appears to involve the sequential activation of PKR/Hck →p38→p53→caspase 8/9→caspase 3.","He, Kaiyu; Zhou, Hui-Ren; Pestka, James J.",Toxicological Sciences,https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article-pdf/127/2/382/16684710/kfs134.pdf,19
933,"Murphy's law—if anything can go wrong, it will: Problems in phage electron microscopy",2012-04-01,"The quality of bacteriophage electron microscopy appears to be on a downward course since the 1980s. This coincides with the introduction of digital electron microscopes and a general lowering of standards, possibly due to the disappearance of several world-class electron microscopists The most important problem seems to be poor contrast. Positive staining is frequently not recognized as an undesirable artifact. Phage parts, bacterial debris, and aberrant or damaged phage particles may be misdiagnosed as bacterial viruses. Digital electron microscopes often seem to be operated without magnification control because this is difficult and inconvenient. In summary, most phage electron microscopy problems may be attributed to human failure. Journals are a last-ditch defense and have a heavy responsibility in selecting competent reviewers and rejecting, or not, unsatisfactory articles.","Ackermann, Hans-W.; Tiekotter, Kenneth L.",Bacteriophage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442825/,19
942,Use of functional gene arrays for elucidating in situ biodegradation,2012-09-21,"Microarrays have revolutionized the study of microbiology by providing a high-throughput method for examining thousands of genes with a single test and overcome the limitations of many culture-independent approaches. Functional gene arrays (FGA) probe a wide range of genes involved in a variety of functions of interest to microbial ecology (e.g., carbon degradation, N fixation, metal resistance) from many different microorganisms, cultured and uncultured. The most comprehensive FGA to date is the GeoChip array, which targets tens of thousands of genes involved in the geochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, metal resistance and reduction, energy processing, antibiotic resistance and contaminant degradation as well as phylogenetic information (gyrB). Since the development of GeoChips, many studies have been performed using this FGA and have shown it to be a powerful tool for rapid, sensitive, and specific examination of microbial communities in a high-throughput manner. As such, the GeoChip is well-suited for linking geochemical processes with microbial community function and structure. This technology has been used successfully to examine microbial communities before, during, and after in situ bioremediation at a variety of contaminated sites. These studies have expanded our understanding of biodegradation and bioremediation processes and the associated microorganisms and environmental conditions responsible. This review provides an overview of FGA development with a focus on the GeoChip and highlights specific GeoChip studies involving in situ bioremediation.","Nostrand, Joy D.

944,Marine Organism Cell Biology and Regulatory Sequence Discoveryin Comparative Functional Genomics,2005-11-30,"The use of bioinformatics to integrate phenotypic and genomic data from mammalian models is well established as a means of understanding human biology and disease. Beyond direct biomedical applications of these approaches in predicting structure–function relationships between coding sequences and protein activities, comparative studies also promote understanding of molecular evolution and the relationship between genomic sequence and morphological and physiological specialization. Recently recognized is the potential of comparative studies to identify functionally significant regulatory regions and to generate experimentally testable hypotheses that contribute to understanding mechanisms that regulate gene expression, including transcriptional activity, alternative splicing and transcript stability. Functional tests of hypotheses generated by computational approaches require experimentally tractable in vitro systems, including cell cultures. Comparative sequence analysis strategies that use genomic sequences from a variety of evolutionarily diverse organisms are critical for identifying conserved regulatory motifs in the 5′-upstream, 3′-downstream and introns of genes. Genomic sequences and gene orthologues in the first aquatic vertebrate and protovertebrate organisms to be fully sequenced (Fugu rubripes, Ciona intestinalis, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Danio rerio) as well as in the elasmobranchs, spiny dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) and little skate (Raja erinacea), and marine invertebrate models such as the sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) are valuable in the prediction of putative genomic regulatory regions. Cell cultures have been derived for these and other model species. Data and tools resulting from these kinds of studies will contribute to understanding transcriptional regulation of biomedically important genes and provide new avenues for medical therapeutics and disease prevention.","Barnes, David W.; Mattingly, Carolyn J.; Parton, Angela; Dowell, Lori M.; Bayne, Christopher J.; Forrest, John N.",Cytotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449718/,19
952,"Identification, Characterization and Application of a G-Quadruplex Structured DNA Aptamer against Cancer Biomarker Protein Anterior Gradient Homolog 2",2012-09-28,"BACKGROUND: Anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2) is a functional protein with critical roles in a diverse range of biological systems, including vertebrate tissue development, inflammatory tissue injury responses, and cancer progression. Clinical studies have shown that the AGR2 protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, including carcinomas of the esophagus, pancreas, breast, prostate, and lung, making the protein as a potential cancer biomarker. However, the general biochemical functions of AGR2 in human cells remain undefined, and the signaling mechanisms that drive AGR2 to inhibit p53 are still not clearly illustrated. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop molecular probes specifically recognizing AGR2 for its detection and for the elucidation of AGR2-associated molecular mechanism. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Through a bead-based and flow cytometry monitored SELEX technology, we have identified a group of DNA aptamers that can specifically bind to AGR2 with K(d) values in the nanomolar range after 14 rounds of selections. Aptamer C14B was chosen to further study, due to its high binding affinity and specificity. The optimized and shortened C14B1 has special G-rich characteristics, and the G-rich region of this binding motif was further characterized to reveal an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex by CD spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. Our experiments confirmed that the stability of the G-quadruplex structure was strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ions and the formation of G-quadruplex structure was also important for the binding capacity of C14B1 to the target. Furthermore, we have designed a kind of allosteric molecule beacon (aMB) probe for selective and sensitive detection of AGR2. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we have developed new aptamer probes for specific recognition of the AGR2. Structural study have identified that the binding motif of aptamer is an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion. Furthermore, with our design of AGR2-aMB, AGR2 could be sensitively and selectively detected. This aptamer probe has great potential to serve as a useful tool for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2.","Wu, Jie; Wang, Chi; Li, Xilan; Song, Yanling; Wang, Wei; Li, Cong; Hu, Jia; Zhu, Zhi; Li, Jiuxing; Zhang, Weiyun; Lu, Zhongxian; Yang, Chaoyong James",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3460915/,19
1049,Positional Bias of MHC Class I Restricted T-Cell Epitopes in Viral Antigens Is Likely due to a Bias in Conservation,2013-01-24,"The immune system rapidly responds to intracellular infections by detecting MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes presented on infected cells. It was originally thought that viral peptides are liberated during constitutive protein turnover, but this conflicts with the observation that viral epitopes are detected within minutes of their synthesis even when their source proteins exhibit half-lives of days. The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products. One potential source of DRiPs is premature translation termination. If this is a major source of DRiPs, this should be reflected in positional bias towards the N-terminus. By contrast, if downstream initiation is a major source of DRiPs, there should be positional bias towards the C-terminus. Here, we systematically assessed positional bias of epitopes in viral antigens, exploiting the large set of data available in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We show a statistically significant degree of positional skewing among epitopes; epitopes from both ends of antigens tend to be under-represented. Centric-skewing correlates with a bias towards class I binding peptides being over-represented in the middle, in parallel with a higher degree of evolutionary conservation.","Kim, Yohan; Yewdell, Jonathan W.; Sette, Alessandro; Peters, Bjoern",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554532/,19
1176,Sumoylation at the Host-Pathogen Interface,2012-04-05,"Many viral proteins have been shown to be sumoylated with corresponding regulatory effects on their protein function, indicating that this host cell modification process is widely exploited by viral pathogens to control viral activity. In addition to using sumoylation to regulate their own proteins, several viral pathogens have been shown to modulate overall host sumoylation levels. Given the large number of cellular targets for SUMO addition and the breadth of critical cellular processes that are regulated via sumoylation, viral modulation of overall sumoylation presumably alters the cellular environment to ensure that it is favorable for viral reproduction and/or persistence. Like some viruses, certain bacterial plant pathogens also target the sumoylation system, usually decreasing sumoylation to disrupt host anti-pathogen responses. The recent demonstration that Listeria monocytogenes also disrupts host sumoylation, and that this is required for efficient infection, extends the plant pathogen observations to a human pathogen and suggests that pathogen modulation of host sumoylation may be more widespread than previously appreciated. This review will focus on recent aspects of how pathogens modulate the host sumoylation system and how this benefits the pathogen.","Wilson, Van G.",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685863/,19
1369,A Preliminary Study of Viral Metagenomics of French Bat Species in Contact with Humans: Identification of New Mammalian Viruses,2014-01-29,"The prediction of viral zoonosis epidemics has become a major public health issue. A profound understanding of the viral population in key animal species acting as reservoirs represents an important step towards this goal. Bats harbor diverse viruses, some of which are of particular interest because they cause severe human diseases. However, little is known about the diversity of the global population of viruses found in bats (virome). We determined the viral diversity of five different French insectivorous bat species (nine specimens in total) in close contact with humans. Sequence-independent amplification, high-throughput sequencing with Illumina technology and a dedicated bioinformatics analysis pipeline were used on pooled tissues (brain, liver and lungs). Comparisons of the sequences of contigs and unassembled reads provided a global taxonomic distribution of virus-related sequences for each sample, highlighting differences both within and between bat species. Many viral families were present in these viromes, including viruses known to infect bacteria, plants/fungi, insects or vertebrates, the most relevant being those infecting mammals (Retroviridae, Herpesviridae, Bunyaviridae, Poxviridae, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Bornaviridae, Picobirnaviridae). In particular, we detected several new mammalian viruses, including rotaviruses, gammaretroviruses, bornaviruses and bunyaviruses with the identification of the first bat nairovirus. These observations demonstrate that bats naturally harbor viruses from many different families, most of which infect mammals. They may therefore constitute a major reservoir of viral diversity that should be analyzed carefully, to determine the role played by bats in the spread of zoonotic viral infections.","Dacheux, Laurent; Cervantes-Gonzalez, Minerva; Guigon, Ghislaine; Thiberge, Jean-Michel; Vandenbogaert, Mathias; Maufrais, Corinne; Caro, Valérie; Bourhy, Hervé",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3906132/,19
1382,Recent developments in antiviral agents against enterovirus 71 infection,2014-02-12,"Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is the main etiological agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Recent EV-71 outbreaks in Asia-Pacific were not limited to mild HFMD, but were associated with severe neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and brainstem encephalitis, which may lead to cardiopulmonary failure and death. The absence of licensed therapeutics for clinical use has intensified research into anti-EV-71 development. This review highlights the potential antiviral agents targeting EV-71 attachment, entry, uncoating, translation, polyprotein processing, virus-induced formation of membranous RNA replication complexes, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The strategies for antiviral development include target-based synthetic compounds, anti-rhinovirus and poliovirus libraries screening, and natural compound libraries screening. Growing knowledge of the EV-71 life cycle will lead to successful development of antivirals. The continued effort to develop antiviral agents for treatment is crucial in the absence of a vaccine. The coupling of antivirals with an effective vaccine will accelerate eradication of the disease.","Tan, Chee Wah; Lai, Jeffrey Kam Fatt; Sam, I-Ching; Chan, Yoke Fun",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3924904/,19
1430,The Domain-Specific and Temperature-Dependent Protein Misfolding Phenotype of Variant Medium-Chain acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase,2014-04-09,"The implementation of expanded newborn screening programs reduced mortality and morbidity in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) caused by mutations in the ACADM gene. However, the disease is still potentially fatal. Missense induced MCADD is a protein misfolding disease with a molecular loss-of-function phenotype. Here we established a comprehensive experimental setup to analyze the structural consequences of eight ACADM missense mutations (p.Ala52Val, p.Tyr67His, p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, p.Lys329Glu, p.Arg334Lys, p.Arg413Ser) identified after newborn screening and linked the corresponding protein misfolding phenotype to the site of side-chain replacement with respect to the domain. With fever being the crucial risk factor for metabolic decompensation of patients with MCADD, special emphasis was put on the analysis of structural and functional derangements related to thermal stress. Based on protein conformation, thermal stability and kinetic stability, the molecular phenotype in MCADD depends on the structural region that is affected by missense-induced conformational changes with the central β-domain being particularly prone to structural derangement and destabilization. Since systematic classification of conformational derangements induced by ACADM mutations may be a helpful tool in assessing the clinical risk of patients, we scored the misfolding phenotype of the variants in comparison to p.Lys329Glu (K304E), the classical severe mutation, and p.Tyr67His (Y42H), discussed to be mild. Experiments assessing the impact of thermal stress revealed that mutations in the ACADM gene lower the temperature threshold at which MCAD loss-of-function occurs. Consequently, increased temperature as it occurs during intercurrent infections, significantly increases the risk of further conformational derangement and loss of function of the MCAD enzyme explaining the life-threatening clinical courses observed during fever episodes. Early and aggressive antipyretic treatment thus may be life-saving in patients suffering from MCADD.","Jank, Johanna M.; Maier, Esther M.; Reiß, Dunja D.; Haslbeck, Martin; Kemter, Kristina F.; Truger, Marietta S.; Sommerhoff, Christian P.; Ferdinandusse, Sacha; Wanders, Ronald J.; Gersting, Søren W.; Muntau, Ania C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981736/,19
1513,Can’t RIDD off viruses,2014-06-18,"The mammalian genome has evolved to encode a battery of mechanisms, to mitigate a progression in the life cycle of an invasive viral pathogen. Although apparently disadvantaged by their dependence on the host biosynthetic processes, an immensely faster rate of evolution provides viruses with an edge in this conflict. In this review, I have discussed the potential anti-virus activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a well characterized effector of the cellular homeostatic response to an overloading of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity. IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. The latter operates as part of the Oligoadenylate synthetase OAS/RNaseL system of anti-viral defense mechanism. Protein-coding RNA substrates are differentially treated by the IRE1 RNase to either augment, through cytoplasmic splicing of an intron in the Xbp1 transcript, or suppress gene expression. This referred suppression of gene expression is mediated through degradative cleavage of a select cohort of cellular RNA transcripts, initiating the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses. This is followed by a review of the RIDD pathway and its potential effect on the stability of viral RNAs. I conclude with a comparison of the enzymatic activity of the two RNases followed by deliberations on the physiological consequences of their activation.","Bhattacharyya, Sankar",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4061530/,19

During infections by RNA- and DNA-viruses, the eukaryotic translation machinery is used to assure optimal viral protein synthesis. Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) uses several non-canonical pathways to translate its own proteins, such as leaky scanning, frameshifting, shunt, and cap-independent mechanisms. Moreover, HIV-1 modulates the host translation machinery by targeting key translation factors and overcomes different cellular obstacles that affect protein translation. In this review, we describe how HIV-1 proteins target several components of the eukaryotic translation machinery, which consequently improves viral translation and replication.","Guerrero, Santiago; Batisse, Julien; Libre, Camille; Bernacchi, Serena; Marquet, Roland; Paillart, Jean-Christophe",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306834/,19
1974,"Pronounced Seasonal Changes in the Movement Ecology of a Highly Gregarious Central-Place Forager, the African Straw-Coloured Fruit Bat (Eidolon helvum)",2015-10-14,"BACKGROUND: Straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) migrate over vast distances across the African continent, probably following seasonal bursts of resource availability. This causes enormous fluctuations in population size, which in turn may influence the bats’ impact on local ecosystems. We studied the movement ecology of this central-place forager with state-of-the-art GPS/acceleration loggers and concurrently monitored the seasonal fluctuation of the colony in Accra, Ghana. Habitat use on the landscape scale was assessed with remote sensing data as well as ground-truthing of foraging areas. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the wet season population low (~ 4000 individuals), bats foraged locally (3.5–36.7 km) in urban areas with low tree cover. Major food sources during this period were fruits of introduced trees. Foraging distances almost tripled (24.1–87.9 km) during the dry season population peak (~ 150,000 individuals), but this was not compensated for by reduced resting periods. Dry season foraging areas were random with regard to urban footprint and tree cover, and food consisted almost exclusively of nectar and pollen of native trees. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that straw-coloured fruit bats disperse seeds in the range of hundreds of meters up to dozens of kilometres, and pollinate trees for up to 88 km. Straw-coloured fruit bats forage over much larger distances compared to most other Old World fruit bats, thus providing vital ecosystem services across extensive landscapes. We recommend increased efforts aimed at maintaining E. helvum populations throughout Africa since their keystone role in various ecosystems is likely to increase due to the escalating loss of other seed dispersers as well as continued urbanization and habitat fragmentation.","Fahr, Jakob; Abedi-Lartey, Michael; Esch, Thomas; Machwitz, Miriam; Suu-Ire, Richard; Wikelski, Martin; Dechmann, Dina K.

2207,A web-based resource for designing therapeutics against Ebola Virus,2016-04-26,"In this study, we describe a web-based resource, developed for assisting the scientific community in designing an effective therapeutics against the Ebola virus. Firstly, we predicted and identified experimentally validated epitopes in each of the antigens/proteins of the five known ebolaviruses. Secondly, we generated all the possible overlapping 9mer peptides from the proteins of ebolaviruses. Thirdly, conserved peptides across all the five ebolaviruses (four human pathogenic species) with no identical sequence in the human proteome, based on 1000 Genomes project, were identified. Finally, we identified peptide or epitope-based vaccine candidates that could activate both the B- and T-cell arms of the immune system. In addition, we also identified efficacious siRNAs against the mRNA transcriptome (absent in human transcriptome) of all the five ebolaviruses. It was observed that three species can potentially be targeted by a single siRNA (19mer) and 75 siRNAs can potentially target at least two species.

2263,"Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong",2016-06-07,"Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1–1.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from −0.14 to −0.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.","Yang, Bingyi; Lau, Eric H.

2395,Expansion and Functional Divergence of AP2 Group Genes in Spermatophytes Determined by Molecular Evolution and Arabidopsis Mutant Analysis,2016-09-20,"The APETALA2 (AP2) genes represent the AP2 group within a large group of DNA-binding proteins called AP2/EREBP. The AP2 gene is functional and necessary for flower development, stem cell maintenance, and seed development, whereas the other members of AP2 group redundantly affect flowering time. Here we study the phylogeny of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes. Spermatophyte AP2 group genes can be classified into AP2 and TOE types, six clades, and we found that the AP2 group homologs in gymnosperms belong to the AP2 type, whereas TOE types are absent, which indicates the AP2 type gene are more ancient and TOE type was split out of AP2 type and losing the major function. In Brassicaceae, the expansion of AP2 and TOE type lead to the gene number of AP2 group were up to six. Purifying selection appears to have been the primary driving force of spermatophyte AP2 group evolution, although positive selection occurred in the AP2 clade. The transition from exon to intron of AtAP2 in Arabidopsis mutant leads to the loss of gene function and the same situation was found in AtTOE2. Combining this evolutionary analysis and published research, the results suggest that typical AP2 group genes may first appear in gymnosperms and diverged in angiosperms, following expansion of group members and functional differentiation. In angiosperms, AP2 genes (AP2 clade) inherited key functions from ancestors and other genes of AP2 group lost most function but just remained flowering time controlling in gene formation. In this study, the phylogenies of AP2 group genes in spermatophytes was analyzed, which supported the evidence for the research of gene functional evolution of AP2 group.","Wang, Pengkai; Cheng, Tielong; Lu, Mengzhu; Liu, Guangxin; Li, Meiping; Shi, Jisen; Lu, Ye; Laux, Thomas; Chen, Jinhui",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5029118/,19
2459,Selection of antigenically advanced variants of seasonal influenza viruses,2016-05-23,"Influenza viruses mutate frequently, necessitating constant updates of vaccine viruses. To establish experimental approaches that may complement the current vaccine strain selection process, we selected antigenic variants from human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus libraries possessing random mutations in the globular head of the haemagglutinin protein (which includes the antigenic sites) by incubating them with human and/or ferret convalescent sera to human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. We also selected antigenic escape variants from human viruses treated with convalescent sera and from mice that had been previously immunized against human influenza viruses. Our pilot studies with past influenza viruses identified escape mutants that were antigenically similar to variants that emerged in nature, establishing the feasibility of our approach. Our studies with contemporary human influenza viruses identified escape mutants before they caused an epidemic in 2014–2015. This approach may aid in the prediction of potential antigenic escape variants and the selection of future vaccine candidates before they become widespread in nature.

In spite of this, the faecal virome of healthy dogs has not been investigated. In this study we describe the faecal virome of healthy dogs and dogs with acute diarrhoea in Australia, using a shotgun metagenomic approach. Viral sequences from a range of different virus families, including both RNA and DNA families, and known pathogens implicated in enteric disease were documented. Twelve viral families were identified, of which four were bacteriophages. Eight eukaryotic viral families were detected: Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, Adenoviridae and Papillomaviridae. Families Astroviridae, Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae were found only in dogs with acute diarrhoea, with Astroviridae being the most common family identified in this group. Due to its prevalence, characterisation the complete genome of a canine astrovirus was performed. These studies indicate that metagenomic analyses are useful for the investigation of viral populations in the faeces of dogs. Further studies to elucidate the epidemiological and biological relevance of these findings are warranted.","Moreno, Paloma S.; Wagner, Josef; Mansfield, Caroline S.; Stevens, Matthew; Gilkerson, James R.; Kirkwood, Carl D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5453527/,19
2848,The use of a P. falciparum specific coiled-coil domain to construct a self-assembling protein nanoparticle vaccine to prevent malaria,2017-09-06,"BACKGROUND: The parasitic disease malaria remains a major global public health concern and no truly effective vaccine exists. One approach to the development of a malaria vaccine is to target the asexual blood stage that results in clinical symptoms. Most attempts have failed. New antigens such as P27A and P27 have emerged as potential new vaccine candidates. Multiple studies have demonstrated that antigens are more immunogenic and are better correlated with protection when presented on particulate delivery systems. One such particulate delivery system is the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) that relies on coiled-coil domains of proteins to form stable nanoparticles. In the past we have used de novo designed amino acid domains to drive the formation of the coiled-coil scaffolds which present the antigenic epitopes on the particle surface. RESULTS: Here we use naturally occurring domains found in the tex1 protein to form the coiled-coil scaffolding of the nanoparticle. Thus, by engineering P27A and a new extended form of the coiled-coil domain P27 onto the N and C terminus of the SAPN protein monomer we have developed a particulate delivery system that effectively displays both antigens on a single particle that uses malaria tex1 sequences to form the nanoparticle scaffold. These particles are immunogenic in a murine model and induce immune responses similar to the ones observed in seropositive individuals in malaria endemic regions. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that our P27/P27A-SAPNs induce an immune response akin to the one in seropositive individuals in Burkina Faso. Since P27 is highly conserved among different Plasmodium species, these novel SAPNs may even provide cross-protection between Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax the two major human malaria pathogens. As the SAPNs are also easy to manufacture and store they can be delivered to the population in need without complication thus providing a low cost malaria vaccine.","Karch, Christopher P.; Doll, Tais A.

Cytology and histopathology of the lesions revealed granulomatous dermatitis with intracytoplasmic organisms, consistent with amastigotes of Leishmania species. Biochemistry identified a mild hyperproteinaemia. Blood extraction and PCR detected Leishmania species, Hepatozoon species and ‘Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum’ (CMhm) DNA. Subsequent sequencing identified Hepatozoon felis. Additionally, the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 locus of Leishmania infantum was partially sequenced and phylogeny showed it to cluster with species derived from dogs in Italy and Uzbekistan, and a human in France. Allopurinol treatment was administered for 6 months. Clinical signs resolved in the second month of treatment with no deterioration 8 months post-treatment cessation. Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to monitor L infantum blood DNA and antibody levels. The cat had high L infantum DNA levels pretreatment that gradually declined during treatment but increased 8 months post-treatment cessation. Similarly, ELISA revealed high levels of antibodies pretreatment, which gradually declined during treatment and increased slightly 8 months post-treatment cessation. The cat remained PCR positive for CMhm and Hepatozoon species throughout the study. There was no clinical evidence of relapse 24 months post-treatment. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of a cat with leishmaniosis with H felis and CMhm coinfections. The high L infantum DNA levels post-treatment cessation might indicate that although the lesions had resolved, prolonged or an alternative treatment could have been considered.","Attipa, Charalampos; Neofytou, Kyriaki; Yiapanis, Christos; Martínez-Orellana, Pamela; Baneth, Gad; Nachum-Biala, Yaarit; Brooks-Brownlie, Harriet; Solano-Gallego, Laia; Tasker, Séverine",JFMS Open Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5692141/,19

The incubation period of HFMD was typically described as about 3–7 days but empirical evidence is lacking. In this study, we estimated the incubation period of HFMD from school outbreaks in Hong Kong, utilizing information on symptom onset and sick absence dates of students diagnosed with HFMD. A total of 99 HFMD cases from 12 schools were selected for analysis. We fitted parametric models accounting for interval censoring. Based on the best-fitted distributions, the estimated median incubation periods were 4.4 (95% CI 3.8–5.1) days, 4.7 (95% CI 4.5–5.1) days and 5.7 (95% CI 4.6–7.0) days for children in kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools respectively. From the fitted distribution, the estimated incubation periods can be longer than 10 days for 8.8% and 23.2% of the HFMD cases in kindergarten and secondary schools respectively. Our results show that the incubation period of HFMD for secondary schools students can be longer than the ranges commonly described. An extended period of enhanced personal hygiene practice and disinfection of the environment may be needed to control outbreaks.","Yang, Zhongzhou; Zhang, Qiqi; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Lau, Eric H.

3091,Role of Fly Cleaning Behavior on Carriage of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2017-07-14,"Flies are known to be mechanical vectors of bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. Although flies are known to transmit disease, the effects of cleaning behavior have not been well studied. This study quantified the cleaning effectiveness and behavior of three fly species: Sarcophaga bullata, Musca domestica L., and Drosophila virilis. Flies were transferred to plates of Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and allowed to walk on the bacteria for a total of 5 min. After the flies were contaminated, they were either immediately collected to quantify bacteria or were placed onto sterile plates to clean for 5 or 10 min. After cleaning, flies were placed into tubes with 1 ml of sterile 0.85% saline and were gently shaken for 1 min to remove bacteria. A serial dilution was made and 50-µl spot titers were plated. Cleaning behavior was also monitored and scored for a period of 5 min. Results demonstrate a bacterial reduction for both bacteria on all three fly species. Sarcophaga bullata and D. virilis both showed a significant reduction of both bacteria within 10 min, whereas M. domestica only showed a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa. Cleaning behavior increased significantly in flies that were exposed to bacteria compared to flies that were not exposed to bacteria. This study is important, as it demonstrates that fly cleaning could affect mechanical transmission of disease, and additional studies should look at flies’ abilities to remove other types of microorganisms.","Jacques, B J; Bourret, T J; Shaffer, J J",Journal of Medical Entomology,https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-pdf/54/6/1712/24252285/tjx124.pdf,19
3275,Differential Shape of Geminivirus Mutant Spectra Across Cultivated and Wild Hosts With Invariant Viral Consensus Sequences,2018-07-02,"Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) possess single-stranded circular DNA genomes that are replicated by cellular polymerases in plant host cell nuclei. In their hosts, geminivirus populations behave as ensembles of mutant and recombinant genomes, known as viral quasispecies. This favors the emergence of new geminiviruses with altered host range, facilitating new or more severe diseases or overcoming resistance traits. In warm and temperate areas several whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses of the genus Begomovirus cause the tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) with significant economic consequences. TYLCD is frequently controlled in commercial tomatoes by using the dominant Ty-1 resistance gene. Over a 45 day period we have studied the diversification of three begomoviruses causing TYLCD: tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV, a natural recombinant between TYLCV and TYLCSV). Viral quasispecies resulting from inoculation of geminivirus infectious clones were examined in plants of susceptible tomato (ty-1/ty-1), heterozygous resistant tomato (Ty-1/ty-1), common bean, and the wild reservoir Solanum nigrum. Differences in virus fitness across hosts were observed while viral consensus sequences remained invariant. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the quasispecies were high, especially in common bean and the wild host. Interestingly, the presence or absence of the Ty-1 allele in tomato did not lead to differences in begomovirus mutant spectra. However, the fitness decrease of TYLCSV and TYLCV in tomato at 45 dpi might be related to an increase in CP (Coat protein) mutation frequency. In Solanum nigrum the recombinant TYLCMaV, which showed lower fitness than TYLCSV, at 45 dpi actively explored Rep (Replication associated protein) ORF but not the overlapping C4. Our results underline the importance of begomovirus mutant spectra during infections. This is especially relevant in the wild reservoir of the viruses, which has the potential to maintain highly diverse mutant spectra without modifying their consensus sequences.","Sánchez-Campos, Sonia; Domínguez-Huerta, Guillermo; Díaz-Martínez, Luis; Tomás, Diego M.; Navas-Castillo, Jesús; Moriones, Enrique; Grande-Pérez, Ana",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036239/,19

The presence of isopeptide bridges in the rationally designed trimerization motifs provides extraordinary stability to withstand thermal and chemical denaturation. As a result, these ultra-stable and well-folded trimeric coiled coils direct and yield proteolysis-resistant and remarkably potent N-peptide chimeric trimers with HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activities in the low nanomolar range, much more effective than the corresponding unstructured N-peptide monomers and reaching the potency of clinically used T20 peptide (enfuvirtide). Thus, these isopeptide bond-crosslinked de novo coiled coils may also be used as attractive scaffolds for isolating NHR-trimers in other class I enveloped viruses for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, this isopeptide bridge-tethering strategy could be extendable to the construction of ultra-stable proteins interfering with certain biological processes.","Wang, Chao; Lai, Wenqing; Yu, Fei; Zhang, Tianhong; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Xifeng; Zhang, Zhenqing; Xu, Xiaoyu; Bai, Yu; Jiang, Shibo; Liu, Keliang",Chem Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6054081/,19

Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single‐stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response. Overall, this study has important implications for understanding the ongoing PCV3 cases worldwide and will guide future efforts to develop effective preventive and control measures.","Li, Gairu; He, Wanting; Zhu, Henan; Bi, Yuhai; Wang, Ruyi; Xing, Gang; Zhang, Cheng; Zhou, Jiyong; Yuen, Kwok‐Yung; Gao, George F.; Su, Shuo",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6145280/,19

Failure to resolve replication stress in a timely manner contribute toward cell cycle defects, genome instability and human disease; however, the mechanism for fork recovery remains poorly defined. Here, we show that the translesion DNA polymerase (Pol) kappa, a DinB orthologue, has a unique role in both protecting and restarting stalled replication forks under conditions of nucleotide deprivation. Importantly, Pol kappa-mediated DNA synthesis during hydroxyurea (HU)-dependent fork restart is regulated by both the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway and PCNA polyubiquitination. Loss of Pol kappa prevents timely rescue of stalled replication forks, leading to replication-associated genomic instability, and a p53-dependent cell cycle defect. Taken together, our results identify a previously unanticipated role for Pol kappa in promoting DNA synthesis and replication stress recovery at sites of stalled forks.","Tonzi, Peter; Yin, Yandong; Lee, Chelsea Wei Ting; Rothenberg, Eli; Huang, Tony T",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251625/,19

However, many proteins/peptides have the disadvantage of poor stability, short half-life, and uncertain targeting ability. Chemical modification can be used to overcome these disadvantages; many polyethylene glycol-modified proteins/peptides have been approved by US FDA. The purpose of this study was to obtain a novel anti-angiogenic chondroitin sulfate (CS)-peptide nanoparticle conjugate with efficient anti-neovascularization and tumor targeting ability and an acceptable half-life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CS-ES2-AF nanoparticle conjugate was synthesized and characterized using (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and particle size and zeta potential analyzer. The anti-angiogenic ability was studied using MTT, migration, tube formation, and chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. The targeting ability of CS-ES2-AF was studied by ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and bioimaging. The pharmacokinetics was also studied. RESULTS: The CS-ES2-AF could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles in aqueous solution, which significantly enhances its anti-neovascularization activity, tumor targeting more explicit, and prolongs its half-life.

3870,Animals as Reservoir for Human Norovirus,2019-05-25,"Norovirus is the most common cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis and is a burden worldwide. The increasing norovirus diversity is currently categorized into at least 10 genogroups which are further classified into more than 40 genotypes. In addition to humans, norovirus can infect a broad range of hosts including livestock, pets, and wild animals, e.g., marine mammals and bats. Little is known about norovirus infections in most non-human hosts, but the close genetic relatedness between some animal and human noroviruses coupled with lack of understanding where newly appearing human norovirus genotypes and variants are emerging from has led to the hypothesis that norovirus may not be host restricted and might be able to jump the species barrier. We have systematically reviewed the literature to describe the diversity, prevalence, and geographic distribution of noroviruses found in animals, and the pathology associated with infection. We further discuss the evidence that exists for or against interspecies transmission including surveillance data and data from in vitro and in vivo experiments.","Villabruna, Nele; Koopmans, Marion P.

3986,Discovery of novel astrovirus genotype species in small ruminants,2019-07-31,"Astroviruses (AstV) are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses, best known for causing diarrhea in humans and are also found in many other mammals; in those, the relevance in gastroenteritis remains unclear. Recently described neurotropic AstV showed associations with encephalitis in humans as well as in other mammals. In Switzerland, two different neurotropic AstV were identified in cattle, as well as one in a sheep. The high genetic similarity between the ovine and one of the bovine AstV strengthens the hypothesis of an interspecies transmission. In humans, AstV associated with encephalitis were found also in human stool samples, suggesting that in these patients the infection spreads from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. Whether a similar pathogenesis occurs in ruminants remains unknown. The aims of this study were (1) the investigation of the potential occurrence of neurotropic AstV in feces samples, (2) the discovery and analysis of so far unknown AstV in small ruminants and other ruminant species’ fecal samples and (3) the examination of a potential interspecies transmission of AstV. To achieve these aims, RNA extraction out of 164 fecal samples from different ruminant species was performed and all samples were screened for known neurotropic AstV occurring in Switzerland, as well as for various AstV using RT-PCR. Positive tested samples were submitted to next generation sequencing. The generated sequences were compared to nucleotide- and amino acid databases, virus properties were identified, and phylogenetic analyses as well as recombination analysis were performed. The excretion of neurotropic AstV in small ruminants’ feces could not be demonstrated, but this work suggests the first identification of AstV in goats as well as the discovery of multiple and highly diverse new genetic variants in small ruminants, which lead to a classification into novel genotype-species. Additionally, the prediction of multiple recombination events in four of five newly discovered full or almost full-length genome sequences suggests a plausible interspecies transmission. The findings point out the occurrence and fecal shedding of previously unknown AstV in sheep and goats and pave the way towards a better understanding of the diversity and transmission of AstV in small ruminants.","Kauer, Ronja V.; Koch, Michel C.; Hierweger, Melanie M.; Werder, Simea; Boujon, Céline L.; Seuberlich, Torsten",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6679648/,19
4007,Diversity and prevalence of parasitic infestation with zoonotic potential in dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and fat-tailed sheep (dhumba) in Bangladesh,2019-02-25,"OBJECTIVE: Parasitic infestation is a major cause of losses in livestock production in tropical regions. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Gastro-intestinal (GI) parasites of dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and fat-tailed sheep (dhumba), and the prevalence of hemoparasites in camel from Dhaka, Bangladesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 87 fecal samples (32 dhumba and 55 camel) and 55 camel blood samples were collected during September–October 2015. Fecal samples were examined by direct smear, sedimentation method, flotation technique, and McMaster technique for GI parasite. Giemsa stained blood smears were examined under microscope for hemoparasite detection. RESULTS: 62% camel (n = 34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 47.7–74.6) were infected with at least one genus of parasite. 15% camel were harboring more than one genus of parasite. The prevalence of GI parasite and hemoparasite in camel were recorded as Trichuris spp. (n = 16; 29%; 95% CI: 17.6–42.9), Balantidium coli (n = 12; 22%; 95% CI: 11.8–35.0), Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 7; 13%; 95% CI: 5.3–24.5), Strongyloides spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.0–20.0), Anaplasma spp. (n = 5; 9%; 95% CI: 3.02–20.0), Paragonimus spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05–9.7), Schistosoma spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05–9.7), Hymenolepis spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05–9.7), Moniezia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05–9.7), and Babesia spp. (n = 1; 2%; 95% CI: 0.05–9.7). Mean EPG feces of camel was 291.76 ± 42.03 with a range of 0–1,400. Total 59.4% dhumba (n = 19; 95% CI: 41–76) were positive for GI parasite, including Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 10; 31.3%; 95% CI: 16.1–50), Strongyloides spp. (n = 9; 28%; 95% CI: 13.8–46.8), B. coli (n = 5; 15.6%; 95% CI: 5.3–32.8), and Trichuris spp. (n = 4; 12.5%; 95% CI: 3.5–28.9). CONCLUSIONS: High percentage of parasitic infestation in camel and dhumba in the present study refers to the necessity of use of anthelmintic for health and production improvement and to prevent zoonotic parasite transmission to animal handler and workers.","Islam, Ariful; Islam, Shariful; Ferdous, Jinnat; Rahman, Md Kaisar; Uddin, Md Helal; Akter, Sazeda; Rahman, Md Hafizar; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul",J Adv Vet Anim Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6702934/,19
4033,Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms,2019-08-19,"For a long time, viruses have been shown to modify the clinical picture of several autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK), celiac disease (CD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Best examples of viral infections that have been proposed to modulate the induction and development of autoimmune diseases are the infections with enteric viruses such as Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and rotavirus, as well as influenza A viruses (IAV), and herpesviruses. Other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella. Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection. Still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce. Available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected B cells. Contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena. Therefore, a better understanding of the immune-related molecular processes in virus-induced autoimmunity is warranted. Here we provide an overview of the current understanding of viral-induced autoimmunity and the mechanisms that are associated with this phenomenon.","Smatti, Maria K.; Cyprian, Farhan S.; Nasrallah, Gheyath K.; Al Thani, Asmaa A.; Almishal, Ruba O.; Yassine, Hadi M.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723519/,19
4073,Mechanisms and biomedical implications of –1 programmed ribosome frameshifting on viral and bacterial mRNAs,2019-06-20,"Some proteins are expressed as a result of a ribosome frameshifting event that is facilitated by a slippery site and downstream secondary structure elements in the mRNA. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding mechanisms of –1 frameshifting in several viral genes, including IBV 1a/1b, HIV‐1 gag‐pol, and SFV 6K, and in Escherichia coli dnaX. The exact frameshifting route depends on the availability of aminoacyl‐tRNAs: the ribosome normally slips into the –1‐frame during tRNA translocation, but can also frameshift during decoding at condition when aminoacyl‐tRNA is in limited supply. Different frameshifting routes and additional slippery sites allow viruses to maintain a constant production of their key proteins. The emerging idea that tRNA pools are important for frameshifting provides new direction for developing antiviral therapies.","Korniy, Natalia; Samatova, Ekaterina; Anokhina, Maria M.; Peske, Frank; Rodnina, Marina V.",FEBS Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6771820/,19
4107,Safety and efficacy of ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine against Rift Valley fever in pregnant sheep and goats,2019-10-18,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus that was first discovered in Kenya in 1930 and has since spread to become endemic in much of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Rift Valley fever (RVF) causes recurrent outbreaks of febrile illness associated with high levels of mortality and poor outcomes during pregnancy—including foetal malformations, spontaneous abortion and stillbirths—in livestock, and associated with miscarriage in humans. No vaccines are available for human use and those licensed for veterinary use have potential drawbacks, including residual virulence that may contraindicate their use in pregnancy. To address this gap, we previously developed a simian adenovirus vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 RVF, that encodes RVFV envelope glycoproteins. ChAdOx1 RVF is fully protective against RVF in non-pregnant livestock and is also under development for human use. Here, we now demonstrate that when administered to pregnant sheep and goats, ChAdOx1 RVF is safe, elicits high titre RVFV neutralizing antibody, and provides protection against viraemia and foetal loss, although this protection is not as robust for the goats. In addition, we provide a description of RVFV challenge in pregnant goats and contrast this to the pathology observed in pregnant sheep. Together, our data further support the ongoing development of ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine for use in livestock and humans.","Stedman, Anna; Wright, Daniel; Wichgers Schreur, Paul J.; Clark, Madeleine H.

4123,Enzyme-Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of Chiral Precursors to Antiviral Prodrugs,2019-07-03,"[Image: see text] Nucleoside analogues are among the most common medications given for the treatment of viral infections and cancers. The therapeutic effectiveness of nucleoside analogues can be dramatically improved by phosphorylation. The ProTide approach was developed using a phosphorylated nucleoside that is masked by esterification with an amino acid and phenol forming a chiral phosphorus center. The biological activity of the ProTides depends, in part, on the stereochemistry at phosphorus, and thus, it is imperative that efficient methods be developed for the chemical synthesis and isolation of diastereomerically pure ProTides. Chiral ProTides are often synthesized by direct displacement of a labile phenol (p-nitrophenol or pentafluorophenol) from a chiral phosphoramidate precursor with the appropriate nucleoside analogue. The ability to produce these chiral products is dictated by the synthesis of the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The enzyme phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta is well-known for its high stereoselectivity and broad substrate profile. Screening PTE variants from enzyme evolution libraries enabled the identification of variants of PTE that can stereoselectively hydrolyze the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The variant G60A-PTE exhibits a 165-fold preference for hydrolysis of the R(P) isomer, while the variant In1W-PTE has a 1400-fold preference for hydrolysis of the S(P) isomer. Using these mutants of PTE, the S(P) and R(P) isomers were isolated on a preparative scale with no detectable contamination of the opposite isomer. Combining the simplicity of the enzymatic resolution of the precursor with the latest synthetic strategy will facilitate the production of diastereometrically pure nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrugs.","Xiang, Dao Feng; Bigley, Andrew N.; Desormeaux, Emily; Narindoshvili, Tamari; Raushel, Frank M.",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822272/,19
4132,Characterizing the PRRSV nsp2 Deubiquitinase Reveals Dispensability of Cis-Activity for Replication and a Link of nsp2 to Inflammation Induction,2019-09-26,"The papain-like cysteine protease 2 (PLP2) within the N-terminus of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nsp2 replicase protein specifies a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), but its biochemical properties and the role in infection have remained poorly defined. By using in vitro assays, we found that the purified PLP2 could efficiently cleave K63 and K48 linked polyubiquitin chains Ub3-7 in vitro although displaying a differential activity in converting the respective ubiquitin dimers to monomer. The subsequent mutagenesis analyses revealed that the requirement for PLP2 DUB activity surprisingly resembled that for cis-cleavage activity, as several mutations (e.g., D91R, D85R, etc.) that largely ablated the DUB function also blocked the cis- but not trans-proteolytic cleavage of nsp2/3 polyprotein. Moreover, the analyses identified key mutations that could differentiate DUB from PLP2 cis- and trans-cleavage activities. Further reverse genetics analyses revealed the following findings: (i) mutations that largely blocked the DUB activity were all lethal to the virus, (ii) a point mutation T88G that selectively blocked the cis-cleavage activity of PLP2 did not affect viral viability in cell culture, and (iii) an E90Q mutation that did not affect either of the PLP2 activities led to rescue of WT-like virus but displayed significantly reduced ability to induce TNF-α production. Our findings support the possibility that the PLP2 DUB activity, but not cis-cleavage activity, is essential for PRRSV replication. The data also establish a strong link of nsp2 to pro-inflammatory cytokine induction during infection that operates in a manner independent of PLP2 DUB activity.","Zhou, Shaochuan; Ge, Xinna; Kong, Can; Liu, Teng; Liu, Aijing; Gao, Peng; Song, Jiangwei; Zhou, Lei; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832237/,19
4138,"A pilot study—genetic diversity and population structure of snow leopards of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, using molecular techniques",2019-11-04,"BACKGROUND: The Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges in Pakistan’s northern areas are a natural habitat of the snow leopard (Panthera uncia syn. Uncia uncia) but the ecological studies on this animal are scarce since it is human shy by nature and lives in difficult mountainous tracts. The pilot study is conducted to exploit the genetic diversity and population structure of the snow leopard in this selected natural habitat of the member of the wildcat family in Pakistan. METHOD: About 50 putative scat samples of snow leopard from five localities of Gilgit-Baltistan (Pakistan) along with a control sample of zoo maintained male snow leopard were collected for comparison. Significant quality and quantity of genomic DNA was extracted from scat samples using combined Zhang–phenol–chloroform method and successful amplification of cytochrome c oxidase I gene (190 bp) using mini-barcode primers, seven simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers and Y-linked AMELY gene (200 bp) was done. RESULTS: Cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequencing suggested that 33/50 (66%) scat samples were of snow leopard. AMELY primer suggested that out of 33 amplified samples, 21 (63.63%) scats were from male and 12 (36.36%) from female leopards. Through successful amplification of DNA of 25 out of 33 (75.75%) scat samples using SSR markers, a total of 68 alleles on seven SSR loci were identified, showing low heterozygosity, while high gene flow between population. DISCUSSION: The low gene flow rate among the population results in low genetic diversity causing decreased diversification. This affects the adaptability to climatic changes, thus ultimately resulting in decreased population size of the species.","Aruge, Samreen; Batool, Hafsa; Khan, Fida M.; Fakhar-i-Abbas,; Janjua, Safia",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6836756/,19
4409,Evasion of autophagy mediated by Rickettsia surface protein OmpB is critical for virulence,2019-10-14,"Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria that evade antimicrobial autophagy in the host cell cytosol by unknown mechanisms. Other cytosolic pathogens block different steps of autophagy targeting, including the initial step of polyubiquitin coat formation. One mechanism of evasion is to mobilize actin to the bacterial surface. Here, we show that actin mobilization is insufficient to block autophagy recognition of the pathogen Rickettsia parkeri. Instead, R. parkeri employs outer membrane protein B (OmpB) to block ubiquitylation of bacterial surface proteins, including OmpA, and subsequent recognition by autophagy receptors. OmpB is also required for the formation of a capsule-like layer. Although OmpB is dispensable for bacterial growth in endothelial cells, it is essential for R. parkeri to block autophagy in macrophages and to colonize mice because of its ability to promote autophagy evasion in immune cells. Our results indicate that OmpB acts as a protective shield to obstruct autophagy recognition, revealing a distinctive bacterial mechanism to evade antimicrobial autophagy.","Engström, Patrik; Burke, Thomas P.; Mitchell, Gabriel; Ingabire, Nadia; Mark, Kevin G.; Golovkine, Guillaume; Iavarone, Anthony T.; Rape, Michael; Cox, Jeffery S.; Welch, Matthew D.",Nat Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988571/,19
4732,Microfluidics in macro-biomolecules analysis: macro inside in a nano world,2010-06-13,"To be effective risk prevention work takes place well before pandemics through the three Ps: Planning, Preparedness and Practise. Between 2005 and 2008 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) worked with the European Commission (EC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO-Euro) to assist European countries in preparing themselves for a future influenza pandemic. All eligible countries in the European Union and European Economic Area participated with energy and commitment. Indicators of preparedness were developed based on WHO planning guidance and these were set within a simple assessment which included a formal country visit. The procedure evolved considerably with field experience. As the complexity of pandemic preparedness was appreciated it changed from being a classical short external assessment to longer national self-assessments with demonstrable impact, especially when self-assessments were published. There were essential supporting activities undertaken including a series of pan-European pandemic preparedness workshops organised by EC, WHO-Euro, ECDC and countries holding the European Union Presidency. The self-assessments highlighted additional work and documentation that was needed by national authorities from the ECDC. This work was undertaken and the document produced. The benefits of the self-assessments were seen in the 2009 pandemic in that EU/EEA countries performed better than some others. A number of the guidance documents were updated to fit the specific features of the pandemic. However the pandemic revealed many weaknesses and brought new challenges for European countries, notably over communication and vaccines, the need to prepare for a variety of scenarios and to factor severity estimates into preparedness, to improve surveillance for severe disease and to deliver seroepidemiology. Any revised self-assessment procedure will need to respond to these challenges.","Nicoll, A.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079977/,19

To validate the effectiveness of our strategy, we compare it with two typical local immunization strategies on both real and artificial networks with a high degree of clustering. Simulations on these networks demonstrate that the performance of our strategy is superior to that of two typical strategies. The proposed strategy can be regarded as a compromise between computational complexity and immune effect, which can be widely applied in scale-free networks of high clustering, such as social network, technological networks and so on.

These viruses are among the most important arthropod-borne viruses worldwide and include dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Morbidity and mortality caused by these viruses vary, but collectively they account for millions of encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, arthralgia, rash, and fever cases per year. Most of the members of this family are transmitted between vertebrate hosts by arthropod vectors, most commonly mosquitoes or ticks. Transmission cycles can be simple or complex depending on the hosts, vectors, the virus, and the environmental factors affecting both hosts and viruses. Replication of virus in invertebrate hosts does not seem to result in any significant pathology, which suggests a close evolutionary relationship between virus and vector. Another example of this relationship is the ability of these viruses to grow in invertebrate cell culture, where replication usually results in a steady state, persistent infection, often without cytopathic effect. Yields of virus from insect cell culture vary but are generally similar to yields in vertebrate cells. Replication kinetics are comparable between insect and vertebrate cell lines, despite differences in incubation temperature. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems continue to play a significant role in flavivirus isolation and the diagnosis of disease caused by these agents. Additionally, these culture systems permit the study of flavivirus attachment, penetration, replication, and release from cells and have been instrumental in the production and characterization of live-attenuated vaccines. Both vertebrate and insect cell culture systems will continue to play a significant role in basic and applied flavivirus research in the future.","Ludwig, George V.; Iacono-Connors, Lauren C.",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089231/,19

Although its etiopathogenesis is not clearly understood, it is known to be a Nairovirus. We aimed to examine the viral effects of intense systemic inflammation and vascular damage on the pulmonary vascular beds and lung tissues. METHODS: A total of 45 patients who were diagnosed with CCHF were considered for this retrospective study. In this patient group, those whose lungs had been visualized via thoracic computer tomography (CT) were entered into the study. Diameters of the pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries, atria, and ventricles were measured. Study group measurements were compared with the control group, which included patients with normal thoracic CT. RESULTS: Overall, 90 patients were enrolled in the study, with 45 patients in the study group and 45 in the control group. In the study group, the man-to-woman balance was 3/2. The average age in the study group was 54.07 ± 17.91 years. In comparing the average diameters of pulmonary arteries in the study and control groups, the study group’s average pulmonary artery diameter was significantly larger than the control group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in diameters of the pulmonary trunks and main pulmonary arteries due to CCHF was first shown in this current study. Moreover, due to our findings, it should be noted that with the rise in pulmonary artery diameter in CCHF, pulmonary hypertension can appear acutely, and this condition can be significantly alter clinical course and follow-up of the viral illness.","Aktaş, Turan; Aktaş, Fatma; Özmen, Zafer; Kaya, Turan",Lung,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101793/,19

Blood-conservation measures such as preoperative autologous donation, acute normovolemic hemodilution, perioperative blood salvage, recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), electrosurgical dissection, and minimally invasive surgical procedures may reduce the need for allogeneic blood transfusion in elective surgery. This review summarizes published evidence of the consequences of anemia and blood transfusion, the effects of blood storage, the infectious and noninfectious risks of blood transfusion, and the role of blood-conservation strategies for cancer patients who undergo surgery. The optimal blood-management strategy remains to be defined by additional clinical studies. Until that evidence becomes available, the clinical utility of blood conservation should be assessed for each patient individually as a component of preoperative planning in surgical oncology.","Weber, Randal S.; Jabbour, Nicolas; Martin, Robert C.

Prediction of severe aGvHD as early as possible is crucial to allow timely initiation of treatment. Here we report on a multicentre validation of an aGvHD-specific urinary proteomic classifier (aGvHD_MS17) in 423 patients. Samples (n=1106) were collected prospectively between day +7 and day +130 and analyzed using capillary electrophoresis coupled on-line to mass spectrometry. Integration of aGvHD_MS17 analysis with demographic and clinical variables using a logistic regression model led to correct classification of patients developing severe aGvHD 14 days before any clinical signs with 82.4% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity. Multivariate regression analysis showed that aGvHD_MS17 positivity was the only strong predictor for aGvHD grade III or IV (P<0.0001). The classifier consists of 17 peptides derived from albumin, β2-microglobulin, CD99, fibronectin and various collagen α-chains, indicating inflammation, activation of T cells and changes in the extracellular matrix as early signs of GvHD-induced organ damage. This study is currently the largest demonstration of accurate and investigator-independent prediction of patients at risk for severe aGvHD, thus allowing preemptive therapy based on proteomic profiling.

In Experiment 1, 8 wk old pullets were fed a control diet (Group C) or a diet (Group IF) supplemented with 1% IF (Arbocel RC). After 5 wk, 6 pullets per group were killed and organ samples collected. The remaining pullets in Group C were divided into two groups: half were fed the control diet (Group C) and half were given the IF diet (Group C-IF). Similarly, half the pullets in Group IF continued on the IF diet (Group IF) and half on the control diet (Group IF-C). At 10 wk, organ samples were collected. BW at wk 5 (IF, 1364.8g; C, 1342.9g) and 10 wk (IF, 1678.1g; IF-C, 1630.5g; C-IF, 1617.1g; C, 1580.4g) were not different. At wk 5, the relative proventricular weight (0.41 g/100g BW) and activities of pepsin (75.3 pepsin units/g proventriculus/min) and pancreatic general proteolytic activity (GP) (122.9 μmol tyrosine produced/g tissue) were greater (P < 0.05) than those of Group C (proventricular relative weight, 0.36; pepsin activity, 70.6; GP activity, 94.3). At wk 10, relative weights of liver and gizzard of Group IF were heavier (P < 0.05) than other treatments; activities of pepsin, GP, trypsin and chymotrypsin of IF pullets were significantly greater than other treatments as was mRNA expression for pepsinogens A (25.9 vs. 22.9) and C (13.1 vs. 10.8). In Experiment 2, 19 wk old hens were fed a control diet or a diet containing 0.8% IF (Arbocel RC) for 12 wk. Final BW after 12 wk was not different (IF, 1919.4 g; C, 1902.1 g). Pancreatic GP activity was greater (P < 0.05) in Group IF hens than Group C at wk 12 (122.2 vs. 97.0 μmol tyrosine released/min/g tissue)) as was relative gizzard weight (1.32 vs 1.10 g/100 g BW).

7156,Antibodies: an alternative for antibiotics?,2005-04-01,"This study analyzed the effects of different broiler production systems on health care costs in the Netherlands. In addition to the conventional production system, the analysis also included 5 alternative animal welfare systems representative of the Netherlands. The study was limited to the most prevalent and economically relevant endemic diseases in the broiler farms. Health care costs consisted of losses and expenditures. The study investigated whether higher animal welfare standards increased health care costs, in both absolute and relative terms, and also examined which cost components (losses or expenditures) were affected and, if so, to what extent. The results show that health care costs represent only a small proportion of total production costs in each production system. Losses account for the major part of health care costs, which makes it difficult to detect the actual effect of diseases on total health care costs. We conclude that, although differences in health care costs exist across production systems, health care costs only make a minor contribution to the total production costs relative to other costs, such as feed costs and purchase of 1-d-old chicks.","Gocsik, É.; Kortes, H.E.; Lansink, A.G.J.M.

7236,Mitochondrial DNA Mutation Detection by Electrospray Mass Spectrometry,2007-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Acute bacterial sinusitis is a frequent complication of viral upper respiratory infection (URI). We describe the clinical and virologic features of URIs that remain uncomplicated and those that precede an episode of sinusitis. We hypothesize that certain viruses are more likely to lead to acute sinusitis, and we compare viruses identified at the time of diagnosis of sinusitis with those identified early in the URI. METHODS: Children aged 48–96 months were followed longitudinally for 1 year. Nasal samples were obtained at surveillance visits, on Day 3–4 of the URI, and on Day 10, when sinusitis was diagnosed. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed on nasal washes for common respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria. A standardized score was used to quantify symptom severity. RESULTS: We evaluated 519 URIs, and 37 illnesses in 31 patients met the criteria for sinusitis. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected more frequently in URI visits that led to sinusitis, compared to in uncomplicated URIs (10.8% vs 3.4%; P = .05). New viruses were detected in 29% of sinusitis episodes, and their pattern was different than those patterns observed at surveillance. The median number of URIs per subject per year was 1 (range 0–9) in uncomplicated URI subjects and 3 (range 1–9) in sinusitis subjects (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children who developed sinusitis experienced more frequent URIs, compared to children whose URIs remained uncomplicated. When nasal samples were obtained on the day of diagnosis of acute sinusitis, nearly 30% of children had a new virus identified, suggesting that some children deemed to have sinusitis were experiencing sequential viral infections.","DeMuri, Gregory P; Eickhoff, Jens C; Gern, James C; Wald, Ellen R",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108184/,19
7518,Regulation of astrocyte proliferation by prostaglandin E(2) and the α subtype of protein kinase C,1993-06-04,"The Golgi apparatus-complex (GA), is a key organelle involved in several posttranslational modifications of polypeptides destined for lysosomes, plasma membranes and secretion. As reported from this laboratory, certain astrocytes in rat brain contain cisternae of the GA not only in perikarya, but also in processes. In order to further investigate which type of astrocytes contain GA in processes we conducted the present study using primary cultures of rat astrocytes and organelle specific antibodies against the GA and the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). While the perikarya of all cells contained elements of the GA, only a single process of a subset of type I astrocytes, negative to antibodies A2B5 and HNK-1, contained GA. In contrast, elements of the RER were found within perikarya and all processes. In order to confirm that the immunostained structures in processes indeed represent the GA, we exposed cultures to Brefeldin A (BFA), a secretion blocker which disperses the GA and redistributes it to the RER. We observed that BFA disrupted the GA of both perikarya and processes. However, astrocytes were resistant to prolonged incubations with BFA, while a similar treatment killed cultured fibroblasts and PC-12 cells. Furthermore, in astrocytes exposed to BFA for several days, the delicate network of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was replaced by large perinuclear masses of the protein. These observations demonstrate that a subset of type I astrocytes have a single process with elements of the GA. We suggest that this specialization of the GA may be related to yet unrecognized secretory or protein processing functions of these cells. The resistance of astrocytes to BFA and the striking changes in their cytoskeleton induced by the drug, may contribute to studies on the mechanism(s) of action of BFA.","Lavi, Ehud; Wang, Qian; Stieber, Anna; Gonatas, Nicholas K.",Brain Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7111168/,19

7842,Yeast Two-Hybrid Screens: Improvement of Array-Based Screening Results by N- and C-terminally Tagged Fusion Proteins,2011-07-26,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) generally require horizontal transmission by arthropod vectors among vertebrate hosts for their natural maintenance. This requirement for alternate replication in disparate hosts places unusual evolutionary constraints on these viruses, which have probably limited the evolution of arboviruses to only a few families of RNA viruses (Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Reoviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae) and a single DNA virus. Phylogenetic studies have suggested the dominance of purifying selection in the evolution of arboviruses, consistent with constraints imposed by differing replication environments and requirements in arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Molecular genetic studies of alphaviruses and flaviviruses have also identified several mutations that effect differentially the replication in vertebrate and mosquito cells, consistent with the view that arboviruses must adopt compromise fitness characteristics for each host. More recently, evidence of positive selection has also been obtained from these studies. However, experimental model systems employing arthropod and vertebrate cell cultures have yielded conflicting conclusions on the effect of alternating host infections, with host specialization inconsistently resulting in fitness gains or losses in the bypassed host cells. Further studies using in vivo systems to study experimental arbovirus evolution are critical to understanding and predicting disease emergence, which often results from virus adaptation to new vectors or amplification hosts. Reverse genetic technologies that are now available for most arbovirus groups should be exploited to test assumptions and hypotheses derived from retrospective phylogenetic approaches.","Weaver, S.

7869,Intranasal Delivery of Antiviral siRNA,2010-11-19,"There are several ways that genes may encode alternative products. The most widely recognized mechanism is alternative splicing. However, genes may also employ noncanonical translational events to produce such products. Some of these mechanisms operate at the level of translational initiation. In prokaryotes, genes may include alternative ribosome-binding sites directing the synthesis of products that differ at the N terminus. In eukaryotes, in which ribosome-binding sites do not exist, leaky scanning allows the same kind of variation. Noncanonical elongation events can also generate products that differ at their C terminus (1–3). Such events include programmed readthrough of translational termination codons (4,5) translational frameshifts (6–9), and translational hops (10,11). In each case, the ribosome fails to follow normal rules of decoding, leading to the synthesis of a protein that is not encoded, in the normal sense, in the DNA. In this chapter, we will describe the methods employed in the identification and analysis of programmed translational frameshift sites, including their discovery, measurement of the efficiency of the events, and determination of the mechanism of the frameshift.","Vimaladithan, Arunachalam; Farabaugh, Philip J.",Protein Synthesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120883/,19

In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A(10)), in a dose-response fashion (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, γ-butyrolactone (γ-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (p < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the γ-BL studies indicate that cocaine's action includes a presynaptic release mechanism for the biogenic amines. Summarily, the data show that a consideration of the route of cocaine administration is crucial in determining the underlying neurochemical basis for cocaine.","Broderick, Patricia A.",Pharmacol Biochem Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133184/,19

METHODS: The global and local Moranʼs indices were used in spatial analysis to measure the effects of spatial dependencies between neighbourhoods, using secondary data related to HI and BI gathered from surveillance service. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that there is a predominance of high rates of mosquito infestation, placing Campina Grande at a near-constant risk of arbovirus outbreaks and epidemics. A highly significant Moranʼs index value (P < 0.001) was observed, indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping, the autocorrelation patterns of Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July, the period with the highest rainfall in the city. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information on infestation locations to the relevant public health authorities, which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources, particularly for arbovirus prevention.

9990,An immunoprobe to measure Rubisco concentrations and maximal photosynthetic rates of individual phytoplankton cells,2003-12-22,"Mimicry of host antigens by infectious agents may induce cross‐reactive autoimmune responses to epitopes within host proteins which, in susceptible individuals, may tip the balance of immunological response versus tolerance toward response and subsequently lead to autoimmune disease. Epitope mimicry may indeed be involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases such as post‐viral myocarditis or Chagas disease, but for many other diseases in which it has been implicated, such as insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitis or rheumatoid arthritis, convincing evidence is still lacking. Even if an epitope mimic can support a cross‐reactive T or B cell response in vitro, its ability to induce an autoimmune disease in vivo will depend upon the appropriate presentation of the mimicked host antigen in the target tissue and, in the case of T cell mimics, the ability of the mimicking epitope to induce a proliferative rather than anergizing response upon engagement of the MHC‐peptide complex with the T cell receptor. B cell presentation of mimicking foreign antigen to T cells is a possible mechanism for instigating an autoimmune response to self antigens that in turn can lead to autoimmune disease under particular conditions of antigen presentation, secondary signalling and effector cell repertoire. In this review evidence in support of epitope mimicry is examined in the light of the necessary immunological considerations of the theory.","Davies, Janet M",Immunol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165643/,19

The mechanisms mediating the development of MBD are unknown. In this study, five inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, Balb/cByJ, A/J, SJL/J, PL/J) immunosuppressed with either irradiation (IR), cyclophosphamide (CY), or cyclosporin A (CP) along with three immune deficient strains (C57BL/6J nu/nu, Balb/cByJ nu/nu, C57BL/6J bg/bg) were lip inoculated with HSV I to determine the effect of immunosuppression on viral spread throughout the brain and the development of demyelination during the acute stage of infection. Mortality increased in all groups when compared with controls but was greatest in A/J, SJL/J, and PL/J strains, where all mice died before day 6 PI. In contrast with immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice where virus is restricted to the brainstem, virus spread throughout the brain of immunosuppressed C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J nu/nu, and C57BL/6J bg/bg mice. Despite viral spread throughout the brain of immunosuppressed C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J nu/nu, Balb/cByJ and Balb/cByJ nu/nu mice, MBD did not develop. MBD did develop however, in both HSV I infected C57BL/6J bg/bg and CP treated Balb/cByJ mice. Immunosuppression of HSV I infected Balb/cByJ mice prevents the development of demyelination at the trigeminal root entry zone (TREZ) of the brainstem while in Balb/cByJ nu/nu mice, the extent of demyelination at TREZ was reduced and delayed when compared with immunocompetent controls. These results suggest that the immune system plays an important role in limiting viral spread in the brain as well as in the development of demyelination at TREZ and of MBD throughout the brain during the acute phase of infection. Virus alone does not induce MBD in this animal model of virus induced CNS demyelination but is a prerequisite for its development.","Kastrukoff, Lorne F.; Lau, Allen S.; Leung, George Y.; Thomas, Eva E.",J Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172415/,19
10439,Modulation of MHC antigen expression by viruses and oncogenes,2004-12-10,"Recent advances in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry afford the opportunity to develop bioactive complex carbohydrates, per se, as drugs or as lead compounds in drug development. Complex carbohydrates are unique among biopolymers in their inherent potential to generate diverse molecular structures. While proteins vary only in the linear sequence of their monomer constituents, individual monosaccharides can combine at any of several sites on each carbohydrate ring, in linear or branched arrays, and with varied stereochemistry at each linkage bond. This chapter addresses some salient features of mammalian glycoconjugate structure and biosynthesis, and presents examples of the biological activities of complex carbohydrates. The chapter presents selected examples that will provide an accurate introduction to their pharmacological potential. In addition to their independent functions, oligosaccharides can modify the activities of proteins to which they are covalently attached. Many glycoprotein enzymes and hormones require glycosylation for expression and function. The chapter discusses the ancillary role of carbohydrates that is of great importance to the use of engineered glycoproteins as pharmaceuticals.","Schnaar, Ronald L.",Adv Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173135/,19
10483,In Vivo Assembly of Nanoparticles Achieved through Synergy of Structure‐Based Protein Engineering and Synthetic DNA Generates Enhanced Adaptive Immunity,2020-02-27,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of infections due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is on the rise worldwide. Polymyxins are considered as last-resort drugs for CRAB infections, but there is still controversy regarding the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. The present systematic review was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of polymyxins based therapies versus non-polymyxins based therapies in CRAB infections. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov to identify eligible studies reporting the clinical outcomes of patients with CRAB infections. The meta-analysis employed a random-effects model to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was 1-month mortality for any cause. We also examined clinical response, microbiological response, length of stay in hospital, and adverse events. RESULTS: Eleven eligible studies were analyzed (1052 patients in total), including 2 randomized clinical trials. Serious risk of bias was found in 8 out of the 11 studies. There was no statistically significant difference between polymyxins based therapies and non-polymyxins based therapies in 1-month mortality for any cause (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.53), microbiological response (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 0.90 to 16.29) and length of stay in hospital (SMD, 0.24; 95% CI, − 0.08 to 0.56). The pooled OR of clinical response indicated a significant difference in favor of polymyxin based therapies (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.03). The pooled OR of adverse events showed that non-polymyxins based therapies were associated with fewer adverse events (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 1.39 to 13.48). CONCLUSION: The performance of polymyxins based therapies was better than non-polymyxin based therapies in clinical response rate and similar to non-polymyxin based therapies in terms of 1-month mortality and microbiological response in treating CRAB infections. Due to the limitations of our study, we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the optimal treatment of CRAB infections, but polymyxins would be a relatively effective treatment for CRAB infections. Adequate and well-designed large scale randomized controlled trials are required to clarify the relative efficacy of polymyxins based and non-polymyxins based therapies.","Lyu, Cheng; Zhang, Yuyi; Liu, Xiaofen; Wu, Jufang; Zhang, Jing",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175513/,19

While oral care interventions (OCIs) have been found to be effective in reducing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), their utility in mitigating non-ventilator-associated pneumonias (NVAP) remains unknown. We performed a structured meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised clinical trials of enhanced oral hygiene procedures on NVAP. Methods We searched PubMed and Embase to include clinical trials (randomised and non-randomised), and observational (retrospective and prospective) and quasi-experimental studies examining the effect of any method of OCI on incidence of NVAP. Results After quality assessment and consensus agreement between authors, we synthesised six randomised clinical trials (3,891 patients), two non-randomised trials (2,993 patients), and separately assessed a retrospective trial (143 patients) and a quasi-experimental study (83 patients). Most studies, performed in nursing homes, did not show a significant association between OCI and NVAP prevention (RR random 0.89, 95% CI 0.64-1.25, p value 0.50). Likewise, the non-randomised trials failed to show an association between NVAP risk and OCI (RR random 1.42, 95% CI, 0.70-2.88, p value 0.32). However, in the subgroup analysis comparing dental professional involvement in care vs usual care, reduced NVAP risk was demonstrated (RR random 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.98, p value 0.03). Conclusions Study results suggest that professional dental care may confer some benefit among NVAP patients. The lack of consistent OCI protocols, data in hospitalised patients and robust randomised clinical trials do not allow definitive conclusions about the contribution of OCI in mitigating NVAP risk.

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of CPV-2 in the feces of asymptomatic free-living coatis from Garden Forest Reserve, Palmital city, SP, Brazil. Fecal samples from 21 coatis (both sexes, different ages, and different aspects of feces) were collected in August 2014 and March 2015. The nucleic acid extracted was submitted to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to amplify a fragment of the VP2 gene of CPV-2. Eight (38%) fecal samples were positive in the PCR assay and were confirmed by sequencing. The 7 nucleotide (nt) sequences analyzed showed 100% nt identity with the prototype strain of CPV-2b (CPV-39 strain). The analysis of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence revealed the presence of the GAT codon (aa D-Asp) at position 426 of the VP2 viral protein (subtype 2b). This study describes for the first time the identification of CPV-2b in asymptomatic free-living coatis (Nasua nasua) and suggests that coatis are susceptible to Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 infection and are important as a reservoir and an asymptomatic carrier to other wild and domestic animal species.","Spera, Caroline Giuseppa; Lorenzetti, Elis; Lavorente, Fernanda Louise Pereira; de Calasans Marques, Gustavo; Bisca, Jacqueline Muniz; Teixeira, Carlos Roberto; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes",Braz J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223230/,19

In line with the salutogenic approach, the aim of the current research was to investigate protective and risk factors to burnout. Research has indicated that sense of coherence (SOC) may act as a protective factor. Studies reported that loneliness has been found a risk factor that may advance burnout. The current study hypothesized that loneliness may moderate the link between SOC and burnout. In a sample of 104 Israeli school psychologists, demographic aspects such as the gender, years of experience, or type of school in which they work did not predict the burnout, focusing on the importance of emotional aspects. The analysis demonstrated that the SOC was negatively associated with burnout among low or mean levels of loneliness, but not among psychologists with high levels of loneliness. The current study provides a new insight into the burnout risk, through the focus on personal resources and social perceptions.

11528,Burn injury,2020-02-13,"ABSTRACT: The most effective treatment of Parkinson’s disease is restoring central dopamine levels with levodopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine. However, due to extensive peripheral metabolism by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), only a fraction of the levodopa dose reaches the brain unchanged. Thus, by preventing levodopa metabolism and increasing the availability of levodopa for uptake into the brain, the inhibition of COMT would be beneficial in Parkinson’s disease. Although nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors have been used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, efforts have been made to discover non-nitrocatechol inhibitors. In the present study, the 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one scaffold was selected for the design and synthesis of non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors since the COMT inhibitory potential of this class has been illustrated. Using COMT obtained from porcine liver, it was shown that a synthetic series of ten 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones are in vitro inhibitors with IC(50) values ranging from 4.55 to 19.8 µM. Although these compounds are not highly potent inhibitors, they may act as leads for the development of non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors. Such compounds would be appropriate for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: 3-Hydroxypyridin-4-ones have been synthesised and evaluated as non-nitrocatechol COMT inhibitors. In vitro, the IC(50) values ranged from 4.55 to 19.8 μM.

However, this is not well studied as a primary outcome in trauma patients. Our primary outcome was to determine if transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC) was an independent predictor of severe hypocalcemia (ionized calcium ≤ 3.6 mg/dL). METHODS: Retrospective, single-center study (01/2004–12/2014) including all trauma patients ≥ 18 yo presenting to the ED with an ionized calcium (iCa) level drawn. Variables extracted included demographics, interventions, outcomes, and iCa. Regression models identified independent risk factors for severe hypocalcemia (SH). RESULTS: Seven thousand four hundred and thirty-one included subjects, 716 (9.8%) developed SH within 48 h of admission. Median age: 39 (Range: 18–102), systolic blood pressure: 131 (IQR: 114–150), median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 15 (IQR: 10–15), Injury Severity Score (ISS): 14 (IQR: 9–24). SH patients were more likely to have depressed GCS (13 vs 15, p < 0.0001), hypotension (23.2% vs 5.1%, p < 0.0001) and tachycardia (57.0% vs 41.9%, p < 0.0001) compared to non-SH patients. They also had higher emergency operative rate (71.8% vs 29%, p < 0.0001) and higher blood administration prior to minimum iCa [pRBC: (8 vs 0, p < 0.0001), FFP: (4 vs 0, p < 0.0001), platelet: (1 vs 0, p < 0.0001)]. Multivariable analysis revealed penetrating mechanism (AOR: 1.706), increased ISS (AOR: 1.029), and higher pRBC (AOR: 1.343) or FFP administered (AOR: 1.097) were independent predictors of SH. SH was an independent predictor of mortality (AOR: 2.658). Regression analysis identified a significantly higher risk of SH at pRBC + FFP administration of 4 units (AOR: 18.706, AUC:. 897 (0.884–0.909). CONCLUSION: Transfusion of pRBC is an independent predictor of SH and is associated with increased mortality. The predicted probability of SH increases as pRBC + FFP administration increases.","Byerly, Saskya; Inaba, Kenji; Biswas, Subarna; Wang, Eugene; Wong, Monica D.; Shulman, Ira; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Lam, Lydia; Demetriades, Demetrios",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7391918/,19

Surgery often does not yield significant neurological improvement and the decision to utilize surgery depends on a number of factors. We describe the case of a 28 year-old male suffering a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) secondary to a bullet lodged in the cervical spinal canal. We present the unique radiological findings and review the indications for and utility of spine surgery for cervical GSW. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 28 year-old male involved in a motor vehicle accident immediately after sustaining a gunshot wound to the cervical spine. Neurologic exam revealed a complete SCI at the C4 level. CT scan revealed a retained bullet in the spinal canal at the C4/5 level without vascular injury or unstable vertebral fracture. He was managed nonoperatively, however, he remained ventilator dependent and ultimately expired secondary to cardiac arrest from a suspected pulmonary embolism. DISCUSSION: We present a case of complete SCI secondary to a retained bullet in the cervical spine. These cases can be managed both operatively and nonoperatively. Given the high risk of morbidity and overall poor neurological recovery after surgical intervention for SCI secondary to GSW, physicians must understand the appropriate indications for surgical intervention. These indications include, but are not limited to, progressive neurological deficit, cerebrospinal fluid leak, spinal instability, and acute lead toxicity.","Benton, Joshua A.; Rahme, Ralph; Krystal, Jonathan; Holland, Ryan; Houten, John K.; Kinon, Merritt D.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7441479/,19

We review three cases from India where proximal femoral resection and pedicled Tensor Fascia Lata (TFL) flapping was used in the management of infected deep trochanteric ulcers communicating to the hip joint. CASE PRESENTATION: Three patients had a total of four trochanteric PrUs communicating to the hip joint. Proximal femoral resection along with radical debridement of the pressure ulcer (PrU) was the first step in our surgical protocol. Serial debridements were performed to make the resulting cavity healthier and ready for the subsequent flap surgery. TFL flapping was done to cover the raw area of the PrU and the donor site was closed either primarily or with a split skin graft. All patients were males with AIS A spinal cord injury (SCI) and stage 4 PrUs in the trochanteric region. One patient had bilateral trochanteric ulcers. There was complete healing of all PrUs with improvement in wheelchair mobility, and general health. DISCUSSION: PrUs are a common complication of patients with SCI and are often considered one of the most neglected issues of health care delivery in India. Proximal femoral resection with pedicled TFL muscle flap is a versatile and reliable procedure for the coverage of recalcitrant trochanteric PrU with hip joint involvement.

Over 1,167 juvenile individuals were collected and 516 otoliths were aged to describe the temporal pattern of the settlement. L. argentiventris recruits in mangroves, where juveniles remain until they are approximately 100 mm in length or 300-days-old. Back-calculated settlement dates and underwater surveys indicated a major recruitment peak during September and October, around 8 days before and after the full moon. The majority of mangrove sites in the Gulf of California had a similar L. argentiventris average size at the beginning of the settlement season for the cohort of 2003; although there were significant differences in individual sizes at the end of the nursery stage. When sub-adults leave mangroves, they live in shallow rocky reefs and later become abundant in deeper rocky reefs. The density of migratory individuals (10–20 cm SL) decreased exponentially as the distance between a reef and a nearby mangrove site increased.

12980,"Characterization and genomic analysis of a diesel-degrading bacterium, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus CA16, isolated from Canadian soil",2020-07-25,"Soybean agglutinin (SBA) is a specific N-acetylgalactosamine-binding plant lectin that can agglutinate a wide variety of cells. SBA has great potential for medical and biotechnology-focused applications, including screening and treatment of breast cancer, isolation of fetal cells from maternal blood for genetic screening, the possibility as a carrier system for oral drug delivery, and utilization as an affinity tag for high-quality purification of tagged proteins. The success of these applications, to a large degree, critically depends on the development of a highly efficient expression system for a source of recombinant SBA (rSBA). Here, we demonstrate the utility of transient and stable expression systems in Nicotiana benthamiana and potato, respectively, for the production of rSBA, with the transgenic protein accumulated to 4% of total soluble protein (TSP) in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and 0.3% of TSP in potato tubers. Furthermore, we show that both plant-derived rSBAs retain their ability to induce the agglutination of red blood cells, are similarly glycosylated when compared with native SBA, retained their binding specificity for N-acetylgalactosamine, and were highly resistant to degradation in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids.

12984,High-yield expression of recombinant soybean agglutinin in plants using transient and stable systems,2010-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Viral pneumonia is a common respiratory disease that leads to high mortality around the world. Tanreqing (TRQ) injection has been widely used to treat viral pneumonia in China. However, the efficiency and safety of TRQ injection for viral pneumonia have not been scientifically and methodically evaluated up to now. Thus, this protocol describes a plan of performing a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRQ injection on patients with viral pneumonia. METHODS: Only randomized controlled trials will be enrolled in our study, and we will search eligible studies in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Wanfang database, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and the Sinomed. The total effective rate of clinical efficacy will be used as primary outcome. Time to relieve symptoms, incidence of adverse reactions, and the laboratory parameters will be used as secondary outcomes. Any side effects and adverse events will be recorded and assessed as safety outcomes. Study inclusion, data extraction, and quality assessment will be performed independently by 2 reviewers, and any disagreement will be resolved by a third reviewer. After that, data synthesis and subgroup analysis will be conducted with the Review Manager V.5.3.3 software. RESULTS: This review will provide a high-quality synthesis to assess the effectiveness and safety of TRQ injection for viral pneumonia patients. CONCLUSION: Our study will provide comprehensive evidence to decide whether TRQ injection is effective and safe for viral pneumonia patients.

13266,Understanding the Mechanisms Underlying Host Restriction of Insect-Specific Viruses,2020-08-31,"A cross-sectional study was performed 200 blood samples and 314 tick samples in El Huda and El Nuhud animals production research stations, Sudan, in May (summer) and December (winter) in 2016, to determine the prevalence of Theileria lestoquardi in sheep and the potential risk factors associated with the infection. A total of 200 blood samples and 314 tick samples were collected from El Huda (n = 103 blood, 97 tick) and El Nuhud (n = 97 blood, 217 tick) stations. Data on the risk factors, such as age, sex, ecotype of sheep, body condition score and seasons were recorded. The overall prevalence of Theileria lestoquardi was 13% (26/200) using PCR. A significant variation in the prevalence of Theileria lestoquardi was observed between the stations and the ecotype of sheep (p ≤ 0.05), whereas the highest prevalence was recorded in El-Huda station (19.4%) as well as in Shugor (22.8%). Other risk factors, like age, sex, body condition, and seasons were not found to be significantly associated with infection. However, the highest prevalence rate was recorded in old animals (21.6%) than the other, in males (17.9%) than females (12.2%), in animals with poor body condition (26.1%) than the other, and in winter (16%) than summer (10%). Four tick species i.e. Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (63.1%), Hyalomma anatolicum (13.8%), Hyalomma dromedarii (8.8%), and Hyalomma impeltatum (14.3%) were recorded in El Nuhud station. While in El Huda station, only Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi (79.4%), Hyalomma anatolicum (20.6%) were recorded. This study revealed that 13% of sheep were suffering from Theileria lestoquardi which is a considerable number at the stations. Therefore, further epidemiological investigations on disease throughout the year are required in order to set a well-coordinated control program.","Magzoub, Abdelmonim; El Ghali, Ahmed; Hussien, Mohammed O.; Juma, Yasir; Mohammed, Sara B.",J Parasit Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7552582/,19

In this work, we have engineered multiserotype BTV vaccine candidates based on recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the NS1 protein of BTV-4 or its truncated form NS1-Nt. A single dose of ChAdOx1-NS1 or ChAdOx1-NS1-Nt induced a moderate CD8+ T cell response and protected IFNAR(-/-) mice against a lethal dose of BTV-4/MOR09, a reassortant strain between BTV-1 and BTV-4, although the animals showed low viremia after infection. Furthermore, IFNAR(-/-) mice immunized with a single dose of ChAdOx1-NS1 were protected after challenge with a lethal dose of BTV-8 in absence of viremia nor clinical signs. Additionally, the heterologous prime-boost ChAdOx1/MVA expressing NS1 or NS1-Nt elicited a robust NS1 specific CD8+ T cell response and protected the animals against BTV-4/MOR09 even 16 weeks after immunization, with undetectable levels of viremia at any time after challenge. Subsequently, the best immunization strategy based on ChAdOx1/MVA-NS1 was assayed in sheep. Non-immunized animals presented fever and viremia levels up to 10(4) PFU/mL after infection. In contrast, although viremia was detected in immunized sheep, the level of virus in blood was 100 times lower than in non-immunized animals in absence of clinical signs.","Utrilla-Trigo, Sergio; Jiménez-Cabello, Luis; Alonso-Ravelo, Ruymán; Calvo-Pinilla, Eva; Marín-López, Alejandro; Moreno, Sandra; Lorenzo, Gema; Benavides, Julio; Gilbert, Sarah; Nogales, Aitor; Ortego, Javier",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7564706/,19
13567,Osmolyte homeostasis controls single-cell growth rate and maximum cell size of Saccharomyces cerevisiae,2019-09-26,"mRNA translation reprogramming occurs frequently in many pathologies, including cancer and viral infection. It remains largely unknown whether viral-induced alterations in mRNA translation contribute to carcinogenesis. Most cervical cancer is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus infection, resulting in the malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells mainly via viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Here, we utilized polysome profiling and deep RNA sequencing to systematically evaluate E6-regulated mRNA translation in HPV18-infected cervical cancer cells. We found that silencing E6 can cause over a two-fold change in the translation efficiency of ~653 mRNAs, most likely in an eIF4E- and eIF2α-independent manner. In addition, we identified that E6 can selectively upregulate the translation of WNT4, JIP1, and JIP2, resulting in the activation of the noncanonical WNT/PCP/JNK pathway to promote cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Ectopic expression of WNT4/JIP2 can effectively rescue the decreased cell proliferation caused by E6 silencing, strongly suggesting that the WNT4/JIP2 pathway mediates the role of E6 in promoting cell proliferation. Thus, our results revealed a novel oncogenic mechanism of E6 via regulating the translation of mRNAs.","Zhao, Lin; Wang, Longlong; Zhang, Chenglan; Liu, Ze; Piao, Yongjun; Yan, Jie; Xiang, Rong; Yao, Yuanqing; Shi, Yi",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6799841/,19
13696,Retraction Note: Interferon-mediated antiviral activities of Angelica tenuissima Nakai and its active components,2018-08-23,"To study brain function, preclinical research heavily relies on animal monitoring and the subsequent analyses of behavior. Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by automating animal tracking, yet they poorly recognize ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to be employed in variable testing environments. Critical advances based on deep-learning and machine vision over the last couple of years now enable markerless tracking of individual body parts of freely moving rodents with high precision. Here, we compare the performance of commercially available platforms (EthoVision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi-Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. We provide a set of videos—carefully annotated by several human raters—of three widely used behavioral tests (open field test, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we then deployed the pose estimation software DeepLabCut to extract skeletal mouse representations. Using simple post-analyses, we were able to track animals based on their skeletal representation in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or greater accuracy than commercial behavioral tracking systems. We then developed supervised machine learning classifiers that integrate the skeletal representation with the manual annotations. This new combined approach allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, while outperforming commercial solutions. Finally, we show that the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, while outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.","Sturman, Oliver; von Ziegler, Lukas; Schläppi, Christa; Akyol, Furkan; Privitera, Mattia; Slominski, Daria; Grimm, Christina; Thieren, Laetitia; Zerbi, Valerio; Grewe, Benjamin; Bohacek, Johannes",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608249/,19

Outcome measures to monitor disease progression or therapeutic interventions have evolved with technology. A systematic review was undertaken to evaluate outcome measures for XLRS. Inclusion criteria were all publications examining outcome measures for natural history studies or following an interventional approach for patients with XLRS. Studies which did not present follow-up data were excluded. We searched medical databases including CENTRAL, Ovid Medline, pre-Medline and ahead of Print up to February 2019. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Twelve studies meet the inclusion criteria with four prospective and eight retrospective case series. Five series were natural history observational studies and seven were interventional series using either topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Visual acuity (VA) declined very slowly in the natural history studies equivalent to 0.22–0.5 letters per year. Five of the six interventional studies showed an improvement in VA and four a reduction in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) parameters for central macular thickness (CMT). The full-field electroretinogram identified the 30-Hz latency as a further parameter to monitor function. VA was the measure most likely to show a statistically significant outcome. How functionally meaningful this is, requires further evaluation. CMT SD-OCT outcomes are variable depending on cystic changes. More refined measures are required to better correlate structure with function.","Grigg, John R.; Hooper, Claire Y.; Fraser, Clare L.; Cornish, Elisa E.; McCluskey, Peter J.; Jamieson, Robyn V.",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608480/,19
14514,Understanding Pseudomonas aeruginosa–Host Interactions: The Ongoing Quest for an Efficacious Vaccine,2020-12-05,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: We applied the genomic fabric principles for personalized gene therapy to a case of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Despite decades of research, the process of finding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the disease and, more importantly, the therapeutic solution is still a work in progress. We analyzed the transcriptomes of the chest wall metastasis, two distinct cancer nodules, and the cancer-free surrounding tissue in the surgically removed right kidney of a Fuhrman grade 3 metastatic ccRCC patient. The studies revealed that even histopathologically equally classified cancer nodules from the same kidney have different transcriptomic topologies, requiring tailored therapeutic solutions not only for each patient but even for each cancer nodule. We identified death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3); transcription activation suppressor (TASOR); family with sequence similarity 27, member C, long non-coding RNA (FAM27C); and UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit (ALG13) as the gene master regulators of the four profiled regions and proposed molecular mechanisms by which expression manipulation of TASOR and ALG13 may selectively destroy the cancer cells without affecting many of the normal cells. ABSTRACT: Published transcriptomic data from surgically removed metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma samples were analyzed from the genomic fabric paradigm (GFP) perspective to identify the best targets for gene therapy. GFP considers the transcriptome as a multi-dimensional mathematical object constrained by a dynamic set of expression controls and correlations among genes. Every gene in the chest wall metastasis, two distinct cancer nodules, and the surrounding normal tissue of the right kidney was characterized by three independent measures: average expression level, relative expression variation, and expression correlation with each other gene. The analyses determined the cancer-induced regulation, control, and remodeling of the chemokine and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, apoptosis, basal transcription factors, cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, renal cell carcinoma, and RNA polymerase pathways. Interestingly, the three cancer regions exhibited different transcriptomic organization, suggesting that the gene therapy should not be personalized only for every patient but also for each major cancer nodule. The gene hierarchy was established on the basis of gene commanding height, and the gene master regulators DAPK3, TASOR, FAM27C and ALG13 were identified in each profiled region. We delineated the molecular mechanisms by which TASOR overexpression and ALG13 silencing would selectively affect the cancer cells with little consequences for the normal cells.","Iacobas, Dumitru A.; Mgbemena, Victoria E.; Iacobas, Sanda; Menezes, Kareena M.; Wang, Huichen; Saganti, Premkumar B.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762545/,19

Production of proinflammatory neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been suggested to be a key factor in inducing a hyperinflammatory signaling cascade, allegedly causing both pulmonary tissue damage and peripheral inflammation. Accordingly, therapeutic blockage of neutrophil activation and NETosis, the cell death pathway accompanying NET formation, could limit respiratory damage and death from severe COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic glycopolymers that activate signaling of the neutrophil checkpoint receptor Siglec-9 suppress NETosis induced by agonists of viral toll-like receptors (TLRs) and plasma from patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, Siglec-9 agonism is a promising therapeutic strategy to curb neutrophilic hyperinflammation in COVID-19.","Delaveris, Corleone S.; Wilk, Aaron J.; Riley, Nicholas M.; Stark, Jessica C.; Yang, Samuel S.; Rogers, Angela J.; Ranganath, Thanmayi; Nadeau, Kari C.; Blish, Catherine A.; Bertozzi, Carolyn R.",ChemRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814829/,19

An estimated 71 million people worldwide are living with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection, which carries the risk of progression to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Similar to other RNA viruses, HCV has a high rate of genetic variability generated by its high mutation rate and the actions of evolutionary forces over time. There are two levels of HCV genetic variability: intra-host variability, characterized by the distribution of HCV mutant genomes present in an infected individual, and inter-host variability, represented by the globally circulating viruses that give rise to different HCV genotypes and subtypes. HCV genetic diversity has important implications for virus persistence, pathogenesis, immune responses, transmission, and the development of successful vaccines and antiviral strategies.

A large body of evidence also supports the hypothesis that this molecule can contribute to immunoregulation of, among other diseases, infection, autoimmune disease and allergy. New data have also come to light to characterize the receptors for CD200 (CD200R) and their potential mechanism(s) of action at the biochemical level, as well as the description of a novel natural antagonist of CD200, lacking the NH(2)-terminal region of the full-length molecule. Significant controversies exist concerning the relative importance of CD200 as a ligand for all reported CD200Rs. Nevertheless, some progress has been made in the identification of the structural constraints determining the interaction between CD200 and CD200R, and this information has in turn proved of use in developing novel small molecule agonists/antagonists of the interaction.

However cumulative environmental health risks and impacts have received little attention from U.S. policy makers at state and federal levels to develop comprehensive strategies to reduce these exposures, mitigate cumulative risks, and prevent harm. An area for which the inherent limitations of current approaches to cumulative environmental health risks are well illustrated is children’s neurodevelopment, which exhibits dynamic complexity of multiple interdependent and causally linked factors and intergenerational effects. OBJECTIVES: We delineate how a complex systems approach, specifically system dynamics, can address shortcomings in environmental health risk assessment regarding exposures to multiple chemical and nonchemical stressors and reshape associated public policies. DISCUSSION: Systems modeling assists in the goal of solving problems by improving the “mental models” we use to make decisions, including regulatory and policy decisions. In the context of disparities in children’s cumulative exposure to neurodevelopmental stressors, we describe potential policy insights about the structure and behavior of the system and the types of system dynamics modeling that would be appropriate, from visual depiction (i.e., informal maps) to formal quantitative simulation models. A systems dynamics framework provides not only a language but also a set of methodological tools that can more easily operationalize existing multidisciplinary scientific evidence and conceptual frameworks on cumulative risks. Thus, we can arrive at more accurate diagnostic tools for children’s’ environmental health inequities that take into consideration the broader social and economic environment in which children live, grow, play, and learn. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7333","Payne-Sturges, Devon C.; Cory-Slechta, Deborah A.; Puett, Robin C.; Thomas, Stephen B.; Hammond, Ross; Hovmand, Peter S.",Environ Health Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7945198/,19

Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is being considered a primary option for the treatment of drug-resistant infections of these types. Methods: We report the successful isolation and characterization of 30 novel, genetically diverse Klebsiella phages. Results: The isolated phages span six different phage families and nine genera, representing both lysogenic and lytic lifestyles. Individual Klebsiella phage isolates infected up to 11 of the 18 Klebsiella capsule types tested, and all 18 capsule-types were infected by at least one of the phages. Conclusions: Of the Klebsiella-infecting phages presented in this study, the lytic phages are most suitable for phage therapy, based on their broad host range, high virulence, short lysis period and given that they encode no known toxin or antimicrobial resistance genes. Phage isolates belonging to the Sugarlandvirus and Slopekvirus genera were deemed most suitable for phage therapy based on our characterization. Importantly, when applied alone, none of the characterized phages were able to suppress the growth of Klebsiella for more than 12 h, likely due to the inherent ease of Klebsiella to generate spontaneous phage-resistant mutants. This indicates that for successful phage therapy, a cocktail of multiple phages would be necessary to treat Klebsiella infections.","Townsend, Eleanor M.; Kelly, Lucy; Gannon, Lucy; Muscatt, George; Dunstan, Rhys; Michniewski, Slawomir; Sapkota, Hari; Kiljunen, Saija J.; Kolsi, Anna; Skurnik, Mikael; Lithgow, Trevor; Millard, Andrew D.; Jameson, Eleanor",Phage (New Rochelle),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8006926/,19

Here we present a promising, environment-friendly alternative to current insecticides that targets the insect tyrosine metabolism pathway. A bloodmeal contains high levels of tyrosine, which is toxic to haematophagous insects if it is not degraded and eliminated. RNA interference (RNAi) of either the first two enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway (tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)) was lethal to tsetse. Furthermore, nitisinone (NTBC), an FDA-approved tyrosine catabolism inhibitor, killed tsetse regardless if the drug was orally or topically applied. However, oral administration of NTBC to bumblebees did not affect their survival.

Animals were allocated to one of three groups: (1) Indirect lung injury only: animals were inoculated by direct injection of Escherichia coli into the kidney parenchyma, provoking systemic inflammation and distributive shock physiology; (2) Direct lung injury only: animals received volutrauma, hyperoxia, and bronchoscope‐delivered gastric particles; (3) Combined indirect and direct lung injury: animals were administered both above‐described indirect and direct lung injury exposures. Animals were monitored for up to 12 h, with serial collection of physiologic data, blood samples, and radiographic imaging. Lung tissue was acquired postmortem for pathological examination. In contrast to indirect lung injury only and direct lung injury only groups, animals in the combined indirect and direct lung injury group exhibited all of the physiological, radiographic, and histopathologic hallmarks of human ARDS: impaired gas exchange (mean PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio 124.8 ± 63.8), diffuse bilateral opacities on chest radiographs, and extensive pathologic evidence of diffuse alveolar damage. Our novel porcine model of ARDS, built on clinically relevant lung injury exposures, faithfully recapitulates the physiologic, radiographic, and histopathologic features of human ARDS and fills a crucial gap in the translational study of human lung injury.","Tiba, Mohamad H.; McCracken, Brendan M.; Leander, Danielle C.; Colmenero, Carmen I.; Nemzek, Jean A.; Sjoding, Michael W.; Konopka, Kristine E.; Flott, Thomas L.; VanEpps, J.

17776,HDV Pathogenesis: Unravelling Ariadne’s Thread,2021-04-28,"Chronic inflammatory disorders are characterised by aberrant and exaggerated inflammatory immune cell responses. Modes of extrinsic cell death, apoptosis and necroptosis, have now been shown to be potent drivers of deleterious inflammation, and mutations in core repressors of these pathways underlie many autoinflammatory disorders. The receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases, RIPK1 and RIPK3, are integral players in extrinsic cell death signalling by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and coordinating the activation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which underpin pathological inflammation in numerous chronic inflammatory disorders. In this review, we firstly give an overview of the inflammatory cell death pathways regulated by RIPK1 and RIPK3. We then discuss how dysregulated signalling along these pathways can contribute to chronic inflammatory disorders of the joints, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, and discuss the emerging evidence for targeting these RIP kinases in the clinic.","Speir, Mary; Djajawi, Tirta M.; Conos, Stephanie A.; Tye, Hazel; Lawlor, Kate E.",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8146010/,19

Developed in the 1930s, the C57BL/6 strain diverged into two major groups in the 1950s, namely, C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N, and more than 20 substrains have been established from them worldwide. We previously reported genetic differences among C57BL/6 substrains in 2009 and 2015. Since then, dozens of reports have been published on phenotypic differences in behavioral, neurological, cardiovascular, and metabolic traits. Substrains need to be chosen according to the purpose of the study because phenotypic differences might affect the experimental results. In this paper, we review recent reports of phenotypic and genetic differences among C57BL/6 substrains, focus our attention on the proper use of C57BL/6 and other inbred strains in the era of genome editing, and provide the life science research community wider knowledge about this subject.","Mekada, Kazuyuki; Yoshiki, Atsushi",Exp Anim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8150240/,19
17943,Conformational epitope matching and prediction based on protein surface spiral features,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the pulmonary ventilation function (PVF) according to different types of rib fractures and pain levels. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with thoracic trauma admitted to our ward from May 1, 2015, to February 1, 2017. Vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured on admission. A numerical rating scale (NRS) was used for pain assessment. RESULTS: A total of 118 (85 males and 33 females) were included. The location of rib fractures did not affect the PVF. When the number of rib fractures was ≥5, the PVF was lower than in those with ≤4 fractures (VC: 0.40 vs. 0.47, P = 0.009; FEV1: 0.37 vs. 0.44, P = 0.012; PEF: 0.17 vs. 0.20, P = 0.031). There were no difference in PVF values between rib fractures with multiple locations and those with non-multiple locations (VC: 0.41 vs. 0.43, P = 0.202; FEV1: 0.37 vs. 0.39, P = 0.692; PEF: 0.18 vs. 0.18, P = 0.684). When there were ≥ 5 breakpoints, the PVF parameters were lower than those with ≤4 breakpoints (VC: 0.40 vs. 0.50, P = 0.030; FEV1: 0.37 vs. 0.45, P = 0.022; PEF: 0.18 vs. 0.20, P = 0.013). When the NRS ≥ 7, the PVF values were lower than for those with NRS ≤ 6 (VC: 0.41 vs. 0.50, P = 0.003; FEV1: 0.37 vs. 0.47, P = 0.040; PEF: 0.18 vs. 0.20, P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: When the total number of fractured ribs is ≥5, there are ≥5 breakpoints, or NRS is ≥7, the VC, FEV1, and PEF are more affected.

One factor associated with these disparities may be differences in symptom burden, which may reduce chemotherapy tolerance and increase early treatment discontinuation. OBJECTIVES: To compare symptom burden by race among women with early-stage breast cancer before starting chemotherapy and quantify symptom differences explained by baseline characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional analysis of symptom burden differences by race among Black and White women with a diagnosis of stage I to III, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who had a symptom report collected before chemotherapy initiation in a large cancer center in the southern region of the US from January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2015. Analyses were conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 31, 2021. Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition was used, adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Four symptom composite scores with a mean (SD) of 50 (10) were reported before starting chemotherapy (baseline) and were derived from symptom items: general physical symptoms (11 items), treatment adverse effects (8 items), acute distress (4 items), and despair (7 items). Patients rated the severity of each symptom they experienced in the past week on a scale of 0 to 10 (where 0 indicates not a problem and 10 indicates as bad as possible). RESULTS: A total of 1338 women (mean [SD] age, 54.6 [11.6] years; 420 Black women [31.4%] and 918 White women [68.6%]) were included in the study. Before starting chemotherapy, Black women reported a statistically significantly higher (ie, worse) symptom composite score than White women for adverse effects (44.5 vs 43.8) but a lower acute distress score (48.5 vs 51.0). Decomposition analyses showed that Black patients’ characteristics were associated with higher symptom burden across all 4 scores. However, these differences were offset by relatively greater, statistically significant, unexplained physical, distress, and despair symptom reporting by White patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, before starting chemotherapy, Black patients with early-stage breast cancer reported significantly higher burden for symptoms that may be exacerbated with chemotherapy and lower distress symptoms compared with White patients. Future studies should explore how symptoms change before and after treatment and differ by racial/ethnic groups and how they are associated with treatment adherence and mortality disparities.","Hu, Xin; Chehal, Puneet K.; Kaplan, Cameron; Krukowski, Rebecca A.; Lan, Roy H.; Stepanski, Edward; Schwartzberg, Lee; Vidal, Gregory; Graetz, Ilana",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8170541/,19

18164,Placental secretome characterization identifies candidates for pregnancy complications,2021-06-08,"Beef and mutton production has been aided by breeding to integrate allelic diversity for myostatin (MSTN), but a lack of diversity in the MSTN germplasm has limited similar advances in pig farming. Moreover, insurmountable challenges with congenital lameness and a dearth of data about the impacts of feed conversion, reproduction, and meat quality in MSTN-edited pigs have also currently blocked progress. Here, in a largest-to-date evaluation of multiple MSTN-edited pig populations, we demonstrated a practical alternative edit-site-based solution that overcomes the major production obstacle of hindlimb weakness. We also provide long-term and multidomain datasets for multiple breeds that illustrate how MSTN-editing can sustainably increase the yields of breed-specific lean meat and the levels of desirable lipids without deleteriously affecting feed-conversion rates or litter size. Apart from establishing a new benchmark for the data scale and quality of genome-edited animal production, our study specifically illustrates how gene-editing site selection profoundly impacts the phenotypic outcomes in diverse genetic backgrounds.

This work aims to determine significant differences in the risk perception between Mexican American migrants and first-generation Mexican American construction workers. This study used a sample of 112 construction workers. A guided questionnaire was applied to collect socio-demographic information. For workplace risk behaviors, we used a 21-item questionnaire adapted from the previous instrument. Each question asked the participant’s perception of the frequency with which they carried out risky activities during routine work activities and the severity of the possible injuries, using a five-level Likert scale. Then, an inferential analysis was carried out using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The main results highlight that time of residence in the United States had a significant influence (p = 0.012) on risk perception in the surveyed construction workers. On the other hand, the age and time they have been working for the organization did not significantly influence risk perception. Finally, risk perception can vary in construction workers according to different variables. It is essential to investigate the factors that influence it, to prevent risky behaviors that can lead to accidents.","Ibarra-Mejía, Gabriel; Gómez-Bull, Karla Gabriela; Vargas-Salgado, María Marisela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199043/,19

18915,"Genome Wide Prediction, Mapping and Development of Genomic Resources of Mastitis Associated Genes in Water Buffalo",2021-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is the causative agent of chytridiomycosis, one of the major causes of worldwide amphibian biodiversity loss. Many amphibians exhibit skin-based chemical defences, which may play an important role against invading pathogens, but whether the synthesis of these chemical compounds is enhanced or suppressed in the presence of pathogens is largely unknown. Here we investigated direct and indirect effects of larval exposure to the globally distributed and highly virulent Bd-GPL strain on skin secreted chemical defences and life history traits during early ontogeny of agile frogs (Rana dalmatina) and common toads (Bufo bufo). RESULTS: Exposure to Bd during the larval stage did not result in enhanced synthesis of the antimicrobial peptide Brevinin-1 Da in R. dalmatina tadpoles or in increased production of bufadienolides in B. bufo tadpoles. However, exposure to Bd during the larval stage had a carry-over effect reaching beyond metamorphosis: both R. dalmatina and B. bufo froglets contained smaller quantities of defensive chemicals than their Bd-naïve conspecifics in the control treatment. Prevalence of Bd and infection intensities were very low in both larvae and metamorphs of R. dalmatina, while in B. bufo we observed high Bd prevalence and infection intensities, especially in metamorphs. At the same time, we did not find a significant effect of Bd-exposure on body mass or development rate in larvae or metamorphs in either species. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of detrimental effect of Bd-exposure on life history traits, even parallel with high infection intensities in the case of B. bufo individuals, is surprising and suggests high tolerance of local populations of these two species against Bd. However, the lowered quantity of defensive chemicals may compromise antimicrobial and antipredatory defences of froglets, which may ultimately contribute to population declines also in the absence of conspicuous mass-mortality events.","Ujszegi, János; Ludányi, Krisztina; Móricz, Ágnes M.; Krüzselyi, Dániel; Drahos, László; Drexler, Tamás; Németh, Márk Z.; Vörös, Judit; Garner, Trenton W.

We hypothesized that increasing and maintaining plasma sodium between 145 and 150 mmol/l in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS would be safe and will reduce lung injury. This was a prospective randomized feasibility study in moderate-to-severe ARDS, comparing standard care with intravenous hypertonic saline to achieve and maintain plasma sodium between 145 and 150 mmol/l for 7 days (HTS group). Both groups of patients were managed with lung protective ventilation and conservative fluid management. The primary outcome was 1-point reduction in lung injury score (LIS) or successful extubation by day 7. RESULTS: Forty patients were randomized with 20 in each group. Baseline characteristics of severity of illness were well balanced. Patients in the HTS group had higher plasma sodium levels during the first 7 days after randomization when compared with the control group (p = 0.04). Seventy five percent (15/20) of patients in the HTS group were extubated or had ≥ 1-point reduction in LIS compared with 35% (7/20) in the control group (p = 0.02). There was also a decrease in length of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay in the HTS group. CONCLUSION: We have shown clinical improvement in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS following induced hypernatremia, suggesting that administration of hypertonic saline is a safe and feasible intervention in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.

The effect of serum lipid levels on TB treatment (ATT) outcomes and their association with serum inflammatory markers have not yet been characterized. Methods: Our retrospective cohort study on drug-susceptible TB patients, at the National Taiwan University Hospital, assessed the association of baseline serum lipid levels such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) with all-cause and infection-related mortality during first 9 months of ATT and baseline inflammatory markers namely C-reactive protein (CRP), total leukocyte count (WBC), and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NL ratio). Results: Among 514 patients, 129 (26.6%) died due to any-cause and 72 (14.0%) died of infection. Multivariable Cox-regression showed a lower adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause mortality in the 3rd tertiles of HDL (aHR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07–0.44) and TC (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.65), and lower infection-related mortality in the 3rd tertile of HDL (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14–0.65) and TC (aHR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14–0.65) compared to the 1st tertile. The 3rd tertiles of LDL and TG showed no association in multivariable analysis. Similarly, 3rd tertiles of HDL and TC had lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers such as CRP, WBC, and NL ratio using linear regression analysis. Body mass index (BMI) did not show evidence of confounding or effect modification. Conclusions: Higher baseline serum cholesterol levels were associated with lower hazards of all-cause and infection-related mortality and lower levels of inflammatory markers in TB patients. BMI did not modify or confound this association.","Chidambaram, Vignesh; Zhou, Lucas; Ruelas Castillo, Jennie; Kumar, Amudha; Ayeh, Samuel K.; Gupte, Akshay; Wang, Jann-Yuan; Karakousis, Petros C.",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8257940/,19

The composition of the lung microbiota has been shown to be predictive of clinical outcome in critically ill patients. However, the dynamics of the lung and gut microbiota composition over time during severe pneumonia remains ill defined. We used a mouse model of pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in order to follow the pathogen burden as well as the composition of the lung, tongue and fecal microbiota from local infection towards systemic spread. RESULTS: Already at 6 h post-inoculation with K. pneumoniae, marked changes in the lung microbiota were seen. The alpha diversity of the lung microbiota did not change throughout the infection, whereas the beta diversity did. A shift between the prominent lung microbiota members of Streptococcus and Klebsiella was seen from 12 h onwards and was most pronounced at 18 h post-inoculation (PI) which was also reflected in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicating severe pulmonary inflammation. Around 18 h PI, K. pneumoniae bacteremia was observed together with a systemic inflammatory response. The composition of the tongue microbiota was not affected during infection, even at 18–30 h PI when K. pneumoniae had become the dominant bacterium in the lung. Moreover, we observed differences in the gut microbiota during pulmonary infection. The gut microbiota contributed to the lung microbiota at 12 h PI, however, this decreased at a later stage of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: At 18 h PI, K. pneumoniae was the dominant member in the lung microbiota. The lung microbiota profiles were significantly explained by the lung K. pneumoniae bacterial counts and Klebsiella and Streptococcus were correlating with the measured cytokine levels in the lung and/or blood. The oral microbiota in mice, however, was not influenced by the severity of murine pneumonia, whereas the gut microbiota was affected.

In order to identify gene(s) involved in this complex disorder, we performed a genome-wide search in a selected sample of 31 patients with primary VUR from eight families originating from southern Italy. Sixteen additional families with 41 patients were included in a second stage. Nonparametric, affected-only linkage analysis identified four genomic areas on chromosomes 1, 3, and 4 (p < 0.05); the best result corresponded to the D3S3681-D3S1569 interval on chromosome 3 (nonparametric linkage score, NPL = 2.75, p = 0.008). This region was then saturated with 26 additional markers, tested in the complete group of 72 patients from 24 families (NPL = 2.01, p = 0.01). We identified a genomic area on 3q22.2–23, where 26 patients from six multiplex families shared overlapping haplotypes. However, we did not find evidence for a common ancestral haplotype.

However, the effect of chronic calcium changes and different vitamin D doses on these PTH measurements remains to be defined. In this study, 60 pediatric dialysis patients, aged 13.9 ± 0.7 years, with secondary hyperparathyroidism were randomized to 8 months of therapy with oral vitamin D combined with either calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) or sevelamer. Serum phosphorus levels did not differ between groups. Serum calcium levels rose from 9.3 ± 0.1 to 9.7 ± 0.1 mg/dl during CaCO(3) therapy (p < 0.01 from baseline) but remained unchanged during sevelamer therapy. In the CaCO(3) and sevelamer groups, baseline serum PTH levels (1st PTH-IMA; Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Clemente, CA) were 964 ± 75 and 932 ± 89 pg/ml, and levels declined to 491 ± 55 and 543 ± 59 pg/ml, respectively (nonsignificant between groups). Patients treated with sevelamer received higher doses of vitamin D than those treated with CaCO(3). The PTH values obtained by first- and second-generation PTH-IMAs correlated closely throughout therapy and the response of PTH was similar to both PTH-IMAs, despite differences in serum calcium levels.","Wesseling-Perry, Katherine; Harkins, G.

Identifying effective recruitment and retention strategies among minority groups and their subpopulations is an important research agenda. Web-based intervention approaches are becoming increasingly popular with the ubiquitous use of the internet. However, it is not completely clear which recruitment and retention strategies have been successful in web-based intervention trials targeting racial and ethnic minorities. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe lessons learned in recruiting and retaining one of the understudied ethnic minority women—Korean Americans—enrolled in a web-based intervention trial and to compare our findings with the strategies reported in relevant published web-based intervention trials. METHODS: Multiple sources of data were used to address the objectives of this study, including the study team’s meeting minutes, participant tracking and contact logs, survey reports, and postintervention interviews. In addition, an electronic search involving 2 databases (PubMed and CINAHL) was performed to identify published studies using web-based interventions. Qualitative analysis was then performed to identify common themes addressing recruitment and retention strategies across the trials using web-based intervention modalities. RESULTS: A total of 9 categories of recruitment and retention strategies emerged: authentic care; accommodation of time, place, and transportation; financial incentives; diversity among the study team; multiple, yet standardized modes of communication; mobilizing existing community relationships with efforts to build trust; prioritizing features of web-based intervention; combined use of web-based and direct recruitment; and self-directed web-based intervention with human support. Although all the studies included in the analysis combined multiple strategies, prioritizing features of web-based intervention or use of human support were particularly relevant for promoting recruitment and retention of racial and ethnic minorities in web-based intervention trials. CONCLUSIONS: The growing prevalence of internet use among racial and ethnic minority populations represents an excellent opportunity to design and deliver intervention programs via the internet.

20573,Interplay of diverse adjuvants and nanoparticle presentation of native-like HIV-1 envelope trimers,2021-08-17,"The ubiquitin–proteasome system is responsible for the degradation of proteins and plays a critical role in key cellular processes. While the constitutive proteasome (cPS) is expressed in all eukaryotic cells, the immunoproteasome (iPS) is primarily induced during disease processes, and its inhibition is beneficial in the treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Oxathiazolones were reported to selectively inhibit iPS over cPS, and the inhibitory activity of several oxathiazolones against iPS was experimentally determined. However, the detailed mechanism of the chemical reaction leading to irreversible iPS inhibition and the key selectivity drivers are unknown, and separate characterization of the noncovalent and covalent inhibition steps is not available for several compounds. Here, we investigate the chemical reaction between oxathiazolones and the Thr1 residue of iPS by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to establish a plausible reaction mechanism and to determine the rate-determining step of covalent complex formation. The modelled binding mode and reaction mechanism are in line with the selective inhibition of iPS versus cPS by oxathiazolones. The k(inact) value of several ligands was estimated by constructing the potential of mean force of the rate-determining step by QM/MM simulations coupled with umbrella sampling. The equilibrium constant K(i) of the noncovalent complex formation was evaluated by classical force field-based thermodynamic integration. The calculated K(i) and k(inact) values made it possible to analyse the contribution of the noncovalent and covalent steps to the overall inhibitory activity. Compounds with similar intrinsic reactivities exhibit varying selectivities for iPS versus cPS owing to subtle differences in the binding modes that slightly affect K(i), the noncovalent affinity, and importantly alter k(inact), the covalent reactivity of the bound compounds. A detailed understanding of the inhibitory mechanism of oxathiazolones is useful in designing iPS selective inhibitors with improved drug-like properties.","Mihalovits, Levente M.; Ferenczy, György G.; Keserű, György M.",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379283/,19

We detected AF with pulse rate variability (PRV) parameters using a blood pressure device (BP+; Uscom, Sydney, Australia) and with a Kardia Mobile Cardiac Monitor (KMCM; AliveCor, Mountain View, CA). In 421 primary care patients (mean (range) age: 72 (31–99) years), we diagnosed AF (n = 133) from 12-lead electrocardiogram recordings, and performed PRV and KMCM measurements. PRV parameters detected AF with area under curve (AUC) values of up to 0.92. Using the mean of two sequential readings increased AUC to up to 0.94 and improved positive predictive value at a given sensitivity (by up to 18%). The KMCM detected AF with 83% sensitivity and 68% specificity. 89 KMCM recordings were “unclassified” or blank, and PRV detected AF in these with AUC values of up to 0.88. When non-AF arrhythmias (n = 56) were excluded, the KMCM device had increased specificity (73%) and PRV had higher discrimination performance (maximum AUC = 0.96). In decision curve analysis, all PRV parameters consistently achieved a positive net benefit across the range of clinical thresholds. In primary care, AF can be detected by PRV accurately and by KMCM, especially in the absence of non-AF arrhythmias or when combinations of measurements are used.","Sluyter, John D.; Scragg, Robert; ‘Ofanoa, Malakai; Stewart, Ralph A.

College students (n = 498) self-reported their general and source-specific stress mindsets, perceived distress, health, coping, and GPA. Stress mindsets varied as a function of duration and controllability, and general stress mindsets were only weakly associated with source-specific mindsets. Consistent with previous research, general stress mindsets were associated with health, but some source-specific mindsets were more predictive of health than others—viewing stress from chronic controllable sources as debilitating was most predictive of poor mental and physical health. Measures of stress were also associated with health, and this association was moderated by stress mindsets, suggesting that viewing stress as enhancing can provide a psychological “buffer” against the negative effects of stress. Approach coping and perceived distress were examined as potential mediators of the links between stress mindset and health. Viewing stress as enhancing was related to greater use of approach coping and lower perceived distress, which in turn was related to better health. This research suggests that stress mindset interventions may benefit students’ health, and that interventions targeting mindsets for chronic controllable sources of stress may be more effective than general stress mindset interventions.","Jenkins, Anna; Weeks, Molly S.; Hard, Bridgette Martin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8425538/,19
21121,Mechanism Underlying the Role of LuxR Family Transcriptional Regulator abaR in Biofilm Formation by Acinetobacter baumannii,2021-09-14,"The worldwide development of twin cohorts began after World War II. These cohorts now include around 1.5 million twins, and more than 2748 twin studies have been published between 1950 and 2012. Each year, the number of twin publications increases by another 500 to 1000. The underrepresentation of German twin studies cannot be solely explained by the abuse of medical research under National Socialism. Developing and expanding large twin cohorts is a challenge in terms of both ethics and data protection. However, twin cohorts enable long-term and real-time research on many medical issues and contribute to answer the question of predisposition or environment as possible disease triggers – even after the sequencing of the human genome. There are currently two German twin cohorts: the biomedical cohort HealthTwiSt, with around 1500 pairs of twins, and TwinLife, a sociological–psychological cohort with around 4000 pairs of twins. There are also disease-specific cohorts. The TwinHealth Consortium in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Tübingen was established in 2016 with the aim of enabling open-ended and sustainable twin research in Tübingen to answer various scientific questions. With the help of systematic literature research and medical history, this article gives an overview of the worldwide development of twin studies and databases over the last 100 years. The example of the Tübingen TwinHealth Initiative illuminates the structure of a twin cohort and its legal, ethical, and data protection aspects.","Enck, Paul; Goebel-Stengel, Miriam; Rieß, Olaf; Hübener-Schmid, Jeannette; Kagan, Karl Oliver; Nieß, Andreas Michael; Tümmers, Henning; Wiesing, Urban; Zipfel, Stephan; Stengel, Andreas",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441034/,19
21321,A switch-on molecular biosensor for detection of caspase-3 and imaging of apoptosis of cells,2021-09-09,"C-reactive protein (CRP) was first recognized in the 1940s as a protein that appeared in blood during acute episodes of infectious disease. Its presence and pharmacodynamics were found in essentially all diseases that involved tissue damage and inflammation. Identified as a major component of the innate, unlearned immunity, it became a useful diagnostic marker for the extent of inflammation during disease exacerbation or remission. Efforts to define its true biological role has eluded clear definition for over a half-century. Herein, a unifying concept is presented that explains both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities of CRP. This concept involves the recognition and understanding that CRP can be induced to undergo a pronounced, non-proteolytic reorganization of its higher-level protein structures into conformationally distinct isomers with distinctive functional activities. This process occurs when the non-covalently associated globular subunits of the pentameric isoform (“pCRP”) are induced to dissociate into a monomeric isoform (“mCRP”). mCRP consistently and potently provides pro-inflammatory activation and amplification activities. pCRP provides weak anti-inflammatory activities consistent with low-level chronic inflammation. mCRP can spontaneously form in purified pCRP reagents in ways that are not immediately recognized during purification and certification analyses. By now understanding the factors that influence pCRP dissociate into mCRP, many published reports investigating CRP as a biological response modifier of host defense can be reevaluated to include a discussion of how each CRP isoform may have affected the generated results. Specific attention is given to in vitro and in vivo studies of CRP as an anti-cancer agent.","Potempa, Lawrence A.; Rajab, Ibraheem M.; Olson, Margaret E.; Hart, Peter C.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8450391/,19
21517,Immune parameters in two different laying hen strains during five production periods,2021-07-24,"States of oral health and disease reflect the compositional and functional capacities of, as well as the interspecies interactions within, the oral microbiota. The oral cavity exists as a highly dynamic microbial environment that harbors many distinct substrata and microenvironments that house diverse microbial communities. Specific to the oral cavity, the nonshedding dental surfaces facilitate the development of highly complex polymicrobial biofilm communities, characterized not only by the distinct microbes comprising them, but cumulatively by their activities. Adding to this complexity, the oral cavity faces near‐constant environmental challenges, including those from host diet, salivary flow, masticatory forces, and introduction of exogenous microbes. The composition of the oral microbiome is shaped throughout life by factors including host genetics, maternal transmission, as well as environmental factors, such as dietary habits, oral hygiene practice, medications, and systemic factors. This dynamic ecosystem presents opportunities for oral microbial dysbiosis and the development of dental and periodontal diseases. The application of both in vitro and culture‐independent approaches has broadened the mechanistic understandings of complex polymicrobial communities within the oral cavity, as well as the environmental, local, and systemic underpinnings that influence the dynamics of the oral microbiome. Here, we review the present knowledge and current understanding of microbial communities within the oral cavity and the influences and challenges upon this system that encourage homeostasis or provoke microbiome perturbation, and thus contribute to states of oral health or disease.","Sedghi, Lea; DiMassa, Vincent; Harrington, Anthony; Lynch, Susan V.; Kapila, Yvonne L.",Periodontol 2000,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457218/,19
21721,Comparative Analysis of Novel Strains of Porcine Astrovirus Type 3 in the USA,2021-09-17,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In order to face the challenges posed by climate change, scientific research should be directed towards global needs while also keeping into account the need for increased plant productivity. In this sense, our scientific group from the Biocontrol Research Laboratory BIOREN (Temuco, Chile) and our collaborators, have been studying the enormous potential to enhance productivity by using suppressive soils. In this review, we highlight soil-suppressive microbiota as a natural source of biocontrol agents and we propose a strategy to create microbial assemblages, where the plant selects its own inoculants (when plants “cry for help”). This approach is based on the selection of specific taxa during the transition from a conducive to a suppressive soil. We hope that this strategy leads to generation of personalized bioinoculants to counteract the effects of climate change and increase agricultural sustainability. ABSTRACT: Crop migration caused by climatic events has favored the emergence of new soilborne diseases, resulting in the colonization of new niches (emerging infectious diseases, EIDs). Soilborne pathogens are extremely persistent in the environment. This is in large part due to their ability to reside in the soil for a long time, even without a host plant, using survival several strategies. In this regard, disease-suppressive soils, characterized by a low disease incidence due to the presence of antagonist microorganisms, can be an excellent opportunity for the study mechanisms of soil-induced immunity, which can be applied in the development of a new generation of bioinoculants. Therefore, here we review the main effects of climate change on crops and pathogens, as well as the potential use of soil-suppressive microbiota as a natural source of biocontrol agents. Based on results of previous studies, we also propose a strategy for the optimization of microbiota assemblages, selected using a host-mediated approach. This process involves an increase in and prevalence of specific taxa during the transition from a conducive to a suppressive soil. This strategy could be used as a model to engineer microbiota assemblages for pathogen suppression, as well as for the reduction of abiotic stresses created due to global climate change.","Durán, Paola; Tortella, Gonzalo; Sadowsky, Michael J.; Viscardi, Sharon; Barra, Patricio Javier; Mora, Maria de la Luz",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8472835/,19
21747,Establishment of a Suspension MDBK Cell Line in Serum-Free Medium for Production of Bovine Alphaherpesvirus-1,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND: Rural women are highly prevalent to depression, where spouse-related factors, including extramarital affairs and poverty, intensify its likelihood of occurrence. However, women engaged with a Money-Saving Group (MSG) are financially self-dependent, which can reduce the risk of depression suffering. Despite this, there is less study among this cohort, which led us to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of depression among the Ugandan women involved in MSG. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in Uganda among rural married or cohabiting women aged 18 to 45 years engaged in MSG. The survey was carried out within a total of 153 participants (33.3 ± 6.7 years) in April 2021. Information related to socio-demographic of the participants, their spouse characteristics, and depression were collected. RESULTS: About 65.4% of the participants had depressive symptoms (based on the cutoff 10/27 at the PHQ-9). But, 8.15 times (CI: 2.83–23.44, p<0.001) and 16.69 times (CI: 4.85–57.39, p<0.001), higher risk of depression were observed, if the participants’ spouses were using an addictive substance and had been involved in an extramarital relationship, respectively. Similarly, there was an increased likelihood of depression when the participant or spouse was unemployed. CONCLUSION: This study observed a higher prevalence of depression, which suggests paying attention to this cohort. Thus, there should be routine screening for depression among married women involved in MSG at lower-level health facilities in rural settings, especially those with spouses engaged in substance use, having an extramarital relationship, and being unemployed.","Kaggwa, Mark Mohan; Namatanzi, Brendah; Kule, Moses; Nkola, Rahel; Najjuka, Sarah Maria; al Mamun, Firoj; Hosen, Ismail; Mamun, Mohammed A; Ashaba, Scholastic",Int J Womens Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8473717/,19

However, there are serious difficulties in doing in vitro manipulations of hamster embryos, because they are very sensitive to various environmental factors. Thus, biotechnological researches of hamster embryos should be performed with high‐level skills of embryo manipulations. METHODS: The authors summarized the history of hamster intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and introduced key points for hamster ICSI, which were found in our previous studies on the production of embryos by ICSI and offspring by embryo transfer. MAIN FINDINGS: The key points for hamster ICSI were in vitro manipulations under the light‐controlled environment, injection of acrosome‐less sperm heads into oocytes as soon as possible before spontaneous oocyte activation occurs, and determination of the optimal culture conditions. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, there are no available reports on production of offspring from ICSI embryos in hamsters except our reports. Moreover, success rates of hamster ICSI remain very low. For the purpose of spreading hamster ICSI, it is necessary to make further researches to improve manipulation techniques and to resolve experimental problems.","Morishita, Nami; Ochi, Masanori; Horiuchi, Toshitaka",Reprod Med Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499600/,19

Ps. aeruginosa specific-phage were present in sputum at concentrations ranging between 10(3) to 10(7) viable particles/ml with as many as 4 different phage strains recovered from a single individual. Of the 16 phage isolates, at least 12 different phage strains could be identified based on bacterial host sensitivity and electron microscopic morphology.

In particular, we develop a mathematical model of the probability of such an outbreak in terms of the number of species hunted, the number of susceptibles, and the rate of contact. Hence, we postulate that local biodiversity loss and increasing rates of animal trafficking, and trade and transportation of animals to large cities—where there is a greater potential for person-to-person transmission—may increase the probability of such outbreaks dramatically.","Swift, Louise; Hunter, Paul R.; Lees, Alexander C.; Bell, Diana J.",Ecohealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087654/,19

23849,Pleiomorphic viruses revealed by cryo tomography: the structure of coronaviruses,2008,"The Golgi apparatus is the major site of protein, lipid and proteoglycan glycosylation. The glycosylation enzymes, as well as kinases and sulfatases that catalyze phosphorylation and sulfation, are localized within the Golgi cisternae in characteristic distributions that frequently reflect their order in a particular pathway (Kornfeld and Kornfeld 1985; Colley 1997). The glycosyl-transferases, sulfotransferases and kinases are “transferases” that require activated donor molecules for the reactions they catalyze. For eukaryotic, fungal and protozoan glycosyltransferases these are the nucleotide sugars UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), GDP-fucose (GDP-Fuc), CMP-sialicacid (CMP-Sia), UDP-glucuronicacid (UDP-GlcA), GDP-mannose (GDP-Man), and UDP-xylose (UDP-Xyl) (Hirschberg et al. 1998). For the kinases, ATP functions as the donor, while for the sulfotransferases, adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphate (PAPS) acts as the donor (Hirschberg et al. 1998). The active sites of all these enzymes are oriented towards the lumen of the Golgi cisternae. This necessitates the translocation of their donors from the cytosol into the lumenal Golgi compartments. In this chapter we will focus on the structure, function and localization of the Golgi nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs), and highlight the diseases and developmental defects associated with defective transporters. We direct the reader to several excellent reviews on Golgi transporters for additional details and references (Hirschberg et al. 1998; Berninsone and Hirschberg 2000; Gerardy-Schahn et al. 2001; Handford et al. 2006; Caffaro and Hirschberg 2006).","Zhao, Weihan; Colley, Karen J.",The Golgi Apparatus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119966/,19

On the other hand, Agent-based model or Individual-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person in the computer. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epstein’s model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which has not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread. In addition, a health policy game against a new type of infectious disease is designed as a serious game.","Kurahashi, Setsuya; Terano, Takao",Agent and Multi-Agent Systems: Technologies and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120138/,19

Rapid detection, differentiation, and quantitation of TCoV are critical to the diagnosis and control of the disease. A specific one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using TCoV-specific primers and dual-labeled fluorescent probe for detection and quantitation of TCoV in feces and intestine tissues is described in this chapter. The fluorogenic probe labeled with a reporter dye (FAM, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) and a quencher dye (Absolute Quencher™) was designed to bind to a 186 base-pair fragment flanked by the two PCR primers targeting the 3′ end of spike gene (S2) of TCoV. The assay is highly specific and sensitive and can quantitate between 10(2) and 10(10) copies/mL of viral genome. It is useful in monitoring the progression of TCoV-induced atrophic enteritis in the turkey flocks.","Chen, Yi-Ning; Wu, Ching Ching; Lin, Tsang Long",Animal Coronaviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120390/,19

Globally relevant risks include trans-boundary risks, i.e. those that originate in one country and affect other countries (such as air pollution), international risks, i.e. those that originate in many countries simultaneously and lead to global impacts (such as carbon dioxide emissions for climate change) and ubiquitous risks, i.e. those that occur in each country in similar forms and may necessitate a co-ordinated international response (such as car accidents or airline safety). To this end the document and the framework it describes provide a common analytic structure for investigating and supporting the treatment of risk issues by the relevant actors in society. In doing so, the focus is not restricted to how governmental or supranational authorities deal with risk but equal importance is given to the roles of the corporate sector, science, other stakeholders as well as civil society — and their interplay. The analytic structure will, it is hoped, facilitate terminological and conceptual clarity, consistency and transparency in the daily operations of IRGC and assure the feasibility of comparative approaches in the governance of risks across a broad range of hazardous events and activities. In particular, this document is meant to assist members of IRGC in their tasks to provide scientifically sound, economically feasible, legally and ethically justifiable and politically acceptable advice to IRGC's targeted audiences.

24601,The Origin and Evolution of Viruses,2008,"Asthma is worldwide at pandemic levels for the past 30 years but is increasing at a greater rate in more affluent societies. It is a heterogeneous disorder caused by interaction between genetic predisposition, atopy, and environmental factors, including allergens, air pollution, and respiratory infections. The pathological aspects and pathophysiological mechanisms are reviewed in this chapter. Allergens or infectious agents may stimulate Th-2 inflammation which causes activation of IL-13, eosinophils, and increase IgE levels, subsequently leading to bronchial smooth muscle hypercontraction. Respiratory viral infections are well-known causes of precipitation of acute asthma exacerbations in 50–60 % of attacks. There is also increasing evidence that bacterial infections, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, may contribute to the onset and course of asthma. The two main hypothesis of microbial genesis of asthma that has arisen in the past 20–30 years appears to be incongruous, but are not, are the hygiene hypothesis of asthma, and the virus-related asthma, early onset of viral bronchiolitis in the susceptible hosts being responsible for later development of asthma. The clinical and experimental evidences to support these contentions are reviewed and critiqued.","Fong, I.

Risk is latent until an external event or an internal process will reveal its existence. Predictive analysis is an indispensable tool that can help decision makers preemptively test all possible or even some perceived impossible operational scenarios before a risk transforms into crisis or disaster. To be prepared is a better position than to discover the risk too late for business continuity or disaster recovery measures.

The concentration of cases in previously healthy staff and the proportion of patients requiring intensive care are particularly alarming.

Leukocytes modulate inflammation through production of secretory mediators, like cytokines and chemokines, which work in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. These mediators can either promote or attenuate the inflammatory response and depending on differential temporal and spatial expression play a crucial role in the outcome of infection. Even though the objective is clearance of the pathogen with minimum damage to host, the pathogenesis of multiple human pathogenic viruses has been suggested to emanate from a dysregulation of the inflammatory response, sometimes with fatal consequences. This review discusses the nature and the outcome of inflammatory response, which is triggered in the human host subsequent to infection by single-sense plus-strand RNA viruses. In view of such harmful effects of a dysregulated inflammatory response, an exogenous regulation of these reactions by either interference or supplementation of critical regulators has been suggested. Currently multiple such factors are being tested for their beneficial and adverse effects. A successful use of such an approach in diseases of viral etiology can potentially protect the affected individual without directly affecting the virus life cycle. Further, such approaches whenever applicable would be useful in mitigating death and/or debility that is caused by the infection of those viruses which have proven particularly difficult to control by either prophylactic vaccines and/or therapeutic strategies using specific antiviral drugs.","Bhattacharyya, Sankar",Dynamics of Immune Activation in Viral Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121364/,19

Most risk assessments in food and environmental virology performed in the last decade have focused on water, fresh produce, molluscan shellfish, and prepared foods. Recent examples of enteric virus risk modeling efforts are discussed in detail, as are several of the difficulties and intricacies of performing risk assessments for foodborne viruses compared to bacteria and other agents.

25248,Five Years of Increasing Structural Biology Throughput - A Retrospective Analysis,2007,"We propose a mining framework that supports the identification of useful patterns based on incremental data clustering. Given the popularity of Web news services, we focus our attention on news streams mining. News articles are retrieved from Web news services, and processed by data mining tools to produce useful higher-level knowledge, which is stored in a content description database. Instead of interacting with a Web news service directly, by exploiting the knowledge in the database, an information delivery agent can present an answer in response to a user request. A key challenging issue within news repository management is the high rate of document insertion. To address this problem, we present a sophisticated incremental hierarchical document clustering algorithm using a neighborhood search. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is the ability to identify meaningful patterns (e.g., news events, and news topics) while reducing the amount of computations by maintaining cluster structure incrementally. In addition, to overcome the lack of topical relations in conceptual ontologies, we propose a topic ontology learning framework that utilizes the obtained document hierarchy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm produces high-quality clusters, and a topic ontology provides interpretations of news topics at different levels of abstraction.","Chung, Seokkyung; McLeod, Dennis",Journal on Data Semantics II,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121790/,19

Ignorance arguments abound in our everyday thinking such as when we conclude that a train does not stop in York because York is not listed in the timetable. These arguments also tend to be the first line of defence when the safety of food or prescribed medications is called into question. The statement ‘There is no evidence that beef is unsafe’, which is a premise in an ignorance argument, was used so extensively by health officials and government ministers during the BSE epidemic in the UK that it came to be called the mantra of the BSE affair by the public inquiry into the epidemic. A similar ignorance premise is often used to frame the conclusion of systematic reviews into the effectiveness of a particular medical or health intervention.

In the final analysis the technological upgrading of industries and services, including resource-based and niche-oriented ones, will remain the most plausible way to continue catching up with the advanced economies and to stay competitive vis-à-vis emerging rivals. However, just as past development trajectories had been shaped by domestic socio-political configurations and the international/regional environment, so future prospects for these countries depend on how well they adapt to the fluid conditions of global competition and the uncertain state of global markets.

Critical thinking is considered an increasingly important 21st century work place skill. This paper investigates the potential value of using critical thinking in assessing the credibility of online information. The paper commences with an overview of existing approaches for assessing the credibility of online information. It then argues that the presence of a well-developed argument in online information to be an indication of credibility. Critical thinking also helps to evaluate the credibility of evidence. These thinking skills can be developed through training. It is shown how a group of first year Information Systems students were able to more critically engage with the content of online news after a course on critical thinking. This paper contributes to the literature on the assessment of the credibility of online information.","van Zyl, Albie; Turpin, Marita; Matthee, Machdel","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134292/,19

29146,EYE INFECTIONS,2004-06-17,"It is increasingly evident that China has attached more attention to discursive power in foreign policy since the early 21st century. Both top leaders and government agencies have been active in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions. Previously, China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs, and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s. The situation has changed since 2009 because of China’s rapid rise to become the world’s second largest economy. With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese government’s support for discursive power, the dominant explanation is based on the “rise of China” argument. However, this argument does not explain the causal relationship between China’s rise and its discursive power strategy. So, this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind China’s discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars. It concludes that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921. Since China’s adoption of an opening-up policy in 1978, this tradition has been suppressed but not eliminated entirely by top leaders. As China continues to rise on the world stage, the principle will drive China to create a new political model rather than be a mere follower of the established political order.","Zhao, Kejin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149126/,19

30118,Human and Animal Viruses,2007-09-02,"The bases of our current knowledge on the physiology of the hepatic portal system are largely owed to the work of three pioneering vascular researchers from the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries: A. Vesalius, W. Harvey, and F. Glisson. Vesalius is referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy, and in his influential book, De humani corporis fabrica libri septem, he elaborated the first anatomical atlas of the hepatic portal venous system (Vesalius 2013). Sir William Harvey laid the foundations of modern cardiovascular research with his Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus (Harvey 1931) in which he established the nature of blood circulation. Finally, F. Glisson characterized the gastrointestinal-hepatic vascular system (Child 1955). These physiological descriptions were later complemented with clinical observations. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Morgagni, Puckelt, Cruveilhier, and Osler were the first to make the connection between common hepatic complications – ascites, splenomegaly, and gastrointestinal bleeding – and obstruction of the portal system (Sandblom 1993). These were the foundations that allowed Gilbert, Villaret, and Thompson to establish an early definition of portal hypertension at the beginning of the twentieth century. In this period, Thompson performed the first direct measurement of portal pressure by laparotomy in some patients (Gilbert and Villaret 1906; Thompson et al. 1937). Considering all these milestones, and paraphrasing Sir Isaac Newton, if hepatologists have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Nowadays, our understanding of the pathogenesis of portal hypertension has largely improved thanks to the progress in preclinical and clinical research. However, this field is ever-changing and hepatologists are continually identifying novel pathological mechanisms and developing new therapeutic strategies for this clinical condition. Hence, the aim of this chapter is to summarize the current knowledge about this clinical condition.","Morales-Ruiz, Manuel; Rodríguez-Vita, Juan; Ribera, Jordi; Jiménez, Wladimiro",PanVascular Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153457/,19

The hypothesis examined in this study is that the transcription factor BCL‐6 is critically important not only for regulating B‐cell growth and development but also for mammary epithelial apoptosis. Methodology: Twenty breast cancer cases and 31 healthy controls were used to investigate whether BCL‐6 protein in involved in breast cancer (grade III). Full length BCL‐6 cDNA was retrovirally transduced into EpH‐4 cell line. We then used flow cytometry of BrdUrd‐stained cells to investigate the cell‐cycle duration of the control and transduced cell lines. TUNEL was used as a marker of apoptosis to find out differences in the frequencies of apoptotic cells in the control and transduced cell lines. Finally, immunohistochemistry staining was performed to detect BCL‐6 in breast cancer (III). Results: Restoration of BCL‐6 into EpH‐4 cells not only inhibits apoptosis but also prolongs the cell cycle and results in increased cell size and protein content. The results also indicated that the cell‐cycle time of BCL‐6‐transduced EpH‐4 cells is prolonged by about 3 h, presumably as a result of the action of BCL‐6 at the BCL‐6 at the G1/S transition. We found differences in the frequencies of viable and apoptotic cells in cultures of the parent EpH‐4 cells, control‐transduced EpH‐4 cells and BCL‐6‐transduced EpH‐4 cells. Consistently, we demonstrated that BCL‐6 is expressed in 90% of high grade of breast carcinoma, which is considered as the most aggressive of tumours. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest that BCL‐6 is likely to be involved in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis.","Alenzi, F. Q.

Immunological responses to malignant transformation of epithelial cells gained increasing interest recently. A former study could demonstrate binding of MBL to certain colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell lines in vitro. We therefore examined the expression of human collectins in normal colon mucosa and in colorectal carcinomas. Materials and methods: Colon samples from 20 CRC patients and 10 normal mucosa samples were collected immediately after surgery. The tissue was microdissected and RNA isolated (Qiagen, Rneasy‐Kit). Gene expression profiles were analysed using Gene‐chips (Affymetrix, HG‐U133). We analysed the data for the expression of MBL, its associated serine proteases mannan‐binding lectin‐associated serine protease 1/2 (MASP 1/2), SP‐A and SP‐D. The signal intensity of the genes of interest was compared using the Mann–Whitney U‐test. Results: The expression of human collectins in normal human colon mucosa was generally low. Only the expression of SP‐A and MASP‐2 reached the noise threshold of 250 signals. These genes were significantly downregulated in CRC specimens. The expression of the other proteins showed no difference in normal mucosa and CRC. Conclusion: As demonstrated before, the expression of human collectins in normal colon was low in this study. Only SP‐A showed a significant expression in normal mucosa which was downregulated in CRC. As the absolute signal level was below the noise threshold, these results have to be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by direct measurenment of the proteins. Our results suggest that there is no major role for the human collectins in colorectal cancer.","Siassi, M.; Hohenberger, W.; Croner, R.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169588/,19

33646,Viruses and their system/hosts,2016-10-14,"The gut microbiome regulates a number of homeostatic mechanisms in the healthy host including immune function and gut barrier protection. Loss of normal gut microbial structure and function has been associated with diseases as diverse as Clostridioides difficile infection, asthma, and epilepsy. Recent evidence has also demonstrated a link between the gut microbiome and sepsis. In this review, we focus on three key areas of the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis. First, prior to sepsis onset, gut microbiome alteration increases sepsis susceptibility through several mechanisms, including (a) allowing for expansion of pathogenic intestinal bacteria, (b) priming the immune system for a robust pro-inflammatory response, and (c) decreasing production of beneficial microbial products such as short-chain fatty acids. Second, once sepsis is established, gut microbiome disruption worsens and increases susceptibility to end-organ dysfunction. Third, there is limited evidence that microbiome-based therapeutics, including probiotics and selective digestive decontamination, may decrease sepsis risk and improve sepsis outcomes in select patient populations, but concerns about safety have limited uptake. Case reports of a different microbiome-based therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, have shown correlation with gut microbial structure restoration and decreased inflammatory response, but these results require further validation. While much of the evidence linking the gut microbiome and sepsis has been established in pre-clinical studies, clinical evidence is lacking in many areas. To address this, we outline a potential research agenda for further investigating the interaction between the gut microbiome and sepsis.","Adelman, Max W.; Woodworth, Michael H.; Langelier, Charles; Busch, Lindsay M.; Kempker, Jordan A.; Kraft, Colleen S.; Martin, Greg S.",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266132/,19

37422,Fluorescent bead-based serological detection of Toxoplasma gondii infection in chickens,2020-07-31,"Mycoplasma ovis (formerly Eperythrozoon ovis) is an epierythrocytic parasitic bacterium of small ruminants known as haemotropic mycoplasma, which is transmitted mechanically by biting flies and contaminated instruments. Acute mycoplasmosis causes severe haemolytic anaemia and mortality in young animals. At the same time, chronic disease may produce mild anaemia and varying degrees of morbidity depending on several factors, including age, reproductive status, the plane of nutrition, immunological status and the presence of concurrent infection. Haemotropic Mycoplasma ovis is currently recognised as an emerging zoonotic pathogen which is widely distributed in the sheep and goat producing areas of tropics and subtropics, where the disease is nearly endemic. Human infection has been reported in pregnant women, immunocompromised patients and people exposed to animals and arthropods. The current diagnosis of haemoplasma relies on microscopic evaluation of Giemsa-stained blood smear and PCR. Although there are few published reports on the incidence of haemotropic Mycoplasma ovis infection of small ruminants in Malaysia, information on its prevalence, risk factors, severity and economic impacts is grossly inadequate. Therefore, a large-scale survey of small ruminant flocks is necessary to elucidate the current seroprevalence status and molecular characteristics of haemotropic M. ovis infection in Malaysia using ELISA and PCR sequencing technologies. In the future, surveillance programs, including vector forecast, quarantine, monitoring by periodic surveys and public enlightenment, will limit the internal and transboundary spread of M. ovis, enhance control efforts and mitigate production losses in Malaysia.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether miR-1975 serves as an indicator of clinical severity upon influenza infection. We investigate the abundance of miR-1975 in sera from clinical patients and its correlation with hypoxemia status. We quantified its amounts in sera from influenza virus-infected patients and healthy volunteers by means of stem-loop RT-PCR. Median values of miR-1975 were significantly higher in influenza virus-infected patients, especially in hypoxemic patients. miR-1975 levels at the acute stage of the disease were highly correlated with the fraction of inspired oxygen used by the patients and total ventilator days. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis revealed that miR-1975 levels in combination with days of fever before presenting to hospital had significant predictive value for hypoxemia and respiratory failure for patients infected with influenza virus. Our results reveal that circulating miR-1975 has great potential to serve as a biomarker for predicting prognosis in patients infected with influenza virus.","Liu, Yuag-Meng; Chen, Hui-Chen; Chen, Yi-Chun; Yu, Wen-Ya; Ho, Meng-Yen; Ho, Chia-Yin; Lai, Michael M.C.; Su, Wen-Chi",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437959/,19

While lectures and exams were more straightforwardly administered online using video-chatting software, many hands-on laboratory-based courses were forced to develop creative solutions. In response to online instructional requirements, instructors at the University of California Irvine developed an online electroencephalography (EEG) laboratory to simulate the laboratory experiment for students unable to perform the experiment on campus. The laboratory experiment was performed and video recorded by the instructional team under three different scenarios to provide students with multiple data sets acquired under various experimental conditions often enacted by students. Students were required to complete a pre-lab quiz, analyze the acquired EEG data offline, complete a post-lab quiz, and submit their laboratory report to communicate their findings prior to final exams. Student performances compared to prior student performances, and qualitative survey responses, were examined to assess the effectiveness of and response to the online laboratory format. Based on student feedback and lab report grades, the majority of students responded positively and demonstrated an understanding of the EEG experiment’s learning outcomes.

42301,Populismus und Bildung,2020-11-19,"AIMS: As the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic passes, the challenge shifts to safe resumption of routine medical services, including elective orthopaedic surgery. Protocols including pre-operative self-isolation, COVID-19 testing, and surgery at a non-COVID-19 site have been developed to minimize risk of transmission. Despite this, it is likely that many patients will want to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19. The aim of this study is to identify the number of patients who still want to proceed with planned elective orthopaedic surgery in this current environment. METHODS: This is a prospective, single surgeon study of 102 patients who were on the waiting list for an elective hip or knee procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics including age, ASA grade, COVID-19 risk, procedure type, surgical priority, and admission type were recorded. The primary outcome was patient consent to continue with planned surgical care after resumption of elective orthopaedic services. Subgroup analysis was also performed to determine if any specific patient factors influenced the decision to proceed with surgery. RESULTS: Overall, 58 patients (56.8%) wanted to continue with planned surgical care at the earliest possibility. Patients classified as ASA I and ASA II were more likely to agree to surgery (60.5% and 60.0%, respectively) compared to ASA III and ASA IV patients (44.4% and 0.0%, respectively) (p = 0.01). In addition, patients undergoing soft tissue knee surgery were more likely to consent to surgery (90.0%) compared to patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty (68.6%), primary knee arthroplasty (48.7%), revision hip or knee arthroplasty (0.0%), or hip and knee injections (43.8%) (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Restarting elective orthopaedic services during the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant challenge. Given the uncertain environment, it is unsurprising that only 56% of patients were prepared to continue with their planned surgical care upon resumption of elective services.

A problem that needs prompt attention in this situation is the increasing difficulties faced by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in raising capital, which has aroused great concern from multiple stakeholders such as public administrations and regulators. As the major supply of capital, financial service providers (FSPs) play a critical role in financing SMEs. However, how FSPs deal with SME financing during shocks has not yet been fully researched. Accordingly, in this study, a theoretical framework based on expectancy theory is proposed to explore the expected strategic adjustments of FSPs in financing SMEs. Specifically, this study investigates 272 FSPs in China on their expectancy and attitude on financing to SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But public health today goes far beyond interpersonal contagion and environmental dangers to address patterns of ill health among the population. Increased rates of conditions such as diabetes or substance use disorders are called “epidemics” to be addressed by public health interventions including education, environmental design, economic incentives, regulation, and even prohibition. This chapter explores the ethics of this so-called “new” public health, arguing that paternalistic interference with behavior is justified only to prevent serious harm. Much information collection, however, aims not to protect individuals but to understand health or health disparities at the population level and thus is not properly regarded as paternalistic. The chapter also argues that interferences such as the requirement to wear masks in a pandemic are mistakenly perceived as protecting individuals against their own choices and are better viewed as protecting others from the possibility of harm.","Francis, John G.; Francis, Leslie P.",Sustaining Surveillance: The Importance of Information for Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972166/,19

The NHFD is a national database whereby markers of care are recorded prospectively for patients over 60 years sustaining a hip fracture and requiring inpatient care, with a Best Practice Tariff linked to key performance indicators. The aim of this study was to review how care varied for patients sustaining a hip fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the equivalent time last year. METHODS: Using the NHFD we compared data from March – May 2019 to the same period in 2020 during the pandemic at St George’s Hospital. The study provides a snapshot of care during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were more admissions and more discharges during the pandemic. There was an increase in time to theatre and subsequent reduction in BPT. There was also an increase in non- operative treatment for these patients. 6 patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive, one of whom died. There was a reduction in time to ortho-geriatrician review and also a reduction in delirium review post-operatively. Length of stay was also reduced. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had an effect on care provided to hip fracture patients. There was an increase in time and a deterioration in orthogeriatric review within 72 hours. The length of stay however improved due to improved focus on pathways and discharge processes. There was also a lower threshold to offer non- operative care wherever possible.","Umarji, Shamim; Sturley, Rhonda; Tsinaslanidis, Prodromos; Hing, Caroline B; Tsinaslanidis, Prodromos",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030183/,19

In response, a large‐scale virtual reality (VR) course was constructed and deployed at Colorado State University for a remote human anatomy course. Enrolled students received a VR capable laptop and head‐mounted display and participated in synchronous online laboratory and recitation sessions. The program enabled students to work collaboratively in a common virtual space and learn human anatomy from digital cadavers and volumized medical data (CT and MRI). We hypothesized that VR is an effective method to increase student engagement and knowledge acquisition in human anatomy. Qualitative data was collected on student engagement, confidence, and reactions to the new technology. Quantitative data assessed student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical spatial relationships when using VR and two‐dimensional (2D) methods. Results suggested that using VR matched 2D methods in terms of student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical relationships. Qualitative data indicated that VR enhanced student engagement and increased opportunities for students to interact with teaching assistants, peers, and the content. Students further reported the unique aspects of the VR program allowed them to explore the content in novel ways. There was a statistically significant increase in student examination scores when compared to previous in‐person laboratories. Overall, the virtual classroom maintained the rigor of traditional gross anatomy laboratories without negatively impacting student examination scores and provided a high level of accessibility, without compromising learner engagement. This novel approach provides a highly engaging and interactive solution to distance education.","Heise, Natascha; Brown, Katelyn; Nelson, Jordan; Eitel, Chad; Meyer, Carolyn; Ivie, Kenneth; Walrond, John; Clapp, Tod",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239753/,19

Today, mobile monitoring and real-time data collection, processing and decision-making, can drastically improve the cardiorespiratory–haemodynamic health diagnosis and care, not only in the rural communities, but urban ones with limited healthcare access as well. Disparities in socioeconomic status and geographic variances resulting in regional inequity in access to healthcare delivery, and significant differences in mortality rates between rural and urban communities have been a growing concern. Evolution of wireless devices and smartphones has initiated a new era in medicine. Mobile health technologies have a promising role in equitable delivery of personalized medicine and are becoming essential components in the delivery of healthcare to patients with limited access to in-hospital services. Yet, the utility of portable health monitoring devices has been suboptimal due to the lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient physiological data collection and analysis platforms. We present a comprehensive review of the current cardiac, pulmonary, and haemodynamic telemonitoring technologies. We also propose a novel low-cost smartphone-based system capable of providing complete cardiorespiratory assessment using a single platform for arrhythmia prediction along with detection of underlying ischaemia and sleep apnoea; we believe this system holds significant potential in aiding the diagnosis and treatment of cardiorespiratory diseases, particularly in underserved populations.","Kulkarni, Kanchan; Sevakula, Rahul Kumar; Kassab, Mohamad B; Nichols, John; Roberts, Jesse D.; Isselbacher, Eric M; Armoundas, Antonis A",Eur Heart J Digit Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482046/,19

58619,Biomedical Applications of Nanofibers,2021-10-05,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the salivary glands, leading to reduced secretory functions and oral and ocular dryness. The salivary glands are composed of acinar cells that are responsible for the secretion and production of secretory granules, which contain salivary components, such as amylase, mucins and immunoglobulins. This secretion process involves secretory vesicle trafficking, docking, priming and membrane fusion. A failure during any of the steps in exocytosis in the salivary glands results in the altered secretion of saliva. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors, actin, tight junctions and aquaporin 5 all serve an important role in the trafficking regulation of secretory vesicles in the secretion of saliva via exocytosis. Alterations in the expression and distribution of these selected proteins leads to salivary gland dysfunction, including SS. Several studies have demonstrated that green tea polyphenols, most notably Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), possess both anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in normal human cells. Molecular, cellular and animal studies have indicated that EGCG can provide protective effects against autoimmune and inflammatory reactions in salivary glands in diseases such as SS. The aim of the present article is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review on the possible therapeutic interactions between EGCG and the selected molecular mechanisms associated with SS.","Errachid, Abdelmounaim; Nohawica, Michal; Wyganowska-Swiatkowska, Marzena",Biomed Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493546/,19
60379,Survey of the 2009 commercial optical biosensor literature.,2011,"BACKGROUND The Stroke Outcomes and Neuroimaging of Intracranial Atherosclerosis (SONIA) study validated noninvasive imaging tests of intracranial atherosclerosis against catheter angiography in a prospective, blinded, multicenter setting. Critical evaluation of transcranial Doppler (TCD) and magnetic resonance angiography in the SONIA study standardized their performance and interpretation. We performed a similar analysis of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for the detection of intracranial stenosis. METHODS Multicenter standardization of image acquisition and blinded, central interpretation of CTA performance were conducted in concert with the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial. Measurements of the intracranial arterial diameter were obtained to derive stenosis values. Correlation with catheter angiography was used to assess CTA performance characteristics. RESULTS CTA measurements of intracranial stenosis were obtained in 120 vessel segments, with angiographic correlation in 52. CTA was performed as a noninvasive study prior to conventional angiography. CTA stenoses of 50-99% or a flow gap were identified in 15 of 52 vessel segments, stenoses of <50% in 5 of 52, and normal arterial diameters in 32 of 52 vessel segments. Based on the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) stenosis defined as 50-99%, the positive predictive value (PPV) of CTA was only 46.7% (95% CI 21.3-73.4) and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 73.0% (95% CI 55.9-86.2). For DSA stenosis defined as 70-99%, the PPV of CTA was 13.3% (95% CI 1.7-40.5) and the NPV was 83.8% (95% CI 68.0-93.8). CONCLUSIONS CTA can accurately rule out the presence of severe stenosis due to intracranial atherosclerosis and may eliminate the need for angiography in many cases. Further prospective, blinded evaluation of CTA and optimization of cutpoints to predict angiographic disease will facilitate future trials of intracranial atherosclerosis.","Liebeskind, David S; Kosinski, Andrzej S; Saver, Jeffrey L; Feldmann, Edward",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000360952; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25337084/,19

We describe quantitative trait analysis of plant height and flowering time in the naturally occurring tetraploid Sorghum halepense, using two novel BC1F2 populations totaling 246 genotypes derived from backcrossing two tetraploid Sorghum bicolor x S. halepense F1 plants to a tetraploidized S. bicolor. Phenotyping for two years each in Bogart, GA and Salina, KS allowed us to dissect variance into narrow-sense genetic (QTLs) and environmental components. In crosses with a common S. bicolor BTx623 parent, comparison of QTLs in S. halepense, its rhizomatous progenitor S. propinquum and S. bicolor race guinea which is highly divergent from BTx623 permit inferences of loci at which new alleles have been associated with improvement of elite sorghums. The relative abundance of QTLs unique to the S. halepense populations may reflect its polyploidy and subsequent 'diploidization' processes often associated with the formation of genetic novelty, a possibility further supported by a high level of QTL polymorphism within sibling lines derived from a common S. halepense parent. An intriguing hypothesis for further investigation is that polyploidy of S. halepense following 96 million years of abstinence, coupled with natural selection during its spread to diverse environments across six continents, may provide a rich collection of novel alleles that offer potential opportunities for sorghum improvement.","Kong, WenQian; Nabukalu, Pheonah; Cox, T S; Goff, Valorie H; Robertson, Jon S; Pierce, Gary J; Lemke, Cornelia; Compton, Rosana; Paterson, Andrew H",TAG.

63653,Structure-Dependent Antibacterial Activity of Amino Acid-Based Supramolecular Hydrogels.,2020-05-05,"OBJECTIVES The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected the development of negative phenomena such as anxiety symptoms, a tendency to use alcohol and aggressive behaviors. It is postulated to investigate the factors limiting the development of the indicated adverse effects. One of the psychological resources that may have a significant, pro-health character in relation to mental functioning is ego-resiliency (ER). It is described as a personality trait associated with a high ability to adequately regulate self-control, depending on the conditions. There are studies providing information about the prohealth, adaptive nature of ER during the COVID‑19 period. The aim of the study was to assess the relationships between ER and anxiety, the tendency to use alcohol and aggression in the group of Polish people in the initial lockdown period in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS Overall, 538 adult Polish people participated in the study. The Ego-Resiliency Scale referred to as ER89-R12, according to Block's concept, was used to measure ER. The other scales used were the General Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, the multiple regression procedure, the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank ANOVA. Cronbach's α coefficients were also assessed. RESULTS Statistically significant negative relationships between ER and the severity of anxiety symptoms and generalized aggression were found. There was a weak positive relationship between ER and the tendency to use alcohol. Among the surveyed Polish people, higher ER was characteristic of the older respondents (aged >29 years) and people with higher education. CONCLUSIONS Ego-resiliency in the times of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can counteract the development of anxiety and aggression. Optimal regulation seems to play an important role in this relationship. The relationship between resiliency and the tendency to use alcohol requires further observation.","Dębski, Paweł; Florek, Szymon; Piegza, Magdalena; Pudlo, Robert; Gorczyca, Piotr Wacław",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34036952/,19

However, previous studies were based on less-effective first-generation devices, and analyzed only dichotomized disability outcomes, which may underestimate the full effect of treatment. METHODS In the combined databases of the SWIFT and STAR trials, we identified patients treated with the Solitaire stent retriever with achievement of substantial reperfusion (Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [TICI] 2b-3). Ordinal numbers needed to treat values were derived by populating joint outcome tables. RESULTS Among 202 patients treated with ET with TICI 2b to 3 reperfusion, mean age was 68 (±13), 62% were female, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 17 (interquartile range [IQR]: 14-20). Day 90 modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes for OTR time intervals ranging from 180 to 480 minutes showed substantial time-related reductions in disability across the entire outcome range. Shorter OTR was associated with improved mean 90-day mRS (1.4 vs. 2.4 vs. 3.3, for OTR groups of 124-240 vs. 241-360 vs. 361-660 minutes; p < 0.001). The number of patients identified as benefitting from therapy with shorter OTR were 3-fold (range, 1.5-4.7) higher on ordinal, compared with dichotomized analysis. For every 15-minute acceleration of OTR, 34 per 1,000 treated patients had improved disability outcome. INTERPRETATION Analysis of disability over the entire outcome range demonstrates a marked effect of shorter time to reperfusion upon improved clinical outcome, substantially higher than binary metrics. For every 5-minute delay in endovascular reperfusion, 1 of 100 patients has a worse disability outcome.","Sheth, Sunil A; Jahan, Reza; Gralla, Jan; Pereira, Vitor M; Nogueira, Raul G; Levy, Elad I; Zaidat, Osama O; Saver, Jeffrey L",Annals of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.24474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26153450/,19

This study was aimed to compare the performance of QBC STAR™ compared to Sysmex XN-module and the reference optical microscopy (OM) assessment. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred peripheral blood samples, collected in K3 EDTA tubes, and 50 capillary blood samples obtained by finger stick were analyzed with QBC STAR™, Sysmex XN-module, and OM. Data were compared with Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS The Passing-Bablok regression analysis (QBC STAR™ capillary sample vs XN-module) yielded slopes comprised between 0.30 and 1.37, while the intercepts ranged between -17.57 and 232.6. Bland-Altman plots yielded relative bias comprised between -4.87% (for MN QBC STAR™ capillary sample vs XN-module) and 27% (PLT QBC STAR™ capillary sample vs XN-module). A significant bias was found for all parameters except MN and WBC, RBC in all and pediatric samples, and HB in adults samples. CONCLUSION The results of this analytical evaluation suggest that QBC STAR™ may not be the ideal tool for performing complete blood count analysis for diagnostic purposes, while it could be more useful in urgent/emergent conditions, such as for rapid monitoring of some hematological parameters (eg, WBC and HB).","Napolitano, Gavino; Caracciolo, Alessandra; Apassiti Esposito, Sara; Della Malva, Nunzia; Manenti, Barbara; Guerra, Giovanni; Ottomano, Cosimo; Lippi, Giuseppe; Buoro, Sabrina",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750012/,19

Data of 282 cows from 9 dairy herds in Québec, Canada, with bulk tank SCC < 250,000 cells/mL were used. Estimated median herd-prevalence of infections that should be treated was 16.2 % (95 % credibility interval (CI): 11.0-22.7). Se and Sp estimates for quarter-milk culture using Petrifilm® were 82.2 % (95 %CI: 74.0-89.5) and 62.0 % (95 %CI: 58.6-65.6), respectively. Se and Sp for quarter-milk standard bacteriology were 67.4 % (95 %CI: 55.8-81.2) and 79.6 % (95 %CI: 76.4-83.0), respectively. Se and Sp of different SCC scenarios and thresholds were estimated. For first parity cows, using only the last Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI) test SCC with a threshold of 100,000 cells/mL appeared quite accurate, with Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and reduction of antimicrobial usage of 85.6 % (95 %CI: 69.6-95.6), 86.0 % (95 %CI: 80.0-91.7), 58.0 % (95 %CI: 42.3-74.2), 96.4 % (95 %CI: 91.3-99.0), and 75.3 % (95 %CI: 70.7-79.3), respectively. For cows of ≥ 2nd parity, using only the last DHI test SCC with a threshold of 200,000 cells/mL resulted in Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and reduction of antimicrobial usage of 75.3 % (95 %CI: 55.8-87.3), 84.0 % (95 %CI: 78.8-89.3), 47.2 % (95 %CI: 32.0-63.7), 94.7 % (95 %CI: 89.0-97.6), and of 77.0 % (95 %CI: 73.3-80.3), respectively. Adding quarter-level milk culture using Petrifilm® to cows identified as unhealthy using cow-level SCC data improved the test accuracy (mainly the PPV) and further reduced the use of antimicrobials. For instance, in ≥ 2nd parity cows, using only the last DHI SCC with a threshold of 200,000 cells/mL, adding a subsequent Petrifilm® test increased the reduction from 77.0 % (95 %CI: 73.3-80.3) to 89.5 % (95 %CI: 86.7-91.8). Considering the availability of SCC data, the easiness of using just the last DHI test, and the high NPV that could be achieved, producers may consider using just the last DHI test as a potential tool to identify cows that should be treated with antimicrobials at dry off. It may be used alone or in combination with quarter-level on-farm Petrifilm® milk culture on high SCC cows to further reduce the use of antimicrobials by identifying quarters that need to be treated.","Kabera, Fidèle; Roy, Jean-Philippe; Keefe, Greg; Dufour, Simon",Preventive veterinary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.105452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399169/,19

It is particularly well suited for patients with locally advanced distal rectal cancer and obesity, where the abdominal approach is challenging. Transanal TME can be performed with either TAMIS or TEM. Here, we report our initial experience with transanal TME using TAMIS (TAMIS-TME). METHODS Patients were selected to undergo transanal TME using the TAMIS platform (TAMIS-TME) primarily for malignant disease, but also for select cases of benign disease. Transanal TME defines a ""bottom-up"" approach to en bloc rectal cancer resection. Transanal TME requires abdominal access for proximal colonic mobilization and is often done in conjunction with a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS During a 32-month period, 20 patients underwent TAMIS-TME with curative intent. The primary indication for transanal TME was distal, locally advanced rectal cancer. The median age of rectal cancer patients at the time of surgery was 57 years (range 36-73 years) with 30% (6) female and 70% (14) male. The median body mass index (BMI) measured was 24 kg/m(2) (range 18-41 kg/m(2)); this included six patients (30%) with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). Mean operating time was 243 min (range 140-495 min) with blood loss averaging 153 ml. Postoperative length of stay averaged 4.5 days (range 3-24 days). There was no 30-day postoperative mortality. Surgical complications included wound infection (n = 2), pelvic abscess (n = 4), and prolonged ileus (n = 4). The anastomotic leak rate was 6.7% (1/15). Of the 20 patients who underwent resection, 90% (18/20) had negative margins. Pathologic grading of the TME specimen revealed that 85% (17/20) of transanal TME specimens were found to have ""completely"" or ""near-completely"" intact mesorectal envelopes. Data collected during the 6-month median follow-up period revealed that only one patient had developed distant metastasis. There was no locoregional recurrence in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS Transanal TME is a feasible method for oncologic resection of locally advanced mid- and distal-rectal cancer with curative intent. It has special application for patients with obesity and anatomic constraints such as a narrow male pelvis.","Atallah, S; Martin-Perez, B; Albert, M; deBeche-Adams, T; Nassif, G; Hunter, L; Larach, S",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-013-1095-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24272607/,19

68320,Avian rotavirus enteritis - an updated review.,2015,"PURPOSE Angiogenesis plays a major role in various physiological and pathological situations. Thus, an angiogenic therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been commonly recommended as a representative therapeutic solution to recover the insufficient blood supply of collateral vessels in an ischemic lesion. In this study, the injection method and injection time point of VEGF proteins were focused to discover how to enhance the angiogenic effect with VEGF. METHODS Mouse models (n = 15) were divided into control, VEGF treatment by intra-venous injection (VEGF-IV) and VEGF treatment by intra-muscular injection (VEGF-IM). Right proximal femoral arteries of mice were firmly sutured to obstruct arterial blood-flow. In the VEGF-IV treatment group, VEGF proteins were injected into the tail vein and, in the VEGF-IM treatment group, VEGF proteins were directly injected into the ischemic site of the right thigh after postoperative day 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 follow-ups. Blood-flow images were acquired by (99m)Tc Gamma Image Acquisition System to compare the ischemic-to-non-ischemic bloodstream ratio at postoperative days 5, 15, and 30. RESULTS VEGF-IM treatment significantly induced higher an angiogenic effect rather than both the control group (P = 0.008) and VEGF-IV treatment group (P = 0.039) at the 30th day. CONCLUSION During all experiments, angiogenesis of VEGF-IM treatment represented the most evident effect compared with control and VEGF-IV group in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia.","Lee, Tai Kyoung; Hwang, Hyosook; Na, Kyung Sook; Kwon, JeongIl; Jeong, Hwan-Seok; Oh, Philsun; Kim, Hee Kwon; Lim, Seok Tae; Sohn, Myung-Hee; Jeong, Hwan-Jeong; Lee, Chang-Moon",Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13139-014-0273-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177380/,19

METHODS Between May 2008 and December 2012, computed tomography (CT)- or ultrasound (US)-guided MWA was performed in 6 patients with 7 cystic renal lesions (range 13.8-27 mm, mean 17.02 mm, SD 8.5 mm) Bosniak category III or IV. The number of treatment sessions, treatment results, lesion size changes and complications were evaluated. Technical success (TS), technical effectiveness (TE), local tumor progression rate (LTPR), cancer-specific survival rate (CSSR) and overall survival rate (OSR) were computed. MAIN FINDINGS TS was 100% (7/7) and TE was 100%; LTPR was 0%; CSSR and OSR were 100%. No major complications were observed. CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience with MWA shows a potential role for US/CT-guided percutaneous MWA in treating Bosniak category III or IV cystic renal lesions, as a safe approach to treat selected patients not suitable for surgery.","Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Petrillo, Mario; Fontana, Federico; Floridi, Chiara; Boni, Luigi; Rovera, Francesca; Rausei, Stefano; Mangano, Alberto; Spampatti, Sebastiano; Marconi, Alberto; Carcano, Giulio; Dionigi, Renzo",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1743-9191(13)60010-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24380547/,19

More specifically, although evidence of phonological influences (i.e., phonological priming effects in the SDT) have been reported, Kinoshita, Gayed, and Norris (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 44(11), 1661-1671, 2018) have claimed that phonological priming does not arise in the SDT when the prime and target are written in the same script and the targets are words, the most typical experimental situation. Indeed, it does appear that no-one has yet reported phonological priming effects in such situations. The question of whether it is possible to observe phonological priming in such situations was more fully examined in the present experiments. Experiment 1 involved a masked priming SDT using Japanese Kanji script in which the primes and targets were homophonic but shared no characters. Experiment 2 was a parallel experiment using Chinese stimuli. In both experiments, phonological priming effects were observed for both one- and two-character words. These experiments indicate that, although the priming effects in masked priming SDTs undoubtedly have a strong orthographic basis, phonological codes also play a role even when the prime and (word) target are written in the same script.","Yang, Huilan; Yoshihara, Masahiro; Nakayama, Mariko; Spinelli, Giacomo; Lupker, Stephen J",Memory & cognition,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-020-01080-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839892/,19

69021,Nonexponential Length Dependence of Molecular Conductance in Acene-Based Molecular Wires.,2021-01-07,"MAIN CONCLUSION 46 monocot chimeric jacalins (MCJs) were mined from wheat genome. They were divided into three subfamilies with the activity of mannose-specific lectins and had effects on dehydration tolerance or disease resistance. Monocot chimeric jacalin (MCJ) is a newly identified subfamily of plant lectins that exclusively exists in Poaceae. The MCJs are modular proteins consisting of a dirigent domain and a jacalin-related lectin domain. Their unique evolution and various functions are not fully understood as only few members of MCJ have so for been investigated. From wheat, 46 MCJs were identified and phylogenetically classified into three subfamilies, in which subfamily I represented the early evolutionary cluster. MCJ genes are evenly distributed among three subgenomes of wheat, indicating that MCJ might be an ancient gene in Poaceae. qRT-PCR analysis showed that TaMCJ1 and TaMCJ2 were mainly expressed in leaves while TaMCJ3 in root tissues. All these TaMCJ genes are JA or ABA inducible. All three proteins exhibited agglutinating activity but different preference to mannose-binding. The overexpression of TaMCJ3 in tobacco increased dehydration tolerance, while TaMCJ1 enhanced wildfire disease resistance. The lignin biosynthetic genes were temporarily induced after pathogen inoculation in transgenic tobacco overexpressing TaMCJ, but the specific association with TaMCJ was not established. This evidence argued against the notion that the dirigent domain in TaMCJ is directly linked with lignin metabolism. Taken together, these results pave the way for a better understanding of the manifold functionality of MCJs and offer important insights to the evolutionary history of MCJ.","Ma, Qing-Hu; Han, Jia-Qi",Planta,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00425-020-03548-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423087/,19

Compression-only CPR should be used by responders who are unable or unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilations. After the first defibrillator shock, further rhythm checks and defibrillation attempts should be performed after 2 min of CPR. The underlying cause of cardiac arrest can be identified and treated during CPR. Drugs have a limited effect on long-term outcomes after cardiac arrest, although epinephrine improves the success of resuscitation, and amiodarone increases the success of defibrillation for refractory VF. Supraglottic airway devices are an alternative to tracheal intubation, which should be attempted only by skilled rescuers. Care after cardiac arrest includes controlled reoxygenation, therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors, percutaneous coronary intervention, circulatory support, and control of blood-glucose levels and seizures. Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest needs a careful, multimodal approach using clinical and electrophysiological assessments after at least 72 h.","Nolan, Jerry P; Soar, Jasmeet; Wenzel, Volker; Paal, Peter",Nature reviews.

There was a positive tendency toward benefits in tele-rehabilitation, health-education and self-management, early detection of COPD exacerbations, psychosocial support and smoking cessation, but the heterogeneity of clinical trials and reviews limits the extent to which this value can be understood. Telemonitoring interventions and cost-effectiveness had contradictory results. The literature on teleconsultation was scarce during this period.

Since there is still no specific treatment available, prevention of disease spread is crucial to manage the pandemic. Adequate public information is very important. To assess the optimal timing, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between web-based interest and new cases and deaths due to COVID-19. METHODS Web-based interest for queries related to 'coronavirus' was assessed between 1 January and 19 June 2020, using Google Trends in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Reliability analysis of the used search terms was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. To investigate the association between web-based interest and new COVID-19 cases or deaths, the relative search volume was analysed for correlation with new cases and deaths. RESULTS Reliability analysis revealed excellent reliability for COVID-19 search terms in all countries. Web-based interest peaked between 23 February and 5 April 2020, which was prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most included countries. There was a moderate to strong correlation between COVID-19 related queries and new cases or new deaths. CONCLUSION Web-based interest in COVID-19 peaked prior to the peak of new infections and deaths in most countries included.

The management of a lung transplantation (LTx) program and the therapeutic strategies to adapt the immunosuppressive regimen and antiviral measures is a major issue in the COVID-19 era, but little is known about worldwide practice. We sent out to 180 LTx centers worldwide in June 2020 a survey with 63 questions, both regarding the management of a LTx program in the COVID-19 era and the therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 LTx recipients. We received a total of 78 responses from 15 countries. Among participants, 81% declared a reduction of the activity and 47% restricted LTx for urgent cases only. Sixteen centers observed deaths on waiting listed patients and 8 centers performed LTx for COVID-19 disease. In 62% of the centers, COVID-19 was diagnosed in LTx recipients, most of them not severe cases. The most common immunosuppressive management included a decreased dose or pausing of the cell cycle inhibitors. Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin were the most proposed antiviral strategies.

This cross-sectional study took place in Ardabil, northwest of Iran. All patients (16 183) who were admitted to the hospitals of Ardabil province were recruited. Six indicator variables were selected to identify latent subgroups of patients using the result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test as a grouping variable. Data analysis was performed using χ2, independent t test, and latent class analysis. This study found that among PCR-positive patients, there were 3 latent classes: (1) mild disease (16.1%), (2) semi-severe disease (62.5%), and (3) severe disease (21.3%). This study showed that having preexisting comorbidity increase the odds of membership in semi-severe disease (odds ratio = 2.30) and severe disease (odds ratio = 1.60) classes compared with mild disease class.

A prospective experimental study was performed where one healthy tarsocrural joint of each horse was randomly assigned to receive repeated through-and-through joint lavage at 0, 48 and 96 h. Synovial fluid and blood samples were collected at 0 (baseline), 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h. Systemic and synovial SAA, total protein, nucleated cell count and percentage of neutrophils were measured and compared to baseline. Concentrations of systemic and synovial SAA percentage of neutrophils were not increased from baseline in contrast to total protein and nucleated cell counts (except for nucleated cell count at 96 h). In conclusion, repeated through-and-through joint lavage did not affect synovial SAA concentrations in horses; however, synovial total protein and nucleated cell count values increased. Some of the total protein and nucleated cell count values observed in this study were within the range reported for septic arthritis 24 h after joint lavage. Hence, synovial SAA may be a valuable marker to evaluate the clinical progression of septic joints after through-and-through joint lavage. Clinical studies evaluating synovial fluid SAA concentrations while treating synovial sepsis with through-and-through joint lavage are warranted.","Sanchez-Teran, A F; Bracamonte, J L; Hendrick, S; Riddell, L; Musil, K; Hoff, B; Rubio-Martínez, L M",Veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2016.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26831179/,19

Typically the care coordination for these perioperative homes is run through hospital-funded, on site, pre-anesthesia clinics. Preliminary data from Pediatric Perioperative homes have shown promising results in improved patient outcomes and decreased length of hospital stay. The majority of pediatric surgeries within the country are performed in non-pediatric hospitals. Such centers may not have the infrastructure or financial resources for a free-standing pediatric pre-anesthesia clinic. Faced with this situation at the largest safety net hospital in New England, the authors present their experience designing and implementing a ""Virtual Pediatric Perioperative Home,"" a telemedicine-based triage and pre-anesthetic optimization for pediatric patients at Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA. METHODS A retrospective chart review of all pediatric anesthesia cases at Boston Medical Center from February 1st, 2019, to January 31st, 2020, as well as the number of pediatric cases canceled or postponed on the day of surgery for any reason during the same time period was conducted. RESULTS From February 1st, 2019, to January 31st, 2020, 1546 anesthetics were performed in children 18 years and under. Of those, 63 were designated as emergent and hence excluded from our analysis. 153 of the total 1483 (9.4%) of non-emergent bookings were canceled or postponed on the day of surgery. The largest reason for case cancellations (41.8%) was due to the patient suffering from acute illness and thus not medically optimized for surgery. Cancellation rates varied from month to month, with the highest cancellation rate of the year in September 2019 (18.8%). The departments of Podiatry and Gastroenterology represented the highest cancellation rates as a denominator of their case volumes, 15.4% and 15.2% respectively. Younger children had 2.4 times the odds (95% CI: 1.720, 3.4) of cancellation compared to older children. CONCLUSION The authors describe the design and successful implementation of a telemedicine-based pediatric pre-anesthesia triage and medical optimization service at a large safety net hospital. By creating a communication network of pediatric subspecialists, the anesthesiologists were able to, at minimal institutional cost, coordinate care for children with a variety of comorbidities leading up to the day of surgery. This yielded a 9.4% same day cancellation rate in a complex, socioeconomically disadvantaged pediatric patient population at a general hospital.","Conley, Christopher; Facchin, Mark; Gu, Qingrou; Mukerji, Shivali; Cohen, Robyn; O'Brien, Sharon; Nurhussien, Lina; Ferrari, Lynne",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33711208/,19

74220,The Evolution of Computational Chemistry Along with Coronaviruses.,2020-05-18,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic. Our laboratory initially used a two-step molecular assay, first reported by Corman et al., for SARS-CoV-2 identification (the T-CDC method). As rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is required to control the spread of this infectious disease, the current study evaluated three commercially available assays, including the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit, the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test and the Rendu 2019-nCoV Assay kit, to establish diagnostic algorithms for clinical laboratories. METHODS A total of 790 clinical specimens, including nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, sputum, saliva, stool, endotracheal aspirate and serum were obtained from patients who were suspected or already confirmed to have COVID-19 at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital from February to May 2020. These specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the different assays and the performance variance between the assays was analyzed. RESULTS Of the assays we evaluated, the T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit require lots of hands-on practical lab work, while the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test and the Rendu 2019-nCoV Assay kit are fully automated detection systems. The T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit showed similar detection sensitivity, however, the T-CDC method frequently delivered false positive signals for E and/or RdRP gene detection, thus increasing the risk of reporting false positive results. A manual test-based testing strategy combining the T-CDC method and the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit was developed, which demonstrated excellent concordance rates (>99%) with the cobas and Rendu automatic systems. There were a few cases showing discrepant results, which may be due to the varied detection sensitivities as well as targets among the different platforms. Moreover, the concordance rate between the cobas and Rendu assays was 100%. CONCLUSION Based on our evaluation, two SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic algorithms, one focusing on the manual assays and the other on the automatic platforms, were proposed. Our results provide valuable information that allow clinical laboratories to implement optimal diagnostic strategies for SARS-CoV-2 testing based on their clinical needs, such as test volume, turn-around time, and staff/resource limitations.","Ho, Hsiang-Ling; Lin, Yen-Yu; Wang, Fang-Yu; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Lee, Chia-Lin; Chou, Teh-Ying",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcma.0000000000000456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177397/,19
75153,Grass Carp Reovirus VP41 Targets Fish MITA To Abrogate the Interferon Response.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Once reserved solely for non-surgical cases, percutaneous ablation is becoming an increasingly popular treatment option for a wider array of patients with small renal masses and the radiation risk needs to be better defined as this transition continues. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review of our renal tumor ablation database revealed 425 patients who underwent percutaneous ablation for treatment of 455 renal tumors over a 5-year time period. Imparted radiation dose information was reviewed for each procedure and converted to effective patient dose and skin dose using established techniques. Statistical analysis was performed with each ablative technique. RESULTS For the 331 cryoablation procedures, the mean DLP was 6987 mGycm (SD = 2861) resulting in a mean effective dose of 104.7 mSv (SD = 43.5) and the mean CTDIvol was 558 mGy (SD = 439) resulting in a mean skin dose of 563.2 mGy (SD = 344.1). For the 124 RFA procedures, the mean DLP was 3485 mGycm (SD = 1630) resulting in a mean effective dose of 50.3 mSv (SD = 24.0) and the mean CTDIvol was 232 mGy (SD = 149) resulting in a mean skin dose of 233.2 mGy (SD = 117.4). The difference in patient radiation exposure between the two renal ablation techniques was statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Both cryoablation and RFA imparted an average skin dose that was well below the 2 Gy deterministic threshold for appreciable sequela. Renal tumor cryoablation resulted in a mean skin and effective radiation dose more than twice that for RFA. The radiation exposure for both renal tumor ablation techniques was at the high end of the medical imaging radiation dose spectrum.","McEachen, James C; Leng, Shuai; Atwell, Thomas D; Tollefson, Matthew K; Friese, Jeremy L; Wang, Zhen; Murad, M Hassan; Schmit, Grant D",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-015-1169-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26159355/,19
75272,Cellular metabolism in the defense against microbes.,2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND The optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is still widely debated in treating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. Current methods of selecting PEEP only provide a range of values and do not provide unique patient-specific solutions. Model-based methods offer a novel way of using non-invasive pressure-volume (PV) measurements to estimate patient recruitability. This paper examines the clinical viability of such models in pilot clinical trials to assist therapy, optimise patient-specific PEEP, assess the disease state and response over time. METHODS Ten patients with acute lung injury or ARDS underwent incremental PEEP recruitment manoeuvres. PV data was measured at increments of 5 cmH2O and fitted to the recruitment model. Inspiratory and expiratory breath holds were performed to measure airway resistance and auto-PEEP. Three model-based metrics are used to optimise PEEP based on opening pressures, closing pressures and net recruitment. ARDS status was assessed by model parameters capturing recruitment and compliance. RESULTS Median model fitting error across all patients for inflation and deflation was 2.8% and 1.02% respectively with all patients experiencing auto-PEEP. In all three metrics' cases, model-based optimal PEEP was higher than clinically selected PEEP. Two patients underwent multiple recruitment manoeuvres over time and model metrics reflected and tracked the state or their ARDS. CONCLUSIONS For ARDS patients, the model-based method presented in this paper provides a unique, non-invasive method to select optimal patient-specific PEEP. In addition, the model has the capability to assess disease state over time using these same models and methods.","Sundaresan, Ashwath; Chase, J Geoffrey; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Chiew, Yeong Shiong; Desaive, Thomas",Biomedical engineering online,https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-925x-10-64; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21794116/,19
75435,Planting Equity: Using What We Know to Cultivate Growth as a Plant Biology Community.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Thrombin, a key enzyme of the clotting system, is involved in thrombus formation, platelet activation, and atherosclerosis, thereby possessing a central role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease. Studies have shown an association between thrombin generation (TG) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but results have been equivocal. Our aim was to study the predictive ability of TG assay in evaluating coronary stenosis severity. METHODS In this prospective study we recruited patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or acute chest pain (without evidence of myocardial injury) planned for coronary angiography. Thrombin generation was evaluated by Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) prior to angiography. Primary end points were significant coronary stenosis and the Syntax I score evaluated by coronary angiography. RESULTS From April 2018 through September 2019, we recruited 128 patients. In the primary analysis there was no significant association between TG and significant coronary stenosis nor between TG and syntax I score, however, there was a positive correlation between peak height and troponin peak (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.194, P-value = 0.035). In sub-group analysis, the chest pain group bare no association between TG and coronary stenosis. In unstable angina group there was an association between peak height and significant coronary stenosis (P-value = 0.029), and in non ST-elevation myocardial infarction group, TG values possessed a relatively good predictive ability of significant coronary stenosis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ~65%) and a positive correlation between both lag time and ttpeak with the syntax I score was noticed (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.31, P-value = 0.099 and Spearman correlation coefficient 0.37, P-value = 0.045 respectively). CONCLUSION In patients with acute chest pain, TG values, evaluated by CAT, do not predict severity of coronary stenosis, nor do they possess prognostic value. Yet, in ACS patients, TG may have the ability to predict coronary disease severity.","Elad, Boaz; Koren, Ofir; Slim, Wasin; Turgeman, Yoav; Avraham, Gilat; Schwartz, Naama; Elias, Mazen",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764787/,19
75459,Coronaviruses in South African bats.,2013,"BACKGROUND Guidelines for follow-up after oral cancer treatment are not site-specific and encompass the entire head and neck area rather than the oral cavity alone. This one-size-fits-all protocol disregards the differences in aetiology, treatment and differential distribution of new disease between the subsites. With the effectiveness of follow-up in early detection of new disease being put into question, the focus of follow-up programmes might shift to other aspects of survivorship care. Personalization of follow-up is important, considering patient-specific features and needs. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic urges us to rethink our follow-up practice. FINDINGS This paper discusses ways in which routine follow-up in patients treated for oral cancer can be optimised. Patients with a high risk of new disease might benefit from an intensified follow-up regimen, whilst patients with a low risk of new disease, a low chance of cure or limited life expectancy could benefit from a de-intensified follow-up regimen. The latter could include a shorter follow-up period and focus on goals other than early detection of new disease. Education of patients to report new symptoms early is of vital importance as the majority of new disease presents symptomatically. Other health care professionals such as specialist nurses and dentists need to play an important leading role in survivorship care. Remote consultations may be useful to perform more efficient and patient centred follow-up care. CONCLUSION Routine follow-up needs to be seen as an integrated part of an individualized survivorship plan that is provided by the entire multidisciplinary team.","Brands, Marieke; Verbeek, André; Geurts, Sandra; Merkx, Thijs",Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jop.13147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270280/,19

76285,Effect of early tracheostomy on clinical outcomes in critically ill lung transplant recipients.,2018,"The coronaviruses are a large family of plus-strand RNA viruses that cause a wide variety of diseases both in humans and in other organisms. The coronaviruses are composed of three main lineages and have a complex organization of nonstructural proteins (nsp's). In the coronavirus, nsp3 resides a domain with the macroH2A-like fold and ADP-ribose-1""-monophosphatase (ADRP) activity, which is proposed to play a regulatory role in the replication process. However, the significance of this domain for the coronaviruses is still poorly understood due to the lack of structural information from different lineages. We have determined the crystal structures of two viral ADRP domains, from the group I human coronavirus 229E and the group III avian infectious bronchitis virus, as well as their respective complexes with ADP-ribose. The structures were individually solved to elucidate the structural similarities and differences of the ADRP domains among various coronavirus species. The active-site residues responsible for mediating ADRP activity were found to be highly conserved in terms of both sequence alignment and structural superposition, whereas the substrate binding pocket exhibited variations in structure but not in sequence. Together with data from a previous analysis of the ADRP domain from the group II severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and from other related functional studies of ADRP domains, a systematic structural analysis of the coronavirus ADRP domains was realized for the first time to provide a structural basis for the function of this domain in the coronavirus replication process.","Xu, Yuanyuan; Cong, Le; Chen, Cheng; Wei, Lei; Zhao, Qi; Xu, Xiaoling; Ma, Yanlin; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01862-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18987156/,19

This methodology has been established for detection of the tropomyosin allergen and includes ligand screening, the determination of sensitivity, and a comparison with traditional detection methods. Three kinds of monoclonal antibodies (2F9, 4C7, and 2H6) known to have a high bioactivity against the tropomyosin allergen were screened and separately immobilized as ligands on a silicon wafer surface, thus allowing them to capture the tropomyosin allergen. Resulting changes on the wafer surface were visualized in gray scale variation on an ellipsometry image. Images showed that these antibodies are able to recognize the presence of the tropomyosin allergen in shrimp and crab with sensitivity of 1 mg L(-1), and at a detecting time of approximately 30 min for an extracted sample. This preliminary study has shown that the detection of the tropomyosin allergen is rapid and specific when using this type of assay on products containing shrimp and crab.

OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study were to determine the association between gastric reflux and aspiration using the presence of pepsin in oral or tracheal secretions as a marker of reflux or aspiration and to determine the association between the pH (range, 0-14) and the presence of pepsin in oral secretions. METHODS A descriptive correlational study was conducted in mechanically ventilated surgical or medical patients receiving gastric tube feedings. Oral secretions were suctioned hourly and tracheal secretions every 2 to 3 hours for 12-hour periods over 1 to 2 days in 15 patients. RESULTS There were 142 paired samples of oral tracheal secretions. A majority of samples (60%) had the same results, with 32% both pepsin-positive and 27% both pepsin-negative. The range of pH measurements was 4 to 8, with a mean of 6.3 ± 0.05. Ninety oral specimens had a pH of 4 to 6. Forty-seven of the oral specimens with pH measures between 4 and 6 (52%) were pepsin-positive. The correlation of pH percent pepsin-positive oral secretions was not significant. CONCLUSION Aspiration events were more frequent than reflux events. Measurement of actual pepsin concentration to detect new reflux and aspiration events is recommended in future studies. Bedside pH measures of oral secretions are not a valid marker of gastric reflux.","Schallom, Marilyn; Orr, James A; Metheny, Norma; Kirby, John; Pierce, Janet",Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcc.0000000000000096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25650493/,19

This article aimed to investigate the history, virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathophysiology and management of COVID-19 disease, in general, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)-induced kidney damage, in particular. Keywords like SARS-CoV2, COVID-19, renal impairment, sepsis, viremia, etc. were used to find relevant publications from PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and clinical trials registry websites. According to different studies, kidney involvement in COVID-19 typically occurs in patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiorgan failure. The kidney damage in COVID-19 has been shown to be multifactorial, involving direct viral infection, indirect injury by sepsis, hemodynamic alterations, cytokine storm, disseminated intravascular coagulation and other unknown mechanisms. The presence in kidney of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor for the virus, has been proven, but few cases of direct viral presence in kidney tissue have been published. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the exact mechanisms underlying kidney impairment. Since the development of AKI is one of the important risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, optimal management of AKI may improve the outcomes.

Many questions remain about asymptomatic or atypical infections and transmission dynamics. We used comprehensive contact tracing of the first 2 confirmed patients in Illinois with COVID-19 and serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to determine whether contacts had evidence of undetected COVID-19. METHODS Contacts were eligible for serologic follow-up if previously tested for COVID-19 during an initial investigation or had greater-risk exposures. Contacts completed a standardized questionnaire during the initial investigation. We classified exposure risk as high, medium, or low based on interactions with 2 index patients and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Serologic testing used a SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on serum specimens collected from participants approximately 6 weeks after initial exposure to either index patient. The 2 index patients provided serum specimens throughout their illness. We collected data on demographic, exposure, and epidemiologic characteristics. RESULTS Of 347 contacts, 110 were eligible for serologic follow-up; 59 (17% of all contacts) enrolled. Of these, 53 (90%) were health care personnel and 6 (10%) were community contacts. Seventeen (29%) reported high-risk exposures, 15 (25%) medium-risk, and 27 (46%) low-risk. No participant had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The 2 index patients had antibodies detected at dilutions >1:6400 within 4 weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS In serologic follow-up of the first 2 known patients in Illinois with COVID-19, we found no secondary transmission among tested contacts. Lack of seroconversion among these contacts adds to our understanding of conditions (ie, use of PPE) under which SARS-CoV-2 infections might not result in transmission and demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is a useful tool to verify epidemiologic findings.","McPherson, Tristan D; Ghinai, Isaac; Binder, Alison M; Freeman, Brandi D; Hoskin Snelling, Chantel; Hunter, Jennifer C; Anderson, Kristin M; Davenport, Polly; Rudd, Deborah L; Zafer, Mujeeb; Christiansen, Demian; Joshi, Kiran; Rubin, Rachel; Black, Stephanie R; Fricchione, Marielle J; Pacilli, Massimo; Walblay, Kelly A; Korpics, Jacqueline; Moeller, Darcie; Quartey-Kumapley, Pearl; Wang, Chen; Charles, E Matt; Kauerauf, Judy; Patel, Megan T; Disari, Vishal S; Fischer, Marc; Jacobs, Max W; Lester, Sandra N; Midgley, Claire M; Rasheed, Mohammed Ata Ur; Reese, Heather E; Verani, Jennifer R; Wallace, Megan; Watson, John T; Thornburg, Natalie J; Layden, Jennifer E; Kirking, Hannah L",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920966064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108976/,19

RESULTS A total of 456 physiotherapists from 139 countries participated in the study. Most physiotherapists were knowledgeable regarding their role in the management of COVID-19 patients (M = 94.3%; SD = 15.4) and the management of potential COVID-19 patients (M = 84.5%; SD = 20.1). The rating of knowledge and practices of preventive measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 were lower (M = 74.3%; SD = 25.7, and M = 62.5%; SD = 31.3, respectively). Participants from the European region (M = 83; SD = 15.8) had a higher score than participants from the Asia Western Pacific region (M = 78; SD = 18.49; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Physiotherapists are highly knowledgeable about their role in managing COVID-19 patients. Most of them are adopting preventive measures to limit the transmission of the disease. Yet, physiotherapists are required to enroll in medical education, training and infection control workshops and courses to remain updated with the recent advances in such fields.","Al Attar, Wesam Saleh A; Husain, Mohamed A",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-210049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092683/,19
79415,A multiplexed immuno-sensor for on-line and automated monitoring of tissue culture protein biomarkers.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in small bowel (SB). Our aim was to identify factors influencing intestinal ACE2 expression in Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. METHODS Using bulk RNA-seq or microarray transcriptomics from tissue samples (4 SB and 2 colonic cohorts; CD=495; UC=387; non-IBD=94), we analyzed the relationship of ACE2 with demographics, disease activity and prognosis. We examined the outcome of anti-TNF and anti-IL12/IL-23 treatment on SB and colonic ACE2 expression in three clinical trials. Univariate and multivariate regression models were fitted. RESULTS ACE2 levels were consistently reduced in SB CD and elevated in colonic UC, when compared to non-IBD controls. Elevated SB ACE2 was also associated with demographic features (age and elevated BMI) associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes. Within CD, SB ACE2 was reduced in patients subsequently developing complicated disease. Within UC, colonic ACE2 was elevated in active disease and in patients subsequently requiring anti-TNF rescue therapy. SB and colonic ACE2 expression in active CD and UC were restored by anti-cytokine therapy, most notably in responders. CONCLUSIONS Reduced SB, but elevated colonic ACE2 levels in IBD are associated with inflammation and severe disease but normalized following anti-cytokine therapy suggesting compartmentalization of ACE2-related biology in SB and colonic inflammation. The restoration of ACE2 expression with anti-cytokine therapy may be important in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially explain reports of reduced morbidity from COVID-19 in IBD patients treated with anti-cytokines.","Potdar, Alka A; Dube, Shishir; Naito, Takeo; Li, Katherine; Botwin, Gregory; Haritunians, Talin; Li, Dalin; Casero, David; Yang, Shaohong; Bilsborough, Janine; Perrigoue, Jacqueline G; Denson, Lee A; Daly, Mark; Targan, Stephan R; Fleshner, Phillip; Braun, Jonathan; Kugathasan, Subra; Stappenbeck, Thaddeus S; McGovern, Dermot P B",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.10.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160965/,19

Genetic engineering, especially applications of CRISPR, now presents the most publicly-discussed engineering challenges-and not just technical, but ethical as well. In this article, I will use the two most controversial genomic engineering applications to help identify the ethics and human rights implications of these research projects. Each of these techniques directly modifies the mechanisms of evolution, threatens to alter our views of ourselves as humans and our planet as our home, and presents novel informed consent and dual use challenges: human genome editing and gene drives in insects.I begin with a discussion of so far disastrously unsuccessful attempts to regulate germline editing in humans, including a summary of the first application of germline genome editing in humans and its aftermath. I then turn to a discussion of setting ethical standards for a genomic technology that has not yet been deployed in nature-gene drives. Finally, I end by suggesting that human rights can and should be directly applicable to defining the ethics of genomic research.","Annas, George J",American journal of law & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0098858820933492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659189/,19

80658,Network analyses in microbiome based on high-throughput multi-omics data.,2020-02-11,"BACKGROUND Comprehensive stroke centers allow for regionalization of subspecialty stroke care. Efficacy of endovascular treatments, however, may be limited by delays in patient transfer. Our goal was to identify where these delays occurred and to assess the impact of such delays on patient outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS This was a retrospective study evaluating patients treated with endovascular therapy from November 2010 to July 2012 at our institution. We compared patients transferred from outside hospitals with locally treated patients with respect to demographics, imaging, and treatment times. Good outcomes, as defined by 90-day modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2, were analyzed by transfer status as well as time from initial computed tomography to groin puncture (""picture-to-puncture"" time). A total of 193 patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 65.8 ± 14.5 years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 19 (interquartile range, 15-23). More than two thirds of the patients (132 [68%]) were treated from referring facilities. Outside transfers were noted to have longer picture-to-puncture times (205 minutes [interquartile range, 162-274] versus 89 minutes [interquartile range, 70-119]; P<0.001), which was attributable to the delays in transfer. This corresponded to fewer patients with favorable Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores on preprocedural computed tomographic imaging (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Scores >7: 50% versus 76%; P<0.001) and significantly worse clinical outcomes (29% versus 51%; P=0.003). In a logistic regression model, picture-to-puncture times were independently associated with good outcomes (odds ratio, 0.994; 95% confidence interval, 0.990-0.999; P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS Delays in picture-to-puncture times for interhospital transfers reduce the probability of good outcomes among treated patients. Strategies to reduce such delays herald an opportunity for hospitals to improve patient outcomes.","Sun, Chung-Huan J; Nogueira, Raul G; Glenn, Brenda A; Connelly, Kerrin; Zimmermann, Susan; Anda, Kim; Camp, Deborah; Frankel, Michael R; Belagaje, Samir R; Anderson, Aaron M; Isakov, Alexander P; Gupta, Rishi",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.112.000506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393011/,19

However, whether this dominant variant can potentially spread through the cold chain and whether the spike protein affects virus stability after cold storage remain unclear. To compare the infectivity of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein with the D614 mutation (S-D614) and G614 mutation (S-G614), after different periods of refrigeration (4°C) and freezing (-20°C). We also determined the integrity of the viral RNA and the ability of the spike protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after storage at these conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at -20°C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant. Stability and infectivity are related to each other, and the higher stability of S-G614 compared to that of S-D614 may contribute to rapid viral spread of the S-G614 variant.IMPORTANCE It has been observed that variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. A SARS-CoV-2 S-D614G variant is currently the most dominant variant in circulation and is associated with enhanced infectivity. We compared the stability of two SARS-CoV-2 variants: the early S-D614 variant carrying the D614 spike protein and the new S-G614 variant carrying the G614 spike protein, stored at both 4°C and -20°C for different periods. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity. Therefore, precautions should be taken during and after handling food preserved under cold conditions.","Huang, Sheng-Yu; Kung, Yu-An; Huang, Peng-Nien; Chang, Sheng-Yun; Gong, Yu-Nong; Han, Yi-Ju; Chiang, Huan-Jung; Liu, Kuan-Ting; Lee, Kuo-Ming; Chang, Chia-Yu; Chang, Chia-Ching; Huang, Chung-Guei; Shih, Shin-Ru",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00104-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789940/,19
83331,New insights into the nuclear localization of retroviral Gag proteins.,2011,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Approximately 30% of strokes are cryptogenic despite an exhaustive in-hospital work-up. Analysis of clot composition following endovascular treatment could provide insight into stroke etiology. T-cells already have been shown to be a major component of vulnerable atherosclerotic carotid lesions. We therefore hypothesize that T-cell content in intracranial thrombi may also be a biomarker of atherothrombotic origin. MATERIALS AND METHODS We histopathologically investigated 54 consecutive thrombi retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy in acute stroke patients. First, thrombi were classified as fibrin-dominant, erythrocyte-dominant or mixed pattern. We then performed quantitative analysis of CD3+ cells on immunohistochemically-stained thrombi and compared T-cell content between ""atherothrombotic"", ""cardioembolism"" and ""other causes"" stroke subtypes. RESULTS Fourteen (26%) thrombi were defined as fibrin-dominant, 15 (28%) as erythrocyte-dominant, 25 (46%) as mixed. The stroke cause was defined as ""atherothrombotic"" in 10 (18.5%), ""cardioembolism"" in 25 (46.3%), and ""other causes"" in 19 (35.2%). Number of T-cells was significantly higher in thrombi from the ""atherothrombotic"" group (53.60 ± 28.78) than in the other causes (21.77 ± 18.31; p<0.0005) or the ""cardioembolism"" group (20.08 ± 15.66; p<0.0003). CONCLUSIONS The CD3+ T-cell count in intracranial thrombi was significantly higher in ""atherothrombotic"" origin strokes compared to all other causes. Thrombi with high content of CD3+ cells are more likely to originate from an atherosclerotic plaque.","Dargazanli, Cyril; Rigau, Valérie; Eker, Omer; Riquelme Bareiro, Carlos; Machi, Paolo; Gascou, Grégory; Arquizan, Caroline; Ayrignac, Xavier; Mourand, Isabelle; Corlobé, Astrid; Lobotesis, Kyriakos; Molinari, Nicolas; Costes, Valérie; Bonafé, Alain; Costalat, Vincent",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0154945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27152622/,19

Improved rapid diagnosis and antimicrobial resistance determination, such as by whole genome sequencing, are required. Our aim was to develop a simple, low-cost method of preparing DNA for sequencing direct from MTB positive clinical samples (without culture). Simultaneous sputum liquefaction, bacteria heat-inactivation (99°C/30min) and enrichment for Mycobacteria DNA was achieved using an equal volume of thermo-protection buffer (4M KCl, 0.05M HEPES buffer pH7.5, 0.1% DTT). The buffer emulated intracellular conditions found in hyperthermophiles, thus protecting DNA from rapid thermo-degradation, which renders it a poor template for sequencing. Initial validation experiments employed Mycobacteria DNA, either extracted or intracellular. Next, mock clinical samples (infection-negative human sputum spiked 0-105 BCG cells/ml) underwent liquefaction in thermo-protection buffer and heat-inactivation. DNA was extracted and sequenced. Human DNA degraded faster than Mycobacteria DNA, resulting in target enrichment. Four replicate experiments achieved MTB detection at 101 BCG cells/ml, with 31-59 MTB complex reads. Maximal genome coverage (>97% at 5x-depth) occurred at 104 BCG cells/ml; >91% coverage (1x depth) at 103 BCG cells/ml. Final validation employed MTB positive clinical samples (n=20), revealing initial sample volumes ≥1ml typically yielded higher mean depth of MTB genome coverage, the overall range 0.55-81.02. A mean depth of 3 gave >96% one-fold TB genome coverage (in 15/20 clinical samples). A mean depth of 15 achieved >99% five-fold genome coverage (in 9/20 clinical samples). In summary, direct-from-sample sequencing of MTB genomes was facilitated by a low cost thermo-protection buffer.","George, Sophie; Xu, Yifei; Rodger, Gillian; Morgan, Marcus; Sanderson, Nicholas D; Hoosdally, Sarah J; Thulborn, Samantha; Robinson, Esther; Rathod, Priti; Walker, A Sarah; Peto, Timothy E A; Crook, Derrick W; Dingle, Kate E",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00670-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719032/,19

METHODS A retrospective cross-sectional study compared women who gave birth between March and April 2020 (first wave), between July to September 2020 (second wave), and a matched historical cohort throughout 2017-2019 (groups A, B, and C, respectively). Primary outcomes were postpartum length of stay (LOS), presentations to the emergency department (ED), and readmissions 30 days or longer after discharge. Following Bonferroni correction, P<0.016 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In total, 3377 women were included: 640, 914, and 1823 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. LOS after birth (both vaginal and cesarean) was shorter in groups A and B compared to the control group (2.28±1.01 and 2.25±0.93 vs 2.55±1.10 days, P<0.001). Rates of ED presentations 30 days after discharge were higher in groups C and B compared to group A (6.63% and 6.45% vs 3.12%, P=0.006). Rates of readmissions 30 days after discharge were 0.78%, 1.42%, and 1.09% (groups A, B, and C, respectively), demonstrating no statistical difference (P=0.408). CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction or no change in rates of ED presentations and readmissions, despite the shortened LOS after delivery.

The aims of this study were to (1) describe the prepartum and calf-rearing systems, as well as the management practices that may influence calf welfare in pastured dairy herds in Uruguay, (2) estimate the annual calf mortality risk from birth to weaning, and (3) identify the primary clinical disease syndromes shown by the calves before death. A survey comprising a farm visit and a questionnaire was conducted on 225 randomly selected dairies with >30 milking cows, in 3 strata (31-99, 100-299, and ≥300 milking cows) of 6 Uruguayan departments where dairies are concentrated. Retrospective information from July 2013 to June 2014 was collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and results were inferred into the national dairy cattle population. Several management practices that could contribute to poor calf welfare were identified in a large proportion of farms. The annual calf mortality risk (calves that died between birth and weaning/calves born death or alive × 100, n = 149 farms) was 15.2%. Age at weaning averaged 75 d. Farmers reported that the most common clinical syndromes were diarrhea and respiratory disease in 85.2% and 47.5% of the farms, respectively. There was no continuous veterinary advice in 61.3% of the farms, 20.0% lacked data records, 38.5% had poor drainage in the prepartum area with waterlogging after rainfall, 52.1% monitored the prepartum area ≤2 times per day during the calving season, 65.1% did not perform navel antisepsis on newborns, 62.3% separated the calves from their dams at >24 h postpartum, 95.2% did not have a colostrum management program, 72.4% did not rotate the calf-rearing areas, 59.0% did not disinfect the calf feeders, 85.7% did not have staff dedicated exclusively to calf rearing, and 39.8% did not separate sick from healthy calves. The average volume of milk or milk replacer offered per calf was 4.5 L/day. Several of the identified management practices that affect calf welfare in the prepartum and calf-rearing periods could explain the high mortality risk.

Many societies issued guidelines to suspend or postpone nonemergent surgeries. Methods We reviewed the emerging evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 infection in neurosurgery and the postponement of elective surgeries. Results and Observations COVID-19 infection poses serious threat in hospitals in the form of cross-infection, hospital staff falling sick, with potential risk to overwhelm or paralyze the healthcare. In addition, we have come to realize the significant perioperative morbidity and mortality secondary to active COVID-19 infection. All these strongly favor suspension of elective neurosurgical services. However, these have to be weighed against the fallout due to prolonged postponement of neurosurgical treatment for conditions, which can progress and cause neurological deterioration. Conclusion This article discusses the contemporary published literature regarding the perioperative risk of COVID-19 infection, impact of postponed surgeries, challenges, risk assessment and guidelines for elective neurosurgery at this point of time.","Arimappamagan, Arivazhagan; Vilanilam, George; Pandey, Paritosh",Neurology India,https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.310113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642265/,19
88377,Proteomic analysis of endothelial cell autoantigens recognized by anti-dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 antibodies.,2009,"Rapid, accurate, reliable and risk-free tracking of pathogenic microorganism at single-cell level is critical to achieve efficient source control and prevent outbreaks of microbiological infectious diseases. In this work, we first reported a promising potential of integrating the concepts of remarkable large Stokes shift and dual-recognition into a single matrix for developing pathogenic microorganism stimuli-responsive ratiometric ﬂuorescent nanoprobe with speediness, cost-efficiency, stability, ultrahigh specificity and sensitivity. As a proof-of-concept, we selected Gram-positive bacterium Staph-ylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as the targeting analyte model, which easily bound to its recognition aptamer and broad-spectrum glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (Van). To improve the speciﬁcity and short sample-to-answer time, we em-ployed the classic noncovalent - stacking interactions as a driving force to trigger Van and aptamer dual-functionalized near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence Apt-Van-QDs to bind to the surface of an unreported blue fluorescence of -rich electronic carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), achieving S. aureus stimuli-responsive ratiometric nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs. In the assembly of Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs, the blue CNPs (energy donor) and NIR Apt-Van-QDs (energy acceptor) got close to occur fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, leading to a remarkable blue fluorescence quenching for CNPs at ~ 465 nm and a clear NIR fluorescence enhancement for Apt-Van-QDs at ~ 725 nm. In the presence of S. aureus, the FRET process from CNPs to Apt-Van-QDs was disrupted, rendering nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs to display a ratiometric fluo-rescent response to S. aureus, which exhibited ~ 260 nm large Stokes shift and rapid sample-to-answer detection time (~ 30.0 min). As expected, the nanoprobe Apt-Van-QDs@CNPs showed an ultrahigh specificity for ratiometric fluorescent de-tection of S. aureus with a promising detection limit of 1.0 CFU/mL, allowing the assay at single-cell level. Moreover, we also carried out the precise analysis of S. aureus in actual samples with acceptable results. We believe that this work can give a new insight into the rational design of efficient ratiometric nanoprobes for rapidly on-site accurate screening of pathogenic microorganism at single-cell level in the early stages, especially during the worldwide spread of COVID-19 today.","Shen, Yizhong; Wu, Tingting; Zhang, Yiyin; Ling, Na; Zheng, Libing; Zhang, Shao-Lin; Sun, Yidan; Wang, Xiaohong; Ye, Yingwang",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867467/,19
88507,"Endophytic actinobacteria: Diversity, secondary metabolism and mechanisms to unsilence biosynthetic gene clusters.",2017,"PURPOSE Unambiguous evaluation of glioblastoma (GB) progression is crucial, both for clinical trials as well as day by day routine management of GB patients. 3D-volumetry in the follow-up of GB provides quantitative data on tumor extent and growth, and therefore has the potential to facilitate objective disease assessment. The present study investigated the utility of absolute changes in volume (delta) or regional, segmentation-based subtractions for detecting disease progression in longitudinal MRI follow-ups. METHODS 165 high resolution 3-Tesla MRIs of 30 GB patients (23m, mean age 60.2y) were retrospectively included in this single center study. Contrast enhancement (CV) and tumor-related signal alterations in FLAIR images (FV) were semi-automatically segmented. Delta volume (dCV, dFV) and regional subtractions (sCV, sFV) were calculated. Disease progression was classified for every follow-up according to histopathologic results, decisions of the local multidisciplinary CNS tumor board and a consensus rating of the neuro-radiologic report. RESULTS A generalized logistic mixed model for disease progression (yes / no) with dCV, dFV, sCV and sFV as input variables revealed that only dCV was significantly associated with prediction of disease progression (P = .005). Delta volume had a better accuracy than regional, segmentation-based subtractions (79% versus 72%) and a higher area under the curve by trend in ROC curves (.83 versus .75).

We aim to analyze the trends and types of services provided by APPs in otolaryngology. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Physician and Other Supplier Public Use Files, 2012-2017. METHODS The Medicare database was searched for 13 commonly used otolaryngology-specific Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, and 10 evaluation and management (E/M) codes were evaluated by provider type. Changes in code utilization were compared between physicians and APPs over time. RESULTS From 2012 to 2017, there was a 51% increase in the number of otolaryngology APPs, compared to a 2.2% increase in physician providers. APPs increased their share of new and established patient visits from 4% to 7%d 11% to 15%, respectively. There was not a significant difference over time in number of patient visits performed annually per provider according to provider type. The increase in number of APP vs physician providers was significantly greater for every procedure except for balloon sinus dilation and tympanostomy tube placement. CONCLUSION Due to increasing numbers, APPs are accounting for more patient visits and procedures over time. The physician workforce and the numbers of procedures performed per physician have remained relatively stable from 2012 to 2017. Increasing complexity of patients seen and a broader range of procedures offered by work-experienced or postgraduate-trained APPs may further improve access to health care in the face of possible physician shortages.","Ge, Marshall; Kim, Jee-Hong; Smith, Stephanie Shintani; Paul, Julianna; Park, Christine; Su, Peiyi; Ference, Elisabeth H",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820971186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33228442/,19

Thus, the current report examined whether cyberbullying processes and frequency are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared US adult participant data from six months before the start of the pandemic (July 2019; n = 181) to data collected in the middle of the pandemic (May, 2020; n = 173) to determine if there are any significant differences in anonymity perceptions, belief in the irrelevance of muscularity for online bullying (BIMOB), cyberbullying attitudes, and cyberbullying perpetration. Results showed that there were significant increases in BIMOB, cyberbullying attitudes, and cyberbullying perpetration during the pandemic, but no significant change for anonymity perceptions. Further, the relationships between several variables germane to cyberbullying perpetration prediction were stronger during the pandemic than before. Overall, these findings add to our understanding of the behavioral impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on US adults.","Barlett, Christopher P; Simmers, Matthew M; Roth, Brendan; Gentile, Douglas",The Journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2021.1918619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128768/,19
89203,Triterpenoid gene expression and phytochemical content in Iranian licorice under salinity stress.,2019,"OBJECTIVES The emergence of a new coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 from China led to a global pandemic. The lack of herd immunity against this virus and the possibility of viral spread from asymptomatic individuals is still a major challenge for the prevention of viral transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the virus in different bodily secretions as a potential source of viral spread among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS The study included 38 COVID-19 patients with a positive real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from the combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples. Saliva, tear and cerumen samples were taken from the patients within 72 hours of the first RT-PCR test. SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 gene regions were studied with single-step RT-PCR in all samples. RESULTS Among the studied samples, the highest positivity rate was in saliva (76.3%) followed by tears (55.3%) and cerumen (39.5%). Viral load in saliva was also significantly higher compared to tears and cerumen (p<0.001), while there was no significant difference between tears and cerumen. Higher viral load in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples was associated with higher viral load in tears, but not in saliva or cerumen. Half of the saliva, tear and cerumen samples obtained from asymptomatic patients contained SARS-CoV-2 genome. CONCLUSION The virus was detected in the saliva, tears and cerumen samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The potential role of these bodily fluids on viral spread needs to be studied.","Hanege, Fatih Mehmet; Kocoglu, Esra; Kalcioglu, M Tayyar; Celik, Serdal; Cag, Yasemin; Esen, Fehim; Bayindir, Eray; Pence, Sadrettin; Alp Mese, Emine; Agalar, Canan",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.29218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33094833/,19

However, their efficacy, in particular for mRNA, remains hampered by poor cellular delivery and limited endosomal escape. Development and optimisation of delivery vectors, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), are impeded by limited screening methods to probe the intracellular processing of LNPs in sufficient detail. We have developed a high-throughput imaging-based endosomal escape assay utilising a Galectin-9 reporter and fluorescently labelled mRNA to probe correlations between nanoparticle-mediated uptake, endosomal escape frequency, and mRNA translation. Furthermore, this assay has been integrated within a screening platform for optimisation of lipid nanoparticle formulations. We show that Galectin-9 recruitment is a robust, quantitative reporter of endosomal escape events induced by different mRNA delivery nanoparticles and small molecules. We identify nanoparticles with superior escape properties and demonstrate cell line variances in endosomal escape response, highlighting the need for fine-tuning of delivery formulations for specific applications.","Munson, Michael J; O'Driscoll, Gwen; Silva, Andreia M; Lázaro-Ibáñez, Elisa; Gallud, Audrey; Wilson, John T; Collén, Anna; Esbjörner, Elin K; Sabirsh, Alan",Communications biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-021-01728-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594247/,19

Since ICD 11 is planned to come into effect and be officially used as from January 1st, 2022, this early sneak peek allows health care professionals enough time to prepare for the new classification and all the changes it brings along. ICD 11 moves away from stigmatizing practices of psychiatrization of transgender persons and finally excludes issues of gender identity from the chapter on mental and behavioral disorders. This reconceptualization consequently sets the stage for different roles of psychiatrists in meeting transgender patients' health care needs. This article addresses the most important changes to the ICD related to Gender incongruence, a new nosological entity formerly known as Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria. The paper offers an overview of the current and future positions of transgender health issues through contemporary medical conceptualization and classification. It aims to eliminate barriers to quality care for transgender patients, by attending to the recognized knowledge gaps and by providing recommendations for psychiatrists and other health care professionals who commonly receive low levels of exposure to transgender content in their education.","Dakić, Tea",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796778/,19

We report our mid-term experience with this device. METHODS Between January 2015 and February 2016, we retrospectively identified, in our prospectively maintained database, all patients treated with p64 FDs in two institutions. Independent clinical follow-up was performed by a vascular neurologist. Imaging follow-up included a digitalized subtraction angiography (DSA) at 3, 6, and 12 months and a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 12 months. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients (22 women/17 men; median age 54 years) with 48 IAs (median aneurysm size 6.2 mm; mean neck size 3.4 mm) were identified. All IAs were saccular and unruptured. Failure of safe stent delivery occurred in 15% of cases (7/48 IAs) which were excluded. Transient neurological morbidity occurred in 2/35 patients (5.7%) including one delayed thromboembolic complication. No permanent morbidity or mortality was encountered. Complete aneurysmal occlusion at 3, 6, and 12 months was 20/30 (66.6%), 18/27 (66.6%), and 24/28 (85.7%), respectively. Intra-stent stenosis was observed in 9/29 patients (31%) and classified as moderate in 4/29 (13.7%) and mild in 5/29 patients (17.2%). These stenoses gradually improved over time, with only mild stenoses being identified at 6 months and at 12 months. CONCLUSION In our small case series, the p64 FD stent appears safe and effective for EVT of IAs. A high occlusion rate and a low morbidity rate were observed.","Morais, Ricardo; Mine, Benjamin; Bruyère, Pierre Julien; Naeije, Gilles; Lubicz, Boris",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-017-1786-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236050/,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS Male patients with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome and matched controls were asked to provide initial, midstream and post-prostatic massage urine specimens. Specimens were analyzed with Ibis T-5000 Universal Biosensor technology to provide comprehensive identification of bacterial and select fungal species. Differences between urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome and control study participants for the presence of species or species variation in a higher taxonomic grouping (genus) were evaluated using permutational multivariate analysis of variance and logistic regression. RESULTS Initial and midstream urine specimens were obtained from 110 (post-prostatic massage urine in 67) participants with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome and 115 (post-prostatic massage urine in 62) controls. Overall 78, 73 and 54 species (42, 39 and 27 genera) were detected in initial, midstream and post-prostatic massage urine specimens, respectively. Mean (SD) initial, midstream and post-prostatic massage urine species count per person was 1.62 (1.28), 1.38 (1.36) and 1.33 (1.24) for cases, and 1.75 (1.32), 1.23 (1.15) and 1.56 (0.97) for controls, respectively. Overall species and genus composition differed significantly between participants with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome and controls in initial stream urine (p=0.002 species level, p=0.004 genus level), with Burkholderia cenocepacia overrepresented in urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome. No significant differences were observed at any level in midstream or post-prostatic massage urine samples. CONCLUSIONS Assessment of baseline culture-independent microbiological data from male subjects enrolled in the MAPP Network has identified overrepresentation of B. cenocepacia in urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Future studies are planned to further evaluate microbiota associations with variable and changing urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome symptom patterns.","Nickel, J Curtis; Stephens, Alisa; Landis, J Richard; Chen, Jun; Mullins, Chris; van Bokhoven, Adrie; Lucia, M Scott; Melton-Kreft, Rachael; Ehrlich, Garth D",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2015.01.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596358/,19

Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a well-established treatment option for the treatment of several viral infections. This in silico study was conducted to target the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 as a target site for aPDT. Methods: SARS-CoV-2-RBD was selected as a novel target for indocyanine green (ICG) as a photosensitizer during aPDT to exploit its molecular modeling, hierarchical nature of protein structure, and physico-chemical properties using several bioinformatic tools. The binding mode of the RBD to ICG was assessed via protein-ligand docking. Results: The results of a computational biology analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2-RBD has 223 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25098.40 Da. RBD is most similar to 6W41 with an E-value of 4e-167, identity of 100%, and query cover of 100%. The aliphatic index of the RBD protein sequences was 71.61, suggesting that the protein is stable in a broad spectrum of temperatures. The predicted structure of RBD showed that it is a protein with a positive charge and a random coil structure (69.51%). Four ligands were modeled in this entry, including one N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAG), one glycerol (GOL), and two sulfate ions (SO4 ), to which ICG desires to bind in the molecular docking analysis. Conclusion: Molecular modeling and simulation analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2-RBD could be a substrate for binding to ICG during aPDT to control the spread of COVID-19.","Pourhajibagher, Maryam; Bahador, Abbas",Journal of lasers in medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.34172/jlms.2020.68; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425294/,19

We report a novel method for studying the dynamics of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacterial transit through the worms' intestine. A microfluidic chip was designed for alternating C. elegans on-chip culture and immobilization, thereby enabling periodic high-resolution time-lapse imaging at single-worm resolution over several days. Immobilization was achieved in a reversible way using arrays of tapered channels suitable for assay parallelization. Dedicated C. elegans feeding protocols were applied. Two E. coli bacterial strains, HT115 and OP50, respectively labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP), were used as food source and imaged with fluorescence microscopy techniques to measure relevant parameters of the bacterial transit process. Feeding behavior and E. coli transit dynamics in the whole intestinal tract of the worms were characterized in an automated way over the first 3 days of adulthood, revealing both fast transit phenomena and variations in microbial accumulation. In particular, we studied the bacterial food transit periodicity in wild-type and eat-2 (ad465) mutant C. elegans strains in both trapped and free-swimming conditions. In order to further demonstrate the versatility of our microfluidic platform, we also studied drug-induced modifications of the bacterial transit by measuring the response of the worms' intestine to exposure to the neurotransmitter serotonin.","Viri, Vittorio; Cornaglia, Matteo; Atakan, Huseyin Baris; Lehnert, Thomas; Gijs, Martin A M",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0lc00064g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633746/,19

To the best of our knowledge, persistent peripheral pain as a key factor for the development of neuromuscular activity impairments has not been analyzed. A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out. A total of 90 women were included and allocated to three groups: (i) 30 women with persistent peripheral pain after breast cancer treatment, (ii) 30 women without pain after breast cancer treatment, and (iii) 30 healthy women. Surface electromyography was employed to measure the onset and amplitude of the muscle activity of three shoulder movements. Statistically significant differences were found in the neuromuscular activity for all the muscles and shoulder movements among women with persistent pain versus healthy women (i.e., amplitude muscle activity variable p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were also observed in the neuromuscular activity for certain muscles in shoulder movements among women with persistent pain versus women without pain, as well as between women without pain versus healthy women. Therefore, following breast cancer treatment, women showed alterations in their shoulder neuromuscular activity, which were more significant if persistent pain existed. These findings may contribute to developing a selective therapeutic exercise program that optimizes the shoulder neuromuscular activity in women after breast cancer treatment.","Prieto-Gómez, Virginia; Navarro-Brazález, Beatriz; Sánchez-Méndez, Óscar; de-la-Villa, Pedro; Sánchez-Sánchez, Beatriz; Torres-Lacomba, María",Journal of clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9061804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531893/,19

The impact of uterine sliding sign has not been previously demonstrated in this practice setting. METHODS Physicians' remote interpretations of transvaginal ultrasound examinations in 2016, before uterine sliding sign, were compared to examinations in 2019 after addition of uterine sliding sign to determine the diagnostic rates. Surgical and histopathological results were reviewed to determine sensitivity and specificity of the respective exam techniques. RESULTS Two hundred eighty-five transvaginal ultrasounds were performed in 2016 and 390 sliding sign ultrasounds in 2019. The number of deeply infiltrating endometriosis cases identified increased significantly from 2% to 6% during the study period (chi-square, Fisher's exact test p = .012).

Whether youth will conform to these strategies is unclear. METHODS We leverage data on 1,152 youth's mask-wearing and social-distancing behaviors from observations of five in-person live-streamed high school graduations from one U.S. public school district in July 2020. Multiple researchers took ethnographic field notes and systematically recorded public health behaviors for each graduation. We also use data from the local public health department, school district, newspapers, community observations, and the National Center for Education Statistics. We then conducted a descriptive quantitative analysis of mask-wearing status by gender, ethnicity, and school, along with a qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS Nearly 70% of students wore their masks properly while receiving their diploma, although 9.6% wore no mask and 18.7% struggled with mask fit. Almost all students removed masks for graduation photos after adults suggested they should, although 80% of them were wearing their mask properly before the photo. We found significant school variation, but no gender or ethnic variation in student mask-wearing. School variation aligned with political themes of student speeches and in adult commitment to safety measures. Student speakers at all schools mentioned altruistic concern about COVID-19. All schools struggled with social distancing throughout the ceremony, except when students were seated in socially distanced chairs. CONCLUSIONS This study provides important insights into youth conformity to COVID-19 guidelines and strategies to protect public health during in-person schooling.","Mueller, Anna S; Diefendorf, Sarah; Abrutyn, Seth; Beardall, Katherine A; Millar, Krystina; O'Reilly, Lauren; Steinberg, Hillary; Watkins, James T",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.12.123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500195/,19

In order to improve accuracy and confidence in targeting tumors, many centers rely on fiducial implantation. We evaluated the migration of a novel fiducial marker specifically designed for lung tissue implanted via electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB). METHODS We retrospectively quantified the individual and group migrations of SuperLock nitinol coil fiducials for 15 patients receiving lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), in order to evaluate the reliability of using these fiducials as a target surrogate for cases where tumors cannot be clearly delineated on cone beam CTs (CBCTs). For each fraction, we compared the individual and group migrations of the fiducials between the planning CT and the acquired CBCT. The group migration was defined as the distance between the centroids of the fiducial group and GTV. RESULTS A total of 16 lung targets were included in our study for these 15 patients (one patient with two targets). Of 55 fiducials placed, we observed a 100% retention rate. The mean individual migration was 1.87 mm (range, 0.63-5.25 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.26 mm. The mean group migration was 1.94 mm (range, 0.03-6.19 mm) with a standard deviation of 1.45 mm. Overall, there was minimal change in the relative locations of the markers with respect to each other, as well as to the target. CONCLUSIONS We found that the SuperLock nitinol coil fiducial marker positions are stable throughout the radiation treatment, and can be used as a reliable surrogate to target, and to avoid geometric misses during gated treatments.","Rong, Yi; Bazan, Jose G; Sekhon, Ashley; Haglund, Karl; Xu-Welliver, Meng; Williams, Terence",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26158847/,19

In the present work, liquid chromatographic and liquid-liquid chromatographic separation with high peak resolution of structural isomeric oleanolic acid and ursolic acid using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as mobile phase additive was successfully achieved, respectively. A high peak resolution, RS=8.143, was achieved for the two structural isomeric compounds by conventional reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, which was greatly improved compared with the published values. Meanwhile, a biphasic solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-0.1 mol/L hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (9:1:10, v/v) was selected for liquid-liquid chromatography, which provided a high peak resolution, RS = 6.573, for analytical apparatus and Rs = 8.500 for semi-preparative apparatus after optimization by liquid-liquid extractions. Two elution modes including reverse phase mode and normal phase mode were investigated for preparative separation of two acids from crude exact of Eriobotrya japonica Thunb. Furthermore, the inclusion complex between each of the two structural isomers and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin were also investigated for high performance liquid chromatography and liquid-liquid chromatography, respectively, in which formation constants were determined for oleanolic acid and ursolic acid.","Wang, Chaoyue; Wang, Xiang; Zhao, Shanshan; Zuo, Guanglei; Xu, Min; Tong, Shengqiang",Journal of chromatography.

To investigate the cellular origin of this cancer, we first report a strategy using fluorescence-activated cell sorting fractionation that could highly enrich bronchiolar Clara and alveolar type II cells, respectively. The EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells (bronchiolar origin) were more enriched with tumorigenic cells in generating secondary tumors than EpCAM(+)MHCII(+) cells (alveolar origin) in primary tumors that had been already initiated with oncogenic Kras activation. In addition, secondary tumors derived from EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells showed diversity of tumor locations compared with those derived from EpCAM(+)MHCII(+) cells. In the alveolar region, secondary tumors from EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells expressed not only bronchiolar epithelial marker, panCK, but also differentiation marker, proSPC, consistent with the notion that cancer-initiating cells display not only the abilities for self-renewal but also the features of differentiation to generate heterogeneous tumors with phenotypic diversity. Furthermore, high level of ERK1/2 activation and colony-forming ability as well as lack of Sprouty-2 expression were also observed in EpCAM(+)MHCII(-) cells. Therefore, these results suggest that bronchiolar Clara cells are the origin of cells and tumorigenesis for Kras(G12D)-induced neoplasia in the lungs.","Cho, Huan-Chieh; Lai, Chao-Yang; Shao, Li-En; Yu, John",Cancer research,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-11-0903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22088965/,19

Because of increased contact between bats, humans, and other animal species, the possibility exists for further cross-species transmissions and ensuing disease outbreaks. We describe here full and partial viral genomes identified using metagenomics in the guano of bats from California and Texas. A total of 34% and 58% of 390,000 sequence reads from bat guano in California and Texas, respectively, were related to eukaryotic viruses, and the largest proportion of those infect insects, reflecting the diet of these insectivorous bats, including members of the viral families Dicistroviridae, Iflaviridae, Tetraviridae, and Nodaviridae and the subfamily Densovirinae. The second largest proportion of virus-related sequences infects plants and fungi, likely reflecting the diet of ingested insects, including members of the viral families Luteoviridae, Secoviridae, Tymoviridae, and Partitiviridae and the genus Sobemovirus. Bat guano viruses related to those infecting mammals comprised the third largest group, including members of the viral families Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Poxviridae, Astroviridae, and Coronaviridae. No close relative of known human viral pathogens was identified in these bat populations. Phylogenetic analysis was used to clarify the relationship to known viral taxa of novel sequences detected in bat guano samples, showing that some guano viral sequences fall outside existing taxonomic groups. This initial characterization of the bat guano virome, the first metagenomic analysis of viruses in wild mammals using second-generation sequencing, therefore showed the presence of previously unidentified viral species, genera, and possibly families. Viral metagenomics is a useful tool for genetically characterizing viruses present in animals with the known capability of direct or indirect viral zoonosis to humans.","Li, Linlin; Victoria, Joseph G; Wang, Chunlin; Jones, Morris; Fellers, Gary M; Kunz, Thomas H; Delwart, Eric",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00501-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20463061/,19

Such a refining of the accepted disease paradigm is urgently needed as thinking on therapeutic targets is currently under active reconsideration. We feel that generalised airway wall ""inflammation"" is unduly over-emphasised, and highlight the patchy and variable nature of the pathology (with the core being airway remodelling). In addition, we present evidence for airway wall disease in smokers/COPD as including a hypocellular, hypovascular, destructive, fibrotic pathology, with a likely spectrum of epithelial-mesenchymal transition states as significant drivers of this remodelling. Furthermore, we present data from a number of research modalities and integrate this with the aetiology of lung cancer, the role of chronic airway luminal colonisation/infection by a specific group of ""respiratory"" bacteria in smokers (which results in luminal inflammation) and the central role for oxidative stress on the epithelium. We suggest translation of these insights into more focus on asymptomatic smokers and early COPD, with the potential for fresh preventive and therapeutic approaches.","Walters, E Haydn; Shukla, Shakti D; Mahmood, Malik Q; Ward, Chris",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0364-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039673/,19

Materials and Methods For this institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, adult patients with healthy livers (n = 24) or various stages of hepatitis C virus-induced chronic liver disease (n = 70) with routine nonenhanced and portal venous phase contrast agent-enhanced liver CT imaging with thick-section (5.0 mm) and thin-section (1.25-1.50 mm) axial images obtained between January 1, 2006, and March 31, 2011, were identified from the electronic medical records. A computer algorithm was developed to measure LSN and derive a score. LSN scores, splenic volume, and the ratio of left lateral segment (LLS) to total liver volume (TLV) were measured from the same multiphasic liver CT examinations. Accuracy for differentiating cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Intra- and interobserver agreement was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. Results Median LSN scores from nonenhanced thick-section CT images in cirrhotic livers (3.16; 56 livers) were significantly higher than in noncirrhotic livers (2.11; 38 livers; P < .001). LSN scores from the four CT imaging types (94 patients for each type) were very strongly correlated (range of Spearman r, 0.929-0.960). LSN scores from portal venous phase contrast-enhanced thick-section CT images had significantly higher accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.929) than splenic volume (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.835) or LLS-to-TLV ratio measurements (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.753) for differentiating cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers (P = .038 and .003, respectively; n = 94). Intra- and interobserver agreements that used nonenhanced thick CT images were very good (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.963 and 0.899, respectively). Conclusion Quantitative measurement of LSN on routine CT images accurately differentiated cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers and was highly reproducible.

This study aimed to describe quality of life outcomes after laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair with a minimum of 2 years follow-up. STUDY DESIGN We prospectively evaluated 293 patients who had laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal groin hernia repair in an IRB-approved study. The Short-Form 36-item Health Survey (version 2), Surgical Outcomes Measurement System, and Carolinas Comfort Scale were administered pre- and postoperatively. Pairwise comparisons using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test were made between time points. RESULTS Mean patient age was 56 ± 15 years and 93% were male; 80% of patients presented with painful hernias and 15% of hernias were recurrent. Mean operative time was 43 ± 16 minutes. No operative complications occurred. Mean duration of narcotic pain medication use was 2.5 ± 3.4 days, and daily activities were resumed and return to work occurred 5.4 ± 4.4 days and 5.4 ± 3.9 days post operation, respectively. Recurrence rate was 2%. The Short-Form 36-item Health Survey outcomes improved from baseline for domains of Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to Physical Health, and Pain at 2 years post operation; Surgical Outcomes Measurement System outcomes improved for domains of Pain Impact on Quality of Life, Body Image, and Patient Satisfaction (p ≤ 0.05). The percentage of patients reporting no or mild but not bothersome symptoms on the Carolinas Comfort Scale at 2 years post operation for sensation of mesh, pain, and movement limitations were 98%, 95%, and 97%, respectively.

The aim of this randomized study was to compare the effect of three types of fixation devices on postoperative pain, patient quality of life, and hernia recurrence. METHODS Patients with ventral hernias between 2 and 7 cm were randomized into one of three mesh fixation groups: permanent tacks (Protack™), absorbable tacks (Securestrap™), and absorbable synthetic glue (Glubran™). The primary endpoint was pain on the second postoperative day, measured on a visual analogue scale. Quality of life and recurrence rate were secondary endpoints and investigated through questionnaires and clinical examination at follow-up visits 1, 6, and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS Seventy-five non-consecutive patients were included in the study, with 25 patients in each group. There was no significant difference between groups for unspecified pain on the second postoperative day (p = 0.250). The DoloTest™ values were 55.3 ± 28.9 mm, 43.5 ± 28.5 mm, and 55.9 ± 26.3 mm for permanent tacks, absorbable tacks, and synthetic glue, respectively. No differences were observed between groups with respect to quality of life of the patients and hernia recurrence rate. CONCLUSIONS In patients with small- and medium-sized ventral hernias, the type of fixation device did not affect the immediate or long-term postoperative pain, quality of life, or recurrence rate when comparing permanent tacks, absorbable tacks, and synthetic glue for mesh fixation.

However, the mechanisms that mediate human heat adaptation have remained elusive. We tested the hypothesis that heat acclimation improves the neural control of body temperature. Skin sympathetic nerve activity, the efferent neural signal that activates heat loss thermoeffectors, was measured in healthy adults exposed to passive heat stress before and after a 7-day heat acclimation protocol. Heat acclimation reduced the activation threshold for skin sympathetic nerve activity, leading to an earlier activation of cutaneous vasodilation and sweat production. These findings demonstrate that heat acclimation improves the neural control of body temperature in humans. ABSTRACT Heat acclimation improves autonomic temperature regulation in humans. However, the mechanisms that mediate human heat adaptation remain poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that heat acclimation improves the neural control of body temperature. Body temperatures, skin sympathetic nerve activity, cutaneous vasodilation, and sweat production were measured in 14 healthy adults (9 men/5 women, 27 ± 5 years) during passive heat stress performed before and after a 7-day heat acclimation protocol. Heat acclimation increased whole-body sweat rate (+0.54 L/h [0.32, 0.75], P < 0.01) and reduced resting core temperature (-0.29°C [-0.40, -0.18], P < 0.01). During passive heat stress, the change in mean body temperature required to activate skin sympathetic nerve activity was reduced (-0.21°C [-0.34, -0.08], P < 0.01) following heat acclimation. The earlier activation of skin sympathetic nerve activity resulted in lower activation thresholds for cutaneous vasodilation (-0.18°C [-0.35, -0.01], P = 0.04) and local sweat rate (-0.13°C [-0.24, -0.01], P = 0.03). These results demonstrate that heat acclimation leads to an earlier activation of the neural efferent outflow that activates the heat loss thermoeffectors of cutaneous vasodilation and sweating.

We estimated the impact of the first lockdown on the burden of COVID-19 in the community in France. METHODS Physicians participating in the French Sentinelles network reported the number of patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) seen in consultation and performed nasopharyngeal swabs in a sample of these patients (first patient of the week). The swabs were tested by RT-PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and virological data were combined to estimate ARI incidence attributable to SARS-CoV-2 from 17 March to 10 May 2020. RESULTS The incidence of ARI attributable to COVID-19 decreased after the second week of the lockdown period from 142 (95%CI [101; 183]) to 41 (95%CI [21; 60]) per 100,000 population. A decrease was observed in all areas in metropolitan France. The youngest age groups (<15-years-old) were least affected with a cumulated incidence estimated to 14 per 100,000 population during the study period.

However, data on continuous albuterol delivery (CAD) via HFNC are lacking. This study quantified CAD via HFNC/vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) and large-volume jet nebulizer (LVN) with face mask (FM) in a pediatric model. Aerosol delivery with two HFNC cannula designs were also compared. METHODS A pediatric manikin was connected to a lung simulator (Vt=150 ml, RR=28 breaths/min, I:E 1:2.4) via collecting filter at the carina. XL Pediatric and SML Adult HFNC designs were tested to determine optimal cannula design for CAD. VMN was placed prior to humidifier (37˚C), albuterol (5 mg/ml) was nebulized at 3, 6, & 12 L/min (n=3). To compare HFNC/VMN with LVN and FM, albuterol (15 mg/hr) was aerosolized for 3 hours/device (n=3). LVN was connected to FM and filled with 9 ml of albuterol (5 mg/ml) and 66 ml of normal saline to deliver 25 ml/hour at 13 L/min. VMN was connected to the infusion pump to deliver 7.5 ml/hr of albuterol (2 mg/ml). Drug eluted from filters was assayed with UV spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS Optimal aerosol delivery occurred at 3 L/min (12.6% ± 0.5%) with SML Adult HFNC (P = .04). When used for CAD, inhaled drug delivery with HFNC/VMN (2.2 mg/hr ± 0.1, 14.8% ± 0.7%) was significantly greater than LVN and FM (0.48 ± 0.09 mg/hr, 3.2% ± 0.6%) (P = .001).

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess endoscopic pleural dye marking using radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-EBUS) and virtual bronchoscopy to localize small peripheral lung nodules immediately before minimally invasive resection. METHODS The endoscopic procedure was performed without fluoroscopy, under general anesthesia in the operating room immediately before minimally invasive surgery. Then, 1 mL of methylene blue (0.5%) was instilled into the guide sheath, wedged in the subpleural space. Wedge resection or segmentectomy were guided by visualization of the dye on the pleural surface. Contribution of dye marking to the surgical procedure was rated by the surgeon. RESULTS Twenty-five nodules, including 6 ground glass opacities, were resected in 22 patients by video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection (n = 11) or robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (10 segmentectomies and 1 wedge resection). The median greatest diameter of nodules was 8 mm. No conversion to open thoracotomy was needed. The endoscopic procedure added an average 10 min to surgical resection. The dye was visible on the pleural surface in 24 cases. Histological diagnosis and free margin resection were obtained in all cases. Median skin-to-skin operating time was 90 min for robotic segmentectomy and 40 min for video-assisted wedge resection. The same operative precision was considered impossible by the surgeon without dye marking in 21 cases. CONCLUSIONS Dye marking using r-EBUS and virtual bronchoscopy can be easily and safely performed to localize small pulmonary nodules immediately before minimally invasive resection.","Lachkar, Samy; Baste, Jean-Marc; Thiberville, Luc; Peillon, Christophe; Rinieri, Philippe; Piton, Nicolas; Guisier, Florian; Salaun, Mathieu",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000486205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29393273/,19

However, there is still little experience with this technique for the treatment of colorectal cancer. METHODS Sixty-eight patients with SILS resections for colon (n = 25) or rectal cancer (n = 43) were compared to a group of conventionally operated patients who were matched for surgical procedure, tumor stage and tumor location, and the use of preoperative radiochemotherapy. RESULTS Both groups were comparable for lymph node harvest, specimen length, and the duration of surgery. No significant differences were observed for the number of positive circumferential resection margins, or the distance of the tumor to both the aboral or lateral resection margin, but two positive resection margins were only present after SILS and not after conventional surgery. Hospitalization tended to be shorter after SILS (p = 0.097). Overall, morbidity was equivalent between the two groups, with a difference for colon cancer where it was significantly lower after SILS as compared to open surgery (p = 0.025) mainly due to a lower rate of wound complications. CONCLUSION SILS might be an acceptable alternative to open surgery for the treatment of colon cancer. For rectal cancer, no apparent benefit could be documented. As no sufficient data on the oncologic quality are available, single-incision laparoscopic surgery can yet not be recommended for the treatment of rectal cancer out of clinical trials.","Rink, Andreas D; Vestweber, Boris; Paul, Claudia; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-014-2041-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25354966/,19
102532,In focus in HCB.,2020-07-29,"Fontan fenestration closure is a topic of great debate. The body of data regarding the risks and benefits of fenestration closure is limited yet growing. Previous studies have demonstrated that Fontan patients have less exercise capacity than those with normal cardiovascular anatomy. Differences also have been noted within various subgroups of Fontan patients such as whether Fontan is fenestrated or not. This study aimed to compare trends in regional oxygen saturations using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients with Fontan circulations during ramping exercise to further delineate differences between patients with and without a fenestration. It was hypothesized that Fontan patients with fenestrations have better exercise times, higher absolute regional oxygen venous saturations, and smaller arteriovenous differences than Fontan patients without fenestrations. For this study, 50 consecutive Fontan patients and 51 consecutive patients with normal cardiovascular anatomy were recruited. Placement of NIRS probes was performed to obtain regional oxygen saturations from the brain and the kidney. Readings were obtained at 1-min intervals during rest, exercise, and recovery. A standard Bruce protocol was used with a 5-min recovery period. Absolute regional tissue oxygenation values (rSO2) and arterial-venous oxygen saturation differences (AVDO2) calculated as arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2)--rSO2 for normal versus Fontan patients and for fenestrated versus unfenestrated Fontan patients were compared using independent t tests. When normal and Fontan patients were compared, the Fontan patients had a significantly shorter duration of exercise (9.3 vs 13.2 min; p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference in rSO2 change or AVDO2 was evident at the time of peak exercise, at 2 min into the recovery, or at 5 min into the recovery. A small oxygen debt also was paid back to the brain in the Fontan patients after exercise, as evidenced by a narrower AVDO2 than at baseline. The comparison of Fontan patients with and without fenestration showed no statistically significant difference in exercise time, rSO2 change, or AVDO2. The Fontan patients were noted to have shorter exercise times than the normal patients and also appeared to have an alteration in postexertional regional blood flow. However, when the various Fontan subtypes were compared by presence or absence of a fenestration, no significant differences were noted with regard to change in regional oxygen saturation or arteriovenous oxygen saturation. Thus, for patients with Fontan physiology, closure of the fenestration does not seem to have an impact on the dynamics of regional oxygen extraction during exercise or recovery.","Loomba, Rohit S; Danduran, Michael E; Dixon, Jennifer E; Rao, Rohit P",Pediatric cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-013-0817-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150685/,19

Staple line reinforcement with a buttress reduces bleeding and associated complications through a combination of factors. The intrinsic hemostatic properties of buttress materials have not been examined. This study examined the intrinsic hemostatic properties of two different types of material used in buttressing in an accepted hemostasis model that does not involve stapling or its effects by compression. MATERIALS An acellular collagen buttress (Veritas) and a synthetic polymer buttress (Duet) were compared to two commonly used hemostatic agents, Syvek and Surgicel, with gauze as control. METHODS In a swine capsular stripping hemostasis model, a 1 × 1 cm section of spleen capsule was removed and used as a source of bleeding, with one patch of material tested per bleeding site. A total of 51 wounds were created in five pigs (each patch n = 10, control n = 11). Hemostatic efficacy was assessed by quantitating the number of applications and total time needed for bleeding to stop. RESULTS The mean time needed for hemostasis for Syvek and Veritas patches was significantly less than gauze, Duet and Surgicel (4.02, 4.51 vs. 8.97, 9.22, and 10.30 min respectively; p < 0.05). The Syvek and Veritas patches required significantly fewer applications than gauze, Duet™ and Surgicel (1.7, 2.2 vs. 4.1, 4.6, and 4.9 respectively; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The intrinsic hemostatic properties of different buttressing materials vary widely. In this study, a collagen buttress was significantly better at promoting hemostasis than the synthetic buttress material in a nonstapling model. This could be another factor to consider when choosing a buttress for staple line reinforcement.","Spector, David; Perry, Zvi; Konobeck, Tracy; Mooradian, Daniel; Shikora, Scott",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1331-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20835722/,19

The specific objective of this study is to establish a convenient method to examine problem of the injectability for the needle-syringe-formulation system when complex formulations with diverse viscosities are used. This work presents the inter-relationship between needle size, syringe volume, viscosity, and injectability of polymeric solutions having typical viscosities encountered in concentrated biologics, by applying a constant probe crosshead speed on the plunger-syringe needle assembly and continuously recording the force-distance profiles. A computerized texture analyzer was used to accurately capture, display, and store force, displacement, and time data. The force-distance curve and area under the curve are determined, and total work done for complete extrusion of the syringe content was calculated automatically by applying an established Matlab program. Various concentrations (i.e., 0.5-4% w/v of polymeric fluids/dispersions) of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with viscosity ranges of 5-100 cP mimicking concentrated monoclonal antibody solutions and complex biopharmaceutical formulations are investigated. Results indicate that calculated values of total work done to completely extrude the syringe content are the most appropriate parameter that describes viscosity-injection force of dispersed formulations. Additionally, the rheological properties of HPMC and PEO fluids in the context of syringeability and injectability are discussed.","Zhang, Qiangnan; Fassihi, Mona A; Fassihi, Reza",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-018-0963-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29464592/,19

Antiplatelet therapy may prevent the development of CAV. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes and appraises the evidence on the effect of antiplatelet therapy after heart transplantation (HT). CENTRAL(Ovid), MEDLINE(Ovid), Embase(Ovid) were searched from inception until April 30, 2020. Outcomes included CAV, all-cause mortality, and CAV-related mortality. Data was pooled using random-effects models. Seven observational studies including 2023 patients, mean age 52 years, 22% female, 47% with ischemic cardiomyopathy followed over a mean 7.1 years proved eligible. All studies compared acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to no treatment and were at serious risk of bias. Data from 1911 patients in 6 studies was pooled in the meta-analyses. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ASA on all-cause or CAV-related mortality. ASA may reduce the development of CAV (RR 0.75, 95% CI:0.44-1.29) based on very low certainty evidence. Two studies that conducted propensity-weighted analyses showed further reduction in CAV with ASA (HR 0.31, 95% CI:0.13-0.74). In conclusion, there is limited evidence that ASA may reduce the development of CAV. Definitive resolution of the impact of antiplatelet therapy on CAV and mortality will require randomized clinical trials.","Aleksova, Natasha; Brahmbhatt, Darshan H; Kiamanesh, Omid; Petropoulos, Jo-Anne; Chang, Yaping; Guyatt, Gordon; Chih, Sharon; Ross, Heather J",Clinical transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33068308/,19

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by recurrent seizures, which may increase the content of reactive oxygen species. Organic and conventional grape juices are rich in polyphenols, compounds with important antioxidant activity. It is hypothesized that organic and conventional purple grape juices may have protective effect against oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a standard convulsant drug) in the liver and serum of Wistar rats. Animals (n = 16 in each group) received, by gavage, saline, organic grape juice or conventional grape juice (10 μL/g of body weight) for 17 days. Subsequently, half of the rats in each group received PTZ (60 mg/kg). After 30 minutes, the animals were euthanized by decapitation. Liver and blood samples were isolated to evaluate oxidative parameters (lipid and protein oxidation, nitric oxide metabolite content, antioxidant defenses, and protein sulfhydryl content). The results of this study showed that although organic juice contains higher polyphenol content than conventional juice, both juices conferred protection against lipid and protein oxidative damage and limited the increase in PTZ-induced nitric oxide metabolite content in the liver and serum. In addition, both juices inhibited the PTZ-induced reduction in enzymatic antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) and sulfhydryl protein content in the liver and serum. In summary, both organic and conventional grape juices were able to reduce oxidative damage induced by PTZ in the liver and serum of Wistar rats.","Rodrigues, Adriana D; Scheffel, Thamiris B; Scola, Gustavo; Dos Santos, Maitê T; Fank, Bruna; Dani, Caroline; Vanderlinde, Regina; Henriques, João A P; Coitinho, Adriana S; Salvador, Mirian",Nutrition research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2012.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23399662/,19

LC-MS/MS is the official control method of veterinary drugs residues in food of animal origin. An experimental study was developed to evaluate the feasibility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) as a potential alternative approach to detect the presence of betamethasone residues. Eight rat liver samples were collected 24 h post-betamethasone-treatment from experimental and control animals and were analysed by 1H-MRS using a 7-Tesla MRI scanner. 1H-MR reference spectra both of the Bentelan formulation used for treatment, and of three solutions of betamethasone in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at 5, 10 and 100 mM, respectively, were acquired to fit analyte-peaks in the liver samples spectra. Betamethasone-peaks were found only in the 100 mM betamethasone in DMSO solution spectrum. Betamethasone residues were not detected in any of the tissue samples analysed, probably related to the low concentration of injected drug. These findings allow us to establish, for the first time in the literature, the detection limit (in the range 10-100 mM) of betamethasone for the 7-Tesla MRI scanner used here. Given this very-low sensitivity, we conclude that the evaluated 1H-MR spectroscopy approach is not suitable for the detection of betamethasone residues in edible tissues, since the maximum residue limit imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) 37/2010 for betamethasone in the liver, and metabolic concentrations required to be detected in animal samples from livestock, are far below the detection limit we found.","Cicero, Luca; Cirincione, Roberta; Comelli, Albert; Coronnello, Claudia; Cassata, Giovanni","Food additives & contaminants.

Some patients have a good haemodynamic response to a fluid challenge, others hardly any response. The early haemodynamic effects of a fluid challenge could predict the final response before the entire fluid volume has been administered. OBJECTIVE To assess whether a multivariate logistic regression model, including pulse pressure variation (PPV), cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE), arterial elastance and the difference between the dicrotic pressure and both systolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP - Pdic and MAP - Pdic) can predict cardiac responsiveness early during a fluid challenge in comparison with the standard procedure described elsewhere. DESIGN Observational study. SETTING Elective surgical patients undergoing laparotomy, enrolled in two Italian University Hospitals. PATIENTS Fifty adult surgical patients, ventilated with a lung protective strategy, were enrolled and data from 46 were analysed. INTERVENTIONS A fluid challenge consisting of 500 ml of crystalloid infused over 10 min. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS The changes in CCE, arterial elastance, SAP - Pdic and MAP - Pdic were compared using analysis of variance. A multivariate logistic regression analysis utilising baseline values and the first minute measuring a variation statistically significant for the considered variables. RESULTS At baseline, PPV correctly identified 70% of patients (89% of non-responders; 42% of responders). The model, including baseline PPV, ΔCCE and ΔSAP - Pdic, correctly identified the efficiency of fluid challenge in 87% of patients (84.2% of responders; 92.5 of non-responders) after 5 min from fluid challenge infusion. CONCLUSION In this pilot study conducted in a population of surgical patients mechanically ventilated with a VT less than 8 ml kg, a dynamic model of fluid challenge assessment, including PPV, ΔCCE and ΔSAP - Pdic, enhances the prediction of fluid challenge response after 5 min of a 10-min administration.

Masks for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in combination with viral-proof filters, worn by healthcare workers, could serve as an alternative protection measure. We determined the simulated protection factor (SPF) of such devices in comparison to conventional surgical masks, N95, and FFP3 respirators. Masks and respirators were mounted on a ventilated mannequin head in a test-chamber. Isotonic saline containing 150 MBq 99mTC-DTPA (99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) was nebulized inside the box. The aerosol had a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.6 ± 0.4 µm. SPFs were measured using radioactive DTPA particles in the mannequin test system by calculating the ratio of unfiltered particles (Pu) and filtered particles (Pf) for each tested device (SPF = Pu/Pf). Simulated protection factors were 15.6 ± 3.6 for a ResMed AcuCare mask plus filter, 3.5 ± 0.2 for a ResMed Mirage Quattro FX mask plus filter, 9.5 ± 0.8 for a Loewenstein JOYCEclinc FF mask plus filter, 1.9 ± 0.2 for a surgical mask with a rubber band, 2.7 ± 0.7 for a surgical mask with ribbons, 2.3 ± 0.3 for an FFP3 respirator, and 3.6 ± 1.3 for an N95 respirator. The ResMed AcuCare and the Loewenstein JOYCEclinic FF mask were more effective than any other of the tested devices (p < 0.001).

The diagnosis of an active infection is based on the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab specimen. The aim of the current analysis was to assess the usefulness of the rapid serological tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS The rapid serological tests detecting IgG/IgM antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were voluntarily performed in asymptomatic employees of 2 companies. The examination was conducted at the date and time selected online by the study participants. The testing team consisted of 2 nurses collecting the samples and 1 doctor who interpreted the results. Each positive rapid test result was verified by an RT-PCR examination from a nasopharyngeal swab. The testing kits named Vazyme: 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold-Based) were provided by the employer along with the manual and certificates. RESULTS The overall interest in testing among employees was below the employer's expectations and reached 30% and 20% in each of the 2 companies, respectively. A total of 516 participants were included in the analysis. Ten positive results of the rapid tests were documented, including 7 for IgM and 3 for IgG antibodies. No positive result was confirmed by the detection of the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR examination.

Despite its worldwide acceptance in many different surgical specialties, the use of robotic assistance in the field of hepatobiliary and pancreatic (HBP) surgery remains relatively unexplored. This article aims to evaluate the efficacy and outcomes of robotic HBP surgery in a single surgical center. METHODS Between May 2009 and December 2010, all patients admitted to our unit for robotic HBP surgery were evaluated. A retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database on clinical outcomes was performed. RESULTS There were 55 robotic HBP operations performed during the study period. There were 27 robotic liver resections (left lateral sectionectomies n = 17, left hepatectomy n = 1, other segmentectomies n = 2 and wedge resections n = 7), 12 robotic pancreatic procedures (Whipple's operations n = 8, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomies n = 2, double bypass n = 1 and cystojejunostomy n = 1) and 16 biliary procedures (biliary enteric bypass n = 9, bile duct exploration and related procedures n = 7).

The Clinical Prevention and Population Health Curriculum Framework developed by the Healthy People Curriculum Task Force served as the planning template for curriculum analysis. Key to success was the incorporation of population health as a ""curriculum enhancement,"" as opposed to curricular expansion or substitution. Strategies included introduction of a Case-Based Series in Population-Oriented Prevention (C-POP) in the preclinical years; community assessments, home visits, and public health assignments in the family medicine and pediatrics clinical clerkships; and prevention history-taking. The Brody integrated curriculum included a wide range of topics and clinical experiences specific to prevention and population health; however, the coverage was uneven. Hybrid teaching cases were developed from four C-POP cases which were adapted to existing instructional materials. Students learned to define the determinants of health, disease burden in their community settings, and community strengths and obstacles specific to dealing with chronic conditions. Factors contributing to the successful integration of population health included a receptive primary care medical school, use of the Framework, analysis of gaps between the Framework and the existing curriculum, providing enhancements to the existing curriculum, employment of patient cases, and integrating population health into a variety of classroom and community medical learning experiences. This approach, as opposed to a separate and distinct course, seeks to reinforce the interconnectedness of communities, families, and individuals.","Kerkering, Kathryn Waldrop; Novick, Lloyd F",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0b013e318166a9ec; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18367893/,19

However, the effects of LSG on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are controversial. Asymptomatic GERD and hiatal hernia (HH) is common in obese patients. Therefore, it is important to identify the high risk patients prior to surgery. This study aims to evaluate efficacy of cruroplasty for HH during LSG in morbidly obese patients using ambulatory pH monitoring (APM) results, and to investigate the patients' selection criteria for this procedure. METHODS This retrospective study includes outcomes of 59 patients who underwent LSG and HH repair according to our patient selection algorithm. Outcomes included preoperative GERD Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaire, APM results, percentage of postoperative excess weight loss, and total weight loss. RESULTS For a total of 402 patients, APM was applied in 70 patients who had a positive score of GERD-HRQL, and 59 patients underwent LSG and concomitant HH repair who had a DeMeester score of 14.7% or above. There was no statistically significant difference in weight loss at 6 and 12-month follow-up. Two patients (3.3%) had symptoms of GERD at 12 months postoperatively, and only one (1.6%) patient required treatment of proton pump inhibitor for reflux. In the total cohort, 11 (2.7%) patients also evolved de novo GERD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This study confirm that careful attention to patient selection and surgical technique can reduce the symptoms of GERD at short-term. Routine bilateral crus exploration could be a major risk factor of postoperative GERD.","Ece, Ilhan; Yilmaz, Huseyin; Acar, Fahrettin; Colak, Bayram; Yormaz, Serdar; Sahin, Mustafa",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2518-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28013451/,19

Pelvic and lower limb MR images of 378 patients with vascular malformations were examined retrospectively. Pain levels and restriction of motion were evaluated with a questionnaire. Cross-sectional areas of affected nerves were compared at standardized anatomical landmarks. Intraneural infiltration patterns and involvement of muscles surrounding the sciatic nerve were documented. Sciatic nerve infiltration occurred in 23/299 patients (7.7%) with VM. In all cases (23/23; 100%), gluteal or hamstring muscles surrounding the nerve were affected by the VM. Infiltrated nerves were enlarged and showed signal alterations (T2-hyperintensity) compared to the unaffected side. Enlarged nerve cross-sectional areas were associated with elevated pain levels. Three nerve infiltration patterns were observed: subepineurial (12/23; 52.2%), subparaneurial (6/23; 26.1%) and combined (5/23; 21.7%) infiltration. This study provides a clinically relevant assessment for sciatic nerve infiltration patterns and muscle involvement of VMs, while suggesting that VMs in gluteal and hamstring muscles require closer investigation of the sciatic nerve by the radiologist.","Goldann, Constantin; Helm, Maximilian; Uller, Wibke; Fellner, Claudia; Hammer, Simone; Deistung, Andreas; Gussew, Alexander; Rosendahl, Jonas; Wildgruber, Moritz; Wohlgemuth, Walther A; Brill, Richard",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71595-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884092/,19

108889,Hierarchy Control of MFI Zeolite Membrane towards Superior Butane Isomer Separation Performance.,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to evaluate various methods of chest compressions in patients with suspected/confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection conducted by medical students wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol generating procedures (AGP). METHODS This was prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded, crossover simulation trial. Thirty-five medical students after an advanced cardiovascular life support course, which included performing 2-min continuous chest compression scenarios using 3 methods: (A) manual chest compression (CC), (B) compression with CPRMeter, (C) compression with LifeLine ARM device. During resuscitation they are wearing full personal protective equipment for aerosol generating procedures. RESULTS The median chest compression depth using manual CC, CPRMeter and LifeLine ARM varied and amounted to 40 (38-45) vs. 45 (40-50) vs. 51 (50-52) mm, respectively (p = 0.002). The median chest compression rate was 109 (IQR; 102-131) compressions per minute (CPM) for manual CC, 107 (105-127) CPM for CPRMeter, and 102 (101-102) CPM for LifeLine ARM (p = 0.027). The percentage of correct chest recoil was the highest for LifeLine ARM - 100% (95-100), 80% (60-90) in CPRMeter group, and the lowest for manual CC - 29% (26-48). CONCLUSIONS According to the results of this simulation trial, automated chest compression devices (ACCD) should be used for chest compression of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. In the absence of ACCD, it seems reasonable to change the cardiopulmonary resuscitation algorithm (in the context of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19) by reducing the duration of the CPR cycle from the current 2-min to 1-min cycles due to a statistically significant reduction in the quality of chest compressions among rescuers wearing PPE AGP.","Malysz, Marek; Dabrowski, Marek; Böttiger, Bernd W; Smereka, Jacek; Kulak, Klaudia; Szarpak, Agnieszka; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Ladny, Jerzy R; Ruetzler, Kurt; Szarpak, Lukasz",Cardiology journal,https://doi.org/10.5603/cj.a2020.0068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419128/,19

We aim to report the clinical outcomes and first series of carotid stenting in a cohort of patients with strokes from symptomatic carotid webs. METHODS Prospective and consecutive data of patients <65 years old with cryptogenic stroke admitted within September 2014 to May 2017. Carotid web was defined by a shelf-like/linear filling defect in the posterior internal carotid artery bulb by computed tomographic angiography. RESULTS Twenty-four patients were identified (91.6% strokes/8.4% transient ischemic attacks [TIAs]). Median age was 46 (41-59) years, 61% were female, and 75% were black. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10.5 (3.0-16.0) and ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) was 8 (7-8). There were no parenchymal hemorrhages, and 96% of patients were independent at 3 months. All webs caused <50% stenosis. In patients with bilateral webs (58%), median ipsilateral web length was larger than contralateral (3.1 [3.0-4.5] mm versus 2.6 [1.85-2.9] mm; P=0.01), respectively. Twenty-nine percent of patients had thrombus superimposed on the symptomatic carotid web. A recurrent stroke/TIA involving the territory of the previously symptomatic web occurred in 7 (32%; 6 strokes/1 TIA) patients: 3 <1 week, 2 1 year of follow-up. Two recurrences occurred on dual antiplatelet therapy, 3 on antiplatelet monotherapy, 1 within 24 hours of thrombolysis, and 1 off antithrombotics. Median follow-up was 12.2 (8.0-18.0) months. Sixteen (66%) patients were stented at a median 12.2 (7.0-18.7) days after stroke with no periprocedural complications. No recurrent strokes/TIAs occurred in stented individuals (median follow-up of 4 [2.4-12.0] months). CONCLUSIONS Carotid web is associated with high recurrent stroke/TIA risk, despite antithrombotic use, and is amenable to carotid stenting.","Haussen, Diogo C; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Bouslama, Mehdi; Pradilla, Gustavo; Belagaje, Samir; Bianchi, Nicolas; Allen, Jason W; Frankel, Michael; Nogueira, Raul G",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.117.019020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29018133/,19

METHOD AND MATERIALS A total of 103 hospitalized patients were offered one of three options to control N/V. Patient choice was considered in the holistic trial design so that patients were not denied either the essential oil or antiemetics. Patients rated nausea 0 to 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale at symptom onset and within 60 minutes of the intervention. RESULTS Only three subjects enrolled in the antiemetic arm; thus this arm was eliminated from analysis, resulting in 100 evaluable patients. Mean nausea score improved significantly for the entire sample following the aromatherapy or aromatherapy/antiemetic intervention (p < .0001). Patients in the aromatherapy arm had significant improvement in nausea compared to the combined aromatherapy/antiemetic arm (p < .0001). Patient perception that peppermint oil relieves N/V significantly improved for the entire sample. Notable is that 65% of patients used peppermint essential oil alone. CONCLUSIONS Peppermint essential oil is an effective independent or complementary modality for relief of N/V in hospitalized patients.

110134,Widespread 3'-end uridylation in eukaryotic RNA viruses.,2016,"Overall mental health depends in part on the blood-brain barrier, which regulates nutrient transfer in-and-out of the brain and its central nervous system. Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce Aβ deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent emergence of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initially considered a respiratory illness, demonstrated a broader virulence spectrum with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inflict a plethora of neuropathological manifestations in the brain - the Neuro-COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are widely reported in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis patients with aggravated clinical outcomes. Lactoferrin, credited with several neuroprotective benefits in the brain could serve as a potential adjuvant in the clinical management of Neuro-COVID-19.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Wallace, Taylor C; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",Journal of dietary supplements,https://doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2021.1922567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33977807/,19

110640,Blame apportioning and the emergence of zoonoses over the last 25 years.,2009,"BACKGROUND Exposure of respiratory therapists (RTs) during aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation is an occupational hazard. Depending on the hospital, RTs may serve as laryngoscopist or in a role providing ventilation support and initiating mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to evaluate the potential exposure of RTs serving in either of these roles. METHODS We set up a simulated patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in an ICU setting requiring endotracheal intubation involving a laryngoscopist, a nurse, and an RT supporting the laryngoscopist. All participants wore appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). A fluorescent marker was sprayed by an atomizer during the procedure using 3 different methods for endotracheal intubation. The 3 techniques included PPE alone, a polycarbonate intubating box, or a coronavirus flexible enclosure, which consisted of a Mayo stand with plastic covering. The laryngoscopist and the supporting RT were assessed with a black light for contamination with the fluorescent marker. All simulations were recorded. RESULTS When using only PPE, both the laryngoscopist and the RT were grossly contaminated. When using the intubating box, the laryngoscopist's contamination was detectable only on the gloves: the gown and face shield remained uncontaminated; the RT was still grossly contaminated on the gloves, gown, neck, and face shield. When using the coronavirus flexible enclosure system, both the laryngoscopist and the RT were better protected, with contamination detected only on the gloves of the laryngoscopist and the RT. CONCLUSIONS Of the 3 techniques, the coronavirus flexible enclosure contained the fluorescent marker more effectively during endotracheal intubation than PPE alone or the intubating box based on exposure of the laryngoscopist and supporting RT. Optimizing containment during aerosol-generating procedures like endotracheal intubation is a critical component of minimizing occupational and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 to RTs who may serve as either the laryngoscopist or a support role.","Smith, Cameron R; Gravenstein, Nikolaus; LeMaster, Thomas E; Borde, Ceri M; Fahy, Brenda G",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229369/,19
110644,Evolutionary Virology at 40.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rapidly progressing inflammatory lung disease with a high mortality rate without specific pharmacological therapy. OBJECTIVES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on corticosteroid use in ARDS. METHODS A search of four medical literature databases was conducted. We retained randomized trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids in hospitalized adults with ARDS in a search up to February, 2020. Two reviewers identified eligible studies, independently extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Authors assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS We included seven RCTs (n=851 patients). Corticosteroids reduced all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.95, p=0.02, moderate certainty) and duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference [MD] -4.93 days, 95% CI: -7.81 days to -2.06 days, p<0.001, low certainty), and increased ventilator-free days (VFD) (MD 4.28 days, 95% CI: 2.67 days to 5.88 days, p<0.001, moderate certainty), when compared to placebo. Corticosteroids also increased the risk of hyperglycemia (RR 1.12%, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.24, p=0.03, moderate certainty), and the effect on neuromuscular weakness was unclear (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.11, p=0.28, low certainty). CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that systemic corticosteroids may potentially improve mortality, ventilator duration, and VFD in patients with ARDS. However, the studies included different corticosteroid classes and initiated the corticosteroid doses at different times, as well as different dosing regimens. Thus caution in the actual clinical application of these results is recommended.","Mammen, Manoj J; Aryal, Komal; Alhazzani, Waleed; Alexander, Paul E",Polish archives of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.20452/pamw.15239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32186831/,19

COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus (DM) relationship is double-faced because DM is considered one of the COVID-19 key risk factors causing an increase in COVID-19 related conditions and death rates; at the same time, high stress in patients with COVID-19 can lead to the occurrence of DM. This relationship adversely affects immune functions. Relaxation techniques have been demonstrated to positively affect immune functions, glycemic control, and stress levels. METHODS A search in Scopus, Web of Science, Medline databases, and EBSCO has been made. The search included clinical trials and systematic and literature reviews on the effects of relaxation techniques on immune functions, glycemic control, and stress levels. RESULTS This review found that relaxation techniques produce short-term effects on decreasing stress levels through an autonomic regulation, controlling glycemic control through decreasing hyperglycemia, and increasing immune functions through increasing immune cells and immunoglobins A. CONCLUSION This review summarizes the important role of performing regular relaxation techniques for COVID-19 patients with DM. Relaxation techniques benefit diabetic patients with COVID-19 through decreasing stress levels, better controlling of glycemic control, and increasing immune functions.","Mahmoud Mohamed, Ayman Abdalla; Alawna, Motaz",Current diabetes reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573399816999201012200109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045980/,19

METHODS An observational study using data from a previous study conducted prior to the pandemic. We compared frequency of sexual intercourse, desire for pregnancy, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score, contraception type, and menstrual abnormalities among women during the pandemic with 6-12 months prior to the pandemic. Participants were contacted by telephone for questioning. RESULTS Average frequency of sexual intercourse was significantly increased during the pandemic compared with 6-12 months prior (2.4 vs 1.9, P=0.001). Before the pandemic 19 (32.7%) participants desired to become pregnant, whereas during the pandemic it had decreased to 3 (5.1%) (P=0.001). Conversely, use of contraception during the pandemic significantly decreased among participants compared with prior (24 vs 10, P=0.004). Menstrual disorders were more common during the pandemic than before (27.6% vs 12.1%, P=0.008). Participants had significantly better FSFI scores before the pandemic compared with scores during the pandemic (20.52 vs 17.56, P=0.001).

However, it is unknown whether these risk factors differ between women and men. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched to identify studies assessing the risk of psychological factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in samples with IHD. Psychological factors included anger/hostility, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, social support, Type A behavior pattern, Type D personality, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). RESULTS A total of 44 articles (64 separate reports) including 227,647 women and 321,894 men reporting confounder-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) or relative risks (RRs) were included in the primary analysis. Results based on random-effects models showed that the association between psychological factors (all combined) and MACE was stronger in men (n = 321,236; 57 reports; HR = 1.37, 95%CI 1.27-1.48) than in women (n = 226,886; 56 reports; HR = 1.21, 95%CI 1.12-1.30; p = .017). A subset of the studies focusing on women showed significant associations between anger/hostility, depression, and distress with MACE. For men, statistically significant associations were found for anxiety, depression, and distress with MACE. CONCLUSIONS Psychological factors are associated with MACE in samples with IHD in both women and men, with a small, but significant higher risk for men. Because of the limited number of studies on other psychological factors than depression and anxiety and the current major focus on MACE reflecting lesions in the major coronary arteries which is more typical in men than women, more research is needed to better identify sex and gender differences in IHD.","Smaardijk, Veerle R; Maas, Angela H E M; Lodder, Paul; Kop, Willem J; Mommersteeg, Paula M C",International journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2019.12.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31937453/,19

METHOD This systematic review and meta-analysis is limited to studies that met predetermined quality criteria. We required included studies to make comparisons with pre-disaster or non-disaster exposed controls, and sample representative populations. Key studies were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO from 1980 to 3 March 2017. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for studies that reported key outcomes with appropriate statistics. RESULTS Forty-one studies were identified by the literature search, of which 27 contributed to the meta-analyses. Continuous measures of psychological distress were increased after natural disasters (combined standardised mean difference 0.63, 95% CI 0.27-0.98, P = 0.005). Psychiatric disorders were also increased (combined odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.43-2.38, P < 0.001). Rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression were significantly increased after disasters. Findings for anxiety and alcohol misuse/dependence were not significant. High rates of heterogeneity suggest that disaster-specific factors and, to a lesser degree, methodological factors contribute to the variance between studies.

This technique is as safe and effective as the open approach. Single-port access surgery is considered a new minimally invasive approach in the search for better cosmetic results and less postoperative pain. One of the goals of single-port surgery is to preserve the satisfactory oncological results obtained by standard laparoscopy. This study presents the first single-port access right hemicolectomy for carcinoma of colon with intracorporeal anastomosis. METHODS The authors report a single-port access right hemicolectomy in a 59-year-old male patient with a neoplasm of the cecum stage IIA (T3, N0) according to the TNM classification. RESULTS A transumbilical single-port access right hemicolectomy was performed with no additional trocars and total intracorporeal anastomosis. Operative time was 140 minutes. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were reported. CONCLUSION Single-port access right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis is a feasible and safe technique when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. This approach must follow the basic principles of laparoscopic right hemicolectomy to achieve the same oncological results. The advantages of a total intracorporeal anastomosis include that there is no need to enlarge the umbilical incision and that avoid traction of the pedicle of the mesenterium of the transverse colon during the extracorporeal anastomosis.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Moreno, Joaquin García; Gómez, Jesus Cañete; Socas, María; Barranco, Antonio; Alarcón, Isaias; Casado, María; Cadet, Jean-Marie; Martín-Cartes, Juan",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610372378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542952/,19

The purpose of this article is to highlight the difficulties that the anesthesiologist may have in deciding quickly what is the best approach in case the endotracheal tube is damaged during maxillofacial surgery and possibly try to provide a rapid and safe solution for the situation.","Piroli, Alba; Cutilli, Tommaso; Lupi, Ettore; Marinangeli, Franco; Varrassi, Giustino; Paladini, Antonella",Advances in therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-019-00968-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065994/,19

Reactive oxygen species, generated during times of heightened oxidative stress, can damage cellular lipids causing the production of oxidation specific epitopes (OSE). OSEs are elevated in chronic inflammatory diseases and promoting their clearance by the body, through pattern recognition receptors and IgM antibodies, prevents and resolves inflammation and tissue damage in animal models. Current research on OSEs in asthma is limited. Although they are present in the lungs of people with asthma during periods of exacerbation or allergen exposure, we do not know if they are linked with disease pathobiology. This article reviews our current understanding of OSEs in asthma and explores whether targeting OSE clearance mechanisms may be a novel therapeutic intervention for asthma.","Pascoe, Christopher D; Vaghasiya, Jignesh; Halayko, Andrew J",The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2020.105864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069787/,19
116202,The V3 Loop of HIV-1 Env Determines Viral Susceptibility to IFITM3 Impairment of Viral Infectivity.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Prone position is used in acute respiratory distress syndrome and in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, it is unclear how responders may be identified and whether an oxygenation response improves outcome. The objective of this study was to quantify the response to prone position, describe the differences between coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and explore variables associated with survival. DESIGN Retrospective, observational, multicenter, international cohort study. SETTING Seven ICUs in Italy, United Kingdom, and France. PATIENTS Three hundred seventy-six adults (220 coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome and 156 acute respiratory distress syndrome). INTERVENTION None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Preproning, a greater proportion of coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients had severe disease (53% vs 40%), worse PaO2/FIO2 (13.0 kPa [interquartile range, 10.5-15.5 kPa] vs 14.1 kPa [interquartile range, 10.5-18.6 kPa]; p = 0.017) but greater compliance (38 mL/cm H2O [interquartile range, 27-53 mL/cm H2O] vs 31 mL/cm H2O [interquartile range, 21-37 mL/cm H2O]; p < 0.001). Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome had a longer median time from intubation to prone position (2.0 d [interquartile range, 0.7-5.0 d] vs 1.0 d [interquartile range, 0.5-2.9 d]; p = 0.03).The proportion of responders, defined by an increase in PaO2/FIO2 greater than or equal to 2.67 kPa (20 mm Hg), upon proning, was similar between acute respiratory distress syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome (79% vs 76%; p = 0.5). Responders had earlier prone position (1.4 d [interquartile range, 0.7-4.2 d] vs 2.5 d [interquartile range, 0.8-6.2 d]; p = 0.06)]. Prone position less than 24 hours from intubation achieved greater improvement in oxygenation (11 kPa [interquartile range, 4-21 kPa] vs 7 kPa [interquartile range, 2-13 kPa]; p = 0.002).The variables independently associated with the ""responder"" category were PaO2/FIO2 preproning (odds ratio, 0.89 kPa-1 [95% CI, 0.85-0.93 kPa-1]; p < 0.001) and interval between intubation and proning (odds ratio, 0.94 d-1 [95% CI, 0.89-0.99 d-1]; p = 0.019).The overall mortality was 45%, with no significant difference observed between acute respiratory distress syndrome and coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome. Variables independently associated with mortality included age (odds ratio, 1.03 yr-1 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05 yr-1]; p < 0.001); interval between hospital admission and proning (odds ratio, 1.04 d-1 [95% CI, 1.002-1.084 d-1]; p = 0.047); and change in PaO2/FIO2 on proning (odds ratio, 0.97 kPa-1 [95% CI, 0.95-0.99 kPa-1]; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Prone position, particularly when delivered early, achieved a significant oxygenation response in ~80% of coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome, similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome. This response was independently associated with improved survival.","Camporota, Luigi; Sanderson, Barnaby; Chiumello, Davide; Terzi, Nicolas; Argaud, Laurent; Rimmelé, Thomas; Metuor, Romain; Verstraete, Aude; Cour, Martin; Bohé, Julien; Piriou, Vincent; Beuret, Pascal; Guérin, Claude",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582426/,19

116405,The BB rat as a model of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.,2001,"PURPOSES To compare the clinical and functional results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction using an autologous four-strand single semitendinosus (ST) tendon or a ST and gracilis tendon. It was hypothesized that successful ACL reconstruction using a single ST tendon without the gracilis tendon could provide comparable knee stability and reduce donor site morbidity. METHODS This study evaluated 144 cases of single-bundle ACL reconstruction using an autologous hamstring tendon. The ST group included 85 cases of reconstruction using a single ST tendon, and the ST/G group included 59 cases of reconstruction using a ST tendon and a gracilis tendon. An extracortical suspension device and a suture tied around a screw post with an additional bioabsorbable screw were used to fix the femoral and tibial tunnels, respectively. Clinical evaluations involved the Lachman, pivot-shift, and one-leg hop tests; an isokinetic test; a KT-2000 arthrometer; an assessment of return to pre-injury activities; and Lysholm, Tegner activity, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective scores. RESULTS No significant differences were found between the ST and ST/G groups with respect to the Lysholm, Tegner activity, and subjective IKDC scores; the Lachman, pivot-shift, and one-leg hop tests; KT-2000 arthrometer side-to-side differences; or return to pre-injury activities. However, mean peak torque deficit, as determined using the isokinetic test during flexion at 60°/s, was significantly lower in the ST group than in the ST/G group (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION This study showed good results for ACL reconstruction using a single ST tendon without deterioration of stability. This provides the evidence that ACL reconstruction using a single ST tendon without the gracilis tendon decreases donor site morbidity without compromising joint stability.

Innovations in laparoscopic surgery have provided transplant surgeons with a range of techniques as well as a vast array of minimally invasive instruments. Whilst randomized control trials have compared open and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy, there is a paucity of high quality data comparing different laparoscopic approaches. This article summarizes the main techniques of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy currently in use and reviews the evidence available for each. In addition, controversial aspects of donor nephrectomy are examined, including the technological advances applicable to this operation. Increasing numbers of living donor kidney transplants are being performed worldwide, and the majority of donor operations are now laparoscopic. Transperitoneal 'pure' and hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy are the two most commonly performed procedures, although retroperitoneal approaches are advocated by some centres. Controversy persists with respect to the technical aspects of donor nephrectomy, including both the approach and the method of ligation of the hilar vessels. More recently, robot-assisted, laparo-endoscopic single site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) -assisted donor nephrectomy have also been performed, further increasing the number of options available, but creating uncertainty as to the ideal approach.","Banga, Neal; Nicol, David",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2012.11058.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22489654/,19

We conducted nine focus groups with youth and adults from March-July 2017 in two Texas unincorporated rural communities. Using ecosocial theory and applied thematic analysis for focus groups, we investigated social, political, and historical factors that affect health. We identified two primary themes: upstream barriers to community health and K-12 schools as facilitators of community health.

Methods of delivery.,2009,"OBJECTIVE We undertook a population-based, case-control study to examine a dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and risk of ischemic stroke in Koreans who had different alcoholic beverage type preferences than Western populations and to examine the effect modifications by sex and ischemic stroke subtypes. METHODS Cases (n = 1,848) were recruited from patients aged 20 years or older with first-ever ischemic stroke. Stroke-free controls (n = 3,589) were from the fourth and fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and were matched to the cases by age (±3 years), sex, and education level. All participants completed an interview using a structured questionnaire about alcohol intake. RESULTS Light to moderate alcohol intake, 3 or 4 drinks (1 drink = 10 g ethanol) per day, was significantly associated with a lower odds of ischemic stroke after adjusting for potential confounders (no drinks: reference; <1 drink: odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.45; 1-2 drinks: 0.45, 0.36-0.57; and 3-4 drinks: 0.54, 0.39-0.74). The threshold of alcohol effect in women was slightly lower than that in men (up to 1-2 drinks in women vs up to 3-4 drinks in men), but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no statistical interaction between alcohol intake and the subtypes of ischemic stroke (p = 0.50). The most frequently used alcoholic beverage was one native to Korea, soju (78% of the cases), a distilled beverage with 20% ethanol by volume. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that light to moderate distilled alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in Koreans.","Lee, Soo Joo; Cho, Yong-Jin; Kim, Jae Guk; Ko, Youngchai; Hong, Keun-Sik; Park, Jong-Moo; Kang, Kyusik; Park, Tai Hwan; Park, Sang-Soon; Lee, Kyung Bok; Cha, Jae Kwan; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Lee, Jun; Kim, Joon-Tae; Lee, Juneyoung; Lee, Ji Sung; Jang, Myung Suk; Han, Moon-Ku; Gorelick, Philip B; Bae, Hee-Joon",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26519539/,19

118588,The molecular basis for public T-cell responses?,2008,"BACKGROUND Perioperative hyperglycemia has many etiologies, including medication, impaired glucose tolerance, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or stress, the latter of which is common in patients postoperatively. Our study investigated the influence of postoperative blood glucose levels on periprosthetic joint infection after elective total joint arthroplasty to determine a threshold for glycemic control for which surgeons should strive during a patient's hospital stay. METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was conducted on 24,857 primary total joint arthroplasties performed from 2001 to 2015. Of these, 13,196 had a minimum follow-up of 1 year (mean, 5.9 years). Postoperative day 1 morning blood glucose levels were utilized and were correlated with periprosthetic joint infection, as defined by the International Consensus Group on Periprosthetic Joint Infection. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the influence of several important covariates on infection. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine significance. RESULTS The rate of periprosthetic joint infection increased linearly from blood glucose levels of ≥115 mg/dL. Multivariable analysis revealed that blood glucose levels were significantly associated with periprosthetic joint infection (p = 0.028). The optimal blood glucose threshold to reduce the likelihood of periprosthetic joint infection was 137 mg/dL. The periprosthetic joint infection rate in the entire cohort was 1.59% (1.46% in patients without diabetes compared with 2.39% in patients with diabetes; p = 0.001). There was no significant association between blood glucose level and periprosthetic joint infection in patients with diabetes (p = 0.276), although there was a linear trend. CONCLUSIONS The relationship between postoperative blood glucose levels and periprosthetic joint infection increased linearly, with an optimal cutoff of 137 mg/dL. Immediate and strict postoperative glycemic control may be critical in reducing postoperative complications, as even mild hyperglycemia was significantly associated with periprosthetic joint infection.

Since moulages that fit an educator's exact needs are often unavailable commercially, this paper explains how 2-dimensional transfer tattoos can be independently developed, produced, and evaluated. METHODS From representative photographs of the specific skin condition an analogue copy of the pathological finding is drawn. Once validated by the medical expert, it can be digitized by scanning and processed using graphics software. The final digital image file is printed onto transfer paper. Once applied and fixed onto the intended wearer, usually a simulated patient, its authenticity can be confirmed, and further transfer tattoos can be produced. RESULTS Using this moulage technique we produced 10 different 2-dimensional transfer tattoos to date, including hematoma, Janeway lesions and splinter nails. These moulages are used in clinical skills training, formative and high-stakes summative assessment in undergraduate medical and nursing programs. CONCLUSIONS By sharing our development process for 2-dimensional transfer tattoos, health profession educators can produce their own that best fit their local educational needs. Due to their high authenticity and standardization, 2-dimensional transfer tattoos are ideal for use in high-stakes assessment.","Bauer, Daniel; Lörwald, Andrea C; Wüst, Sandra; Beltraminelli, Helmut; Germano, Miria; Michel, Adrian; Schnabel, Kai P",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02763-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34154591/,19
118865,Protective immunity to H7N9 influenza viruses elicited by synthetic DNA vaccine.,2014,"The modern food supply faces many challenges. The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie orrapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and this has been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.

120012,Conserved actin machinery drives microtubule-independent motility and phagocytosis in Naegleria.,2020-11-02,"Large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGLL) is characterized by somatic gain-of-function STAT3 mutations. However, the functional effects of STAT3 mutations on primary LGLL cells have not been studied in detail. In this study, we show that CD8+ T cells isolated from STAT3 mutated LGLL patients have high protein levels of epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT1, and are characterized by global hypermethylation. Correspondingly, treatment of healthy CD8+ T cells with IL-6, IL-15, and/or MCP-1 cytokines resulted in STAT3 activation, increased DNMT1, EZH2, c-MYC, l-MYC, MAX, and NFκB levels, increased DNA methylation, and increased oxidative stress. Similar results were discovered in KAI3 NK cells overexpressing gain-of-function STAT3Y640F and STAT3G618R mutants compared to KAI3 NK cells overexpressing STAT3WT. Our results also confirm that STAT3 forms a direct complex with DNMT1, EZH2, and HDAC1. In STAT3 mutated LGLL cells, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor azacitidine abrogated the activation of STAT3 via restored SHP1 expression. In conclusion, STAT3 mutations cause DNA hypermethylation resulting in sensitivity to DNMT inhibitors, which could be considered as a novel treatment option for LGLL patients with resistance to standard treatments.","Kim, Daehong; Park, Giljun; Huuhtanen, Jani; Ghimire, Bishwa; Rajala, Hanna; Moriggl, Richard; Chan, Wing C; Kankainen, Matti; Myllymäki, Mikko; Mustjoki, Satu",Leukemia,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-021-01296-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075200/,19

120263,Unveiling the Molecular Structure of Antimalarial Drugs Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in Solution through Analysis of 1H NMR Chemical Shifts.,2021-03-24,"BACKGROUND This quality improvement (QI) project was performed at a single center to determine the incidence of postoperative complications associated with use of cuffed airway devices. An educational program was then completed that involved training our anesthesia providers about complications related to excessive cuff pressure and how to utilize a quantitative cuff pressure measurement device (manometer). The impact of this educational initiative was assessed by comparing the incidence of postoperative complications associated with the use of airway devices before and after the training period. METHODS After approval by our institution's Institutional Review Board, a pre-intervention (baseline) survey was obtained from 259 adult patients after having undergone surgery with general anesthesia with the use of an endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Survey responses were used to determine the baseline incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Once these results were obtained, education was provided to the anesthesia department members addressing the complications associated with excessive cuff pressures, appropriate cuff pressures based on manufacturer recommendations, and instructions on the use of a quantitative monitor to determine cuff pressure (manometry). Clinical care was then changed by requiring intraoperative cuff pressure monitoring throughout our institution for all surgical patients. After this educational period, 299 patients completed the same survey describing postoperative airway complications. RESULTS The use of manometry reduced the incidence of moderate-to-severe postoperative sore throat in the pre- vs. post-intervention groups (35 patients vs 31 patients, p = 0.045), moderate to severe hoarseness (30 patients vs 13, patients p = 0.0001), and moderate-to-severe dysphagia (13 patients vs 5 patients, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Caring for patients in the perioperative setting frequently entails placement of an airway device. This procedure is associated with several potential complications, including sore throat, coughing, and vocal cord damage. Our quality improvement initiative has shown that intraoperative management of intra-cuff pressure based on manometry is feasible to implement in clinical practice and can reduce postoperative airway complications.","Fritz, Ashley V; Mickus, Gregory J; Vega, Michael A; Renew, J Ross; Brull, Sorin J",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-00963-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32093637/,19

121633,Viral avoidance and exploitation of the ubiquitin system.,2009,"BACKGROUND Vasopressors are frequently used to increase blood pressure in order to ensure sufficient cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (CPO) during hypotensive periods in anaesthetized patients. Efficacy depends both on the vasopressor and anaesthetic protocol used. Propofol-remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is common in human anaesthesia, and dexmedetomidine is increasingly used as adjuvant to facilitate better haemodynamic stability and analgesia. Little is known of its interaction with vasopressors and subsequent effects on CPO. This study investigates the CPO response to infusions of norepinephrine and phenylephrine in piglets during propofol-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil-dexmedetomidine anaesthesia. Sixteen healthy female piglets (25-34 kg) were randomly allocated into a two-arm parallel group design with either normal blood pressure (NBP) or induced low blood pressure (LBP). Anaesthesia was induced with propofol without premedication and maintained with propofol-remifentanil TIVA, and finally supplemented with continuous infusion of dexmedetomidine. Norepinephrine and phenylephrine were infused in consecutive intervention periods before and after addition of dexmedetomidine. Cerebral perfusion measured by laser speckle contrast imaging was related to cerebral oxygenation as measured by an intracerebral Licox probe (partial pressure of oxygen) and transcranial near infrared spectroscopy technology (NIRS) (cerebral oxygen saturation). RESULTS During propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia, increases in blood pressure by norepinephrine and phenylephrine did not change cerebral perfusion significantly, but cerebral partial pressure of oxygen (Licox) increased following vasopressors in both groups and increases following norepinephrine were significant (NBP: P = 0.04, LBP: P = 0.02). In contrast, cerebral oxygen saturation (NIRS) fell significantly in NBP following phenylephrine (P = 0.003), and following both norepinephrine (P = 0.02) and phenylephrine (P = 0.002) in LBP. Blood pressure increase by both norepinephrine and phenylephrine during propofol-remifentanil-dexmedetomidine anaesthesia was not followed by significant changes in cerebral perfusion. Licox measures increased significantly following both vasopressors in both groups, whereas the decreases in NIRS measures were only significant in the NBP group. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral partial pressure of oxygen measured by Licox increased significantly in concert with the vasopressor induced increases in blood pressure in healthy piglets with both normal and low blood pressure. Cerebral oxygenation assessed by intracerebral Licox and transcranial NIRS showed opposing results to vasopressor infusions.","Mikkelsen, Mai Louise Grandsgaard; Ambrus, Rikard; Rasmussen, Rune; Miles, James Edward; Poulsen, Helle Harding; Moltke, Finn Borgbjerg; Eriksen, Thomas",Acta veterinaria Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-018-0362-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422100/,19
121677,Viral escape from endosomes and host detection at a glance.,2018,"Background: To determine the frequency of discordance in programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) expression between primary tumors and paired distant metastases in advanced cancers.Methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for eligible studies and assessed their methodologic quality using QUADAS-2 tool. We estimated the discordant rates (positive to negative or vice versa) of PD-L1 expression in primary tumors and paired distant metastases using logistic-normal random effects model. We performed subgroup analyses based on the PD-L1 status of primary tumors (positive or negative), location of primary tumors (lung or others) and distant metastases (central nervous system or others), timing of distant metastases (synchronous or metachronous), positivity thresholds of PD-L1 expression (1% or 5%) and types of antibody clones used (E1L3N or SP142).Results: Thirteen eligible studies including 451 cases were identified. The included studies were judged to have low to unclear risk of bias. The pooled estimate of discordant rates in PD-L1 expression was 31% (95% CI= 19-47%), with high heterogeneity across the studies (I2 = 75%). There was no significant effect modification in the discordant rates according to the predefined subgroups.Conclusion: Approximately one-third of advanced cancer cases have discordance in PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and paired distant metastases. A more liberal testing of PD-L1 expression in both primary and metastatic tumors is recommended in order to identify patients who may benefit from immune checkpoint blockade treatment.

We sought to explore the cytotoxicity of non-classical Pt-based compounds, and compared the efficacy and anticancer activity of 56MESS with cisplatin in OC. Drug sensitivity of seven non-classical Pt-based compounds as well as cisplatin were determined by CCK-8 assay. Comparison of cytotoxic effects between 56MESS, phenanthriplatin and cisplatin was performed on six different OC cell lines. The anticancer effects of 56MESS was further measured both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the biological role of FACL4 and its relationship with 56MESS-induced growth inhibition were investigated. Two out of seven Pt-based compounds displayed a significant cytotoxic effect. 56MESS was chosen as the most potent compound due to its highly selective cytotoxic activity. 56MESS particularly caused G2/M phase arrest, while failed to induce apoptosis. In vivo, 56MESS had a higher cytotoxic capacity than cisplatin. Overexpression of FACL4 rescued 56MESS-induced growth inhibition in OC cells. Overall, 56MESS is a highly selective and potent chemotherapeutic drug superior to cisplatin, and thus may be considered as a promising anticancer agent.","Miao, Lejing; Yu, Pei; Huang, Jing; Zhuang, Zehang; Liu, Xiqiang",Die Pharmazie,https://doi.org/10.1691/ph.2020.0481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305724/,19

COVID-19 severely affects aged subjects, determining an important prothrombotic status. Aim of this study was to evaluate mortality-related factors in older AF patients with COVID-19. METHODS Between March and June 2020, we enrolled >=60 years in-hospital COVID-19 patients (N=806) in GeroCovid, a multicenter observational study promoted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine. RESULTS The prevalence of AF was 21.8%. In-hospital mortality was higher in the AF group (36.9 vs. 27.5%, p=0.015). At admission, 51.7%, 10.2% and 38.1% of AF cases were taking, respectively, oral anticoagulants (OACs), antiplatelet agents and no antithrombotic therapy. During hospitalization, 51% patients switched to low-molecular weight heparins. AF patients who survived were younger (81±8 vs. 84±7 years; p=0.002) and had a lower CHA2DS2-VASc score (3.9±1.6 vs. 4.4±1.3; p=0.02) than those who died. OACs use before (63.1% vs. 32.3%; p<0.001) and during hospitalization (34.0% vs. 12.7%; p=0.002) was higher among survivors. At multivariable analysis, lower age, higher self-sufficiency, less severe initial COVID-19 presentation, and the use of Vitamin K antagonists (OR=0.16, 95%CI: 0.03-0.84) or DOACs (OR=0.22, 95%CI: 0.08-0.56) at admission, or the persistence of OAC during hospitalization (OR=0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.24), were associated with a lower chance of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS AF is a prevalent and severe condition in older COVID-19 patients. Advanced age, dependency and relevant clinical manifestations of disease characterized a worse prognosis. Pre-admission and in-hospital anticoagulant therapy were positively associated with survival.","Fumagalli, Stefano; Trevisan, Caterina; Del Signore, Susanna; Pelagalli, Giulia; Volpato, Stefano; Gareri, Pietro; Mossello, Enrico; Malara, Alba; Monzani, Fabio; Coin, Alessandra; Bellelli, Giuseppe; Zia, Gianluca; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1503-3875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962480/,19
122781,Potential Antiviral Immune Response Against COVID-19: Lessons Learned from SARS-CoV.,2021,"The RV144 HIV vaccine trial included a recombinant HIV glycoprotein 120 (gp120) construct fused to a small portion of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein D (gD) so that the first 40 amino acids of gp120 were replaced by the signal sequence and the first 27 amino acids of the mature form of gD. This region of gD contains most of the binding site for HVEM, an HSV receptor important for virus infection of epithelial cells and lymphocytes. RV144 induced antibodies to HIV that were partially protective against infection, as well as antibodies to HSV. We derived monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from peripheral blood B cells of recipients of the RV144 HIV vaccine and showed that these antibodies neutralized HSV-1 infection in cells expressing HVEM, but not the other major virus receptor, nectin-1. The MAbs mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and mice that received the MAbs and were then challenged by corneal inoculation with HSV-1 had reduced eye disease, shedding, and latent infection. To our knowledge, this is the first description of MAbs derived from human recipients of a vaccine that specifically target the HVEM binding site of gD. In summary, we found that monoclonal antibodies derived from humans vaccinated with the HVEM binding domain of HSV-1 gD (i) neutralized HSV-1 infection in a cell receptor-specific manner, (ii) mediated ADCC, and (iii) reduced ocular disease in virus-infected mice.IMPORTANCE Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes cold sores and neonatal herpes and is a leading cause of blindness. Despite many trials, no HSV vaccine has been approved. Nectin-1 and HVEM are the two major cellular receptors for HSV. These receptors are expressed at different levels in various tissues, and the role of each receptor in HSV pathogenesis is not well understood. We derived human monoclonal antibodies from persons who received the HIV RV144 vaccine that contained the HVEM binding domain of HSV-1 gD fused to HIV gp120. These antibodies were able to specifically neutralize HSV-1 infection in vitro via HVEM. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that HVEM-specific HSV-1 neutralizing antibodies protect mice from HSV-1 eye disease, indicating the critical role of HVEM in HSV-1 ocular infection.","Wang, Kening; Tomaras, Georgia D; Jegaskanda, Sinthujan; Moody, M Anthony; Liao, Hua-Xin; Goodman, Kyle N; Berman, Phillip W; Rerks-Ngarm, Supachai; Pitisuttithum, Punnee; Nitayapan, Sorachai; Kaewkungwal, Jaranit; Haynes, Barton F; Cohen, Jeffrey I",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00411-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701403/,19

The search terms ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" ""depress*,"" ""cognit*,"" and ""therapeutics"" were used. STUDY SELECTION The studies included in this review were clinical trials of antidepressants and other therapeutic agents in MDD populations. Participants were aged between 18 and 65 years and had a DSM-III, -IV, or -5 diagnosis of MDD. In total, 2,045 research papers were screened, 53 full-text articles were assessed, and 26 articles were eligible to be included in this systematic review. DATA EXTRACTION The data and quality of research papers were assessed and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved through a third reviewer. RESULTS Overall, studies demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants do not have procognitive effects, while vortioxetine and bupropion have demonstrated procognitive effects in MDD populations relative to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Several non-antidepressant agents, such as modafinil, amphetamines, and erythropoietin, have also demonstrated significant positive effects on cognition in depression. CONCLUSIONS Present-day antidepressants and other agents have demonstrated procognitive effects in MDD, but the findings between various agents are mixed. Further research looking at objective measures of cognitive performance would be helpful to obtain more definitive results regarding the efficacy of therapeutics for cognitive impairment in MDD.","Blumberg, Michelle J; Vaccarino, Sophie R; McInerney, Shane J",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.19r13200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726521/,19
124143,A bio-inspired cell-free system for cannabinoid production from inexpensive inputs.,2020-08-24,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a mutation in the huntingtin gene. This leads to the expression of the mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) which provokes pathological changes in both the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery. Accumulating evidence suggests that mHTT can spread between cells of the CNS but here, we explored the possibility that mHTT could also propagate and cause pathology via the bloodstream. For this, we used a parabiosis approach to join the circulatory systems of wild-type (WT) and zQ175 mice. After surgery, we observed mHTT in the plasma and circulating blood cells of WT mice and post-mortem analyses revealed the presence of mHTT aggregates in several organs including the liver, kidney, muscle and brain. The presence of mHTT in the brain was accompanied by vascular abnormalities, such as a reduction of Collagen IV signal intensity and altered vessel diameter in the striatum, and changes in expression of Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65-67) in the cortex. Conversely, we measured reduced pathology in zQ175 mice by decreased mitochondrial impairments in peripheral organs, restored vessel diameter in the cortex and improved expression of Dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP32) in striatal neurons. Collectively, these results demonstrate that circulating mHTT can disseminate disease, but importantly, that healthy blood can dilute pathology. These findings have significant implications for the development of therapies in HD.","Rieux, Marie; Alpaugh, Melanie; Sciacca, Giacomo; Saint-Pierre, Martine; Masnata, Maria; Denis, Hélèna L; Lévesque, Sébastien A; Herrmann, Frank; Bazenet, Chantal; Garneau, Alexandre P; Isenring, Paul; Truant, Ray; Oueslati, Abid; Gould, Peter V; Ast, Anne; Wanker, Erich E; Lacroix, Steve; Cicchetti, Francesca",Molecular psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0787-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32514103/,19

Earlier identification of biomarkers for SARS can facilitate detection and reduce the mortality rate of the disease. Thus, by integrated network analysis and structural modeling approach, we aimed to explore the potential drug targets and the candidate drugs for coronavirus medicated SARS. Methods: Differentially expression (DE) analysis of CoV infected host genes (HGs) expression profiles was conducted by using the Limma. Highly integrated DE-CoV-HGs were selected to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Results: Using the Walktrap algorithm highly interconnected modules include module 1 (202 nodes); module 2 (126 nodes) and module 3 (121 nodes) modules were retrieved from the PPI network. MYC, HDAC9, NCOA3, CEBPB, VEGFA, BCL3, SMAD3, SMURF1, KLHL12, CBL, ERBB4, and CRKL were identified as potential drug targets (PDTs), which are highly expressed in the human respiratory system after CoV infection. Functional terms growth factor receptor binding, c-type lectin receptor signaling, interleukin-1 mediated signaling, TAP dependent antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I, stimulatory T cell receptor signaling, and innate immune response signaling pathways, signal transduction and cytokine immune signaling pathways were enriched in the modules. Protein-protein docking results demonstrated the strong binding affinity (-314.57 kcal/mol) of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex which was selected as a drug target. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations indicated the structural stability and flexibility of the ERBB4-3cLpro complex. Further, Wortmannin was proposed as a candidate drug to ERBB4 to control SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis through inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent macropinocytosis, MAPK signaling, and NF-kb singling pathways that regulate host cell entry, replication, and modulation of the host immune system. Conclusion: We conclude that CoV drug target ""ERBB4"" and candidate drug ""Wortmannin"" provide insights on the possible personalized therapeutics for emerging COVID-19.","Selvaraj, Gurudeeban; Kaliamurthi, Satyavani; Peslherbe, Gilles H; Wei, Dong-Qing",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.50850.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968364/,19

Non-removal of the uterus may retain functional (e.g. bowel, bladder and sexual) benefits. Therefore, the concept of uterine preservation for pelvic-organ prolapse has been of interest to pelvic-floor surgeons for many decades.

METHOD Patients with Crohn's disease who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2007 were identified. Pathology slides were reviewed for the presence, number and location of granulomas in four representative slides from each specimen. RESULTS Two-hundred and seven patients were identified. At a mean follow up of 14 months, 39 patients had a recurrence, 22 (57%) of whom underwent reoperation. Ninety-four (45%) patients had granulomas present in the surgical specimen. Patients with granulomas were younger (P<0.001), had a lower preoperative body mass index (P=0.037), were more likely to be female (P=0.017) and were more likely to have extra-intestinal manifestations (P=0.026) or perianal disease (P=0.012). Sites of disease and procedures performed were similar in both groups. Disease recurrence and reoperative rates were similar in both groups, as were length of stay and morbidity rates. The average number of granulomas present in each sampled pathology slide was 7.2, and there was no correlation between number of granulomas and disease severity. No link was found between the depth of involvement of the granulomas and fistulizing or stricturing disease. CONCLUSION Granulomas were associated with increased extra-intestinal manifestations and perianal disease, a lower body mass index and younger or female patients. There was no correlation between the presence of granulomas and disease progression or recurrence rates during the short follow-up period of this study.","Denoya, P; Canedo, J; Berho, M; Allende, D S; Bennett, A E; Rosen, L; Hull, T; Wexner, S D",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02421.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20860713/,19

In the present study, a new strategy was used to evaluate the protective effect of TRQ capsule against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, by analyzing metabolic profiling of endogenous bile acids (BAs) along with biochemical and histological analyses. BAs concentrations were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis were then employed to analyze the UPLC-MS results and compare the hepatoprotective effect of TRQ capsule in different groups at the doses of 0.36, 1.44, and 2.88 g·kg-1 body weight, respectively. Moreover, our results suggested that taurocholic acid (TCA) and taurohyodesoxycholic acid (THDCA) were the most important biochemical markers, which were indicative of CCl4-induced acute hepatic damage and hepatoprotective effect of TRQ capsule.

Registries have remained subsidiary to randomized controlled trials, yet vast opportunities exist to leverage big data in stroke. SUMMARY This overview builds upon the rationale for innovative, imaging-intensive interventional registries as a pivotal step in realizing precision medicine for several cerebrovascular disorders. Such enhanced registries may serve as a model for expansion of our translational research pipeline to fully leverage the role of phase IV investigations. The scope and role of registries in precision medicine are considered, followed by a review on the history of stroke and interventional registries, data considerations, critiques or barriers to such initiatives, and the potential modernization of registry methods into efficient, searchable, imaging-intensive resources that simultaneously offer clinical, research and educational added value. KEY MESSAGES Recent advances in technology, informatics and endovascular stroke therapies converge to provide an exceptional opportunity for registries to catapult further progress. There is now a tremendous opportunity to deploy registries in acute stroke, intracranial atherosclerotic disease and carotid disease where other clinical trials leave questions unanswered. Unlike prior registries, imaging-intensive and modernized methods may leverage current technological capabilities around the world to efficiently address key objectives and provide added clinical, research and educational value.","Liebeskind, David S",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000438773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26600792/,19
127850,Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies.,2015,"BACKGROUND TransAnal Minimally Invasive Surgery (TAMIS) has been proposed as an alternative to Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery (TEM) for resection of benign polyps and early cancers of rectum. Since clinical application has begun in the absence of any experimental validation, we assessed its feasibility and efficacy ex vivo in a pilot study. METHODS In a dedicated trainer box for transanal procedures, 10 surgeons with no experience in transanal surgery were asked to perform a dissection/suture task using both TAMIS and TEM in randomly allocated order. Surgeons were asked to dissect two identically drawn lesions of ~3 cm in larger diameter. Precision of dissection was assessed using a quantitative photographic method, while the time needed for dissection and suturing was considered a measure of quantitative evaluation. Each participant expressed a subjective opinion regarding difficulty with dissection, difficulty with suturing, vision quality, and conflict between instruments on a scale from 1 to 5. RESULTS No difference was observed between the two techniques regarding the accuracy of dissection as the margin was interrupted along 4.1 % of the circumference in the TEM group compared with 2.48 % in the SILS group (P = 0.271). Dissection and suturing were significantly quicker in the TEM group [04:30 vs. 06:35 min (P = 0.049) and 14:34 versus 19:18 min (P = 0.003)]. In three cases in the SILS group, completing the suture was not considered possible, and the procedures were terminated by TEM. Subjective evaluation revealed a better appreciation of TEM in all proposed comparisons: dissection (2.6 vs. 3.5, P = 0.004), suturing difficulty (3.1 vs. 4.6, P < 0.001), quality of vision (2.3 vs. 2.8, P = 0.18), and instrument conflicts (3.1 vs. 4.0, P = 0.054).

128379,The Coevolution of Cellularity and Metabolism Following the Origin of Life.,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures (e.g., ""stay at home"" orders) may impact tobacco supply and demand among consumers. This qualitative study identified multi-level drivers of shifts in inhaled tobacco product use and access patterns during the initial COVID-19 ""lockdown"" period in the United States. METHODS Between April⁠-May 2020, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 44) with adults who use cigarettes and/or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transcripts were thematically analyzed using a socioecological framework. RESULTS Nearly all participants reported changes in their product use during lockdown, though patterns varied. Increased use was most common and was predominantly driven by individual-level factors: pandemic-related anxiety, boredom, and irregular routines. Decreased use was common among social users who cited fewer interpersonal interactions and fear of sharing products. At the community level, retail access impacted cigarette and ENDS use differently. While cigarettes were universally accessible, ENDS access was more limited, driving some to purchase products online. Delayed deliveries led some ENDS users to compensate with readily-available cigarettes. CONCLUSION To mitigate ways that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate an existing public health crisis, multi-level policy strategies, such as expanded virtual cessation services and implementation and enforcement of smoke-free home rules, can better support population health during this critical period. Policies that facilitate access to lower risk products can help minimize harm among those who cannot or do not want to quit smoking.","Giovenco, Daniel P; Spillane, Torra E; Maggi, Rachel M; Lee, Esther Y; Philbin, Morgan M",The International journal on drug policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662811/,19

Hara and Myriophyllum verticillatum Linn.). The results showed that FC and CDS not only lead to decrease in biomass and significant changes in enzyme activity and chlorophyll content in tissue, but also affected the permeability of cell membranes. The extent of damage was in the order CDS > FC, and the comprehensive stress resistance of Vallisneria natans (2.994) was more than that of Myriophyllum verticillatum (2.895). In addition, semi-permeable membranes can reduce plant damage by FC and CDS, but cannot completely prevent it. FC and CDS mainly affected the relative distribution of microbial genera on the surface of aquatic plants (p < 0.05). Furthermore, CDS caused irreversible damage to plant cells and induced programmed cell death (PCD) of plants to accelerate their decline. Therefore, FC and CDS may be one of the main reasons for the decline in submerged vegetation. This study provides a scientific basis for evaluating the harmful effects of cyanobacteria on submerged macrophytes.","Zhang, Weizhen; Gu, Peng; Zheng, Xiaowei; Wang, Ning; Wu, Hanqi; He, Jian; Luo, Xingzhang; Zhou, Liang; Zheng, Zheng",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.123372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645542/,19

The objective of this trend analysis was to assess whether clinical outcomes following laparoscopic sigmoid resection for diverticular disease have improved over the past 10 years. METHODS The analysis was based on the prospective database of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. Some 2813 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic sigmoid resection for diverticular disease from 1995 to 2006 were included. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted analyses were performed. RESULTS Over time, there was a significant reduction in the conversion rate (from 27.3 to 8.6 per cent; P(trend) < 0.001), local postoperative complication rate (23.6 to 6.2 per cent; P(trend) = 0.004), general postoperative complication rate (14.6 to 4.9 per cent; P(trend) = 0.024) and reoperation rate (5.5 to 0.6 per cent; P(trend) = 0.015). Postoperative median length of hospital stay significantly decreased from 11 to 7 days (P(trend) < 0.001). CONCLUSION This first trend analysis in the literature of clinical outcomes after laparoscopic sigmoid resection, based on almost 3000 patients, has provided compelling evidence that rates of postoperative complications, conversion and reoperation, and length of hospital stay have decreased significantly over the past 10 years.","Guller, U; Rosella, L; Karanicolas, P J; Adamina, M; Hahnloser, D",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.6787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20013934/,19

Methods: The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver enzyme changes condition and NCP patients' disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. t-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r > 0.2, FDR < 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. Conclusion: We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","Guan, G W; Gao, L; Wang, J W; Wen, X J; Mao, T H; Peng, S W; Zhang, T; Chen, X M; Lu, F M",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2020.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32077659/,19

However, studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may play a significant role as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of TCM as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 through a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Four English and three Chinese language databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. RCTs comparing TCM in combination with Western medicine (WM) with the same WM therapies alone for confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The outcome measures were cure rate, lowering of body temperature, cough relief, improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) images, deterioration of condition, and adverse effects. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A series of meta-analyses were conducted for selected outcomes using RevMan 5.3 software. The quality of evidence was appraised using the grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. Results: Ten RCTs with a total of 1,285 patients were included. Compared with WM alone in treating COVID-19, WM with auxiliary treatment by TCM appears to have increased the cure rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.26]), relieved cough (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.15-1.52]), improved chest CT images (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.11-1.37]), and reduced the number of cases transitioning from a moderate to severe condition (RR 0.58 [95% CI 0.43-0.77]). The authors are uncertain whether TCM combined WM has effects on fever normalization (RR 1.10 [95% CI 0.94-1.29]) or adverse effects (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.42-1.57]). Although they evaluated the certainty of evidence for lowering body temperature and adverse effects as very low, and low for cure rate, certainty was evaluated as moderate for improvement in chest CT images, cough relief, and deterioration of condition. Conclusion: TCM may be an effective auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is likely to help improve the main symptoms and reduce disease progression. However, due to the limited number of studies and apparent heterogeneity among them, a more definitive conclusion on the effect of TCM on lowering body temperature and adverse effects cannot be drawn at this time.","Zhou, Le-Peng; Wang, Jie; Xie, Ri-Hua; Pakhale, Smita; Krewski, Daniel; Cameron, D William; Wen, Shi Wu",Journal of alternative and complementary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2020.0310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252246/,19

OBJECTIVE To study relationship of membrane stiffness, cytoskeleton structure and storage time of pRBCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS pRBCs were processed and stored according to blood bank procedure, for 42 days, at +4°C; pRBC samples were taken on days 3, 12, 19, 21, 24, 28, 35 and 42. Cytoskeleton images and membrane stiffness were studied using atomic force microscope. RESULTS In the course of the pRBC storage, the cytoskeleton network configuration underwent structural changes. Simultaneously, pRBC membrane stiffness was increasing, with the correlation coefficient 0·88. Until 19 days, the stiffness grew slowly, in 19-24 days there occurred a transition period, after which its growth rate was three times higher than the initial. A chain of pathological processes developed in pRBC during long storage: pH reduction (linked to increased oxidative stress), then cytoskeletal destruction and an associated increase in pRBC membrane stiffness. CONCLUSION During prolonged storage of pRBCs and their acidification, there is a progression of pRBC cytoskeletal changes and associated increase of membrane stiffness, observed to increase in rate after days 19-24. Mutual measurements of cytoskeletal integrity and membrane stiffness may be useful quality assessment tool to study the molecular mechanisms of RBC structural degradation during storage.","Sherstyukova, Ekaterina; Chernysh, Aleksandr; Moroz, Viktor; Kozlova, Elena; Sergunova, Viktoria; Gudkova, Olga",Vox sanguinis,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33103792/,19

This popularised the concept of ""stealth"" surgery. CASE DETAILS A 42 year-old gentleman underwent a stealth surgery for a painless progressively growing mass in the left submandibular triangle, which was provisionally diagnosed as a Lymphoma. As he desired a scarless procedure, a linear incision in the neck was avoided, and the surgical team opted for a Retro-Auricular HairLine (RAHL) approach, with a combination of balloon spacing and ultrasonic shears dissection. DISCUSSION The procedure was performed with perfect hemostasis, and is being reported as the first case of stealth RAHL (scarless) surgery in the United Arab Emirates for a submandibular mass. This article has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria [1]. ""Stealth"" surgery is becoming increasingly popular as it helps to avoid unsightly incisions in exposed areas of the body. The term was first used by by the paediatric surgical department of John Hopkins hospital, and it caught the fancy of the public as well as the surgeons. CONCLUSION A retro-auricular endoscopic excision of a submandibular mass is being reported in this article for its feasibility and cosmesis. Following the principles of ""stealth"" surgery, invisible port site incisions were used to complete the surgery successfully. The purpose of this case report was to illustrate the feasibility and safety of the endoscopic resection using the retro-auricular approach for submandibular mass excision.","J S, Rajkumar; Reddy, Jayakrishna Aluru; Vijayan, Ranjith Kumar; Kharip, Zeina; Sisodiya, Rajesh; Eraki, Mohamed",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.105677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652365/,19

Affected kits were severely dehydrated, and their furcoats and paws were covered with yellow- to green-tinged mucoid feces. On necropsy, the small intestines of examined animals were markedly distended by serous to mucoid fluid. Microscopically, there was prominent colonization of the intestinal villar epithelium by gram-positive bacterial cocci in the absence of inflammation and morphologic changes in villous enterocytes. The colonizing bacteria were phenotypically identified as belonging to the Staphylococcus intermedius group of bacteria. This was confirmed by nucleic acid sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Further nucleic acid sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons from the superoxide dismutase gene and the heat shock protein 60 gene differentiated the isolate as Staphylococcus delphini. Production of staphylococcal enterotoxins A and E was demonstrated with a commercial ELISA-based immunoassay. Sequencing of PCR amplicons confirmed the presence of the enterotoxin E gene, but PCR amplification of the enterotoxin A, B, C, or D genes was not successful. Although direct causation was not confirmed in this study, the authors postulate that the observed hypersecretory diarrhea in these mink kits was the result of colonization of the small intestine by S delphini and subsequent production of enterotoxin.","Sledge, D G; Danieu, P K; Bolin, C A; Bolin, S R; Lim, A; Anderson, B C; Kiupel, M",Veterinary pathology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985810364514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466860/,19

METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT) for iliofemoral DVT from May 2007 to March 2012 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Patients were categorized in two groups, depending on the status of IVC filtration during the lysis procedures: patients with an IVC filter protection (group A) and patients without an IVC filter protection (group B). The primary outcome was perioperative clinically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) or intraprocedural IVC filter clot capture. RESULTS Eighty patients (mean age, 50 ± 16 years; 39 women) with symptoms averaging 12 ± 10 days were treated. A perioperative IVC filter was placed in 32 patients, and nine patients had an indwelling patent filter (group A, n = 41). Twenty patients received no filter, and 19 patients had an indwelling thrombosed filter (group B, n = 39). There were no clinically significant PE in either group. In group A, nine patients (22%) had documented embolic clot within the filter nest. The clot volume was deemed clinically significant in only two patients (5%). Factors related to embolization included female gender (odds ratio [OR], 5.833; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.038-32.797; P = .032) and preoperative clinical PE (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.043-30.081; P = .054). A trend for increased embolization was seen with a higher average number of DVT risk factors (1.44 vs 1; P = .065) and when PMT was used as a single treatment (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 0.851-21.929; P = .087). CONCLUSIONS IVC filters during thrombolysis should be used selectively in patients with preoperative clinical PE, in women and potentially in patients with multiple risk factors for DVT, or when stand-alone PMT is planned.","Avgerinos, Efthymios D; Hager, Eric S; Jeyabalan, Geetha; Marone, Luke; Makaroun, Michel S; Chaer, Rabih A",Journal of vascular surgery.

134719,Mechanistic Insights into the Chaperoning of Human Lysosomal-Galactosidase Activity: Highly Functionalized Aminocyclopentanes and C-5a-Substituted Derivatives of 4-epi-Isofagomine.,2020-09-03,"INTRODUCTION Ultrasound (US) performed prior to percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) may be useful in avoiding injury to pretracheal vascular structures and in avoiding high placement of the tube. Bedside real-time US guidance with visualization of needle path is routinely utilized for other procedures such as central venous catheterization, and may enhance the safety and accuracy of PT without causing airway occlusion or hypercarbia. Our objective was to demonstrate that PT performed under real-time US guidance with visualization of needle path during tracheal puncture is feasible, including in patients with features that increase the technical difficulty of PT. METHODS Mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring tracheostomy underwent US guided PT. The orotracheal tube was withdrawn using direct laryngoscopy. The trachea was punctured under real-time US guidance (with visualization of the needle path) while using the acoustic shadows of the cricoid and the tracheal rings to identify the level of puncture. After guidewire passage the site and level of entry was verified using the bronchoscope, which was then withdrawn. Following dilatation and tube placement, placement in the airway was confirmed using auscultation and the ""lung sliding"" sign on US. Bronchoscopy and chest X-ray were then performed to identify any complications. RESULTS Thirteen patients successfully underwent US guided PT. Three patients were morbidly obese, two were in cervical spine precautions and one had a previous tracheostomy. In all 13 patients bronchoscopy confirmed that guidewire entry was through the anterior wall and between the first and fifth tracheal rings. There was no case of tube misplacement, pneumothorax, posterior wall injury, significant bleeding or other complication during the procedure.

At the same time, the health system also faces challenges related to shortages of health professionals, low public financing, and informal payments. With the added pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, Hungarian policymakers acted rapidly to pass a sweeping regulation aimed at these issues. Over two days, the Hungarian parliament introduced and unanimously approved a new regulation, Act C of 2020 on the Employment Status of Health Workers, that replaces the existing public employment relationship between health professionals, public providers and their controlling authorities. The Act, passed on 6 October 2020, brings the employment of health workers under strict central control by introducing a new employment status similar to that of the armed forces. The Act also provides doctors with an unprecedented 120% salary increase and criminalizes informal payments. The reception has been overwhelmingly negative, with thousands of health professionals indicating that they would not sign the new contracts, and the policy also contains serious technical and feasibility concerns. Although the first statistics show that only about 3-5% of the active workforce did not sign the contract by 1 March 2021, the implementation of the reform still faces serious challenges.","Gaal, Peter; Velkey, Zita; Szerencses, Viktoria; Webb, Erin",Health policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2021.04.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030886/,19

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES Seven medical research databases (Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus) from inception to October 2018 and bibliographies and citations of relevant papers. Searches were limited to English language publications. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STUDY SELECTION Original articles describing a new multimorbidity index including more information than disease counts and not focusing on comorbidity associated with one specific disease. Studies were of adults based in the community or at population level. RESULTS Among 7128 search results, 5560 unique titles were identified. After screening against eligibility criteria the review finally included 35 papers. As index components, 25 indices used conditions (weighted or in combination with other parameters), five used diagnostic categories, four used drug use, and one used physiological measures. Predicted outcomes included mortality (18 indices), healthcare use or costs (13), hospital admission (13), and health related quality of life (7). 29 indices considered some aspect of mental health, with most including it as a comorbidity. 12 indices are recommended for use. CONCLUSIONS 35 multimorbidity indices are available, with differing components and outcomes. Researchers and clinicians should examine existing indices for suitability before creating new ones.

136493,Direct binding of ESCRT protein Chm7 to phosphatidic acid-rich membranes at nuclear envelope herniations.,2021-03-01,"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and adapted to infect humans. Several SARS-CoV-2 strains have been identified. Genetic variation is fundamental to virus evolution, and in response to selection pressure, is manifested as the emergence of new strains and species adapted to different hosts or with novel pathogenicity. The combination of variation and selection forms a genetic footprint on the genome, consisting of the preferential accumulation of mutations in particular areas. Properties of betacoronaviruses contributing to variation and the emergence of new strains and species are beginning to be elucidated. To better understand their variation, we profiled the accumulation of mutations in all species in the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 and two other species that infect humans: SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Variation profiles identified both genetically stable and variable areas at homologous locations across species within the genus Betacoronavirus. The S glycoprotein is the most variable part of the genome and is structurally disordered. Other variable parts include proteins 3, 7, and ORF8, which participate in replication and suppression of antiviral defense. In contrast, replication proteins in ORF 1b are the least variable. Collectively, our results show that variation and structural disorder in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all members of the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the potential for the continual emergence of new species and strains with novel biological properties and indicate that the S glycoprotein has a critical role in host adaptation. IMPORTANCE Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines trigger the formation of antibodies against the S glycoprotein, which are detected by antibody-based diagnostic tests. Our analysis showed that variation in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all species in the genus Betacoronavirus including three species that infect humans: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. The variable nature of the S glycoprotein provides an explanation for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 into strains, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 repeated infections in people. Variation of the S glycoprotein also has important implications for the reliability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based diagnostic tests and the design and deployment of vaccines and antiviral drugs. These findings indicate that adjustments to vaccine design and deployment and to antibody-based diagnostic tests are necessary to account for S glycoprotein variation.","LaTourrette, Katherine; Holste, Natalie M; Rodriguez-Peña, Rosalba; Leme, Raquel Arruda; Garcia-Ruiz, Hernan",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00496-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037417/,19

METHODS Programs for the AUA Annual Meeting were reviewed from 2017-2019. Topics of sessions and genders of moderators and panelists were collected. Percentages of women urologists as well as topics of sessions were compared between years. RESULTS Women urologists comprised 60 of 467 moderators (12.8%) and 63 of 614 panelists (10.3%). Sessions about infection had the most women urologist moderators while oncology had the least. Sessions about FPMRS has the most women urologists as panelists. Male urologists were more likely to be full professors compared to women urologists. While the percentage of female panelists fluctuated, the percentage of female moderators decreased each year. CONCLUSIONS Although the proportion of women to men in urology is increasing, the number and proportion of woman urologist panelists and moderators at the annual AUA meeting does not reflect this trend.

The VATS study exclusion criteria included T3 or T4 tumours, central hilar tumours, tumours visible on bronchoscopy requiring sleeve resection, hilar lymphadenopathy, N2 disease, history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation, previous thoracic surgery or pleurodesis. METHODS A retrospective study of 410 patients (143 women, mean age 61.5 ± 13.1 years (84-15) treated by VATS lobectomy between 1996 and 2011 was performed at our institution. VATS lobectomy was performed for lung cancer (n = 364, 88.9%), pulmonary metastasis (n = 25, 5.8%) and non-neoplastic diseases (n = 21, 5.1%). In lung cancer, a systematic radical lymph node dissection was performed. RESULTS There was no intraoperative death. The conversion rate was 6.1% (n = 25): bleeding (n = 4), extended pleural adhesion (n = 6, 1.4%), technical difficulty (n = 6, 1.4%), tumour extension to the fissure or mediastinum or adenopathy (n = 7, 1.7%) and intolerance to one-lung ventilation (n = 2, 0.4%). The postoperative mortality rate was 1.2% (n = 5). Major complications occurred in 21 patients (5.1%). The mean number of mediastinal nodes removed was 14.6 (5-44) and 42 patients (10.2%) presented N2 disease at the definitive staging. The mean operating time was 152 (85-315) min. The mean drainage duration was 3.2 days (1-15). Mean postoperative length of hospital stay before return at home was 6.8 days (3-75) and 5.5 days in patients without major complications. There was no port site recurrence. Kaplan-Meier 3-year survival rates were 76.5% for Stage I and 87.3% for Stage IA, 58% for Stage II and 61% for Stage III. CONCLUSIONS VATS lobectomy is an acceptable alternative and seems equivalent to open lobectomy in terms of complications and oncological value.

However, the utility of RPE in children is less researched and therefore, warrants investigation. The purpose of this scoping review is to map out the literature around the application of RPE specifically during aerobic exercise in paediatric populations. Seven bibliographic databases were systematically searched. Grey literature searching and pearling of references were also conducted. To be included for the review, studies were required to comply with the following: (1) participants aged ≤ 18 years asymptomatic of any injuries, disabilities or illnesses; (2) applied RPE in aerobic exercise, testing and/or training; (3) included at least one measure of exercise intensity; and (4) be available in English. The search identified 22 eligible studies that examined the application of RPE in children. These studies involved a total of 718 participants across ten different countries. Nine different types of RPE scales were employed. Overall, the application of RPE in paediatric populations can be classified into three distinct themes: prediction of cardiorespiratory fitness/performance, monitoring internal training loads, and regulation of exercise intensity. The utility of RPE in paediatric populations remains unclear due to the small body of available research and inconsistencies between studies. However, findings from the included studies in this scoping review may show promise. Further research focussing on child-specific RPE scales across various sports, subgroups, and in field-based settings is needed.","Kasai, Daiki; Parfitt, Gaynor; Tarca, Brett; Eston, Roger; Tsiros, Margarita D",Sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-020-01374-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206334/,19

METHODS A cross-sectional study design with nonrandom sampling was used. The sample consisted of a total of 1148 pregnant women in various trimesters. They were recruited via social media and completed an online study questionnaire in April-May 2020. RESULTS The results of the present research indicate satisfactory psychometric properties of the Polish version of the PREPS. Our findings confirm the factor structure found by the authors of the original English version of the PREPS. The scale consists of two stress subscales: perinatal infection stress and preparedness stress and one additional positive appraisal scale. Pandemic-related pregnancy stress is significantly associated with fear of childbirth and with non-pandemic pregnancy-specific stress, which bolsters its convergent validity. Higher levels of pandemic-related pregnancy stress are experienced by primiparas, those in their second or third trimester, women who received infertility treatment, and those with a high-risk pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS The Polish version of the PREPS has sound psychometric properties and replicates the structure of the original English PREPS. This stress scale can be used to investigate additional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify women at risk of high stress and those who need intervention.","Ilska, Michalina; Kołodziej-Zaleska, Anna; Brandt-Salmeri, Anna; Preis, Heidi; Lobel, Marci",Midwifery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.102940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601126/,19
139786,Genes underlying the evolution of tetrapod testes size.,2021-08-18,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate a novel, ready-to-use, iodinated polyvinyl alcohol polymer embolic implant. METHODS Under good laboratory practice conditions, 26 pigs were investigated. A complex arteriovenous malformation (AVM) model was created in 16 animals, and a simple rete model was used in the remaining 10 animals. The novel material was used for embolization in 22 animals, and a commercially available liquid embolic material in 4 animals as a control group. Animals were killed at 2 days, 3 months and 6 months. Feasibility, efficacy and safety were evaluated radiologically, clinically and histologically. RESULTS Preparation was easy, without risk of catheter clogging or adhesiveness. Embolic delivery was well controlled under subtracted fluoroscopy. Visibility was homogeneous throughout the injection and the material behaved cohesively upon delivery. Best lesion penetration was obtained with the use of proximal microballoon occlusion. Unforeseen over-dilution of the test material by DMSO prefilled in the microballoon hub changed the material properties and caused inadvertent cerebral embolization leading to death in five animals. This phenomenon was avoided by practical measures. The casts produced no beam-hardening artefacts on CT scans. Histology showed excellent biocompatibility. CONCLUSIONS Embolization with this novel, iodinated, precipitating polymer was feasible and effective. Care should be taken during delivery to avoid over-dilution of the material by prefilled DMSO. The material is promising for embolization of AVMs and hypervascular lesions. KEY POINTS • The intrinsically opaque precipitating polymer has adequate fluoroscopic visibility • The polymer does not induce shading or beam-hardening artefacts on CT • The novel liquid embolic material does not require lengthy preparation • Lack of implant adherence reduces the risk of entrapment of the delivery catheter.","Kulcsár, Zsolt; Karol, Agnieszka; Kronen, Peter W; Svende, Pfundstein; Klein, Karina; Jordan, Olivier; Wanke, Isabel",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-016-4463-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27300197/,19

Methods Inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Enze Hospital from January 17, 2020 to February 15, 2020 were included. The evolving characteristics of CT manifestations and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results Twenty-two patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Clinical symptoms at the time of onset included fever (n=19) and cough (n=8). The first CT findings mainly included ground-glass opacities (GGOs) (n=18), lung consolidation (n=7), interlobular septal thickening (n=5), and fibrosis-like stripes (n=4). Dynamic CT showed GGOs, lung consolidation, and fibrosis-like stripes, all of which demonstrated a trend that initially increased in number, and then gradually decreased in number or disappeared. According to the characteristics of CT evolution. COVID-19 could be divided into early stage, progressing stage, recovery stage, and dissipation stage. The median times of the respective stages were: early stage-3 days (1-8 days) after disease onset, progressing stage-7 days (4-17 days) after onset, recovery stage-10 days (8-14 days) after onset, and dissipation stage-19.5 days (11-25 days) after onset. Conclusions COVID-19 has an acute onset, with main imaging manifestations of different types of GGO with or without lung consolidation in the subpleural regions of the bilateral lungs. The CT manifestations of lung lesions change rapidly. The lung lesions of mild and ordinary types of COVID-19 may improve significantly or disappear in a short period after active treatment, with good prognosis. Moreover, fibrosis-like stripes may be a sign of atelectasis of sub-segment lung tissue of COVID-19 and may be a specific sign for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Kong, Min; Yang, Hai; Li, Xiaodong; Shen, Jianfei; Xu, Xinjian; Lv, Dongqing",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33145063/,19

Developing culturally appropriate interventions is paramount to closing the gap in these health inequities. The purpose of this systematic review is to critically evaluate health promotion interventions for African Americans delivered in two environments that are frequented by this population: barbershops and hair salons. Characteristics of effective interventions will be identified and evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions will be provided. Results of this review will inform future health promotion efforts for African Americans particularly focused on the leading health inequities in obesity-related chronic diseases: cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Subject headings and keywords will be used to search for synonyms of 'barbershops,' 'hair salons' and 'African Americans' to identify all relevant articles (from inception onwards) in the following databases: Academic Search Ultimate, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science (Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index) and ProQuest Dissertations.

141399,Polyvalent Interactions in Biological Systems: Implications for Design and Use of Multivalent Ligands and Inhibitors.,1998,"BACKGROUND Internal hernias have been described after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) as a major problem. Thus, many routinely close defects during LRYGB. In our technique, we do not close any defects. We hypothesize that not closing the defects would not cause a significant internal hernia rate diagnosed during reoperations. METHODS Patients who were reoperated after LRYGB were included in this study. Only patients who had a laparoscopic or open exploration focused on inspecting for internal hernias are reported here. The LRYGB technique that was utilized included an antecolic, antegastric gastrojejunostomy, minimal division of the small bowel mesentery, a long jejunojejunostomy performed with three staple lines, adequate division of the omentum, and placement of the jejunojejunostomy above the colon in the left upper quadrant. RESULTS There were a total of 387 patients who had LRYGB from 2002 to 2007 utilizing this particular technique. Fifty-four patients had a reoperation at an average of 24 (Range: 1-60) months postoperatively. The procedures were abdominoplasty, cholecystectomy, diagnostic laparoscopy, and lysis of adhesions. While two patients had a defect present, no patient had an internal hernia despite aggressive attempts to diagnose one. CONCLUSIONS Internals hernias are not common after our particular method of LRYGB.

METHODS This is a cross-sectional analysis following a prospective observational study performed at Mayo Clinic Cancer Center. Adult patients receiving cancer-directed therapy or in recent remission on active surveillance with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 18 and July 31, 2020, were included. RPM was composed of in-home technology to assess symptoms and physiologic data with centralized nursing and physician oversight. RESULTS During the study timeframe, 224 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 187 patients (83%) initially managed in the outpatient setting, those who did not receive RPM were significantly more likely to experience hospitalization than those receiving RPM. Following balancing of patient characteristics by inverse propensity score weighting, rates of hospitalization for RPM and non-RPM patients were 2.8% and 13%, respectively, implying that the use of RPM was associated with a 78% relative risk reduction in hospital admission rate (95% CI, 54 to 102; P = .002). Furthermore, when hospitalized, these patients experienced a shorter length of stay and fewer prolonged hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and deaths, although these trends did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION The use of RPM and a centralized virtual care team was associated with a reduction in hospital admission rate and lower overall acute care resource utilization among cancer patients with COVID-19.","Pritchett, Joshua C; Borah, Bijan J; Desai, Aakash P; Xie, Zhuoer; Saliba, Antoine N; Leventakos, Konstantinos; Coffey, Jordan D; Pearson, Kristina K; Speicher, Leigh L; Orenstein, Robert; Virk, Abinash; Ganesh, Ravindra; Paludo, Jonas; Halfdanarson, Thorvardur R; Haddad, Tufia C",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.21.00307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085535/,19

The treatment of dural arteriovenous fistulas has primarily become the role of the endovascular surgeon. The venous anatomy surrounding the cavernous sinus and venous sinus thrombosis that is often associated with these fistulas contributes to the complexity of these interventions. The current report gives a detailed description of the alternate endovascular routes to the cavernous sinus based on a single center's experience as well as a literature review supporting each approach. A comprehensive understanding of the anatomy and approaches to the cavernous sinus available to the endovascular surgeon is vital to the successful treatment of this condition.","Dye, Justin; Duckwiler, Gary; Gonzalez, Nestor; Kaneko, Naoki; Goldberg, Robert; Rootman, Daniel; Jahan, Reza; Tateshima, Satoshi; Szeder, Viktor",Brain sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10080554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32823885/,19

Enveloped viruses acquire their surrounding membranes by budding: either through the plasma membrane or an internal membrane of infected cells. Thus, a newly budded enveloped virus finds itself either in the extracellular milieu or in a lumenal compartment from which it can exit the cell by conventional secretion. On the other hand, naked viruses such as poliovirus, nodavirus, adenovirus, and SV40 lack an external membrane. They are simply protein-nucleic acid complexes within the cytoplasm or nucleus of the infected cell, and thus would seem to have no other exit route than cell lysis. We have presented the first documentation of nonlytic spread of a naked virus, and showed the interconnections between this event and the process or components of the autophagy pathway.","Bird, Sara W; Kirkegaard, Karla",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.4161/15548627.2014.994372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25680079/,19

Based upon our experience with esophagogastrostomy during laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, we have applied a modified lift-up method to LATG. MATERIAL AND METHODS Esophagojejunostomy using a modified lift-up method was performed during LATG in 41 patients with early gastric cancer, from July 2005 to June 2010. The lift-up technique comprises three steps, which together reduce the difficulty of anvil insertion by lifting up the nasogastric tube connected to the anvil head. RESULTS During the early stages of the present study, some patients who underwent LATG with the modified lift-up method developed anastomotic leakage, with stenosis occurring in two cases (4.9%) and three cases (7.3%), respectively. All patients who developed complications showed improvement following conservative treatment with no surgical procedure. The anastomotic leaks occurred during the later periods of the study. There was no mortality in the present study. CONCLUSIONS Our modified lift-up technique facilitates circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy in LATG and could provide a more feasible and safe option for an established procedure, especially for preventing anastomotic leak.","Nunobe, Souya; Hiki, Naoki; Tanimura, Shinya; Kubota, Takeshi; Kumagai, Koshi; Sano, Takeshi; Yamaguchi, Toshiharu",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-011-1489-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21557017/,19

While the author's story is unique, other medical students have also faced challenges that have led them to consider a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Although resources are available, stigma represents a significant barrier for students as they decide whether to seek help. Students fear that showing the slightest hint of vulnerability or imperfection will be used against them in an advancement committee, a course evaluation, or the dean's letter for residency applications. This difficulty asking for help and the subsequent suppression of feelings can lead to burnout and ultimately to increased risk of suicide. The author calls for medical schools to make changes to their culture to preserve medical student mental health. These include committing to helping students who are struggling academically or psychologically; implementing an institution-wide program to screen for individuals at risk for suicide; educating members of the institution's community about depression to destigmatize seeking help for mental health; and ensuring confidential mental health services are readily available to those who need them. But, most importantly, medical schools must create a culture that normalizes the need for self-care and includes vulnerability as part of training in professionalism.","Veal, Christopher Thomas",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570856/,19

To inform and evaluate such initiatives, guidance is required on indicators that describe and monitor population-level preconception health. We searched relevant databases and websites (March 2021) to identify national and international preconception guidelines, recommendations and policy reports. These were reviewed to identify preconception indicators. Indicators were aligned with a measure describing the prevalence of the indicator as recorded in national population-based data sources in England. From 22 documents reviewed, we identified 66 indicators across 12 domains. Domains included wider (social/economic) determinants of health; health care; reproductive health and family planning; health behaviours; environmental exposures; cervical screening; immunisation and infections; mental health, physical health; medication and genetic risk. Sixty-five of the 66 indicators were reported in at least one national routine health data set, survey or cohort study. A measure of preconception health assessment and care was not identified in any current national data source. Perspectives from three (healthcare) professionals described how indicator assessment and monitoring may influence patient care and inform awareness campaign development. This review forms the foundation for developing a national surveillance system for preconception health in England. The identified indicators can be assessed using national data sources to determine the population's preconception needs, improve patient care, inform and evaluate new campaigns and interventions and enhance accountability from responsible agencies to improve preconception health.","Schoenaker, Danielle A J M; Stephenson, Judith; Connolly, Anne; Shillaker, Sally; Fishburn, Sarah; Barker, Mary; Godfrey, Keith M; Alwan, Nisreen A",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,https://doi.org/10.1017/s2040174421000258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085623/,19

Methods: 144 individuals participated in the present study and were randomly allocated to three mask groups of 48 (N95, SURGICAL, and NO MASK) with two exercise subgroups for each mask group (MAX, n = 24; SUB, n = 24) for both sexes. Participants in each experimental group (N95SUB, N95MAX; SURSUB, SURMAX; SUB, MAX) were assessed for their hemodynamic and hematologic function at baseline and during recovery after exercise. Results: No significant differences were noted for either hemodynamic or hematologic function at post-exercise as compared to baseline with regard to mask modality (P > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) for maximal intensity were significantly greater at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to SURGICAL (P < 0.05). No differences were noted for hemodynamic and hematologic function with N95 and SURGICAL compared to NOMASK for either intensity (P > 0.05). Females showed significantly greater HR values at 1 min post-exercise in N95 as compared to NO MASK, but no significant differences were noted for hematological function between sexes (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings show that wearing a face mask (N95/surgical) while exercising has no detrimental effects on hemodynamic/hematologic function in both males and females, and suggest that wearing a mask, particularly a surgical mask, while exercising during the ongoing pandemic is safe and poses no risk to individual's health.

BACKGROUND The natural history and management of traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysms is controversial. METHODS We retrospectively identified all traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysms diagnosed on head/neck computed tomographic angiography at a high-volume trauma center over a 10-year period. Radiographic and clinical data were recorded, and a treatment algorithm was derived. RESULTS Forty-three pseudoaneurysms were diagnosed in 39 patients. All patients were treated with daily aspirin unless contraindicated, and 82% underwent daily transcranial Doppler ultrasonography with embolic monitoring. A rate of 8 or more emboli per hour was predictive of embolic stroke (P = 0.0076). Acute ischemic or embolic stroke was seen in 7 patients (16%) with an overall mortality in this subpopulation of 42% (n = 3). Four patients (9%) underwent acute surgical treatment (parent vessel sacrifice and/or arterial bypass) for ongoing ischemia. Long-term radiographic and clinical follow-up was obtained for 36 surviving patients (mean = 8 months; range: 1 week-5 years), all of whom were maintained on daily aspirin. No delayed ischemic or embolic events were reported. For ICA pseudoaneurysms treated with aspirin and observation alone, 9 (28%) increased in size, 17 (53%) decreased or stabilized, and 6 (19%) resolved. Enlargement of 5 mm or more in maximal diameter underwent delayed endovascular treatment with a 100% obliteration rate and no complications. CONCLUSIONS Traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysms are safely treated with daily aspirin, embolic monitoring, and radiographic surveillance. Acute stroke or hemorrhage, or delayed radiographic progression, are indications for endovascular or surgical treatment.","Morton, Ryan P; Levitt, Michael R; Emerson, Samuel; Ghodke, Basavaraj V; Hallam, Danial K; Sekhar, Laligam N; Kim, Louis J; Chesnut, Randall M",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000001158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25692360/,19

The aim of this study is to compare three different hemostatic techniques. METHODS This is a prospective randomized study. There were 150 patients, aged 56 +/- 14 years, randomized for total thyroidectomy with conventional technique (CT), Ligasure vessel sealing system (LI) or Harmonic Scalpel (HS) at the university surgical department. One hundred thirty-five patients had benign diseases; 15 had malignancies. RESULTS Mean postoperative hospital stay was 2.6 days. Mean operation time was 113 +/- 31 min; in HS patients, it was significantly shorter (p < 0.001). Morbidity was 43.3%; mortality was nil. Morbidity was significantly different between CT and NT groups (p = 0.0002); HS and LI groups had a higher morbidity (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.02, respectively). Mean postoperative calcemia was 1.12 +/- 0.1 mmol/l with a significant difference between groups; NT patients had a significantly lower calcemia (p < 0.05). There was no difference in recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies and in intraoperative blood losses (p = ns).

Objective To examine changes in US emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions (MHCs), suicide attempts (SAs), overdose (OD), and violence outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program to examine national changes in ED visits for MHCs, SAs, ODs, and violence from December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020 (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). The National Syndromic Surveillance Program captures approximately 70% of US ED visits from more than 3500 EDs that cover 48 states and Washington, DC. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcome measures were MHCs, SAs, all drug ODs, opioid ODs, intimate partner violence (IPV), and suspected child abuse and neglect (SCAN) ED visit counts and rates. Weekly ED visit counts and rates were computed overall and stratified by sex. Results From December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020, a total of 187 508 065 total ED visits (53.6% female and 46.1% male) were captured; 6 018 318 included at least 1 study outcome (visits not mutually exclusive). Total ED visit volume decreased after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in the US beginning on March 16, 2020. Weekly ED visit counts for all 6 outcomes decreased between March 8 and 28, 2020 (March 8: MHCs = 42 903, SAs = 5212, all ODs = 14 543, opioid ODs = 4752, IPV = 444, and SCAN = 1090; March 28: MHCs = 17 574, SAs = 4241, all ODs = 12 399, opioid ODs = 4306, IPV = 347, and SCAN = 487). Conversely, ED visit rates increased beginning the week of March 22 to 28, 2020. When the median ED visit counts between March 15 and October 10, 2020, were compared with the same period in 2019, the 2020 counts were significantly higher for SAs (n = 4940 vs 4656, P = .02), all ODs (n = 15 604 vs 13 371, P < .001), and opioid ODs (n = 5502 vs 4168, P < .001); counts were significantly lower for IPV ED visits (n = 442 vs 484, P < .001) and SCAN ED visits (n = 884 vs 1038, P < .001). Median rates during the same period were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 for all outcomes except IPV.

One of the most prone individuals, even in normal situations is patients with HIV. Currently, the evidence regarding the link between HIV and COVID-19 is still limited and conflicting. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HIV and poor outcomes of COVID-19 infection. METHODS We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 12th, 2021. All articles published on COVID-19 and HIV were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. RESULTS A total of 38 studies with 18,271,025 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that HIV was not associated with composite poor outcome [OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.95 - 1.23), p = 0.26, I2 = 68%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by hypertension (p < 0.00001) and diabetes (p = 0.0007). Subgroup analysis which involves only studies from African region showed that HIV was associated with composite poor outcomes [OR 1.11 (95% CI 1.03 - 1.21), p = 0.01, I2 = 0%, random-effect modelling].

147364,In silico prediction of new mutations that can improve the binding abilities between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and human ACE2.,2021-02-09,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Anterior (Wendler) glottoplasty has become a popular surgery for voice feminization. However, there has been some discrepancy between its theoretical pitch-raising potential and what is actually achievable, and downsides to shortening the glottis have not been fully explored. In addition, descriptions of the surgery are inconsistent in their treatment of the vocal ligament. This study aimed to determine 1) how fundamental frequency (fo ) is expected to vary with length of anterior glottic fixation, 2) the impact of glottic shortening on sound pressure level (SPL), and 3) the effect of including the ligament in fixation. STUDY DESIGN Computational simulation. METHODS Voice production was simulated in a fiber-gel finite element computational model using canonical male vocal fold geometry incorporating a three-layer vocal fold composition (superficial lamina propria, vocal ligament, and thyroarytenoid muscle). Progressive anterior glottic fixation (0, 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, etc. up to 7/8 of membranous vocal fold length) was simulated. Outcome measures were fo , SPL, and glottal flow waveforms. RESULTS fo increased from 110 Hz to 164 Hz when the anterior one-half vocal fold was fixed and continued to progressively rise with further fixation. SPL progressively decreased beyond 1/8 to 1/4 fixation. Inclusion of the vocal ligament in fixation did not further increase fo . Any fixation increased aperiodicity in the acoustic signal. CONCLUSIONS The optimal length of fixation is a compromise between pitch elevation and reduction in output acoustic power. The simulation also provided a potential explanation for vocal roughness that is sometimes noted after anterior glottoplasty.

OBJECTIVE To critically evaluate two commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serology tests. DESIGN A total of 333 unique, non-duplicated serum samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n=170) and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 were used in the study. Samples were tested on the Roche E411 and Abbott Architect i4000SR platforms and results were correlated to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and clinical symptoms. RESULTS There was a strong level of agreement in the qualitative results between both assays with a Cohen's kappa value of 0.840, P<.001. The specificity for both Roche and Abbott were excellent at 100%. Roche exhibited marginally better performance in the ≥21 days group with a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI 75.8-96.8%) versus Abbott's sensitivity 84.4% (95% CI 68.3 - 93.1%) as well as the 14-20 days group with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI 65.4 - 95.0%) versus Abbott sensitivity 81.0% (95% CI 60.0 - 92.3%). Less than 14 days of symptoms groups exhibited poor sensitivity at <50% for both assays. The area under curve (AUC ± standard error) for Roche (0.894 ± 0.025, P< .001) and Abbott (0.884 ± 0.026, P <.001) were very similar.

METHODS We performed database search, literature mining and drug-like index screening to identify the bioactive components in TJQW, the positive drugs for disease treatment and their therapeutic targets. The core disease target was investigated based on the cross-linking interaction of the bioactive components, positive drug and potential disease target, and the target proteins at the key nodes were analyzed by GO and KEGG analyses. Based on the therapeutic targets for COVID-19, virtual screening was conducted to screen the compounds in TJQW and construct the network cross-linking the key bioactive molecules in TJQW, key node targets of the disease, and the related biological pathways. RESULTS We identified 159 compounds in TJQW and obtained 18 core proteins based on the cross-linking of the bioactive components, positive drugs and disease targets. The key node targets consisted of 22 targets including the latest 4 COVID-19 proteins. Virtual screening results showed that at least 14 compounds could bind with the core disease target proteins. The material basis of TJQW for COVID-19 treatment was explained in multi-pathway, multi-component and multi-target perspectives. In terms of the structural characteristics of the compounds, we screened the top 30 molecules with strong binding with the target proteins, among which flavonoids were the predominant components. CONCLUSIONS This investigation reveals the therapeutic mechanism of TJQW for COVID-19 involving multiple components, targets and pathways from the perspective of key bioactive molecules, disease key node targets and related biological pathways. We screened 30 active precursors from TJQW, which provides reference for the clinical application and further development of TJQW.","Ma, Shitang; Zhang, Xue; Cen, Jinfeng; Hong, Ge; Hong, Shengwei; Ju, Wenzheng",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.08.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895172/,19

This study analyzed the performance and correlation of two quantitative anti-S1 assays in oligo-/asymptomatic individuals from a population-based cohort. Methods In total, 362 plasma samples (108 with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]-positive pharyngeal swabs, 111 negative controls, and 143 with positive serology without confirmation by RT-PCR) were tested with quantitative assays (Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EI-S1-IgG-quant]) and Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [Ro-RBD-Ig-quant]), which were compared with each other and confirmatory tests, including wild-type virus micro-neutralization (NT) and GenScript®cPass™. Square roots R of coefficients of determination were calculated for continuous variables and non-parametric tests were used for paired comparisons. Results Quantitative anti-S1 serology correlated well with each other (true positives, 96%; true negatives, 97%). Antibody titers decreased over time (< 30 to > 240 days after initial positive RT-PCR). Agreement with GenScript-cPass was 96%/99% for true positives and true negatives, respectively, for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and 93%/97% for EI-S1-IgG-quant. Ro-RBD-Ig-quant allowed distinct separation between positives and negatives, and less non-specific reactivity versus EI-S1-IgG-quant. Raw values (95% CI) ≥ 28.7 U/mL (22.6-36.4) for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and ≥ 49.8 U/mL (43.4-57.1) for EI-S1-IgG-quant predicted NT > 1:5 in 95% of cases. Conclusions Our findings suggest both quantitative anti-S1 assays (EI-S1-IgG-quant and Ro-RBD-Ig-quant) may replace direct neutralization assays in quantitative measurement of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 in certain circumstances. However, although the mean antibody titers for both assays tended to decrease over time, a higher proportion of Ro-RBD-Ig-quant values remained positive after 240 days.

We show that expression of ELF5, a transcription factor critical for normal mammary development, is downregulated in mammary luminal epithelia with age. DNA-methylation of the ELF5 promoter is negatively correlated with expression in an age-dependent manner. Both ELF5 methylation and gene expression were used to build biological clocks to estimate chronological ages of mammary epithelia. ELF5 clock-based estimates of biological age in luminal epithelia from average-risk women were within 3 years of chronological age. Biological ages of breast epithelia from BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers, who were high risk for developing breast cancer, suggested they were accelerated by two decades relative to chronological age. The ELF5 DNA methylation clock had better performance at predicting biological age in luminal epithelial cells as compared to two other epigenetic clocks based on whole tissues. We propose that the changes in ELF5 expression or ELF5-proximal DNA methylation in luminal epithelia are emergent properties of at-risk breast tissue and constitute breast-specific biological clocks.","Miyano, Masaru; Sayaman, Rosalyn W; Shalabi, Sundus F; Senapati, Parijat; Lopez, Jennifer C; Angarola, Brittany Lynn; Hinz, Stefan; Zirbes, Arrianna; Anczukow, Olga; Yee, Lisa D; Sedrak, Mina S; Stampfer, Martha R; Seewaldt, Victoria L; LaBarge, Mark A",Cancer prevention research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.capr-20-0635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140348/,19

Stringent regulatory guidelines and zero tolerance policy toward this bacterium necessitate rapid, accurate, and reliable methods of identification and subtyping. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) has recently become a method of choice for routine identification of pathogens in clinical settings and has largely replaced biochemical assays. Identification relies on well-curated databases such as SARAMIS. Extensive use of SARAMIS to generate consensus mass spectra, in conjunction with statistical analysis, such as partial least square-discriminant analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, is useful in subtyping bacteria. While MALDI-ToF MS has been extensively used for pathogen detection, its application in bacterial subtyping has been limited. The protocol describes a MALDI-ToF MS workflow as a single tool for simultaneous identification and subtyping of L. monocytogenes directly from solid culture medium.","Jadhav, Snehal R; Shah, Rohan M; Palombo, Enzo A",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-0982-8_2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975763/,19

This may be of value when monitoring gases with short-term maximum levels and for time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations used in standard measuring practices. A functional embedded system was designed using low-cost carbon monoxide (CO) electrochemical sensors and long-range-wide-area-network radio communication technology (LoRaWAN) was used to enable internet connectivity. This system was utilized to monitor gas levels continuously in the working atmosphere of an incineration plant over a 2-month period. The results show that stable and long-term continuous data transfer was enabled by LoRaWAN, which proved useful for detecting rapid changes in gas levels. However, it was observed that raw data from the low-cost sensors did not meet the NIOSH accuracy criteria of [Formula: see text]25% of the estimated true concentration based on field data from a co-located gas detector that met the NIOSH accuracy criteria. The new IoT technologies and CO sensor networks shows potential for remote monitoring of exposure in order to: (1) detect rapid changes in CO and other possible hazardous airborne gases; and (2) show the dynamic range of real-time data that may be hazardous for workers in the sampled areas. While the IoT low-cost sensors appear to be useful as a sentinel for monitoring hazardous atmospheres containing CO, the more useful finding may be showing real-time changes and the dynamic range of exposures, thus shedding light on the transient and toxic nature of airborne hazards. More importantly, the low-cost CO sensors are not a clear substitute for the more costly real-time gas detectors that perform within the NIOSH accuracy criteria.","Johannessen, Lene N; Grimstad, Hans Jørgen; Skjetne, Jens Emil; Myklebust, Ida Nord; Svendsen, Kristin V Hirsch",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1798453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776824/,19
150884,Lessons in antiviral immunity.,2021-01-29,"The innate immune response is critical for host defence against respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs). This study demonstrated that an ongoing respiratory virus infection compromises innate immune responses and affects the pathogenesis of a respiratory CoV co-infection. An innate immunosuppressive respiratory virus infection was established by infecting weaned pigs with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV); 10 days later, the pigs were exposed to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). The PRRSV/PRCV dual-infected pigs had reduced weight gains, a higher incidence of fever and more severe pneumonia compared with either single infection. Significant suppression of innate immune responses [reduced alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) levels in the lungs and reduced blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity] by the ongoing PRRSV infection was observed in dual-infected pigs, which coincided with exacerbated pneumonia during early PRCV infection. The subsequent PRCV infection led to enhanced PRRSV replication in the lungs and a trend towards increased serum T-helper type 1 (Th1) (IFN-gamma) but decreased Th2 [interleukin (IL)-4] responses, further exacerbating PRRSV pneumonia. Following PRCV infection, more severe PRRSV-related pulmonary alveolar macrophage (PAM) apoptosis occurred, as determined by an in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay, suggesting increased PRRSV replication in PAMs. Collectively, these observations suggest interactive effects between PRCV and PRRSV via early innate (IFN-alpha) and later adaptive Th1 (IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4) immune responses. These findings imply that an existing immunomodulating respiratory viral co-infection may be a contributing factor to more severe pneumonia in respiratory CoV disease. This study provides new insights into host-pathogen interactions related to co-infection by CoVs and other respiratory viruses.","Jung, Kwonil; Renukaradhya, Gourapura J; Alekseev, Konstantin P; Fang, Ying; Tang, Yuxin; Saif, Linda J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.014001-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19656969/,19

152159,Docking paradigm: Drug Design.,2020-12-06,"OBJECTIVE To assess the demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of young Australians who die by suicide. DESIGN Retrospective analysis of National Coronial Information System (NCIS) data. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS People aged 10-24 years who died by suicide in Australia during 2006-2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographic, social, and clinical characteristics of young people who died by suicide; circumstances of death recorded in the NCIS. RESULTS 3365 young people died of suicide during 2006-2015 (including 2473 boys and men, 73.5%); 1292 people (38.4%) lived in areas of greater socio-economic disadvantage. Free text reports were included in the NCIS for 3027 people (90%), of whom 1237 (40.9%) had diagnosed mental health disorders and 475 (15.7%) had possible mental health disorders. Alcohol consumption near the time of death was detected in 1015 of 3027 cases (33.5%); histories of self-harm were recorded in 940 cases (31.1%) and of illicit substance misuse in 852 (28.1%). Adverse life events included history of abuse or neglect (223, 7.4%), suicide of relatives, friends, or acquaintances (202, 6.7%), and financial difficulties (174, 5.8%). CONCLUSIONS Three-quarters of the young people who died by suicide were boys or young men, and 57% had diagnosed or possible mental health disorders, suggesting that the mental health and wellbeing of young Australians should be a key target for youth suicide prevention. To reduce the number of youth suicides, it is imperative that prevention strategies target the mental health and psychosocial stressors that lead to suicidal crises in young people.","Hill, Nicole Tm; Witt, Katrina; Rajaram, Gowri; McGorry, Patrick D; Robinson, Jo",The Medical journal of Australia,https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.50876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236400/,19

We investigated whether endoscopists without prior training in NBI can achieve the following thresholds recommended by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: for diminutive colorectal polyps characterized with high confidence, a ≥90% negative predictive value for adenomas in the rectosigmoid and a ≥90% agreement in surveillance intervals. METHODS Twenty-six endoscopists from 2 tertiary care centers underwent standardized training in NBI interpretation. Endoscopists made real-time predictions of diminutive colorectal polyp histology and surveillance interval predictions based on NBI. Their performance was evaluated by comparing predicted with actual findings from histologic analysis. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess predictors of performance. Cumulative summation analysis was used to characterize learning curves. RESULTS The endoscopists performed 1451 colonoscopies and made 3012 diminutive polyp predictions (74.3% high confidence) using NBI. They made 898 immediate post-procedure surveillance interval predictions. An additional 505 surveillance intervals were determined with histology input. The overall negative predictive value for high-confidence characterizations in the rectosigmoid was 94.7% (95% confidence interval: 92.6%-96.8%) and the surveillance interval agreement was 91.2% (95% confidence interval: 89.7%-92.7%). Overall, 97.0% of surveillance interval predictions would have brought patients back on time or early. High-confidence characterization was the strongest predictor of accuracy (odds ratio = 3.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.72-4.29; P < .001). Performance improved over time, however, according to cumulative summation analysis, only 7 participants (26.9%) identified adenomas with sufficient sensitivity such that further auditing is not required. CONCLUSIONS With standardized training, gastroenterologists without prior expertise in NBI were able to meet the negative predictive value and surveillance interval thresholds set forth by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. The majority of disagreement in surveillance interval brought patients back early. Performance improves with time, but most endoscopists will require ongoing auditing of performance.

METHODS Individuals receiving services during May 8-18, 2020, from behavioral health programs that had introduced telehealth in March 2020, were invited to participate in a survey regarding their perceptions of the telehealth services. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to test for differences in survey responses in three ways: between program types, between the 2020 sample and a 2018 sample, and between individuals reported by staff to be distressed or not distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Of 1,482 survey respondents, >80% reported that their ability to connect to staff, receive support, and get an appointment was at least as great as before the pandemic. Among 80% of respondents indicating interest in continuing remote services after the pandemic ended, 83% preferred a mix of remote and face-to-face services. From February 2020 to April 2020, total service utilization remained stable for treatment, outreach, and housing programs. In addition, mental health-related hospital utilization did not increase. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study suggest that telehealth, including telephone-based services, is an acceptable and even preferred service delivery mode for clients with severe mental illness. Continued investigation into the optimal dosing of face-to-face versus remote services in various settings is needed to inform service practice during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tse, Jeanie; LaStella, Drew; Chow, Elisa; Kingman, Emily; Pearlman, Shoshannah; Valeri, Linda; Wang, Hao; Dixon, Lisa B",Psychiatric services,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957769/,19

Here, we report on systematic VT and DOSY NMR studies, XRD analyses as well as DFT calculations on a sulfoximinoyl-substituted model system to explain the pronounced solvent dependency of the carbenoid stability. While the sodium and potassium chloride car-benoids showed high stabilities independent of the solvent, the lithium carbenoid was stable at room temperature in THF but decomposed at -10 °C in toluene. These divergent stabilities could be explained by the different structures formed in solution. In contrast to simple organolithium reagents, the monomeric THF-solvate was found to be more stable than the dimer in toluene, since the latter more readily forms direct Li/Cl interactions which facilitate decomposition via α-elimination.","Dilchert, Katharina; Schmidt, Michelle; Großjohann, Angela; Feichtner, Kai-Stephan; Mulvey, Robert E; Gessner, Viktoria H",Angewandte Chemie,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202011278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006796/,19

Therefore, a laboratory developed test (LDT) comprising a multiplexed RT-PCR protocol that detects and differentiates the four hCoV NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 was adapted on the PF. The novel CE marked Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV were validated with 321 diagnostic specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract in comparison to two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (PF E-gene RT-PCR and genesig RT-PCR, 157 specimens) or the R-GENE hCoV/hParaFlu RT-PCR (164 specimens), respectively. For the endemic hCoV, results were 96.3 % concordant with two specimens discordantly positive in the PF and four specimens discordantly positive in the R-GENE assay. All discordantly positive samples had Ct values between 33 and 39. The PF hCoV LDT identified 23 hCoV positive specimens as NL63, 15 as 229E, 15 as HKU1 and 25 as OC43. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA gave 99.4 % concordant results compared to the consensus results with a single specimen discordantly positive. Moreover, 36 samples from proficiency testing panels were detected and typed correctly by both novel methods.

APERIUS(®) is a minimally invasive IPD that can be implanted percutaneously. This multicentre prospective study was designed to make a preliminary evaluation of safety and effectiveness of this IPD up to 12 months post-implantation. METHODS After percutaneous implantation in 156 patients with NIC due to DLSS, data on symptoms, quality of life, pain, and use of pain medication were obtained for up to 12 months. RESULTS Early symptom and physical function improvements were maintained for up to 12 months, when 60 and 58 % of patients maintained an improvement higher than the Minimum Clinically Important Difference for Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) symptom severity and physical function, respectively. Leg, buttock/groin, and back pain were eased throughout, and the use and strength of related pain medication were reduced.

154952,Size and scale during development and regeneration.,2020-08-12,"Seasonal respiratory infections place an increased burden on health services annually. We used a sentinel emergency department syndromic surveillance system to understand the factors driving respiratory attendances at emergency departments (EDs) in England. Trends in different respiratory indicators were observed to peak at different points during winter, with further variation observed in the distribution of attendances by age. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed acute respiratory infection and bronchitis/bronchiolitis ED attendances in patients aged 1-4 years were particularly sensitive indicators for increasing respiratory syncytial virus activity. Using near real-time surveillance of respiratory ED attendances may provide early warning of increased winter pressures in EDs, particularly driven by seasonal pathogens. This surveillance may provide additional intelligence about different categories of attendance, highlighting pressures in particular age groups, thereby aiding planning and preparation to respond to acute changes in EDs, and thus the health service in general.","Hughes, H E; Morbey, R; Hughes, T C; Locker, T E; Pebody, R; Green, H K; Ellis, J; Smith, G E; Elliot, A J",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268815002125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26415918/,19

155350,Binding and folding in transcriptional complexes.,2020-11-25,"Background and Purpose- Two large-scale randomized controlled trials of recurrent stroke prevention suggest that dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin is beneficial for prevention of subsequent ischemic events. There is a paucity of data, however, on the efficacy or effectiveness of such an approach in the treatment of stroke patients with symptomatic large artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Methods- We used a multicenter stroke registry database (Clinical Research Collaboration for Stroke in Korea) to analyze acute ischemic stroke patients due to large artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease who were treated with aspirin alone or combination of clopidogrel and aspirin from May 2008 to May 2015. The results were analyzed by intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and as-treated methodologies. The primary end point was the 1-year composite outcome of stroke recurrence, myocardial infarction, and all-cause death. To balance the differences between groups, a frailty model using propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting was used. Results- A total of 5934 patients with symptomatic large artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease were treated either with clopidogrel plus aspirin (n=2903, 49%) or aspirin (n=3031, 51%). The frequency of the primary outcome was 12% (n=353) in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and 14% (n=410) in the aspirin group. The hazards of the primary outcome with combination over aspirin only were significantly reduced in the per-protocol and as-treated analyses (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.88; P=0.002 and hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.96; P=0.02, respectively), but there was borderline significance in the intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.01; P=0.06). Combination therapy was beneficial for all-cause death in all analyses but did not reduce recurrent stroke. Conclusions- Compared with patients receiving aspirin monotherapy, the primary outcome seemed to occur less frequently in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, which is explained mainly by the decrease of all-cause death. Since this is a nonrandomized, retrospective, observational study, our study should be cautiously interpreted.","Kim, Dohoung; Park, Jong-Moo; Kang, Kyusik; Cho, Yong-Jin; Hong, Keun-Sik; Lee, Kyung Bok; Park, Tai Hwan; Lee, Soo Joo; Kim, Jae Guk; Han, Moon-Ku; Kim, Beom Joon; Lee, Jun; Cha, Jae-Kwan; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Nah, Hyun-Wook; Kim, Dong-Eog; Ryu, Wi-Sun; Kim, Joon-Tae; Choi, Kang-Ho; Choi, Jay Chol; Lee, Byung-Chul; Yu, Kyung-Ho; Oh, Mi Sun; Kim, Wook-Joo; Kwon, Jee-Hyun; Shin, Dong-Ick; Sohn, Sung-Il; Hong, Jeong-Ho; Lee, Ji Sung; Lee, Juneyoung; Gorelick, Philip B; Bae, Hee-Joon",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.024786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30932785/,19

METHODS We used a Penrose drain with threads ligated on both ends to suspend the stomach. We then pulled the threads out of the body from the side of the trocar or from besides the xiphisternum by using Endo Close. In most cases, 2 Penrose drains were used to retract the stomach. When the greater omentum on the left side of the cardia still blocks the surgical field, we sewed the posterior wall of the stomach onto the dome of the diaphragm. RESULTS The use of 2 Penrose drains and Endo Close were effective to retract the stomach in most cases. However, in 3 cases, we needed to additionally sew the stomach onto the diaphragm to fully open up the field.

Methods: From January 2020 to February 2020, 54 patients who were newly diagnosed with NCP in Wuhan Fourth Hospital were included in this study. RT-PCR method was used to measure the level of 2019-nCov RNA in pharyngeal swab samples of these patients. The patients were divided into RNA positive and negative group, and the differences of clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics were compared. Results: There were 31 RNA of 2019-nCov positive cases, and 23 negative cases. Common clinical symptoms of two groups were fever (80.64% vs. 86.96%) , chills (61.29% vs.52.17%) , cough (80.64% vs.95.65%) , fatigue (61.30% vs.56.52%) , chest distress (77.42% vs.73.91%) . Some other symptoms were headache, myalgia, dyspnea, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The laboratory and radiological characteristics of two groups mainly were lymphopenia, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased C-reactive protein, increased lactate dehydrogenase, decreased oxygenation index, normal white blood cell count and bilateral chest CT involvement. There was no statistically significant difference in other clinical characteristics except for dyspnea between two groups. Conclusions: RNA positive and negative NCP patients shared similar clinical symptoms, while RNA positive NCP patients tended to have dyspnea. Therefore, we should improve the understanding of NCP to prevent missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis; In addition, more rapid and accurate NCP diagnostic approaches should be further developed.","Li, Y Y; Wang, W N; Lei, Y; Zhang, B; Yang, J; Hu, J W; Ren, Y L; Lu, Q F",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200214-00095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087623/,19

This uncharted territory has changed the practices in modern healthcare delivery; this is particularly true in the case of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) where various changes are being adopted. This survey was conducted to determine the impact of the pandemic and the changes being adopted in the field of MIS, from a resource-limited developing country, India. Materials and Methods The survey was carried out from 27 July to 22 August 2020, amongst MIS surgeons in India using an online questionnaire generated on Google Forms. Results The survey was completed by 251 MIS surgeons nationwide. There was a proportional reduction of overall elective surgeries and MIS. Approximately 30% of the surgeons continued to use MIS, as during the pre-pandemic era. Pre-operative tests for COVID-19 (96.1%) and personal protective equipment (PPE, 66%-86%), including respirators (95.2%), are used uniformly across the nation. Almost half (43.1%) of the MIS surgeons are using ≥6 recommended intraoperative modifications in MIS to mitigate the COVID-19 transmission. Conclusion MIS surgeons in India have adapted within a short time to the challenge of the pandemic by embracing pre-operative testing, PPE and new techniques/technologies to continue patient care. Innovations and low-cost indigenous customisations are the need of the hour for a developing country like India. Further studies are required to establish the true risk of viral transmission involved in MIS and the efficacies of the techniques/devices to reduce the spread of the virus.","Balakrishna, Pavithra; Singh, Hemant Kumar; Kumar, Naresh P; Jamir, Limalemla",Journal of minimal access surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmas.jmas_244_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045412/,19
158928,Collectrin and ACE2 in renal and intestinal amino acid transport.,2011,"PRACTICAL RELEVANCE Minimally invasive techniques are becoming increasingly available in both first opinion and referral veterinary surgeries. Clients may be reluctant to pursue open surgery for the collection of biopsy samples in a sick cat but may be more open to a laparoscopic approach. Furthermore, a laparoscopic approach provides excellent visualization of the abdominal organs and enables high quality biopsies to be taken that are invariably more diagnostic than percutaneous needle biopsies. Although the feline patient is small in size, its distensible abdomen allows more room for surgical manipulation than afforded by a similar sized canine patient. CLINICAL CHALLENGES Clinical challenges for the most part relate to mastering laparoscopic technique. Familiarity with the use of long instrumentation viewed on a two-dimensional screen is essential. Hemostasis is an important consideration and suitable instrumentation for achieving hemostasis should be available at all times. Insufflation of the abdomen carries its own challenges with regard to anesthesia and this is covered in an accompanying article in this Special Issue series. AIM This article introduces the feline practitioner to basic techniques required to effectively utilize diagnostic laparoscopy within feline medical investigations. It focuses on the common procedures of liver biopsy, cholecystocentesis, pancreatic biopsy, kidney biopsy and laparoscopic-assisted intestinal biopsy.

BACKGROUND PCI for in-stent total occlusive disease has traditionally been associated with low success rates. We sought to examine angiographic and procedural outcomes of patients who underwent CTO PCI due to ISR using the novel ""hybrid"" algorithm, and compare them with patients with de novo CTOs. METHODS We examined 521 consecutive patients who underwent CTO PCI at five high-volume PCI centers in the United States using the ""hybrid"" approach. Clinical, angiographic, and procedural outcomes were compared between CTOs due to ISR and de novo CTOs. RESULTS The target CTO was due to ISR in 57 of 521 patients (10.9%). Compared to patients with de novo CTOs, those with CTO due to ISR had higher frequency of diabetes (56.1% vs. 39.6%, P = 0.02) and less calcification (5.3% vs. 16.2%, P <0.001), but longer occlusion length [38 (29-55) vs. 30 (20-51), P = 0.04]. Technical success in the ISR and de novo group was 89.4% and 92.5% (P = 0.43), respectively; procedural success was 86.0% and 90.3% (P = 0.31), respectively; and the incidence of major adverse cardiac events was 3.5% and 2.2% (P = 0.63), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Use of the ""hybrid"" approach to CTO PCI was associated with similarly high procedural success and similarly low major complication rates in patients with de novo and ISR CTOs.","Christopoulos, Georgios; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Alaswad, Khaldoon; Lombardi, William L; Grantham, J Aaron; Rangan, Bavana V; Kotsia, Anna P; Lembo, Nicholas; Kandzari, David E; Lee, James; Kalynych, Anna; Carlson, Harold; Garcia, Santiago; Banerjee, Subhash; Thompson, Craig A; Brilakis, Emmanouil S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.25465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585508/,19

A search was performed on the reference list of included and excluded studies of one systematic review, on land-based exercises for knee osteoarthritis and, an updated search of The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL and PEDro was completed. Two authors independently selected the studies and a third author was consulted for an additional opinion. The inclusion criteria were male or female with tibiofemoral knee osteoarthritis, land-based exercises, non-exercise control group and randomized clinical trials. The exclusion criteria were mixed diagnosis or comparison to other types of exercise. The data were extracted by two authors. Fifty-five full-text articles were included. Strengthening, proprioception and aerobic exercises resulted in significant pain reduction. The intervention durations which were significant for pain reduction were either the period of 8-11 weeks or 12-15 weeks. The frequency of three times per week was found significant in comparison to a non-exercise control group. The results, which formed an evidence synthesis, demonstrate that there is substantial evidence regarding the benefits of strengthening exercises to reduce pain in knee osteoarthritis patients. Based on the included studies analysis, exercises should be performed three times weekly for a duration of 8-11 or 12-15 weeks. Health professionals working with knee osteoarthritis patients can use this evidence synthesis as a fast and pragmatic instrument to obtain information about several effective types of exercises for pain reduction.","Imoto, Aline Mizusaki; Pardo, Jordi Pardo; Brosseau, Lucie; Taki, Jade; Desjardins, Brigit; Thevenot, Odette; Franco, Eduardo; Peccin, Stella",Rheumatology international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-019-04289-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30915489/,19

Although the disease is characterized by low mortality and a relatively short and mild clinical period, the infection has the potential to alter the outcome of experiments substantially. For animal facilities, it is therefore essential to eradicate the virus. Here we report a successful sanitation of a rotavirus-infected mouse colony in an animal facility. Despite a high ratio of transgenic and partially immunodeficient strains, a permanent eradication of the virus was achieved by euthanasia of highly susceptible mice, a prolonged breeding cessation in areas containing immunocompromised mice and a strict hygienic management. The management of a rotavirus infection reported here is a feasible and inexpensive opportunity for sanitation that benefits from maintaining most of the animal population, even in today's mouse colonies comprising mainly transgenic mice with unknown or compromised immune status.","Held, N; Hedrich, H J; Bleich, A",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1258/la.2010.010150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21402733/,19

Aim: To provide the detailed chest HRCT findings along with clinical information in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Radiology SZPGMI, Lahore. Information on clinical data, chest radiography appearance and comorbidities were recorded ona designed proforma. HRCT chest findings were recorded in terms of pattern, distribution, laterality, and other findings. HRCT chest severity was calculated using a 25 point CT severity score. Kendall's Tau test applied to investigate the correlation between the severity of HRCT chest with clinical severity levels of COVID-19. Results: Fever (74%) was the most reported presenting symptom, followed by dry cough (70%). The majority of patients had abnormal chest X-ray (57%) as well as abnormal HRCT chest (90%). The majority of patients were in mild clinical scoring levels of disease (61%) and mild category (49%) of HRCT chest severity. In majority of the patients (46%), all five pulmonary lobes were involved, whereas the right lower lobe was most frequently affected.

165009,Anti-fibrotic activity of an antimicrobial peptide in a Drosophila model,2021-03-19,"Phylogenetics has played a pivotal role in the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, such as tracking the emergence and global spread of variants, and scientific communication. However, the rapid accumulation of genomic data from around the world — with over two million genomes currently available in the GISAID database — is testing the limits of standard phylogenetic methods. Here, we describe a new approach to rapidly analyze and visualize large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Using Python, genomes are filtered for problematic sites, incomplete coverage, and excessive divergence from a strict molecular clock. All differences from the reference genome, including indels, are extracted using minimap2, and compactly stored as a set of features for each genome. For each Pango lineage (https://cov-lineages.org), we collapse genomes with identical features into ‘variants’, generate 100 bootstrap samples of the feature set union to generate weights, and compute the symmetric differences between the weighted feature sets for every pair of variants. The resulting distance matrices are used to generate neigihbor-joining trees in RapidNJ and converted into a majority-rule consensus tree for the lineage.

Yet there is no effective approved treatment for the disease. In an effort of utilizing human ferritin as nanoplatform for drug delivery, we engineered a fusion protein by presenting receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 virus spike glycoprotein on the N-terminus of ferritin subunits. The designed fusion protein with a cage-like structure, similar to that of corona virus, is a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We hereby show the construction, preparation, and characterization of the fusion protein RBM-HFtn. Our initial affinity study confirmed its biological activity towards ACE2 receptor which suggests its mode of action against SARS-CoV-2 could be either through vaccine therapy or blocking the cellular entry of virus as antagonist of ACE2 receptor.","Yao, Dehui; Lao, Fang; Zhang, Zeyi; Liu, Yan; Cheng, Jianwei; Ding, Fengjiao; Wang, Xiaofei; Xi, Lun; Wang, Chuang; Yan, Xichong; Zhang, Rongkun; Ouyang, Fangxing; Ding, Hui; Ke, Tianyi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.25.115618,19

Nursing home residents required medicine reviews post-covid infection to optimise medicines and reduce pill burden. Method: The Care Home Nursing Support Team (CHNST), consultant pharmacist for older people and the lead care home pharmacist medicines optimisation older people (MOOP), rapidly established a multidisciplinary virtual round. Four main steps included: • establishing Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) • proforma template design • inclusion of resident • evaluation An SOP was established to ensure consistent pathway for nursing home inclusion criteria and team roles. The inclusion group included residents who were furthest from their baseline including weight loss, swallowing difficulties, decreased mobility, altered sitting balance and polypharmacy. The pharmacist developed a proforma template for completion by the nursing home staff to gather key information ahead of the round to improve efficiency eg swallow, renal function, pain, falls risk. The care home resident was included on video link by ipad following careful consent processes. Benefits included enhanced assessment of frailty, mobility, dexterity and adherence. Results: • 40% residents reviewed had increased Rockwood frailty score • 50% residents reviewed had weight loss post-covid- average 4.8 kg • Average 2.4 pharmacy medicines interventions per resident including: •Reducing doses & nephrotoxic medicines due to poor renal function •Deprescribing •Onward referral to psychiatry for signs of depression •Formulation changes due to swallowing difficulties •Evaluation from the multidisciplinary team and nursing home staff was overwhelmingly positive, emphasising the opportunity for shared learning Conclusion: The multidisciplinary care home rounds provided an efficient means to collaborate with other professionals, while providing holistic&patient-focussed care. Plans are underway for development of an NI MOOP care home pathway.","Crawford, P.; Kirkpatrick, F.; Galway, O.; Watson, K.",Age and Ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab116.23,19

Conventional machine learning methods either consider temporal dependencies only, or treat spatial and temporal relations as two separate autoregressive models, namely, space-time autoregressive models. Such methods suffer when it comes to long-term forecasting or predictions for large-scale areas, due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we propose to address these challenges using spatio-temporal graph neural networks.

The enterprises employ the customization production paradigm, where the products have similar functions and structures, and adapt to such environment. However, for this mode, the mechanism is lack of making a quotation rapidly due to the complex of product and changeable demands. Formulating the relationship between factors and quotation of an order becomes an issue concerned by academia and entrepreneurs. We present control metrics to connect with those factors and existing quotation of a product. Since a quotation of product needs a large number of parameters to represent, the control metrics can be alternative of those parameters of quotation. Then, we propose a model of quoting. The correlation between the control metrics and a quotation of product is explored. Finally, a reduction approach of crucial metrics is developed by rough set on incomplete data. The case study is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method of reduction. The outcomes show that the multiple reducts can be obtained to facilitate the enterprises to make viable quotation decision from the multiple schemes in terms of their characteristics and different demands of the customers.","Meng, Qiunan; Xu, Xun; Yang, Luwei",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314645; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314645,19

Our goal was to develop a robust and accessible assay technology that is suitable for high-throughput screening and applicable to a wide range of proteins acting as either hydrolysing or non-hydrolysing binders of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyl groups. As a foundation of our work, we developed a C-terminal protein fusion tag based on a Gi protein alpha subunit peptide (GAP), which allows for site-specific introduction of cysteine-linked mono- and poly-ADP-ribosyl groups as well as chemical ADP-ribosyl analogs. By fusion of the GAP-tag and ADP-ribosyl binders to fluorescent proteins, we were able to generate robust FRET signals and the interaction with 22 previously described ADP-ribosyl-binders was confirmed. To demonstrate the applicability of this binding assay for high-throughput screening, we utilized it to screen for inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 macrodomain and identified the drug suramin as a moderate yet unspecific inhibitor of this protein. To complement the binding technology, we prepared high-affinity ADP-ribosyl binders fused to a nanoluciferase, which enabled simple blot-based detection of mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins. These tools can be expressed recombinantly in E. coli using commonly available agents and will help to investigate ADP-ribosylation systems and aid in drug discovery.","Sowa, Sven T.; Galera-Prat, Albert; Wazir, Sarah; Alanen, Heli I.; Maksimainen, Mirko M.; Lehtiö, Lari",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.31.445082,19

Studies that have addressed these new forms of employment relationship and HRD during this pandemic are sparse. This paper aims to broaden the scope of HRD research by exploring the implications of these new forms of employment relationship for HRD in the time of COVID-19. It also provides insights for HRD professionals as well as governments into how to address this challenge. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a viewpoint that addresses the new workforce patterns generated by the COVID-19 pandemic and their implications for HRD at the organizational, individual and national levels. Findings COVID-19 sheds light on the importance of atypical workers who can create a competitive advantage for organizations, ensure their continuity and significantly benefit national and societal well-being in times of health crisis. However, these atypical workers are often overlooked when it comes to training and development. Whence the importance, for HRD professionals and governments, to address their situation and to integrate them into organizational and national HRD plans and programs, by going beyond traditional models of HRD which focus mainly on standard employees. Originality/value This paper examines a relatively unexplored topic. Besides examining the implications of the new forms of employment relationship, for HRD, it provides insights for HRD professionals and governments into how to address the challenges related to these new forms of employment relationship.","Hamouche, S.; Chabani, Z.",Industrial and Commercial Training,https://doi.org/10.1108/ict-11-2020-0112,19

The complexity of the CNS poses unique challenges to investigate the infection of these viruses in the brain using traditional techniques. In this study, we explore the use of fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the spatial and cellular distribution of a representative neurotropic virus, rabies virus (RABV), in the whole brain. Mice were inoculated with a lethal dose of recombinant RABV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under different infection routes, and a three-dimensional view of the distribution of RABV in the whole mouse brain was obtained using fMOST. Meanwhile, we pinpointed the cellular distribution of RABV by utilizing scRNA-seq. Our fMOST data provide the first evidence that RABV can infect multiple nuclei related to fear independent of different infection routes. More surprisingly, scRNA-seq data indicate that besides neurons RABV can infect macrophages and NK cells in vivo. Collectively, this study draws a comprehensively spatial and cellular map of RABV infection in the mouse brain, providing a novel and insightful strategy to investigate the pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses.","Zhang, Yachun; Xing, Xudong; Long, Ben; Cao, Yandi; Hu, Simeng; Li, Xiangning; Yu, Yalan; Tian, Dayong; Sui, Baokun; Luo, Zhaochen; Liu, Wei; Lv, Lei; Wu, Qiong; Dai, Jinxia; Zhou, Ming; Han, Heyou; Fu, Zhen F.; Gong, Hui; Bai, Fan; Zhao, Ling",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.436691,19

However, UPF face numerous threats from increasing urbanization and climate change. A comprehensive understanding of the flow of the forests' CES between urban and peri-urban areas was lacking. Further, there is little empirical evidence of how people valued and used UPF during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we assessed residents' perceptions of CES provided by UPF, and their spatial distribution in Karlsruhe and Rheinstetten, Germany, using a participatory map-based questionnaire survey. Respondents (n=501) were asked to indicate five preferred locations of UPF and to rate the individual UPFs’ importance concerning various CES. Heatmaps were created to visualize the results, and normalized ratings of the perceptions were examined. The study demonstrated that residents prefer nearby locations for all studied CES but place a higher value on peri-urban forests regardless of their frequency of use. The survey results show an increase in visits to UPFs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of urban forest for citizens’ stress reduction during the pandemic was highlighted by the participants.

While an unprecedented social safety net policy response successfully offset earnings losses among lower-wage workers, the risk of continued and persistent unemployment remains higher among the working class. The key lesson from the Great Recession is that strong economic growth and a hot labor market do more to improve the economic well-being of the working class and historically disadvantaged groups than a slow recovery that relies on safety net policies to help replace lost earnings. Thus, the best way to prevent a “k-shaped” recovery is to ensure that safety net policies do not interfere with a return to the strong pre-pandemic economy once the health risk subsides and that progrowth policies that incentivize business investment and hiring are maintained.","Burkhauser, Richard V.; Corinth, Kevin Holtz-Eakin Douglas",Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,https://doi.org/10.1177/00027162211031772,19

However, mounting evidence has unveiled the risk of aerosol transmission of the virus. Whereas caution has been taken to avoid this risk in association with clinical facilities, facilities such as spa pools and Jacuzzis, which are characterized by bubble-aerosol generation, high bather loads, and limited turnover rates, may promote aerosol transmission. Focusing on these non-clinical facilities in the built environment, a review study was undertaken. First, the typical water disinfection and ventilation-aided operations for the facilities were illustrated. Second, cross comparisons were made between the applicable standards and guidelines of the World Health Organization and countries including Australia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The similarities and differences in their water quality specifications, ventilation requirements, and air quality enhancement measures were identified;there were no specific regulations for preventing aerosol transmission at those aerosol-generating facilities. Third, a qualitative review of research publications revealed the emergence of studies on potential air-borne transmission of COVID-19, but research on built facilities posing high risks of aerosol transmission remains scant. This study’s results inform key directions for future research on abating aerosol transmission of COVID-19: the development of bespoke personal protective equipment and engineering and management controls on water quality, ventilation, and air quality.","Law, Roger C.

With a sample of 30,383 students from 62 countries, the study reveals that amid the worldwide lockdown and transition to online learning students were most satisfied with the support provided by teaching staff and their universities’ public relations. Still, deficient computer skills and the perception of a higher workload prevented them from perceiving their own improved performance in the new teaching environment. Students were mainly concerned about issues to do with their future professional career and studies, and experienced boredom, anxiety, and frustration. The pandemic has led to the adoption of particular hygienic behaviours (e.g., wearing masks, washing hands) and discouraged certain daily practices (e.g., leaving home, shaking hands). Students were also more satisfied with the role played by hospitals and universities during the epidemic compared to the governments and banks. The findings also show that students with certain socio-demographic characteristics (male, part-time, first-level, applied sciences, a lower living standard, from Africa or Asia) were significantly less satisfied with their academic work/life during the crisis, whereas female, full-time, first-level students and students faced with financial problems were generally affected more by the pandemic in terms of their emotional life and personal circumstances. Key factors influencing students’ satisfaction with the role of their university are also identified. Policymakers and higher education institutions around the world may benefit from these findings while formulating policy recommendations and strategies to support students during this and any future pandemics.","Keržič, Damijana Ravšelj Dejan Tomaževič Nina Umek Lan",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208438,19

The American Horse Council (2018) reported that 1,227,986 horses comprise the competition sector, with each horse owner showing 1.57 horses [5]. This participation generates $7.5B in expenses annually. The reduced attendance at in-person shows resulted in a decrease in annual expenditures, suggesting economic losses of $3.23 billion. The quantified direct effects were used in the IMPLAN input-output model to estimate the total economic impact. The reduced attendance resulted in a reduction of $7.2 billion, and a reduction of ∼50,000 jobs within the horse show industry. Additionally, the industry's contribution to GDP (value added) was reduced by $3.95 billion.

The current pandemic situation, caused by Covid19 has made us to realize the importance of automatic remotely operated independent services, such as cloud. However, the cloud servers are developed and maintained by third parties, and may access user's data for certain benefits. Considering these problems, we propose a specialized method such that the patient's rights and changes in medical treatment can be preserved. The problem arising due to Melanoma skin cancer is carefully considered and a privacy-preserving cloud-based approach is proposed to achieve effective skin lesion segmentation. The work is accomplished by the development of a Z-score-based local color correction method to differentiate image pixels from ambiguity, resulting the segmentation quality to be highly improved. On the other hand, the privacy is assured by partially order homomorphic Permutation Ordered Binary (POB) number system and image permutation.

We report here a multi-omics investigation of IFN signaling in hospitalized COVID19 patients, defining the biosignatures associated with varying levels of 12 different IFN ligands. Previously we showed that seroconversion associates with decreased production of select IFN ligands (Galbraith et al, 2021). We show now that the antiviral transcriptional response in circulating immune cells is strongly associated with a specific subset of ligands, most prominently IFNA2 and IFNG. In contrast, proteomics signatures indicative of endothelial damage associate with levels of IFNB and IFNA6. Differential IFN ligand production is linked to distinct constellations of circulating immune cells. Lastly, IFN ligands associate differentially with activation of the kynurenine pathway, dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and altered central carbon metabolism. Altogether, these results reveal specialized IFN ligand action in COVID19, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","Galbraith, M. D.; Kinning, K. T.; Sullivan, K.

This was likely due to the heavy aggregation of Atezolizumab, caused by mutation of N297A for removing unwanted antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) of IgG1 antibody drug. Here, we developed a new version of Atezolizumab (Maxatezo), which was demonstrated better anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. In Atezolizumab, we mutated 297A to 297N back to bring back the glycosylation, and inserted a short sequence GGGS between G237 and G238 in the hinge region of the IgG1 heavy chain. Our data shown that insertion of GGGS, without altering the anti-PD-L1 antibody affinity and inhibitory activity, completely abolished the ADCC activity, as same as Atezolizumab. Moreover, the insertion of GGGS, without altering the glycosylation profile of IgG1, increased the yields of anti-PD-L1 antibody considerately. Additionally, glycosylation improved the stability yet reduced the amounts of aggregations in the antibody solutions. In turn, the level of ADA in animals treated with Maxatezo was 70% lower than the ones treated with Atezolizumab.

This enabled our discovery and capacity to reliably identify non-reproducible Ab-Ag interactions (NRI), as well as our development of a powerful explanatory model (“0-RI-NRI-Hook four-state model”) that is [mAb]-dependent, regardless of specificity, which ultimately shows that both NSI and NRI are not predictable yet certain-to-happen.

Beyond challenging the centrality of Ab-Ag interaction specificity data in serology and immunology, our discoveries also facilitated the rapid development of a serological test with uniquely informative COVID-19 diagnosis performance.","Pan, Jiaojiao; Yang, Lan; Deng, Yi; Sun, Baoqing; Zhang, Li; Wu, Wenya; Li, Jingzhi; Cheng, Hu; Li, Yiting; Xu, Wenwen; Yang, Jiao; Sun, Yiyue; Fei, Hao; Xue, Qinghong; Zhou, Youxin; Wang, Hui; Zheng, Peiyan; Chen, Hao; Zhu, Fengcai; Peng, Daxin; Gu, Dayong; Han, Jun; Qiu, Jiwan; Ma, Hongwei",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.453011,19
184638,Membrane fusion.,2000,"The current pandemic situation leads researchers to reflect on conducting qualitative research, completely changing how they conduct participatory research. As it became clear that the pandemic would last many months, researchers started to redesign their planned research in digital spaces through social media channels and participatory online tools. From communicating with participants over Zoom (or other similar applications) to sharing information on exclusive online groups, digital platforms have become, for many, the only way to work, learn, or be entertained. This situation offered a significant opportunity to think creatively about research engagement and reflect on which aspects truly require researchers to be “on the ground” to conduct face-to-face participatory sessions to gather qualitative data. Qualitative researchers must use this opportunity to reflect while using digital tools for distance research. This paper is inspired by the work the authors are conducting in MEMEX – a European-funded project promoting social inclusion by developing collaborative storytelling tools related to cultural heritage and at the same time facilitating encounters and interactions between communities at risk of social exclusion. Thus, the work here presented reflects on the digital tools and techniques to collect qualitative data when the researchers cannot meet the participants face-to-face due to pandemics safety measures or other restrictions. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Cesário, V.; Nisi, V.","18th IFIP TC 13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, INTERACT 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85607-6_41,19
184689,Enteric infections with coronaviruses and toroviruses.,2001,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the accuracy of combined models with the individual models in terms of forecasting Euro against US dollar during COVID-19 era. During COVID, the euro shows sharp fluctuation in upward and downward trend;therefore, this study is keen to find out the best-fitted model which forecasts more accurately during the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The descriptive design has been adopted in this research. The three univariate models, i.e. autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA), Naïve, exponential smoothing (ES) model, and one multivariate model, i.e. nonlinear autoregressive distributive lags (NARDL), are selected to forecast the exchange rate of Euro against the US dollar during the COVID. The above models are combined via equal weights and var-cor methods to find out the accuracy of forecasting as Poon and Granger (2003) showed that combined models can forecast better than individual models. Findings: NARDL outperforms all remaining individual models, i.e. ARIMA, Naïve and ES. By applying a combination of different models via different techniques, the combination of NARDL and Naïve models outperforms all combination of models by scoring the least mean absolute percentage error value, i.e. 1.588. The combined forecasting of NARDL and Naïve techniques under var-cor method also outperforms the forecasting accuracy of individual models other than NARDL. It means the euro exchange rate against the US dollar which is dependent upon the macroeconomic fundamentals and recent observations of the time series. Practical implications: The findings could help the FOREX market, hedgers, traders, businessmen, policymakers, economists, financial managers, etc., to minimize the risk indulged in global trade. It also helps to produce more accurate results in different financial models, i.e. capital asset pricing model and arbitrage pricing theory, because their findings may not be useful if exchange rate fluctuations do not trace effectively. Originality/value: The NARDL models have been applied previously in different time series and only limited to the asymmetric or symmetric relationships. This study is using it for the forecasting exchange rate which is almost abandoned in earlier literature. Furthermore, this study combined the NARDL with univariate models to produce the accuracy which itself is a novelty. Moreover, the findings help to enhance the effectiveness of different financial theories as well. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AsadUllah, M.; Bashir, M. A.; Aleemi, A.

This has frequently been conducted on Twitter data in particular. Using data mining techniques, opinion mining, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge management, the underlying public mood states and sentiment can be uncovered. As cryptocurrencies play an increasingly significant role in global economies, there is an evident relationship between Twitter sentiment and future price fluctuations in Bitcoin. This paper assesses Tweets' collection, manipulation, and interpretation to predict early market movements of cryptocurrency. More specifically, sentiment analysis and text mining methods, including Logistic Regressions, Binary Classified Vector Prediction, Support Vector Mechanism, and Naive Bayes, were considered. Each model was evaluated on their ability to predict public mood states as measured by 'tweets' from Twitter during the era of covid-19.

Nucleocapsids of SARS-CoV-2 and the related viruses were studied for gene and amino acid sequence homologies. In this study, we established similarities and differences in nucleocapsids in SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome – coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1), bat coronavirus (bat-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome - coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We conducted a detailed analysis of the nucleocapsid protein amino acid and gene sequence encoding it, found in various coronavirus strains. After thoroughly screening the different nucleocapsids, we observed a close molecular homology between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. More than 95% sequence similarity was observed between the two SARS-CoV strains. Bat-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 showed 92% sequence similarity. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid analysis indicated only 65% identity. Molecular characterization of nucleocapsids from various coronaviruses revealed that SARS-CoV 2 is more related to SARS-CoV 1 and bat-CoV. SARS-CoV 2 exhibited less resemblance with MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV 2 showed less similarity to MERS-CoV. Thus, either SARS-CoV-1 or bat-CoV may be the source of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Moreover, the existing differences in nucleocapsid molecular structures in SARS-CoV-2 make this virus more virulent and highly infectious, which means that the non-identical SARS-CoV-2 genes (which are absent in SARS-CoV-1 and bat-CoV) are responsible for COVID-19 severity. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid from different locations varied in amino acid sequences. This revealed that there are many SARS-CoV-2 subtypes/subsets currently circulating globally. This study will help to develop antiviral vaccine and drugs, study viral replication and immunopathogenesis, and synthesize monoclonal antibodies that can be used for precise COVID-19 diagnosis, without false-positive/false-negative results.","Kannan, Shantani; Subbaram, Kannan; Ali, Sheeza; Kannan, Hemalatha",J.

We designed a research with the objective of finding the frequency of respiratory viruses, particularly WU and KI polyomaviruses (WUPyV & KIPyV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human parechovirus (HPeV) in hospitalized children who were influenza negative. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Throat swabs were collected from children younger than 5 years who have been hospitalized for SARI and screened for WUPyV, KIPyV, HCoVs, HRSV and HPeV using Real time PCR. RESULTS: A viral pathogen was identified in 23 (11.16%) of 206 hospitalized children with SARI. The rate of virus detection was considerably greater in infants <12 months (78.2%) than in older children (21.8%). The most frequently detected viruses were HCoVs with 7.76% of positive cases followed by KIPyV (2%) and WUPyV (1.5%). No HPeV and HRSV were detected in this study. CONCLUSION: This research shown respiratory viruses as causes of childhood acute respiratory infections, while as most of mentioned viruses usually causes mild respiratory diseases, their frequency might be higher in outpatient children. Meanwhile as HRSV is really sensitive to inactivation due to environmental situations and its genome maybe degraded, then for future studies, we need to use fresh samples for HRSV detection. These findings addressed a need for more studies on viral respiratory tract infections to help public health.","Aghamirmohammadali, Fahimeh Sadat; Sadeghi, Kaveh; Shafiei-Jandaghi, Nazanin Zahra; Khoban, Zahra; Mokhtari-Azad, Talat; Yavarian, Jila",Iran J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7244825/,19
186675,A long-term study on the prevalence of shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) on four German cattle farms.,2002,"Symptomatic early neurosyphilis is a rare manifestation of syphilis that usually occurs within the first 12 months of infection. Most neurologic symptoms of early neurosyphilis result from acute or subacute meningitis, abnormalities in cranial nerve function, and inflammatory vasculitis leading to a cerebrovascular accident. Symptomatic early neurosyphilis essentially disappeared in the United States after the introduction of penicillin treatment for syphilis in the late 1940s but reappeared in the 1980s among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The disease burden from neurosyphilis is unknown because national reporting of this disease is incomplete. Because the increase in syphilis cases during the past 5 years has occurred primarily among MSM, many of whom were infected with HIV, CDC conducted a review of possible neurosyphilis cases to describe the clinical course of symptomatic early neurosyphilis and to better characterize the risk for this illness among HIV-infected MSM. The review included health department records from four U.S. cities (Los Angeles, California; San Diego, California; Chicago, Illinois; and New York, New York) for the period January 2002-June 2004. This report describes the results of that review, which identified 49 HIV-positive MSM with symptomatic early neurosyphilis during that 30-month period. Among HIV-positive MSM with early syphilis, the estimated risk for having symptomatic early neurosyphilis was 1.7%, and the risk for having early neurosyphilis with persistent symptoms 6 months after treatment was 0.5%. These findings emphasize the importance of preventing syphilis in HIV-infected persons. HIV-infected persons with cranial nerve dysfunction or other unexplained neurologic symptoms should be evaluated for early neurosyphilis.",,MMWR.

METHODS A total of 104 consecution radiofrequency ablations of either the liver (n = 68) or the kidney (n = 36) were evaluated for hemorrhagic complications by color Doppler sonography. All radiofrequency ablations were performed in a similar fashion, including track coagulation during electrode removal. Follow-up computed tomography of the organ of interest was performed within 24-hours after the procedure. RESULTS The study included 32 patients with 36 renal radiofrequency ablations and 43 patients with 68 hepatic ablations. There were 1 arterial and 0 venous Doppler signals in the renal ablations and 2 arterial and 2 venous Doppler signals in the hepatic ablations. No major complications were observed, but a moderate hematoma occurred in 1 renal ablation. A statistically significant correlation was noted between the computed tomographic findings of hematomas and the presence of a color line sign (P = .048). We found a lower percentage of the color line sign compared to prior reports that identified this sign after biopsy of the liver or kidney. CONCLUSIONS There is a decreased frequency of the color line sign and hemorrhagic complications after radiofrequency ablation compared to their rates of occurrence with core biopsy. Identification of the color line sign may be useful for predicting hemorrhagic complications.","McGahan, John P; Wright, Luke; Brock, John",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22039021/,19

Much remains unknown about 2019-nCoV, especially the additional risks that 2019-nCoV infection may pose for colon cancer patients. Many reports show that angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the cell receptor through which 2019-nCoV enters host cells, and this is similar to the cell entry mechanism of SARS coronavirus. Previous studies show that ACE2 is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon. In patients with colon cancer, ACE2 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to tissues from patients with other types of cancer. One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the serine protease (TMPRSS2) and AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1), which also facilitates the passage of viruses into cells. Furthermore, the Database of Gene expression profiling interactive analysis suggests that expression levels for ACE2, TMPRSS2, and AAK1 are positively correlated in colon cells. Therefore, our findings predict that 2019-nCoV will create increased complications for patients with colon cancer.","Chen, Yongyi; Gong, Wangang; Wei, Haibin; Dai, Wumin; Xu, Songxiao",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042335/,19

Therefore, we decided early in the pandemic to suspend all elective cases of cardiac surgery and closed the ambulatory clinic. The effect of this strategy on the mental well-being of the non-COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess whether planned or operated patients suffered from either anxiety or depression by their altered medical care trajectory and if their score influenced decision-making. The findings intend to anticipate individual needs during subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: The patient population consisted of two groups. The first group included planned patients whose operation date was delayed; in the second group, the postoperative control visit was postponed. Both groups received a twofold questionnaire. Part one was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, part two a series of questions on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgical care from a patient's perspective.Results: The study population was composed of 46 patients (63% men). Most of them (82,6%) would like the surgery to be performed as fast as possible, even before the end of the first wave of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Of all patients 30,4% have avoided to consult a physician because of fear and 34,8% consulted a physician by phone call. When they physically consulted a physician, there was a prominent role for the general practitioner (41,3% went to the GP vs 19,6% to the specialist). Most (58,7%) of the patients would have liked a (tele)consultation with the cardiac surgeon.Conclusions: Regardless of the HADS, one can state that a closer follow-up using telemedicine during the pandemic is expected by all patients. All patients prefer their surgery to take place even during a pandemic.","Welch, Ashley; Nijs, Jan; Van Loo, Ines; Mallefroy, Marina; La Meir, Mark",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075844/,19

METHODS Surveys were mailed to all physicians in the three-hospital Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) System (2,174) from January to March 2004; there were 820 respondents for a 37.7% response rate. RESULTS A total of 71% of physicians indicated that they were ""not confident"" that they could recognize five of the infectious agents named; they had higher confidence rates for smallpox (48.8%). Infectious diseases and emergency medicine physicians had the highest rates of confidence. Seventy-eight percent of physicians indicated conferences and lectures as their preferred CME learning modality. Nearly 72% of physicians reported a low familiarity with the DPH reporting requirements. DISCUSSION The results highlighted the breadth of perceived weaknesses among clinicians from disease recognition to reporting incidents, which signifies the need for greater training in these areas. As clinicians themselves emphasized their lack of skills and knowledge in this area, there should be a rapid development and dissemination of problem-based learning CME courses in bioterrorism preparedness.","Hartwig, Kari A; Burich, David; Cannon, Christopher; Massari, Louis; Mueller, Lloyd; Dembry, Louise-Marie",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19557957/,19

To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the kinetics of RNA binding between nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated infectious bronchitis virus N protein with nonviral and viral RNA by surface plasmon resonance (Biacore). Mass spectroscopic analysis of N protein identified phosphorylation sites that were proximal to RNA binding domains. Kinetic analysis, by surface plasmon resonance, indicated that nonphosphorylated N protein bound with the same affinity to viral RNA as phosphorylated N protein. However, phosphorylated N protein bound to viral RNA with a higher binding affinity than nonviral RNA, suggesting that phosphorylation of N protein determined the recognition of virus RNA. The data also indicated that a known N protein binding site (involved in transcriptional regulation) consisting of a conserved core sequence present near the 5' end of the genome (in the leader sequence) functioned by promoting high association rates of N protein binding. Further analysis of the leader sequence indicated that the core element was not the only binding site for N protein and that other regions functioned to promote high-affinity binding.","Chen, Hongying; Gill, Andrew; Dove, Brian K; Emmett, Stevan R; Kemp, C Fred; Ritchie, Mark A; Dee, Michael; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15613344/,19

So far, CT has emerged as main stay of imaging whereas the local data on radiographic features of COVID-19 is sparse. METHODS Prospective study includes 402 chest X rays (CXRs) of 105 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. The nature of abnormality, distribution and lung zone involvement was documented. Following British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidelines, CXRs were grouped into classic/ probable COVID-19, indeterminate, non-COVID-19 and normal categories. The lung involvement was scored according to modified Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring. The follow up radiographs were assessed for disease progression and improvement. RESULTS Seventy-six males and 29 females with mean age of 50 years were included in our study. 47 out of 105 baseline radiographs were categorized as classic/ probable COVID-19, 26 as indeterminate, 7 as Non-COVID-19 and 25 as normal. 75 patients were positive and 30 were negative on RT-PCR testing. The sensitivity of CXR in diagnosing COVID-19 is 84%. The worsening radiographic features and higher RALE score correlates with longer hospital stay, ICU admissions and mortality. The ground glass opacities and consolidations in peripheral distribution involving bilateral mid and lower zones are the predominant findings of COVID-19 in Pakistani population. CONCLUSIONS Combination of bilateral peripheral ground glass opacities and consolidations are the cardinal feature of COVID-19 on CXRs. The diagnostic categories described by BSTI correlates with PCR results in Pakistani population. The worsening radiographic findings correspond to poor prognosis; hence serial radiographs can be used for assessing disease course.","Majeed, Ayesha Isani; Raza, Farheen; Riaz, Syeda Kiran; Kanwal, Jaweria","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137543/,19

METHODS This is a retrospective endovascular database review of a single-operator experience over a 9-year period for patients with (1) complete BAO, (2) extensive bilateral pontine DWI changes and (3) 90-day modified Rankin scale 0-2. RESULTS Three out of a total of 40 patients met the inclusion criteria. Case 1 was an 18-year-old male with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 32 on admission, treated 25 h after symptom onset. Case 2 was a 56-year-old male with NIHSS 19, treated 10 h after onset. Case 3 was a 73-year-old male with NIHSS 29, treated 6 h after onset. Full endovascular reperfusion was achieved in all 3 patients. A literature review identified 9 additional cases of extensive pontine DWI changes and good outcome. These patients were young (32 ± 22 years), mostly males (69%), presented with a relatively low posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (6 ± 1), were treated relatively late from last known normal (13 ± 10 h) and were mostly (84%) treated with endovascular intervention.

The pandemic, started at the end of 2019 and spread in Europe and all over the world at the beginning of the 2020, is the biggest threat to the health and to the economy of all countries, since the time of Spanish Flu. A global effort is being made to counter the virus with social distancing and restrictions, but our habits and behavior have dramatically been modified. Hospital activity has changed, and Plastic Surgery is affected as well as other disciplines. MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS Our work describes the impact of the pandemic on a Plastic Surgery Unit in a tertiary care hospital and estimates the possible consequences in the near future. Elective procedures and consultations have been postposed and rescheduled, but we ensured treatment for life-threatening conditions and offered the best therapy, complying with the new safety standard to protect the patients and the healthcare providers. Media helped in keeping in touch the people, ensuring continuity in education and circulation of the data about SARS-CoV-2 research. CONCLUSION We don't know yet what the overall cost of the crisis will be on the global economy and on the National Health Systems. Definitely, it will be a big challenge to face, both for the Governments, for the people, as for healthcare providers.

In this study, the S glycoprotein genes were recovered from naturally infected civets in central China (Hubei province), extending the geographic distribution of civet-CoV beyond the southeastern province of Guangdong. Moreover, pseudoviruses generated in our laboratory with four civet S genes, each with a distinct RBD, infected cells expressing human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, but with 90 to 95% less efficiency compared to that of SARS-CoV. These four civet S genes were also constructed as DNA vaccines to immunize mice. Immunized sera elicited against most civet S glycoproteins displayed potent neutralizing activities against autologous viruses but were much less efficient (50% inhibitory concentration, 20- to 40-fold) at neutralizing SARS-CoV and vice versa. Convalescence-phase sera from humans were similarly ineffective against the dominant civet pseudovirus. Our findings suggest that the design of SARS vaccine should consider not only preventing the reemergence of SARS-CoV but also providing cross-protection, thus interrupting zoonotic transmission of a group of genetically divergent civet CoVs of broad geographic origin.","Liu, Li; Fang, Qing; Deng, Fei; Wang, Hanzhong; Yi, Christopher E; Ba, Lei; Yu, Wenjie; Lin, Richard D; Li, Taisheng; Hu, Zhihong; Ho, David D; Zhang, Linqi; Chen, Zhiwei",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314167/,19
190703,Proinflammatory cytokines and viral respiratory disease in pigs.,2000,"A 2-phase study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the NEB-1 strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) to potentiate common bacterial pathogens of swine. In phase I, 25 of 50 4-5-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were exposed to NEB-1 PRRSV (day 0). Seven days after virus inoculation, 8 groups received 1 of 4 bacterial pathogens: Haemophilus parasuis, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella cholerasuis, and Pasteurella multocida. The ability of NEB-1 PRRSV to produce clinical disease, viremia, neutralizing antibody, gross and microscopic lesions and to potentiate bacterial pathogens was assessed. Response to NEB-1 PRRSV was similar among inoculated pigs; prolonged hyperthermia, lethargy, mild to moderate dyspnea, and cutaneous erythema were consistent clinical signs. No clinical differences were observed in groups after bacterial challenge. Virus was isolated from serum at weekly intervals through the end of the study, and all PRRSV-inoculated pigs had seroconverted by study termination. Two of 5 pigs died in non-PRRSV-inoculated groups challenged with H. parasuis and Streptococcus suis. Mortality in PRRSV-infected pigs was limited to 1 of 5 pigs from the Salmonella cholerasuis-challenged group. Gross lesions were seen in pigs dying after inoculation in H. parasuis- and Streptococcus suis-inoculated groups, in Salmonella cholerasuis- and P. multocida-challenged pigs, and in 1 non-PRRSV-inoculated control pig. Microscopic lesions consisted of mild to moderate proliferative interstitial pneumonia, nonsuppurative myocarditis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and nonsuppurative encephalitis in PRRSV-inoculated pigs. Findings in phase I indicated that NEB-1 PRRSV does not potentiate bacterial disease while inducing consistent clinical signs, viremia, seroconversion, and microscopic lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Cooper, V L; Doster, A R; Hesse, R A; Harris, N B","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7578444/,19
190836,Nonsegmented negative-strand viruses as vaccine vectors.,2006,"The inflammatory response and the intracellular signaling pathway induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) were studied in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts. SARS-CoV spike (S) protein-encoding plasmid induced activations of IL-8 promoter and AP-1, but not NF-kappaB in these cells. Mutation of the AP-1, not the kappaB site, abolished the SARS-CoV S protein-induced IL-8 promoter activity. IL-8 release was effectively induced by vAtEpGS688, a baculovirus exhibiting the aa 17-688 fragment of S protein, and this induction was attenuated by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 Ab. Recombinant baculovirus expressing different deletion and insertion fragments identified the functional region of S protein from aa 324-688 (particularly the N-terminal aa 324-488 and the C-terminal aa 609-688), which is responsible for IL-8 production. Activations of AP-1 DNA-protein binding and MAPKs after vAtEpGS688 transduction were demonstrated, and SARS-CoV S protein-induced IL-8 promoter activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitors of MAPK cascades. These results suggested that the S protein of SARS-CoV could induce release of IL-8 in the lung cells via activations of MAPKs and AP-1. The identification of the functional domain for IL-8 release will provide for the drug design on targeting specific sequence domains of S protein responsible for initiating the inflammatory response.","Chang, Ya-Jen; Liu, Catherine Y-Y; Chiang, Bor-Luen; Chao, Yu-Chan; Chen, Ching-Chow",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15585888/,19

Health care staff has been advised to change working routines to keep themselves and their patients safe. Radionuclide therapy has had an increasing role in clinical practice. Most therapeutic radionuclide procedures have applications in oncology. Cancer patients are an especially fragile and vulnerable population with higher risk due to co morbidities and immunosuppression. COVID-19 is another risk that must be considered in treatment planning. Therapeutic, prophylactic, and supportive interventions may require changes for these patients. The most common radionuclide therapies involve patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who need radioiodine therapy (RAI), patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) who need peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who need therapy with radiolabelled microspheres, and patients with prostate cancer and bone metastasis who need radionuclide palliative therapy. If infected, cancer patients could be at a higher risk for serious COVID-19 disease. Treatment decisions for thyroid cancer and NETs are challenging in this environment. Any decision to postpone therapy must be carefully considered, balancing risks and benefits. A risk of worsened prognosis due to delayed or suboptimal cancer treatment must be weighed against the risk of severe COVID-19 illness.","Koukouraki, S; Kapsoritakis, N; Bourogianni, O",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862212/,19

Challenge with a 10(2) 50% cell culture infectious doses of YFV resulted in a 50-80% mortality rate in female hamsters. Virus was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) in liver, kidney, spleen and serum with peak titers on 4-6 days post-viral challenge (dpi). Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, potassium and creatinine were significantly elevated, while serum levels of albumin, amylase, glucose, calcium, globulin, phosphorus, sodium and total protein were significantly reduced. Packed cell volume and white blood cell count were significantly elevated during the course of the infection. Intraperitoneal treatment of hamsters with 0.5-5 microg/kg/day interferon (IFN) alfacon-1, 100mg/kg/day viramidine or 50 mg/kg/day ribavirin, initiated 4h prior to YFV challenge, resulted in significant improvement in survival and serum ALT levels. Treatment with IFN alfacon-1 or ribavirin starting 2dpi, also significantly improved survival and serum ALT levels in hamsters challenged with YFV. Pre- and post-virus exposure treatment with IFN alfacon-1 was efficacious in improving disease in YFV-infected hamsters.","Julander, Justin G; Morrey, John D; Blatt, Lawrence M; Shafer, Kristiina; Sidwell, Robert W",Antiviral research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17049380/,19

Now that the SARS outbreak is under control, hospitals struggle with the balance between adhering to patient- and family-centred care models, and addressing the future threat of infectious diseases. To evaluate the effect of visitor restrictions and to guide future visitation policies, the Ottawa Hospital conducted a preliminary survey of patients, next of kin, staff, physicians and volunteers. Ninety percent of staff surveyed supported some form of visitor restrictions, while 71% indicated that they felt comfortable asking visitors to leave if they had exceeded current restrictions. The majority of patients (80%) and next of kin (76%) were at least moderately satisfied with current restricted limiting hours. A disproportionate number of positive comments on current visiting restrictions were received from both patients and staff. In the absence of evidence on which to base future visitor policy development, objective input from healthcare workers, patients and families is invaluable.","Quinlan, Bonnie; Loughrey, Sue; Nicklin, Wendy; Roth, Virginia R",Hospital quarterly,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14674175/,19

This study revealed that mRT-PCR had almost exactly the same performance or results were almost 100% in agreement with that of RT-PCR and RAT both in terms of the assay sensitivity and specificity which was more highly evident in detecting CIV, CDV and CRCoV antigens present in canine nasal swab samples.

A total of 639 serum samples collected in the context of different studies from naturally infected cats were tested. The current study revealed that, with an apparent prevalence of 83%, FCoV serotype 1 is the most prevalent serotype in Switzerland. FCoV type 1 viruses induced higher antibody titers than FCoV type 2, and were more frequently associated with clinical signs and/or feline infectious peritonitis. The antibody development in seven cats experimentally infected with FCoV type 1 revealed that, with progressing duration of infection, antibodies to FCoV type 1 significantly increased over those to FCoV type 2. There was a significant relationship between antibody titers against TGEV, FCoV 1, and FCoV 2 and TGEV antigen detected the highest proportion of seropositive cats. We conclude that a vaccine against FCoV should be based on FCoV type 1-related antigens and that for serodiagnosis of FCoV infection TGEV should be used to attain the highest diagnostic efficiency. When serology is used in addition to clinical signs, hematology, and clinical chemistry results as an aid to diagnose clinical FIP, TGEV shows a diagnostic efficiency equal to that of a FCoV antigen.","Kummrow, Maya; Meli, Marina L; Haessig, Michael; Goenczi, Enikoe; Poland, Amy; Pedersen, Niels C; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16210485/,19

AIM To poll what they think of remote care among 605 care providers of Arkin. METHOD We surveyed 605 professionals on their experiences. RESULTS Enthusiasm for remote care was found predominantly among psychologists who worked in curative care. They reported practical benefits for the patient and for the process of care provision. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists who provided care to patients with complex and/or chronic problems. They feared a deterioration in quality of care and a decline in their job satisfaction. Nurses were also critical, especially those who provided FACT and outreaching care. Their patients often lacked the resources or skills required to access digital care. CONCLUSION This assessment of remote care was likely adversely affected by the corona measures. Employees were suddenly forced to alter their usual work habits and had not been optimally trained in the new method were more critical. Moreover, they were forced to work from home and lacked informal professional contact with colleagues. Nevertheless, professionals have a nuanced and predominantly positive opinion of video calling: it is not suitable for everyone or appropriate under all circumstances, but remote care is seen as a useful addition to the existing arsenal of treatment modalities.","de Beurs, E; Blankers, M; Goudriaan, A E; de Koning, M; Dekker, J J M",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913137/,19

As part of a general health assessment of multiple anthropogenic source emissions conducted by the National Environmental Respiratory Center, a series of health assays was conducted on rodents exposed to environmentally relevant levels of hardwood smoke. This article summarizes the study design and exposures, and reports findings on general indicators of toxicity, bacterial clearance, cardiac function, and carcinogenic potential. Hardwood smoke was generated from an uncertified wood stove, burning wood of mixed oak species. Animals were exposed to clean air (control) or dilutions of whole emissions based on particulate (30, 100, 300, and 1000 micromg/m3). F344 rats, SHR rats, strain A/J mice, and C57BL/6 mice were exposed by whole-body inhalation 6 h/day, 7 days/wk, for either 1 wk or 6 mo. Effects of exposure on general indicators of toxicity, bacterial clearance, cardiac function, and carcinogenic potential were mild. Exposure-related effects included increases in platelets and decreases in blood urea nitrogen and serum alanine aminotransferase. Several other responses met screening criteria for significant exposure effects but were not consistent between genders or exposure times and were not corroborated by related parameters. Pulmonary histopathology revealed very little accumulation of hardwood smoke particulate matter. Parallel studies demonstrated mild exposure effects on bronchoalveolar lavage parameters and in a mouse model of asthma. In summary, the results reported here show few and only modest health hazards from short-term to subchronic exposures to realistic concentrations of hardwood smoke.","Reed, M D; Campen, M J; Gigliotti, A P; Harrod, K S; McDonald, J D; Seagrave, J C; Mauderly, J L; Seilkop, S K",Inhalation toxicology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16717024/,19

One pillar of Decision 2119/98/EC is the early warning and response system (EWRS). The main objective of the network is to establish permanent communication between European Union (EU) Member States' public health authorities, which are responsible for determining the measures required to control communicable disease-related events. Since 1998, a web based informatics tool has been developed in order to allow information to be shared between the relevant public health authorities. Between 1998 and December 2005, a total of 583 messages were circulated through the EWRS, notifying 396 events. The information shared through the system helped to coordinate public health measures in the EU. However, only few events prompted specific measures at Community level and most of them were controlled with public health measures applied at national level. Major events (such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the results of simulation exercises prompted the Commission to upgrade the informatics system on the basis of user needs. Since 1 May 2004 the 10 newest Member States have provided information under the current legislation and since April 2005 the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is part of the system.

Variables recorded were age, sex, staff position, work area, and reason for contact. We used the χ2 test to compare ED workers to workers in other areas of the health care system. RESULTS Of the 3900 health care workers (279 in the ED), 1744 cases (92 in the ED) were included for analysis. A total of 736 workers (52 in the ED) had symptoms, and 151 had positive test results (9 from the ED). Two of the infections in the ED workers (22.2%) were attributed to patient contact and 7 (77.8%) to nonwork-related contact either in the workplace or in the community. The prevalence of COVID-19 among ED workers was 3.2% (9/279). The prevalence among other health system workers was 3.9% (142/3621).

Decision-making was complicated when the findings made their way into the media. The normal trajectory of non-urgent research includes peer-review publication after which decision-makers can process the information taking into account other evidence and logistic considerations. In the situation that arose, however, the congruence of an unexpected finding and the simultaneous review of the evidence both within and outside the traditional peer-review sphere raised several interesting issues about how to deal with emerging evidence during a public health emergency. These events are used in this article to aid discussion of the complex interrelationship between researchers, public health decision-makers and scientific journals, the trade-offs between sharing information early and maintaining the peer-review quality assurance process, and to emphasise the need for critical reflection on the practical and ethical norms that govern the way in which research is evaluated, published and communicated in public health emergencies.","Crowcroft, N S; Rosella, L C; Pakes, B N",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970372/,19

Immune stainings of virus-infected cells by using FCoV type-specific monoclonal antibodies indicated that their antigenic specificity was serotype II. However, antigenic variations among these serotype II FCoVs were detected by neutralization assay with hyperimmune antisera against FCoVs and canine coronaviruses, and with experimentally infected cat sera; there were two subtypes in serotype II FCoVs. The isolates efficiently grew in fcwf-4 cell culture showing lytic CPE enough to form distinct plaques: when measured 48 hr after infection, plaque sizes of both M91-266 and M91-267 were approximately 1 mm in diameter, and a mixture of small (less than 1 mm in diameter) and large (approximately 3 mm in diameter) plaques were produced in the case of KUK-H. Strains KUK-H, M91-266 and M91-267 produced feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in 50%, 67% and 89% of experimentally inoculated kittens, respectively. Furthermore, 80% of the kittens inoculated with the small plaque former of KUK-H developed FIP accompanied by more prominent clinical signs as well as pathological changes when compared with 28.6% of kittens inoculated with the large plaque former.

In this study, we demonstrated that one of the MHV strains, MHV-S, did not synthesize mRNA 4 and made a smaller mRNA 5. Sequence analysis showed that the transcription initiation site for gene 4 of MHV-S was mutated from the consensus UCUAAAC to UUUAAAC, consistent with the idea that mutations in this region abolish mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, within gene 5 there were deletions totaling 307 nucleotides which deleted almost all of open reading frame 5a, but preserved open reading frame 5b of gene 5. Comparison of the growth of MHV-S with other MHV strains in DBT cells revealed no significant growth defect in MHV-S.

METHODS Acute chemical incidents were actively identified through several informal (e.g. Internet-based resources) and formal (e.g. various networks of organizations) sources and assessed against criteria for public health emergencies of international concern using the then proposed revised International Health Regulations (IHR). WHO regional and country offices were contacted to obtain additional information regarding identified incidents. FINDINGS Altogether, 35 chemical incidents from 26 countries met one or more of the IHR criteria. The WHO European Region accounted for 43% (15/35) of reports. The WHO Regions for Africa, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific each accounted for 14% (5/35); South-East Asia and the Americas accounted for 9% (3/35) and 6% (2/35), respectively. Twenty-three (66%) events were identified within 24 hours of their occurrence. CONCLUSION To our knowledge this is the first global surveillance system for chemical incidents of potential international concern. Limitations such as geographical and language bias associated with the current system are being addressed. Nevertheless, the system has shown that it can provide early detection of important events, as well as information on the magnitude and geographical distribution of such incidents. It can therefore contribute to improving global public health preparedness.","Olowokure, B; Pooransingh, S; Tempowski, J; Palmer, S; Meredith, T",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16462985/,19

Of interest were the serum titers to the following common agents found in vaccines, canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), and Bordetella bronchiseptica. There were no statistical differences in the antibodies to CPIV, B. bronchispetica, and CRCoV, among the age/weight categories, nor among the age/weight categories and the time, in days, between the date of sample collection and the date of the last recorded vaccination for CPIV, B. bronchiseptica, CPV, and CDV. For CPV, the control dogs had significantly (P < 0.002) higher serum neutralization (SN) titers than the lean geriatric dogs and the obese geriatric dogs. For CDV SN titers, the only statistically significant (P = 0.01) difference was that the control dogs had higher SN titers than the lean geriatric dogs.","Ellis, John; Gow, Sheryl; Rhodes, Carrie; Lacoste, Stacey; Kong, Lyndsay; Musil, Kristyna; Snead, Elisabeth",The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27152043/,19

The results showed significant increase in the levels of lipid peroxidation as well as the activities of LDH, acid and alkaline phosphatases in a dose dependent manner. The remarkable increase in the levels of these stress biomarkers indicates strong stress inducing potential of these insecticides in fishes. The importance of the current study lies in indicating the potential risk of muddy freshwater fishes due to strong soil binding property of pyrethroids along with their slow metabolism in fishes as compared to that of mammals.","Kumar, A; Sharma, B; Pandey, R S",Cellular and molecular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23273206/,19

In November/December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, a SARS-like viral disease with a high adhesive capacity and the potential to endanger the life of the patient was reported. It soon became clear that the disease was very contagious and new hospitals were being built on the site and a General closure was underway. Many doctors from all over China were recruited and sent to the isolated area. Local medical reports were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like, and patients needed respiratory support for oxygenation and some needed ventilation on respiratory devices with significant mortality rates. The disease has since spread to many parts of the world, mainly towards Europe. Hospitals have received hundreds of patients, to the point of partially collapsing the glorious Italian healthcare system. Italy and Spain reported a lung disease that causes severe oxidative disruption but no disruption in ventilation unlike ARDS. Initial post-mortem shows that the main cause of death is thromboembolic. Heart involvement with myocarditis and even heart attacks are beginning to be reported. Various drugs are involved in the treatment plan and are often known to fail. Even promising remedies such as Remdesavir, which is an antiviral drug, are beginning to receive reports from controlled trials, which are not as successful as originally expected. All in all, we continue to wander in the dark, both about the disease and certainly, regarding the treatment. The primary treatment involves maximum efforts for respiratory, hematologic, nephrologic and cardiologic support. In this review, I will try to describe the disease and the enigma concerning suggested treatments.","Levinger, Uriel",Harefuah,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32583640/,19
196612,Development of a DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus type 16 oncoprotein E6.,2004,"Detection of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the sera of individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) can indicate both a high infectivity of the disease and a poor prognosis of disease treatment. Most of monoclonal antibodies raised against HBV e proteins interact with immuno-dominant epitopes, such as HBeAg-beta. In order to raise antibodies against non-dominant epitopes of HBV e protein, in this study, mice were immunized with both recombinant HBeAg (rHBeAg) and an anti-HBeAg antibody (EWB) recognizing a dominant antigenic epitope of HBeAg (HBeAg-beta epitope). With this strategy, we successfully selected two monoclonal antibodies, S-29-3 and S-72-3. Both S-29-3 and S-72-3 bind to recombinant HBeAg with a high affinity. The epitope mapping assay determined that the S-73-2 recognizes the N-terminal of HBeAg (1-118 aa) and the S-29-3 recognizes the C-terminal of HBeAg (91-149 aa). Further experiment showed that these two antibodies could be formed a pair-Abs that is used in detecting native HBeAg from the sera of HBV patients. The conclusion is that the developed method is useful to raise mAb against non-dominant epitopes in given Ag.","Yan, Ling Chen; Jing, Cai Ying; Huang, Chao Feng; Ji, Yong Yong; Yao, Gang; Cai, Xing Feng; Sun, Bing",Journal of biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17408795/,19
196703,Essential role for collectrin in renal amino acid transport.,2006,"AIM To obtain the pure sample of SARS small envelope E protein (SARS E protein), study its properties and analyze its possible functions. METHODS The plasmid of SARS E protein was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the protein was expressed in the E coli strain. The secondary structure feature of the protein was determined by circular dichroism (CD) technique. The possible functions of this protein were annotated by bioinformatics methods, and its possible three-dimensional model was constructed by molecular modeling. RESULTS The pure sample of SARS E protein was obtained. The secondary structure feature derived from CD determination is similar to that from the secondary structure prediction. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the key residues of SARS E protein were much conserved compared to the E proteins of other coronaviruses. In particular, the primary amino acid sequence of SARS E protein is much more similar to that of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and other mammal coronaviruses. The transmembrane (TM) segment of the SARS E protein is relatively more conserved in the whole protein than other regions. CONCLUSION The success of expressing the SARS E protein is a good starting point for investigating the structure and functions of this protein and SARS coronavirus itself as well. The SARS E protein may fold in water solution in a similar way as it in membrane-water mixed environment. It is possible that beta-sheet I of the SARS E protein interacts with the membrane surface via hydrogen bonding, this beta-sheet may uncoil to a random structure in water solution.","Shen, Xu; Xue, Jian-Hua; Yu, Chang-Ying; Luo, Hai-Bin; Qin, Lei; Yu, Xiao-Jing; Chen, Jing; Chen, Li-Li; Xiong, Bin; Yue, Li-Duo; Cai, Jian-Hua; Shen, Jian-Hua; Luo, Xiao-Min; Chen, Kai-Xian; Shi, Tie-Liu; Li, Yi-Xue; Hu, Geng-Xi; Jiang, Hua-Liang",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12791175/,19

METHODS Between February 2010 and August 2015, data on 541 consecutive patients with BMI 30-35 kg/m2 undergoing LSG were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS Mean age was 32 ± 8 years (13-65) and 419 (77.4 %) were women. Preoperative weight was 92.0 ± 8.8 kg (65-121) and BMI was 32.6 ± 1.5 kg/m2 (30-35). Comorbidities were detected in 210 (39 %) patients. Operative time was 74 ± 12 min (40-110) and postoperative stay was 1.7 ± 0.22 days (1-3). There were no deaths, leaks, abscesses or strictures and the rate of hemorrhage was 1.2 %. At 1 year, 98 % were followed and BMI decreased to 24.7 ± 1.6, the percentage of total weight loss (% TWL) was 24.1 ± 4.7 while the percentage of excess BMI loss (%EBMIL) reached 106.1 ± 24.1. At 5 years, 76 % of followed patients achieved a ≥50 % EBMIL.

197904,Animal coronavirus vaccines: lessons for SARS.,2004,"As Veterinary Services and animal health organisations attempt to respond to a new era of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases, their ability and skill in forming new strategic partnerships will be paramount. While these new partnerships are likely to include many relationships outside traditional Veterinary Services and animal agriculture, none will become more important than the formation of new animal health and public health partnerships. Episodes of emerging zoonoses are being increasingly recognised around the world and the confluence of people, animals and animal products today is unprecedented. Concurrently, a wide array of complex factors are also converging that will not only ensure the continuous emergence of zoonoses, but are also likely to drive the further increase and expansion of these diseases. This article discusses the need for the creation of more effective and co-operative partnerships in the face of new microbial threats, the complexity of both the formation and expansion of zoonoses, and the collective abilities of both human and animal health services to respond to them. Lessons learned from recent zoonotic epidemics supportthe need for co-ordinated research, interdisciplinary centres, integrated surveillance systems, response systems and infrastructures, and workforce development strategies. While there are some excellent examples of collaborative animal and public health relationships, there is no question that more and stronger partnerships among national and international organisations, both academic and private, will be necessary to meet the future challenges of emerging zoonoses and to manage their profound implications.","King, L J; Marano, N; Hughes, J M",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702731/,19

198010,Phosphatidyl-serine inhibition of OC43 and NCDCV coronavirus infectivity.,1985,"Laparoscopic-assisted ventral hernia repair (LAVHR) with mesh is well established as the preferred technique for hernia repair. We sought to determine whether primary fascial closure and/or overlap of the mesh reduced recurrence and/or complications. We conducted a retrospective review on 57 LAVHR patients using polyester composite mesh between August 2010 and July 2013. They were divided into mesh-only (nonclosure) and primary fascial closure with mesh (closure) groups. Patient demographics, prior surgical history, mesh overlap, complications, and recurrence rates were compared. Thirty-nine (68%) of 57 patients were in the closure group and 18 (32%) in the nonclosure group. Mean defect sizes were 15.5 and 22.5 cm(2), respectively. Participants were followed for a mean of 1.3 years [standard deviation (SD) = 0.7]. Recurrence rates were 2/39 (5.1%) in the closure group and 1/18 (5.6%) in the nonclosure group (P = 0.947). There were no major postoperative complications in the nonclosure group. The closure group experienced four (10.3%) complications. This was not a statistically significant difference (P = 0.159). The median mesh-to-hernia ratio for all repairs was 15.2 (surface area) and 3.9 (diameter). Median length of stay was 14.5 hours (1.7-99.3) for patients with nonclosure and 11.9 hours (6.9-90.3 hours) for patients with closure (P = 0.625). In conclusion, this is one of the largest series of LAVHR exclusively using polyester dual-sided mesh. Our recurrence rate was about 5 per cent. Significant mesh overlap is needed to achieve such low recurrence rates. Primary closure of hernias seems less important than adequate mesh overlap in preventing recurrence after LAVHR.","Karipineni, Farah; Joshi, Priya; Parsikia, Afshin; Dhir, Teena; Joshi, Amit R T",The American surgeon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27099060/,19

198228,Pseudotyping Viral Vectors With Emerging Virus Envelope Proteins.,2016,"BACKGROUND Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the concentrations of antioxidant vitamins in human plasma may play an important role in numerous chronic diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. However, methods for simultaneous measurement of these antioxidants are scarce. We developed and validated a new HPLC method for simultaneous determination of these vitamers in human plasma that uses a novel column-switching approach. METHODS The new method uses liquid-liquid extraction and isocratic separation with two monomeric C(18) columns maintained at 35 and 4 degrees C coupled with ultraviolet-visible and fluorometric detection. This method could separate 14 vitamers and 3 internal standards within 27 min. No additional modifier was required; the mobile phase was acetonitrile-methanol (65:35 by volume), and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. RESULTS For photodiode array detection, the detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio >3) were 0.02 mg/L for beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and canthaxanthin; 0.01 mg/L for all-trans-retinol, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-carotene, and lycopene; and 0.1 mg/L for all tocopherols and tocotrienols. The detection limit was at least 25-fold lower (0.004 mg/L) when fluorometry was used for measurement of delta-, gamma-, and alpha-tocotrienol and delta-tocopherol compared with ultraviolet detection. The recovery and imprecision of the assay were generally >90% and <10%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This new method separates a wide range of fat-soluble antioxidant vitamins in human plasma, including six carotenoids, three isoforms of tocotrienols and tocopherols (delta-, gamma-, and alpha-), and all-trans-retinol. The overall findings suggest that our method is faster, more sensitive, and more comprehensive than existing methods.","Lee, Bee-Lan; New, Ai-Li; Ong, Choon-Nam",Clinical chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14633878/,19

The relationship between positive-strand RNA viruses and the cell cycle and the concomitant effects on virus replication are not clearly understood. We have shown that infection of asynchronously replicating and synchronized replicating cells with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a positive-strand RNA virus, resulted in the accumulation of infected cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Analysis of various cell cycle-regulatory proteins and cellular morphology indicated that there was a down-regulation of cyclins D1 and D2 (G1 regulatory cyclins) and that a proportion of virus-infected cells underwent aberrant cytokinesis, in which the cells underwent nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, division. We assessed the impact of the perturbations on the cell cycle for virus-infected cells and found that IBV-infected G2/M-phase-synchronized cells exhibited increased viral protein production when released from the block when compared to cells synchronized in the G0 phase or asynchronously replicating cells. Our data suggested that IBV induces a G2/M phase arrest in infected cells to promote favorable conditions for viral replication.","Dove, Brian; Brooks, Gavin; Bicknell, Katrina; Wurm, Torsten; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16571830/,19
202315,Response of the authors,2020,"The role and importance of solidarity for effective health provision is the subject of lengthy and heated debate which has been thrown into even sharper relief by the COVID-19 pandemic. In various ways, and by various authorities we have all been asked, even instructed, to engage in solidarity with one another in order to collectively respond to the current crisis. Under normal circumstances, individuals can engage in solidarity with their compatriots in the context of public health provision in a number of ways, including paying taxes which fund welfare state initiatives, and avoiding others when ill. While there has been significant engagement in solidarity worldwide, there have also been high profile examples of refusals and failures to engage in solidarity, both by individual agents, and governments. In this paper I examine the consequence of these failures with reference to the actions of the current British government, which has failed to deliver an effective response to the crisis. This failure has effectively devolved responsibility for responding to the crisis to people who are simultaneously more vulnerable to infection, and less able to do anything about it. I argue that such responses represent mismanagement of a public health crisis, and a rejection of important democratic and egalitarian norms and values.","West-Oram, Peter",J. med. ethics,,19

Nurse practitioners (NPs) represent an efficient solution to human resource challenges. During the current pandemic, many Medical Directors in LTC homes worked virtually to reduce the risk of transmission. In contrast, NPs were present for in-person care. This study aims to understand the NPs' roles in optimizing resident care and supporting LTC staff during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 14 NPs working in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, was recruited. Data were generated using semistructured interviews and examined using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four categories relating to the NPs' practices and experiences during the pandemic were identified: (a) containing the spread of COVID-19, (b) stepping in where needed, (c) supporting staff and families, and (d) establishing links between fragmented systems of care by acting as a liaison. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that innovative models of care that include NPs in LTC homes are required moving forward. NPs embraced a multitude of roles in LTC homes, but the need to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 was central to how they prioritized their days. The pandemic clearly accentuated that NPs have a unique scope of practice, which positions them well to act as leaders and build capacity in LTC homes.","McGilton, Katherine S; Krassikova, Alexandra; Boscart, Veronique; Sidani, Souraya; Iaboni, Andrea; Vellani, Shirin; Escrig-Pinol, Astrid",Gerontologist,,19

A multiple dose regimen of BKI 1369 has been shown to be highly effective against Cystoisospora suis (syn. Isospora suis), the causative agent of neonatal porcine coccidiosis. However, multiple dosing may not be widely applicable in the field. The present study aimed to determine the efficacy of reduced treatment frequencies with BKI 1369 against porcine cystoisosporosis in vitro and in vivo. Pre-incubation of sporozoites with BKI 1369 completely failed to inhibit the infection in vitro unless treatment was prolonged post-infection. Notably, a single treatment of infected cell cultures 2 days post-infection (dpi) resulted in a significant reduction of merozoite replication. In an experimental infection model, treatment of suckling piglets experimentally infected with C. suis 2 and 4 dpi with 20 mg BKI 1369/kg body weight completely suppressed oocyst excretion. A single treatment on the day of infection or 2 dpi suppressed oocyst excretion in 50% and 82% of the piglets and reduced the quantitative excretion in those that shed oocysts by 95.2% and 98.4%, respectively. Moreover, a significant increase in body weight gain and reduced number of diarrhea days were observed in BKI 1369 treated piglets compared to the control piglets, irrespective of time points and frequencies of treatment. Given that reduced treatment frequencies with BKI 1369 are comparable in efficacy to repeated applications without any adverse effects, this could be considered as a practical therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis.","Shrestha, Aruna; Ruttkowski, Bärbel; Greber, Patricia; Whitman, Grant R; Hulverson, Matthew A; Choi, Ryan; Michaels, Samantha A; Ojo, Kayode K; Van Voorhis, Wesley C; Joachim, Anja",Int J Parasitol Drugs Drug Resist,,19

Com base no pressuposto de que uma escola médica responsável e comprometida precisa estar atenta às necessidades básicas da sociedade para que os processos formativos possam atender a elas, torna-se necessário refletir sobre a educação médica em tempos de pandemia. Objetivo: O presente ensaio buscará refletir criticamente sobre ""o que já aprendemos"" em relação à educação médica no contexto atual de pandemia da Covid-19. Desenvolvimento: Em 2010, a revista Lancet publicou um manuscrito intitulado ""Health professionals for a new century: transforming education to strengthen health systems in an interdependent world"", o qual realiza uma análise histórica e socioepidemiológica sobre a formação em saúde, a fim de refletir sobre as características necessárias para uma formação profissional voltada para o século XXI. Diante disso e dos 20 anos vividos em um novo século, questionamo-nos: como estamos formando profissionais para o século XXI? Estamos reproduzindo padrões tecnicistas com uma ""nova roupagem"" ou promovendo a responsabilidade social ao longo do processo formativo? Estamos utilizando metodologias ativas com um enfoque técnico ou ampliando a análise a partir da perspectiva da determinação social do processo saúde-doença proposta pelas DCN? Não é nossa proposta apresentar uma resposta simples, mas fomentar o debate para que possamos pensar juntos(as) quais são os caminhos possíveis para ampliarmos nossa formação e realmente pensarmos em processos formativos voltados para a promoção da equidade no século XXI. Conclusão: Precisamos advogar em função dos usuários do SUS e também despertar em nossos(as) estudantes o olhar para essa necessidade. As demandas sociais da atualidade também exigem competências atitudinais e relacionais dos profissionais da saúde, o que precisa ser colocado em prática na formação desses profissionais.","Raimondi, Gustavo Antonio; Tourinho, Francis Solange Vieira",Rev. bras. educ. méd,,19
209153,Understanding the Community Perceptions and Knowledge of Bats and Transmission of Nipah Virus in Bangladesh,2020,"Casein Kinase 1 epsilon (CK1Îµ) is a member of the serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) CK1 family, known to have crucial roles in several biological scenarios and, ever more frequently, in pathological contexts, such as cancer. Recently, the human DEAD-box RNA helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X), involved in cancer proliferation and viral infections, has been identified as one of CK1Îµ substrates and its positive regulator in the Wnt/ß-catenin network. However, the way by which these two proteins influence each other has not been fully clarified. In order to further investigate their interplay, we defined the kinetic parameters of CK1Îµ towards its substrates: ATP, casein, Dvl2 and DDX3X. CK1Îµ affinity for ATP depends on the nature of the substrate: increasing of casein concentrations led to an increase of KmATP, while increasing DDX3X reduced it. In literature, DDX3X is described to act as an allosteric activator of CK1Îµ. However, when we performed kinase reactions combining DDX3X and casein, we did not find a positive effect of DDX3X on casein phosphorylation by CK1Îµ, while both substrates were phosphorylated in a competitive manner. Moreover, CK1Îµ positively stimulates DDX3X ATPase activity. Our data provide a more detailed kinetic characterization on the functional interplay of these two proteins.","Bono, Bartolo; Franco, Giulia; Riva, Valentina; Garbelli, Anna; Maga, Giovanni",,,19

In a disease where there are acute inflammation and compromised oxygenation, we investigated the impact of initial hemoglobin (Hgb) levels at Emergency Department (ED) triage on the severity and the clinical course of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 601 COVID-19 patients in a COVID-19 national referral center between 13 and 27 June 2020. All adult patients presented at our hospital that required admission or hotel isolation were included in this study. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had a lower initial Hgb than those admitted outside the ICU (12.84 g/dL vs. 13.31 g/dL, p = 0.026) and over the course of admission; the prevalence of anemia (Hgb < 12.5 g/dL) was 65% in patients admitted to ICU, whereas it was only 43% in non-ICU patients (odds ratio of 2.464, 95% CI 1.71-3.52). Anemic ICU patients had a higher mortality compared with non-anemic ICU patients (hazard ratio = 1.88, log-rank p = 0.0104). A direct agglutination test (DAT) for all anemic patients showed that 14.7% of ICU patients and 9% of non-ICU patients had autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA patients had significantly longer length of hospital stay compared with anemic patients without AIHA (17.1 days vs. 14.08 days, p = 0.034). Lower Hgb level at hospital presentation could be a potential surrogate for COVID-19 severity.","Algassim, Abdulrahman A; Elghazaly, Assem A; Alnahdi, Abdulrahman S; Mohammed-Rahim, Owais M; Alanazi, Abdulaziz G; Aldhuwayhi, Nawaf A; Alanazi, Mashael M; Almutairi, Mohammed F; Aldeailej, Ibrahim M; Kamli, Najeeb A; Aljurf, Mahmoud D",Ann. hematol,,19

Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of this pandemic on cancer care worldwide. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a validated web-based questionnaire of 51 items. The questionnaire obtained information on the capacity and services offered at these centers, magnitude of disruption of care, reasons for disruption, challenges faced, interventions implemented, and the estimation of patient harm during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 356 centers from 54 countries across six continents participated between April 21 and May 8, 2020. These centers serve 716,979 new patients with cancer a year. Most of them (88.2%) reported facing challenges in delivering care during the pandemic. Although 55.34% reduced services as part of a preemptive strategy, other common reasons included an overwhelmed system (19.94%), lack of personal protective equipment (19.10%), staff shortage (17.98%), and restricted access to medications (9.83%). Missing at least one cycle of therapy by > 10% of patients was reported in 46.31% of the centers. Participants reported patient exposure to harm from interruption of cancer-specific care (36.52%) and noncancer-related care (39.04%), with some centers estimating that up to 80% of their patients were exposed to harm. CONCLUSION: The detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care is widespread, with varying magnitude among centers worldwide.

While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population-adjusted number of cases and mortality rates (MRs) were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population-adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination was negatively associated with population-adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study is an attempt to bring in several social, economic, and structural confounders into understanding of the nature and spread of this novel pandemic globally.","Goswami, Rudra Prosad; Ganguli, Bhaswati; Chatterjee, Moumita",J Med Virol,,19

Hypoxaemia is one of the main clinical manifestations, especially in severe cases. HIF1&#945; is a master transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxygen levels. The immunopathogenesis of this severe form of COVID-19 is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed scRNAseq from leukocytes from five critically ill COVID-19 patients and characterized the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes. Also performed metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar cells. RESULTS: Critically-ill COVID-19 patients show a shift towards an immature myeloid profile in peripheral blood cells, including band neutrophils, immature monocytes, metamyelocytes, monocyte-macrophages, monocytoid precursors, and promyelocytes-myelocytes, together with mature monocytes and segmented neutrophils. May be the result of a physiological response known as emergency myelopoiesis. These cellular subsets and bronchoalveolar cells express HIF1&#945; and their transcriptional targets related to inflammation (CXCL8, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4); virus sensing, (TLR2 and TLR4); and metabolism (SLC2A3, PFKFB3, PGK1, GAPDH and SOD2). CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation and participation of HIF1&#945; in events such as inflammation, immunometabolism, and TLR make it a potential molecular marker for COVID-19 severity and, interestingly, could represent a potential target for molecular therapy. Key messages Critically ill COVID-19 patients show emergency myelopoiesis. HIF1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes are expressed in immature myeloid cells which could serve as molecular targets. HIF1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes is also expressed in lung cells from critically ill COVID-19 patients which may partially explain the hypoxia related events.","Taniguchi-Ponciano, Keiko; Vadillo, Eduardo; Mayani, Héctor; Gonzalez-Bonilla, César Raúl; Torres, Javier; Majluf, Abraham; Flores-Padilla, Guillermo; Wacher-Rodarte, Niels; Galan, Juan Carlos; Ferat-Osorio, Eduardo; Blanco-Favela, Francisco; Lopez-Macias, Constantino; Ferreira-Hermosillo, Aldo; Ramirez-Renteria, Claudia; Peña-Martínez, Eduardo; Silva-Román, Gloria; Vela-Patiño, Sandra; Mata-Lozano, Carlos; Carvente-Garcia, Roberto; Basurto-Acevedo, Lourdes; Saucedo, Renata; Piña-Sanchez, Patricia; Chavez-Gonzalez, Antonieta; Marrero-Rodríguez, Daniel; Mercado, Moisés",Ann Med,,19

After a year and half and over 4 million deaths, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be widespread, and its related topics continue to dominate the global media. Although COVID-19 diagnoses have been well monitored, neither the impacts of the disease on human behavior and social dynamics nor the effectiveness of policy interventions aimed at its containment are fully understood. Monitoring the spatial and temporal patterns of behavior, social dynamics and policy - and then their interrelations - can provide critical information for preparatory action and effective response. Methods. Here we present an open-source dataset of 1.92 million keyword-selected Twitter posts, updated weekly from January 2020 to present, along with a dynamic dashboard showing totals at national and subnational administrative divisions. Results. The dashboard presents 100% of the geotagged tweets that contain keywords or hashtags related COVID-19. We validated our inclusion criteria using a machine learning-based text classifier and found that 88% of the selected tweets were correctly labeled as related to COVID-19. With this information we tested the correlation between tweets and covid diagnosis from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and see a decreasing correlation across time. Conclusions. With emerging COVID variants but ongoing vaccine hesitancy and resistance, this dataset could be used by researchers to study numerous aspects of COVID-19 and provide valuable insights for preparing future pandemics.","Chi, Guangqing; Yin, Junjun; Smith, M.

OBJECTIVE: To assess weight changes, the development of overweight/obesity, and changes in lipid levels 18 months after replacing TDF with TAF. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: 5 university hospitals, affiliated hospitals, and private physicians in Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: 4375 adults living with HIV who received TDF-containing ART for 6 months or longer. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in weight and lipid levels were assessed using mixed-effect models. Differences in proportions of newly overweight/obese participants were calculated using 2-proportions Z tests. RESULTS: 4375 individuals were included, with follow-up between 1 January 2016 and 31 July 2019. Median age was 50 years (interquartile range, 43 to 56 years), 25.9% were female, and 51.7% had a normal body mass index (BMI); 3484 (79.6%) switched to TAF and 891 (20.4%) continued TDF. After 18 months, switching to TAF was associated with an adjusted mean weight increase of 1.7 kg (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.0 kg), compared with 0.7 kg (CI, 0.4 to 1.0 kg) with the continued use of TDF (between-group difference, 1.1 kg [CI, 0.7 to 1.4 kg]). Among individuals with a normal BMI, 13.8% who switched to TAF became overweight/obese, compared with 8.4% of those continuing TDF (difference, 5.4 percentage points [CI, 2.1 to 8.8 percentage points]). Switching to TAF led to increases in adjusted mean total cholesterol (0.25 mmol/L [9.5 mg/dL]), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.05 mmol/L [1.9 mg/dL]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.12 mmol/L [4.7 mg/dL]), and triglyceride (0.18 mmol/L [16.1 mg/dL]) levels after 18 months.

229670,Monoclonal Antibodies for the Coronavirus,2020,"Predicting interactions among heterogenous graph structured data has numerous applications such as knowledge graph completion, recommendation systems and drug discovery. Often times, the links to be predicted belong to rare types such as the case in repurposing drugs for novel diseases. This motivates the task of few-shot link prediction. Typically, GCNs are ill-equipped in learning such rare link types since the relation embedding is not learned in an inductive fashion. This paper proposes an inductive RGCN for learning informative relation embeddings even in the few-shot learning regime. The proposed inductive model significantly outperforms the RGCN and state-of-the-art KGE models in few-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we apply our method on the drug-repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG) for discovering drugs for Covid-19. We pose the drug discovery task as link prediction and learn embeddings for the biological entities that partake in the DRKG. Our initial results corroborate that several drugs used in clinical trials were identified as possible drug candidates.

The present study investigated the association of type of KRT with COVID-19 severity adjusting for differences in individual characteristics. METHODS: Data on kidney transplant recipients and hemodialysis patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between February 1st and December 1st 2020 were retrieved from ERACODA. Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, frailty and comorbidities were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for 28-day mortality risk in all patients and in the subsets who were tested because of symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 1,670 patients (496 functional kidney transplant and 1,174 hemodialysis) were included. 16.9% of kidney transplant and 23.9% of hemodialysis patients died within 28 days of presentation. The unadjusted 28-day mortality risk was 33% lower in kidney transplant recipients compared with hemodialysis patients (HR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.52-0.85). In a fully adjusted model, the risk was 78% higher in kidney transplant recipients (HR: 1.78, 95%CI: 1.22-2.61) compared with hemodialysis patients. This association was similar in patients tested because of symptoms (fully adjusted model HR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.31-3.06). This risk was dramatically increased during the first post-transplant year. Results were similar for other endpoints (e.g. hospitalization, ICU admission, mortality beyond 28 days) and across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients had a greater risk of a more severe course of COVID-19 compared with hemodialysis patients; they therefore require specific infection mitigation strategies.","Goffin, Eric; Candellier, Alexandre; Vart, Priya; Noordzij, Marlies; Arnol, Miha; Covic, Adrian; Lentini, Paolo; Malik, Shafi; Reichert, Louis J; Sever, Mehmet S; Watschinger, Bruno; Jager, Kitty J; Gansevoort, Ron T",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,19
231926,Epigenetic modifications of RNA and their implications in antiviral immunity,2020,"Background: Due to the SARS-CoV­2 crisis, online adaptation of sleep trainings is necessary. As sleep disturbances in school children are common, prevention of chronification is essential. The aim of this study was to adapt an established age-oriented cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) group training for 5-10-year-old children with insomnia and their parents to an online version (group iCBT-I). Methods: The adaptation procedure and structure of the iCBT­I are described. To assess acceptance the Online Sleep Treatment Acceptance questionnaire (OSTA) and the Online Sleep Treatment Feedback questionnaire (OSTF) were implemented. In addition, trainers filled in the Adherence and Feasibility Questionnaire for Online Sleep Treatment (AFOST). Sleep problems were assessed using a structured interview for sleep disorders in children and clinical interview, and the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ-DE). Emotional problems were evaluated with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL 4-18). Results: This pilot study included 12 parents and 6 children fulfilling insomnia criteria prior to online training. The adapted online version consisted of three parental sessions, whereas child-oriented sessions were transferred into videoclips. The new group iCBT­I was well accepted by parents. Parents scored the online version as helpful and time saving based on the OSTA and trainers estimated the adapted version to be feasible and effective. According to AFOST, adherence was given. After training, 67% of children showed reduced sleep problems according to parental rating. Conclusion: Parental acceptance of a group iCBT­I for school children and their parents was very good and parents scored the videos for their children as very helpful. Trainers declared the adapted version to be feasible. A further study with a larger sample is necessary.","Schlarb, Angelika A; Schulte, Hannah; Selbmann, Anika; Och, Ina",Somnologie (Berl),,19
232349,Mass Spectrometry Imaging as a Potential Tool to Investigate Human Osteoarthritis at the Tissue Level,2020,"Some studies suggest that recent common coronavirus (CCV) infections are associated with reduced COVID-19 severity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We completed serological assays using samples collected from health care workers to identify antibody types associated with SARS-CoV-2 protection and COVID-19 symptom duration. Rare SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies elicited by past CCV infections were not associated with protection; however, the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections was significantly reduced in individuals with higher common betacoronavirus (ßCoV) antibody titers. Since antibody titers decline over time after CCV infections, individuals in our cohort with higher ßCoV antibody titers were more likely recently infected with common ßCoVs compared with individuals with lower antibody titers. Therefore, our data suggest that recent ßCoV infections potentially limit the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections through mechanisms that do not involve cross-reactive antibodies. Our data are consistent with the emerging hypothesis that cellular immune responses elicited by recent common ßCoV infections transiently reduce symptom duration following SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Gouma, Sigrid; Weirick, Madison E; Bolton, Marcus J; Arevalo, Claudia P; Goodwin, Eileen C; Anderson, Elizabeth M; McAllister, Christopher M; Christensen, Shannon R; Dunbar, Debora; Fiore, Danielle; Brock, Amanda; Weaver, JoEllen; Millar, John; DerOhannessian, Stephanie; Unit, The UPenn Covid Processing; Frank, Ian; Rader, Daniel J; Wherry, E John; Hensley, Scott E",JCI insight,,19

Here, we investigated the effect of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide on levcromakalim-induced headache in healthy volunteers. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study, 15 healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to receive glibenclamide and levcromakalim (day 1), glibenclamide and placebo (day 2), and placebo and placebo (day 3) on three different days separated by at least 1 week. The primary endpoints were the difference in incidence of headache and the difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores (0-12 hours) between the days. RESULTS: Fifteen healthy volunteers completed the 3 days of the study. More participants (12/15, 80%) developed headache on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (5/15, 33%) (p = 0.01; mean difference 47%; 95% confidence interval 18-75%) and compared to the placebo-placebo day (1/15, 7%) (p = 0.001; mean difference 73%; 95% confidence interval 48-99%). We found no difference in headache incidence between glibenclamide-placebo day and placebo-placebo day (p = 0.12; mean difference 27%; 95% confidence interval 1.3-52%). The area under the curve for headache intensity was significantly larger on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (p = 0.003); and compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.001). We found no difference in the area under the curve between the glibenclamide-placebo day compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.07). The median time to onset for headache after levcromakalim infusion with glibenclamide pretreatment was delayed (180 min) compared to levcromakalim without pretreatment (30 min) from a previously published study. CONCLUSION: Glibenclamide administration did not cause headache, and glibenclamide pretreatment did not prevent levcromakalim-induced headache. However, glibenclamide delayed the onset of levcromakalim-induced headache. More selective blockers are needed to further elucidate the role of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in headache initiation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03886922.","Al-Karagholi, Mohammad Al-Mahdi; Ghanizada, Hashmat; Kokoti, Lili; Paulsen, Joachim S; Hansen, Jakob Møller; Ashina, Messoud",Cephalalgia,,19
236784,Multiscale simulations of large complexes in conjunction with cryo-EM analysis,2021,"The risk of transmitting airborne pathogens is an important consideration in dentistry and has acquired special significance in the context of recent respiratory disease epidemics. The purpose of this review, therefore, is to examine (1) what is currently known regarding the physics of aerosol creation, (2) the types of environmental contaminants generated by dental procedures, (3) the nature, quantity, and sources of microbiota in these contaminants and (4) the risk of disease transmission from patients to dental healthcare workers. Most dental procedures that use ultrasonics, handpieces, air-water syringes, and lasers generate sprays, a fraction of which are aerosolized. The vast heterogeneity in the types of airborne samples collected (spatter, settled aerosol, or harvested air), the presence and type of at-source aerosol reduction methods (high-volume evacuators, low volume suction, or none), the methods of microbial sampling (petri dishes with solid media, filter paper discs, air harvesters, and liquid transport media) and assessment of microbial bioload (growth conditions, time of growth, specificity of microbial characterization) are barriers to drawing robust conclusions. For example, although several studies have reported the presence of microorganisms in aerosols generated by ultrasonic scalers and high-speed turbines, the specific types of organisms or their source is not as well studied. This paucity of data does not allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding saliva as a major source of airborne microorganisms during aerosol generating dental procedures. Well-controlled, large-scale, multi center studies using atraumatic air harvesters, open-ended methods for microbial characterization and integrated data modeling are urgently needed to characterize the microbial constituents of aerosols created during dental procedures and to estimate time and extent of spread of these infectious agents.","Kumar, Purnima S; Subramanian, Kumar",J Periodontol,,19

Of all 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 15 patients comprising four transmission clusters were identified. Three patients were infected by direct contact without travel history to Wuhan. Of 18 patients, 10 patients showed bilateral pneumonia and two patients showed no abnormalities. Three patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, liver diseases, or diabetes developed severe illness. High C-reactive protein levels and elevations of both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were observed in three severely ill patients on admission. All 18 patients were eventually discharged, including the three severe patients who recovered after treatment with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, convalescent plasma, and other therapies. Our findings confirmed human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in clusters.

Understanding species' connectivity can reveal how nations share resources, demonstrating the need for cooperative protection efforts. Unfortunately, connectivity information is rarely integrated into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs). This is exemplified in the Red Sea where biodiversity is only nominally protected by a non-cohesive network of small-sized MPAs, most of which are barely implemented. Here, we showcase the potential of using connectivity patterns of flagship species to consolidate conservation efforts in the Red Sea. We argue that a large-scale MPA (LSMPA) would more effectively preserve Red Sea species' multinational migration routes. A connectivity-informed LSMPA approach provides thus one avenue to unite coastal nations toward acting for the common good of conservation and reverse the global decline in marine biodiversity.","Gajdzik, Laura; Green, Alison L; Cochran, Jesse E M; Hardenstine, Royale S; Tanabe, Lyndsey K; Berumen, Michael L",Mar Pollut Bull,,19

The present study reports how the French Health Care system created temporary ICU beds to avoid being overwhelmed. METHODS: All French ICUs were contacted for answering a questionnaire focusing on the available beds and health care providers before and during the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 336 institutions with ICUs before the outbreak, 315 (94%) participated, covering 5054/5531 (91%) ICU beds. During the outbreak, 4806 new ICU beds (+95% increase) were created from Acute Care Unit (ACU, 2283), Post Anaesthetic Care Unit and Operating Theatre (PACU & OT, 1522), other units (374) or real build-up of new ICU beds (627), respectively. At the peak of the outbreak, 9860, 1982 and 3089 ICU, ACU and PACU beds were made available. Before the outbreak, 3548 physicians (2224 critical care anaesthesiologists, 898 intensivists and 275 from other specialties, 151 paediatrics), 1785 residents, 11,023 nurses and 6763 nursing auxiliaries worked in established ICUs. During the outbreak, 2524 physicians, 715 residents, 7722 nurses and 3043 nursing auxiliaries supplemented the usual staff in all ICUs. A total number of 3212 new ventilators were added to the 5997 initially available in ICU. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the French Health Care system created 4806 ICU beds (+95% increase from baseline), essentially by transforming beds from ACUs and PACUs.

256210,Preparing for Pandemics: RNA Vaccines at the Forefront,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a policy option to reduce consumption of alcohol and the harm it does, on May 1, 2018, Scotland introduced a minimum price of 50 British pence (p) per unit of alcohol (8 g) sold; Wales followed suit on March 2, 2020, with the same minimum unit price (MUP). We analysed household purchase data based on bar codes to assess the impact of these policy options in the medium term for Scotland and in the immediate term for Wales. METHODS: For these location-controlled, interrupted time series regression analyses, the data source was Kantar WorldPanel's household shopping panel, which, at the time of our analysis, included 35 242 British households providing detailed information on 1·24 million separate alcohol purchases in 2015-18 and the first half of 2020. With no data exclusions, we analysed the impact of introducing MUP in Scotland, using purchases in northern England as control, and in Wales, using western England as control. The studied changes associated with MUP were price paid per gram of alcohol purchased, grams of alcohol purchased, and amount of money spent on alcohol. FINDINGS: In Scotland, price increases and purchase decreases following the introduction of MUP in 2018 were maintained during the first half of 2020. The difference between Scotland and northern England in 2020 was a price increase of 0·741 p per gram (95% CI 0·724-0·759), a 7·6% increase, and a purchase decrease of 7·063 g per adult per household per day that an alcohol purchase was made (6·656-7·470), a 7·7% decrease. In Wales, the introduction of MUP led to similar results. The difference between Wales and western England was a price increase 0·841 of 0·841 p per gram (0·732-0·951), an 8·2% increase, and a purchase decrease of 7·052 g per adult per household per day that an alcohol purchase was made (6·463-7·640), an 8·6% decrease. For both Scotland and Wales, reductions in overall purchases of alcohol were largely restricted to households that bought the most alcohol. The introduction of MUP was not associated with an increased expenditure on alcohol by households that generally bought small amounts of alcohol and, in particular, those with low incomes. The changes were not affected by the introduction of COVID-19 confinement in the UK on March 26, 2020. INTERPRETATION: The evidence base supporting the positive, targeted impact of MUP is strengthened by the comparable results for Scotland and Wales. The short-term impact of MUP in Scotland during 2018 is maintained during the first half of 2020. MUP is an effective alcohol policy option to reduce off-trade purchases of alcohol and should be widely considered.

Within this framework, a flexible algorithmic approach selects a set of turning points for each state, computes distances between them, and determines whether each state is in (or over) a first or second surge. Then, appropriate distances between normalized time series are used to further analyze the relationships between case trajectories on a month-by-month basis. Our algorithm shows that 31 states are experiencing second surges, while 4 of the 10 largest states are still in their first surge, with case counts that have never decreased. This analysis can aid in highlighting the most and least successful state responses to COVID-19.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02068v1.pdf,19

The crystallographic structures of 3CLpro (PDB: 6LU7) and RdRp (PDB 6ML7) were used in virtual screening of 50000 chemical compounds obtained from the CAS Antiviral COVID19 database using 3D-similarity search and standard molecular docking followed by ranking and selection of compounds based on their binding affinity, computational techniques for the sake of details on the binding interactions, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction; we report three 4-(morpholin-4-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine derivatives; two compounds (2001083-68-5 and 2001083-69-6) with optimal binding features to the active site of the main protease and one compound (833463-19-7) with optimal binding features to the active site of the polymerase for further consideration to fight COVID-19. The structural stability and dynamics of lead compounds at the active site of 3CLpro and RdRp were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Essential dynamics demonstrated that the three complexes remain stable during simulation of 20 ns, which may be suitable candidates for further experimental analysis. As the identified leads share the same scaffold, they may serve as promising leads in the development of dual 3CLpro and RdRp inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

It was hypothesized that lockdown would be associated with increased sleep duration. METHODS: Outcomes were changes in bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration in the pandemic compared to before. Logistic regression was applied to evaluate the effects of age and covariates on outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 845 questionnaires completed from May 1 to June 10, 2020 were analyzed (45.8% female; age 3-17 years). During the pandemic, 23.1% of preschoolers, 46.2% of school-age children, and 89.8% of adolescents were going to bed after 10 p.m. on weekdays compared to 7.1%, 9.4%, and 57.1% respectively before the pandemic, with these proportions being higher on weekends. Likewise, 42.5% of preschoolers, 61.3% of school-age children, and 81.2% of adolescents were waking after 8 a.m. on weekdays (11.6%, 4.9%, and 10.3%, before) with these proportions being greater on weekends. Sleep duration did not change in 43% of participants on weekdays and in 46.2% on weekends. The 14-17 years group had fourfold increased odds for longer sleep duration on weekdays (p < .01), and children aged 6-13 years had twofold increased odds for longer sleep duration on weekends relative to the 3-5 years age group (p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Although lockdown was associated with later bedtime and wake time, this shift did not alter sleep duration in more than 40% of children. Yet, compared to preschoolers, high school-aged children were more likely to sleep more on weekdays and primary school children on weekends.","Kaditis, Athanasios G; Ohler, Adrienne; Gileles-Hillel, Alex; Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Gozal, David; Bruni, Oliviero; Aydinoz, Secil; Cortese, Rene; Kheirandish-Gozal, Leila",Pediatr Pulmonol,,19

The 21st century appears no longer an exception, with the trend continued with escalated fear of SARS coronavirus in 2002 and further concern of influenza H5N1 in 2003. A novel influenza virus created the first pandemic of the 21st century, the pandemic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus, MERS-CoV in 2012. A novel coronavirus ""SARS-CoV-2"" (and the disease COVID-19) emerged suddenly, causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatality rate. This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out? Endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to infect naïve, as well as individual with pre-existing immunity. Continuous monitoring is strongly advisable, not only to the newly infected individuals, but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as re-infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population.","Biswas, Asim; Bhattacharjee, Uttaran; Chakrabarti, Alok Kumar; Tewari, Devendra Nath; Banu, Hasina; Dutta, Shanta",Crit Rev Microbiol,,19

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of transports of subjects with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from sending hospitals to tertiary care hospitals in Boston. Follow-up data were obtained for patients transported between March 1st and April 20th, 2020. RESULTS: Of 254 charts identified, 250 patients were transported. Nine patients (3.5%) had cardiac arrest prior to transport. Twenty-nine (11.6%) had hypotension, 22 (8.8%) had a critical desaturation, and 4 (1.6%) had both en route. Hospital follow-up data were available for 189 patients. Of those intubated during their hospitalization, 44 (25.0%) had died, 59 (33.5%) had been extubated, and 13 (17.6%) had been discharged alive. For the subgroup with prior cardiac arrest, follow-up data available for 6. Of these 6, 2 died and 4 (66.7%) have been discharged alive. CONCLUSIONS: Few patients with COVID-19 had an adverse event in transport. The in-hospital mortality rate was 25%, with a 33.5% extubation rate. Patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest prior to transport had a 66.7% discharge rate among those transported to consortium hospitals.","Frakes, Michael A; Richards, Jeremy B; Cocchi, Michael N; Cohen, Ari; Cohen, Jason E; Dargin, James; Friedman, Franklin D; Kaye, Adam S; Rettig, Jordan S; Seethala, Raghu; Wilcox, Susan R",J Intensive Care Med,,19

As long as the COVID-19 pandemic is ever on the rise, the psychological pandemic of the disease is on the rise, too. The high prevalence of COVID-19 has further increased physicians' work pressure. Patients' needs are not met adequately by physicians. It seems essential to use aids to monitor patients' needs and serve them properly. Thus, in the present research, suggestions are made on how to evaluate patients' physical and psychological conditions during the treatment via a mobile application. Methods and Analysis: The present research is a randomized, two parallel-group, controlled trial. One-hundred-twelve inpatients diagnosed with the coronavirus will be assigned randomly to the control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, a mobile application will be provided to educate patients, establish two-way interactions between patients and care providers and record patients' symptoms. Those in the control group will receive the usual care. The primary outcome is the change to the depression anxiety stress scales-21 (DASS-21) score from the baseline to 2 weeks after discharge from hospital. It will be measured at the baseline, at the time of discharge, and two weeks later.

The overarching aim of this study was therefore to assess the available evidence on the clinical effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the profiles of liver chemistries and coagulation in COVID-19 diagnosed patients. We considered all study designs including epidemiological and observational that reported liver function test abnormalities in patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Medline, Embase databases and Google Scholar as well as relevant reviews were searched to identify appropriate studies from inception to 31st of August 2020. We calculated the pooled mean with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) through a random-effect model meta-analysis. A total of 35 studies with 10,692 participants were considered for the review from which 23 studies with sufficient quantitative data were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean for liver enzymes and coagulation parameters did not significantly change in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and remained within normal range. Notwithstanding potential bias from confounding factors in interpretation of data in this review, findings from the observational studies and case reports suggest that COVID-19 does not appear to have a significant impact on the transaminases or total bilirubin levels of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further controlled studies and larger sample size observational studies are needed with adequate reporting of other liver function parameters are warranted.","Bzeizi, Khalid; Abdulla, Maheeba; Mohammed, Nafeesa; Alqamish, Jehad; Jamshidi, Negar; Broering, Dieter",Sci Rep,,19

A month later, there was an intensive outbreak inception. Indeed, epidemiologists and virologists forecasted that the peak of the crisis would be in three months and disappear by the end of the fourth month. However, the virus contagion's healing, prediction, and diagnosis continue to pose critical challenges. In this study, the central objective was to engage in COVID-19 analysis to discern its general diagnosis index via artificial intelligence (AI) application. The motivation was to steer improvements in how accurately the disease could be diagnosed and allow for timely clinical interventions. The sample entailed 85 undiagnosed persons and 32 diagnosed individuals. The research context was in Zhejiang province. To screen the important indexes, four AI technology types were employed. To deal with the problem, some of the feature selection methods that were employed included recursive feature elimination, Gradient boosted feature selection, and the multi-objective decomposition ensemble optimizer (ARMED). In the results, it was noted that out of 18 indexes that were achieved in relation to coronavirus diagnosis, those that matched with the 2019 China virus diagnosis clinical guide included Amyloid-A in the laboratory, 2019 novel coronavirus RNA, Eosinophil rate, Eosinophil count, and white blood cells (WBC). Overall, the method developed was accurate relative to COVID-19 prediction and diagnosis, upon which the rate of confirmed diagnosis could be improved and pave the way for timely clinical interventions.","Husein, Ismail; Noerjoedianto, Dwi; Sakti, Muhammad; Jabbar, Abeer Hamoodi",Syst.

292024,Ocular delivery of CRISPR/Cas genome editing components for treatment of eye diseases,2020,"An ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, whose regression curves are a set of solution curves for some ODEs, poses a challenge in parameter estimation. The challenge, due to the frequent absence of analytic solutions and the complicated likelihood surface, tends to be more severe especially for larger models with many parameters and variables. Yang and Lee (2021) proposed a state-space model with variational Bayes (SSVB) for ODE, capable of fast and stable estimation in somewhat large ODE models. The method has shown excellent performance in parameter estimation but has a weakness of underestimation of the posterior covariance, which originates from the mean-field variational method. This paper proposes a way to overcome the weakness by using the Laplace approximation. In numerical experiments, the covariance modified by the Laplace approximation showed a high degree of improvement when checked against the covariances obtained by a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo method. With the improved covariance estimation, the SSVB renders fairly accurate posterior approximations.","Yang, Hyunjoo; Lee, Jaeyong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02949v2.pdf,19
294123,Controlling timing and location in vaccines,2020,"Members of family Coronaviridae cause a variety of diseases in birds and mammals. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs &#8804;4 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds. Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of &#8805;0.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (>28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], ±1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, ±3.70%).IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds. This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds. These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations. Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.","Mora-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Magtoto, Ronaldo; Houston, Elizabeth; Baum, David; Carrillo-Ávila, José Antonio; Temeeyasen, Gun; Zimmerman, Jeff; Piñeyro, Pablo; Giménez-Lirola, Luis",MSphere,,19

One class of solutions are symptom checkers, which have become very popular in the context of COVID-19. Traditional symptom checkers, however, are based on manually curated expert systems that are inflexible and hard to modify, especially in a quickly changing situation like the one we are facing today. That is why all COVID-19 existing solutions are manual symptom checkers that can only estimate the probability of this disease and cannot contemplate alternative hypothesis or come up with a differential diagnosis. While machine learning offers an alternative, the lack of reliable data does not make it easy to apply to COVID-19 either. In this paper we present an approach that combines the strengths of traditional AI expert systems and novel deep learning models. In doing so we can leverage prior knowledge as well as any amount of existing data to quickly derive models that best adapt to the current state of the world and latest scientific knowledge. We use the approach to train a COVID-19 aware differential diagnosis model that can be used for medical decision support both for doctors or patients. We show that our approach is able to accurately model new incoming data about COVID-19 while still preserving accuracy on conditions that had been modeled in the past. While our approach shows evident and clear advantages for an extreme situation like the one we are currently facing, we also show that its flexibility generalizes beyond this concrete, but very important, example.","Kannan, Anitha; Chen, Richard; Venkataraman, Vignesh; Tso, Geoffrey J.; Amatriain, Xavier",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03323v1.pdf,19

Older patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions have been identified as populations at risk of a severe disease course. It remains unclear at this point to what extent chronic liver diseases should be considered as risk factors, due to a shortage of appropriate studies. However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention. Thus, the challenge hepatologists are facing is to promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritise outpatient contacts, avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers, and at the same time maintain standard care for patients who require immediate medical attention.","Boettler, Tobias; Newsome, Philip N.; Mondelli, Mario U.; Maticic, Mojca; Cordero, Elisa; Cornberg, Markus; Berg, Thomas",JHEP Rep.,,19

Additionally, to investigate if there was an increase in the proportion of women undergoing mammography for diagnostic purposes, with palpable lesions. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the number of mammograms performed by the Brazilian public health services, provided by DATASUS, an open access database. Mammograms from private institutions were not included. This study compares the number of mammograms performed in 2019 and 2020, in women aged 50-69 years, stratified by month, in each federal state, and the presence of palpable lumps (physician-reported). RESULTS: In total, 1,948,471 mammograms were performed in 2019 and 1,126,688 in 2020, for the population studied. These values represent a 42% decline. Monthly, a significant decreased is observed after April 2020. The results varied slightly according to federal state; yet the entire country was affected. Rondônia was the most affected state, with 67% decline. The proportion of women presenting palpable lumps increased from 7.06% on average in 2019 to 7.94% in 2020 (OR = 1.135, 95%CI 1.125-1.145, p = 0,001). DISCUSSION: The number of mammograms performed in 2020 declined considerably. Out of the women who presented for mammogram, the proportion of palpable lumps was significantly higher in 2020. Considering the detection rate of digital mammography, the loss of 800,000 exams means 4,000 undiagnosed breast cancer cases, by the end of 2020.","Bessa, Jordana de Faria",Rev. saúde pública (Online),,19

RESULTS: No differences were seen in fitness (p = 0.6), training volume (p = 0.24) or intensity (p = 0.79) and sedentary behavior (p = 0.14) during the pandemic. Energy intake was unchanged (p = 1.0) during the pandemic, but participants consumed lower amounts of key nutrients such as fiber, vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids and potassium (p < 0.05) while consuming more alcohol (p = 0.008) and vitamin C (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has undesirable effects on nutrient and alcohol intake of Masters cyclists without impacting their training regimes, which may have adverse effects on their overall health and fitness in the long term.","Shaw, Keely A; Bertrand, Leandy; Deprez, Dalton; Ko, Jongbum; Zello, Gordon A; Chilibeck, Philip D",Nutr Health,,19
304770,Rapid generation of potent antibodies by autonomous hypermutation in yeast,2021,"Telomere length is a promising biomarker for age-associated diseases and cancer, but there are still substantial challenges to routine telomere analysis in clinics because of the lack of a simple and rapid yet scalable method for measurement. We developed the single telomere absolute-length rapid (STAR) assay, a novel high-throughput digital real-time PCR approach for rapidly measuring the absolute lengths and quantities of individual telomere molecules. We show that this technique provides the accuracy and sensitivity to uncover associations between telomere length distribution and telomere maintenance mechanisms in cancer cell lines and primary tumors. The results indicate that the STAR assay is a powerful tool to enable the use of telomere length distribution as a biomarker in disease and population-wide studies.","Luo, Yongqiang; Viswanathan, Ramya; Hande, Manoor Prakash; Loh, Amos Hong Pheng; Cheow, Lih Feng",Sci.

Since obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 in adults, children (including adolescents) with obesity might perceive themselves to be vulnerable. Using a combined quantitative and qualitative approach, we explored COVID-19 related anxiety in paediatric patients with severe obesity in the Netherlands using semi-structured telephone interviews and the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire, which had also been completed by the study population at baseline in the year prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. In total, 75 families participated in the semi-structured telephone interviews during the lockdown, April 2020. Characteristics of included patients were: median age 10.5 years (interquartile range = 7.6-15.2); 52% female; mean BMI standard deviation score 3.8 (SD = 1.0). COVID-19 related anxiety was reported for 24/75 (32%) children. The mean decrease in PedsQL score between baseline visit and COVID-19 outbreak did not differ between children for whom anxiety was reported vs those for whom it was not (mean change -10.3 ± 36.5 vs -3.3 ± 24.4, P = .54). Self-imposed strict quarantine measures were taken by 19/75 (25%) families. During follow-up, several families reported that the previous contact alleviated their anxiety. In conclusion, healthcare professionals should address possible COVID-19 related anxiety in children with severe obesity. Addressing COVID-19 related anxiety could mitigate its potential negative effects.","Abawi, Ozair; Welling, Mila S; van den Eynde, Emma; van Rossum, Elisabeth F C; Halberstadt, Jutka; van den Akker, Erica L T; van der Voorn, Bibian",Clin Obes,,19

BACKGROUND: The Global Health Security Index categorized the preparedness of 195 countries to face a biological threat on a variety of measures, producing an overall score. The United States of America and the United Kingdom were ranked 1st and 2nd most prepared in 2019. METHOD: A cross-nation comparison of the top 36 countries ranked by Global Health Security Index score using a variety of online sources, including key data about each nation's expenditure on health and the nursing workforce, and compared these with mortality data for COVID-19. RESULTS: The extent of a country's pandemic preparedness, expenditure on healthcare and magnitude of the nursing workforce does not appear to impact mortality rates at this stage of the pandemic which is something of a paradox. CONCLUSION: It is important that arrangements for dealing with future global pandemics involve a range of agencies and experts in the field, including nurse leaders. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: To achieve the best outcomes for patients, nurse leaders should be involved in policy forums at all levels of government to ensure nurses can influence health policy.","Stribling, Julian; Clifton, Andrew; McGill, George; de Vries, Kay",J Adv Nurs,,19
319314,Zn nanoparticles modified screen printed carbon electrode as a promising sensor for insulin determination,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a prominent pandemic disease that emerged in China and hurriedly stretched worldwide. There are many reports on COVID-19 associated with the amplified incidence of thrombotic events. In this review, we focused on COVID-19 coupled with the coagulopathy contributes to severe outcome inclusive of comorbidities such as venous thromboembolism, stroke, diabetes, lung, heart attack, AKI, and liver injury. Initially, the COVID-19 patient associated coagulation disorders show an elevated level of the D-dimer, fibrinogen, and less lymphocyte count such as lymphopenia. COVID-19 associated with the Kawasaki disease has acute vasculitis in childhood which further affects the vessels found all over the body. COVID-19 linked with the thrombotic microangiopathy triggers the multiple vasculitis along with the arterioles thrombosis, medium, large venous and arterial vessels mediates the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). SARS-Co-V-2 patients have reduced primary platelet production, increased destruction of the platelet, decreased circulating platelet leads to the condition of increased thrombocytopenia which contributes to the coagulation disorder. Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the coagulation disorders via increased generation of the thrombin and stops fibrinolysis further leads to hypercoagulopathy. Along with that endothelial dysfunction activates the complement system pathways and contributes to the acute and chronic inflammation via cytokine storm with the production of the cytokines and chemokines, coagulation in different organs such as lung, brain, liver, heart, kidney and further leads to multi-organ failure.","Vinayagam, Sathishkumar; Sattu, Kamaraj",Life Sci,,19

The relationships between virus infection and the mechanisms that moderate cytokine transcription are incompletely understood. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Virus infection induced Keap1 binding to the Ifnb1, Tnf, and Il6 genes. Keap1 moderated viral induction of their transcription by mechanisms that did not require Nrf2. Keap1 was required for NF-&#954;B p50 recruitment, but not for NF-&#954;B p65 or IRF3 recruitment, to these genes. Keap1 formed complexes with NF-&#954;B p50 and NF-&#954;B p65, which were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. These bimolecular fluorescence complementation complexes bound chromosomes in live cells, suggesting that Keap1 could bind chromatin in association with NF-&#954;B proteins. Keap1 was required for viral induction of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding and H3K9me2 modification at cytokine genes. G9a-GLP inhibitors counteracted transcription repression by Keap1 and enhanced Keap1 and NF-&#954;B recruitment to cytokine genes. The interrelationships among Keap1, NF-&#954;B, and G9a-GLP recruitment, activities, and transcriptional effects suggest that they form a feedback circuit, which moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription. Nrf2 counteracted Keap1 binding to cytokine genes and the recruitment of NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP by Keap1. Whereas Keap1 has been reported to influence cytokine expression indirectly through its functions in the cytoplasm, these findings provide evidence that Keap1 regulates cytokine transcription directly in the nucleus. Keap1 binds to cytokines genes upon virus infection and moderates their induction by recruiting NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP.","Burns, Veronica Elizabeth; Kerppola, Tom Klaus",J. immunol,,19

329961,Effectiveness of two intranasal vaccines for the control of bovine respiratory disease in newborn beef calves: A randomized non-inferiority multicentre field trial,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Community face mask use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has considerably differed worldwide. Generally, Asians are more inclined to wear face masks during disease outbreaks. Hong Kong has emerged relatively unscathed during the initial outbreak of COVID-19, despite its dense population. Previous infectious disease outbreaks influenced the local masking behaviour and response to public health measures. Thus, local behavioural insights are important for the successful implementation of infection control measures. This study explored the behaviour and attitudes of wearing face masks in the community during the initial spread of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. METHODS: We observed the masking behaviour of 10 211 pedestrians in several regions across Hong Kong from 1 to 29 February 2020. We supplemented the data with an online survey of 3199 respondents' views on face mask use. RESULTS: Among pedestrians, the masking rate was 94.8%; 83.7% wore disposable surgical masks. However, 13.0% wore surgical masks incorrectly with 42.5% worn too low, exposing the nostrils or mouth; 35.5% worn 'inside-out' or 'upside-down'. Most online respondents believed in the efficacy of wearing face mask for protection (94.6%) and prevention of community spread (96.6%). Surprisingly, 78.9% reused their mask; more respondents obtained information from social media (65.9%) than from government websites (23.2%). CONCLUSIONS: In Hong Kong, members of the population are motivated to wear masks and believe in the effectiveness of face masks against disease spread. However, a high mask reuse rate and errors in masking techniques were observed. Information on government websites should be enhanced and their accessibility should be improved.","Tam, V C W; Tam, S Y; Khaw, M L; Law, H K W; Chan, C P L; Lee, S W Y",Hong Kong Med J,,19
330844,Nanoscale Structural Characterization of Individual Viral Particles Using Atomic Force Microscopy Infrared Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS),2020,"RATIONALE: Chitotriosidase (CHIT1) is an enzyme secreted by activated macrophages. The role of CHIT1 in the pathogenesis of some pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary infections and pulmonary sarcoidosis was reported. The potential role of CHIT1 in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine if serum CHIT1 activity is elevated in a group of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The single-center case-control study included 40 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 associated pneumonia confirmed by high-resolution CT and 40 non-COVID-19 patients with no signs of lung damage as a control group. We compared the serum CHIT1 activity levels between the two groups. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman's ρ were used for statistical processing. RESULTS: The groups were comparable in age, sex and body mass index. The median of lung involvement percentage was 36.50% (15.0-48.0%). The median of serum CHIT1 activity level in COVID-19 patients was 42.50 U/ml (27.25-70.00) that is significantly higher than 30.00 U/ml (15.50-45.00) in the control group (U=543, p=0.013). There was no correlation between CHIT1 activity and the percentage of lung tissue damage. A moderate negative correlation between serum CHIT1 activity and the duration of illness was found (ρ=-0.502, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Present study did not confirm the interrelation between the activity of CHIT1 and the severity of lung damage. Still, due to CHIT1 taking part in cytokine release syndrome, it could be an early marker of macrophage activation in COVID-19.","Skvortsov, A.; Balakhonov, A.; Panferov, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,19

O sistema imunológico é fator determinante no combate à infecção viral e, quando atua equilibrada e eficientemente, a doença é autolimitada e benigna. Uma parcela significativa da população, porém, apresenta resposta imune exacerbada. Os indivíduos diabéticos, hipertensos, obesos e com doenças cardiovasculares, infectados pelo vírus, apresentam maior chance de progredir para formas graves. Essas doenças estão relacionadas a processos inflamatórios crônicos e disfunção endotelial. Os receptores do tipo Toll estão presentes nas células de defesa e participam da imunopatologia de doenças cardiovasculares e metabólicas, levando à produção de citocinas pró-inflamatórias quando ativados. Devido à ação viral e à hiperativação do sistema imune, estados de hiperinflamação, hiperativação plaquetária, disfunção endotelial e hipercoagulabilidade são desenvolvidos, predispondo a tromboses venosas e arteriais.

Place all contaminated instruments in the bag (eg, laryngoscope blades and handles) and close. Designate and maintain clean and dirty areas. After induction of anesthesia, wipe down all equipment and surfaces with disinfection wipes that contain a quaternary ammonium compound and alcohol. Use a top-down cleaning sequence adequate to reduce bioburden. Treat operating rooms using UV-C. (3) Decolonize patients using preprocedural chlorhexidine wipes, 2 doses of nasal povidone-iodine within 1 hour of incision, and chlorhexidine mouth rinse. (4) Create a closed lumen IV system and use hub disinfection. (5) Provide data feedback by surveillance of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) transmission. (6) To reduce the use of surgical masks and to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure, use relatively long (eg, 12 hours) staff shifts. If there are 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1-2 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases, not 8 first case starts. (7) Do 1 case in each operating room daily, with terminal cleaning after each case including UV-C or equivalent. (8) Do not have patients go into a large, pooled phase I postanesthesia care unit because of the risk of contaminating facility at large along with many staff. Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery as is done routinely in Japan. These 8 programmatic recommendations stand on a substantial body of empirical evidence characterizing the epidemiology of perioperative transmission and infection development made possible by support from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF).","Dexter, Franklin; Parra, Michelle C; Brown, Jeremiah R; Loftus, Randy W",Anesth Analg,,19

Although the focus has been initially more on the physical health during the pandemic, mental health concerns linked to the lockdown have quickly risen. This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian women's mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; p < 0.001). Psychological abuse was the most frequent type of violence (96%). Women who had experienced abuse before the lockdown were at an increased risk of violence during lockdown (p < 0.001; OR = 19.34 [8.71-43.00]). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence against women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world. It may be a sound basis for developing a more effective psychological intervention aimed at women in these regions.","Sediri, Sabrine; Zgueb, Yosra; Ouanes, Sami; Ouali, Uta; Bourgou, Soumaya; Jomli, Rabaa; Nacef, Fethi",,,19
338701,Phage Display Technique as a Tool for Diagnosis and Antibody Selection for Coronaviruses,2021,"Long-span suspension bridges are susceptible to wind loads due to their lightweight, low stiffness, and small structural damping. Recently, two large-span suspension bridges in China that closed for several months due to COVID-2019 experienced large-scale and continuous vortex-induced vibration shortly after reopening to traffic, and the traffic was closed again for safety consideration, which has aroused widespread concerns in society. To provide a reference for owners and related decision-making departments whether to restore the traffic, this article intends to explore the impact mechanism of traffic loads on the dynamic behavior of suspension bridges. First, two mechanical models for suspension bridges considering traffic loads and structural damping are proposed in this article. Then, based on the extended dynamic stiffness method, the explicit expressions of modal damping ratio in the two models are derived for the first time. Subsequently, Wittrick?Williams algorithm is employed to solve the frequency equation to obtain the modal frequency of the structure that considers the effect of traffic loads. A numerical case is studied to inspect the influence of traffic loads on the structural dynamic characteristics. Moreover, field monitoring data of accelerations of a suspension bridge are utilized to demonstrate the reasonability and accuracy of the approach proposed. Analysis shows that the theoretical results are consistent well with the measured ones, which indicates the traffic loads will affect the dynamic characteristics of the suspension bridge, thus reducing the modal frequency and increasing the modal damping ratio. Besides, the measured results further explain that the contribution of traffic loads to the structural damping is significant, which has a positive effect on preventing and eliminating vortex-induced vibration response. Some interesting and enlightening conclusions are also obtained in this article.","Dan, Danhui Yu Xuewen Han Fei Xu Bin",Structural Health Monitoring,,19
340031,NMR in target driven drug discovery: why not?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The management of the COVID-19 pandemic is hampered by long delays associated with centralised laboratory PCR testing. In hospitals, these delays lead to poor patient flow and nosocomial transmission. Rapid, accurate tests are therefore urgently needed in preparation for the next wave of the pandemic. METHODS: We did a prospective, interventional, non-randomised, controlled study of molecular point-of-care testing in patients aged 18 years or older presenting with suspected COVID-19 to the emergency department or other acute areas of Southampton General Hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK. Nose and throat swab samples taken at admission from patients in the point-of-care testing group were tested with the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel. Samples taken from patients in a contemporaneous control group were tested by laboratory PCR. The primary outcome was time to results in the full cohort. This study is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN14966673) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between March 20 and April 29, 2020, 517 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 499 were recruited to the point-of-care testing group and tested by the QIAstat-Dx Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 Panel. 555 contemporaneously identified patients were included in the control group and tested by laboratory PCR. The two groups were similar with regard to the distribution of sex, age, and ethnicity. 197 (39%) patients in the point-of-care testing group and 155 (28%) in the control group tested positive for COVID-19 (difference 11·5% [95% CI 5·8-17·2], p=0·0001). Median time to results was 1·7 h (IQR 1·6-1·9) in the point-of-care testing group and 21·3 h (16·0-27·9) in the control group (difference 19·6 h [19·0-20·3], p<0·0001). A Cox proportional hazards regression model controlling for age, sex, time of presentation, and severity of illness also showed that time to results was significantly shorter in the point-of-care testing group than in the control group (hazard ratio 4023 [95% CI 545-29â696], p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Point-of-care testing is associated with large reductions in time to results and could lead to improvements in infection control measures and patient flow compared with centralised laboratory PCR testing.

Lung transplantation is a consolidated treatment for end-stage chronic lung disease requiring significantly demanding management. Deciding whether to keep transplant programmes open during an epidemic of this size is not easy, as immunosuppressed subjects face the risk of infection and related mortality. Additionally, there is a chance for the patient's standard care process to be compromised. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report the case of a patient undergoing bilateral lung transplantation during the explosion of COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy; he died from definite early acute antibody-mediated rejection, clinically (persistent high fever, unresponsive to treatment) and radiologically mimicking viral pneumonia but persistently negative for SARS-CoV-2. DISCUSSION: The diagnosis was difficult given this atypical presentation, confounded by global scenario. Grafts were procured from a donation after circulatory death donor in an uncontrolled setting and a donor-recipient transmission was possible. Our institute became a COVID-Hospital right during the first post-transplantation days. Radiological imaging had the same features of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of lung transplantation of the COVID-19 era in Europe. Our extremely fragile patient was COVID-19 free up to the end. Donor-recipient transmission is conceivable, but the risk should be assessed with respect to waiting list mortality. Ultimately, treating COVID-19 patients can be a resource-consuming activity but we decided to keep our centre open.","Palleschi, Alessandro; Rosso, Lorenzo; Morlacchi, Letizia Corinna; Del Gobbo, Alessandro; Ramondetta, Miriam; Gori, Andrea; Blasi, Francesco; Nosotti, Mario",Int J Surg Case Rep,,19

The occurrence of ARDS in COVID 19 patients is thought to occur secondary to an exaggerated immunologic response. In this meta-analysis, we aim to comprehensively study the various levels of immunological parameters in patients with COVID 19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Database, and medRxiv with the search terms, ""COVID-19"" and ""Interleukin"". The outcome of interest was prognosis in COVID 19 patients. RESULTS: We performed meta analysis of 16 studies. Higher counts of CD4 and CD8 with Lower Levels of TNF-a, IL2R, IL6, IL8 were observed on patients with good prognosis compared to patients with poor prognosis; -0.57 (pg/mL) (-1.10, -0.04, p = 0.04), (I2 91%, p < 0.001); -579.84 (U/mL) (-930.11, -229.57, p < 0.001), (I2 96%, p < 0.001); -1.49 (pg/mL) (-1.97, -1.01, p < 0.001), (I2 94%, p < 0.001); -0.80 (pg/mL) (-1.21, -0.40, p < 0.001), (I2 79%, p < 0.001); -2.51 (pg/mL) (-3.64, -1.38, p < 0.00001), (I2 98%, p < 0.001) respectively. Meta-regression showed age and hypertension (coefficient: 1.99, and -1.57, p = 0.005, and 0.006) significantly influenced association between IL-6 and poor outcome. CONCLUSION: Elevated immune response to coronavirus occurs in COVID 19 patients.

AREAS COVERED: Authors review evidence on IL-6 and IL-6 blockade in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss the pathophysiological and prognostic roles of this cytokine and the clinical impact of pharmacological blockade of IL-6 . The material includes original articles and reviews published from March 2020 to March 2021 and searched on PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. EXPERT OPINION: IL-6 is one of the most prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased levels are recorded in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe-to-critical disease. Evidence is accumulating on the relevance of IL-6 as a prognostic marker in COVID-19. Since IL-6 is a druggable target for several inflammatory diseases, pharmacological blockers of the IL-6 signaling pathway were repurposed to blunt the abnormal SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine release. Data are limited to few randomized controlled trials that reported encouraging, though not conclusive, results, indicating the usefulness of IL-6 blockade early in the course of the disease in patients with hyperinflammation and no or limited organ damage. Further research is warranted to explore the role of IL-6 in different COVID-19 phenotypes and identify subgroups of patients who may mostly benefit from IL-6 pathway inhibition.","Potere, Nicola; Batticciotto, Alberto; Vecchié, Alessandra; Porreca, Ettore; Cappelli, Antonella; Abbate, Antonio; Dentali, Francesco; Bonaventura, Aldo",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,19

This pandemic has taxed our healthcare system and disrupted normal operations, even of lifesaving procedures like liver transplants. During these unprecedented times providers and patients are imperiled and resources for diagnosis and care may be limited. Continuing to perform resource intense advanced procedures is challenging, as is caring for patients with end-stage liver disease or patients with urgent needs for liver tumor control. Liver transplantation in particular requires critical resources like blood products and critical care beds, which are fairly limited in the COVID19 pandemic. The potential of COVID19 infections in post-transplant patients on immunosuppression and staff contacts further adds to the complexity. Therefore, transplant programs must re-evaluate the ethicality, feasibility, and safety of performing liver transplants during this pandemic.

METHODS: This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2141 people (50.8% men; 20-79 years). The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020, and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: Three of the five personal protective measures' availability significantly improved during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving; however, there is potential for improvement, especially concerning avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth.","Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Saito, Reiko; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Takamiya, Tomoko; Odagiri, Yuko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Kojima, Takako; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",Int J Infect Dis,,19

367520,A cautionary tale: Problems in the valence-CASSCF description of the ground state (X1Σ+) of BF,2020,"This study demonstrates that an adoption of a segmenting and shielding strategy could increase the scope to partially exit COVID-19 lockdown while limiting the risk of an overwhelming second wave of infection. We illustrate this using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the 'shielders'. Effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population are explored. Our study shows that the most important determinants of outcome are: (i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general and between the general and vulnerable segments; (ii) fractions of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; (iii) adherence to protective measures; and (iv) build-up of population immunity. Additionally, we found that effective measures in the shielder segment, e.g. intensive routine screening, allow further relaxations in the general population. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. This strategy has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.

370050,Nanoscale Drug Delivery Systems for Glaucoma: Experimental and In Silico Advances,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to analyze the relationship between the initial chest X-ray findings in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and eventual clinical worsening and to compare three systems of quantifying these findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed the clinical and radiological evolution of 265 adult patients with COVID-19 attended at our center between March 2020 and April 2020. We recorded data related to patients' comorbidities, hospital stay, and clinical worsening (admission to the ICU, intubation, and death). We used three scoring systems taking into consideration 6 or 8 lung fields (designated 6A, 6B, and 8) to quantify lung involvement in each patient's initial abnormal chest X-ray and to classify its severity as mild, moderate, or severe, and we compared these three systems. We also recorded the presence of alveolar opacities and linear opacities (fundamentally linear atelectasis) in the first chest X-ray with pathologic findings. RESULTS: In the &#967;2 analysis, moderate or severe involvement in the three classification systems correlated with hospital admission (p=0.009 in 6A, p=0.001 in 6B, and p=0.001 in 8) and with death (p=0.02 in 6A, p=0.01 in 6B, and p=0.006 in 8). In the regression analysis, the most significant associations were 6B with alveolar involvement (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.1.-4.7; p=0.025;) and 8 with alveolar involvement (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.01.-4.25; p=0.046). No differences were observed in the ability of the three systems to predict clinical worsening by classifications of involvement in chest X-rays as moderate or severe. CONCLUSION: Moderate/severe extension in the three chest X-ray scoring systems evaluating the extent of involvement over 6 or 8 lung fields and the finding of alveolar opacities in the first abnormal X-ray correlated with mortality and the rate of hospitalization in the patients studied. No significant difference was found in the predictive ability of the three classification systems proposed.","Petite Felipe, D J; Rivera Campos, M I; San Miguel Espinosa, J; Malo Rubio, Y; Flores Quan, J C; Cuartero Revilla, M V",Radiologia,,19

372030,Antiviral Cyanometabolites-A Review,2021,"Since its recent onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the daily lives of millions around the world. One area particularly affected is our diets, with food supply chain disruptions, media coverage of food safety issues and restaurant closures all influencing consumer dietary behaviour. Given this situation, we pose a timely question - what is the impact of the current pandemic on longer-term meat consumption patterns? This issue is pertinent given accumulating evidence that overconsumption of meat, particularly red meat, is associated with negative environmental and health outcomes. Here, we discuss how the current pandemic has already begun to shift public awareness of illnesses linked to animals and has resulted in short-term changes in patterns of meat consumption. Past zoonotic outbreaks, such as SARS and swine flu, are also referred to, and we find that these led to similar short-term reductions in meat intake, a shift in the type of meat chosen and longer-lasting impacts on consumer perceptions of the health risks associated with meat. We conclude that, if immediate changes in eating patterns as a result of COVID-19 are retained in the longer term, one possible opportunity to emerge from the current pandemic may be a shift away from overconsumption of meat, leading to potential health and environmental benefits in the longer term.","Attwood, Sophie; Hajat, Cother",Public Health Nutr,,19

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that was first described in 2019, unrelated to the commonly occurring feline coronavirus (FCoV) that is an alphacoronavirus associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has spread globally within a few months, resulting in the current pandemic. Felids have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particularly in the Western world, many people live in very close contact with their pet cats, and natural infections of cats in COVID-19-positive households have been described in several countries. In this review, the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases (ABCD), a scientifically independent board of experts in feline medicine from 11 European Countries, discusses the current status of SARS-CoV infections in cats. The review examines the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and human-to-animal transmissions, including infections in domestic and non-domestic felids, as well as mink-to-human/-cat transmission. It summarises current data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in domestic cats and the results of experimental infections of cats and provides expert opinions on the clinical relevance and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats.","Hosie, Margaret J; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Hartmann, Katrin; Egberink, Herman; Truyen, Uwe; Addie, Diane D; Belák, Sándor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Frymus, Tadeusz; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Tasker, Séverine; Thiry, Etienne; Möstl, Karin",Viruses,,19

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical records and comparison of vaginal delivery outcomes between 10 pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and 53 pregnant women without COVID-19 admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University between January 20 and March 2, 2020. Results of laboratory tests, imaging tests, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were also analyzed in neonates delivered by pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in gestational age, postpartum hemorrhage, and perineal resection rates between the two groups. There were no significant differences in birth weight of neonates and neonatal asphyxia rates between the two groups. Neonates delivered by pregnant women with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Under the premise of full evaluation of vaginal delivery conditions and strict protection measures, pregnant women with ordinary type COVID-19 can try vaginal delivery without exacerbation of COVID-19 and without increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates.","Liao, Jing; He, Xiaoyan; Gong, Qing; Yang, Lingyun; Zhou, Chunhua; Li, Jiafu",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,,19

Material and methods: A review and analysis of the available scientific materials and articles in PUBMED and ClinicalKey database dedicated to the ocular COVID-19 manifestations and the Dry eye disease along with Consensus of the Eye Surface Academy and DEWS II guidelines. Results: Dry eye syndrome is one of the most common eye conditions worldwide in a daily medical practice. The ocular manifestation of COVID can resemble DES. It is recommended that during properly conducted diagnostics, the patient should be properly classified in terms of severity of symptoms. A diet rich in vitamins and flavonoids and the use of polyunsaturated fatty acids are common recommendations for both DES treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This in particular validates the appropriate use of these substances. Fatty acids such as α-lipoic or γ-linolenic are proven to have the most effective anti-inflammatory properties. Conclusions: In the era of pandemia the ocular manifestation and transmission of COVID has to be always considered since every patient could be a coronavirus carrier. Many substances might be effective in treating and relieving symptoms of dry eye syndrome and coronavirus prevention.

Here we profiled the humoral response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by measuring immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgM, and IgG against nucleocapsid and spike proteins, along with IgM and IgG antibodies against receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and total neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). We tested 279 plasma samples collected from 176 COVID-19 patients who presented and enrolled at different stages of their disease. Plasma dilutions were optimized and based on the data, a single dilution of plasma was used. The mean absorbance at 450 nm was measured for Ig levels and NAbs were measured using geometric mean titers. We demonstrate that more severe cases have a late-onset in the humoral response compared to mild/moderate infections. All the antibody titers continue to rise in patients with COVID-19 over the disease course. However, these levels are mostly unrelated to disease severity. The appearance time and titers of NAbs showed a significant positive correlation to the antibodies against spike protein. Our results suggest the late onset of antibody response as a risk factor for disease severity, however, there is a limited role of antibody titers in predicting disease severity of COVID-19.","Ren, Lili; Zhang, Lulu; Chang, De; Wang, Junwen; Hu, Yongfeng; Chen, Hong; Guo, Li; Wu, Chao; Wang, Conghui; Wang, Yingying; Wang, Ying; Wang, Geng; Yang, Siyuan; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Sharma, Lokesh; Wang, Linghang; Zhang, Dingyu; Wang, Jianwei",Commun Biol,,19

385469,Brighton Collaboration Viral Vector Vaccines Safety Working Group (V3SWG) standardized template for collection of key information for benefit-risk assessment of live-attenuated viral vaccines,2020,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification, influencing transcript fate and function in uninfected and virus-infected cells. Installation of m6A by the nuclear RNA methyltransferase METTL3 occurs cotranscriptionally; however, the genomes of some cytoplasmic RNA viruses are also m6A-modified. How the cellular m6A modification machinery impacts coronavirus replication, which occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, is unknown. Here we show that replication of SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and a seasonal human ß-coronavirus HCoV-OC43, can be suppressed by depletion of METTL3 or cytoplasmic m6A reader proteins YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 and by a highly specific small molecule METTL3 inhibitor. Reduction of infectious titer correlates with decreased synthesis of viral RNAs and the essential nucleocapsid (N) protein. Sites of m6A modification on genomic and subgenomic RNAs of both viruses were mapped by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (meRIP-seq). Levels of host factors involved in m6A installation, removal, and recognition were unchanged by HCoV-OC43 infection; however, nuclear localization of METTL3 and cytoplasmic m6A readers YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 increased. This establishes that coronavirus RNAs are m6A-modified and host m6A pathway components control ß-coronavirus replication. Moreover, it illustrates the therapeutic potential of targeting the m6A pathway to restrict coronavirus reproduction.","Burgess, Hannah M; Depledge, Daniel P; Thompson, Letitia; Srinivas, Kalanghad Puthankalam; Grande, Rebecca C; Vink, Elizabeth I; Abebe, Jonathan S; Blackaby, Wesley P; Hendrick, Alan; Albertella, Mark R; Kouzarides, Tony; Stapleford, Kenneth A; Wilson, Angus C; Mohr, Ian",Genes Dev,,19

Such outbreaks would certainly be catastrophic for some of the best-ranked health systems and would be more catastrophic in countries with more fragile health systems. Accordingly, the World Health Organization and other organizations have been appealing to donor countries to support a rapid response plan. The primary objectives of this response plan are to appeal for funds from donors and to distribute these funds to the most affected countries based on the requirements. METHODS: In this study, we developed a mathematical model to provide initial insights into the efficient and equitable distribution of urgent funds to high-priority countries. Three phases were proposed for the construction of this mathematical model. In the first phase, the final epidemic sizes in all the target countries were predicted by using three epidemiological models. In the second phase, the urgent requirements for each country were estimated in parallel with the estimates issued by the humanitarian response plan, based on the size of the epidemic and several other factors. In the third and final phase, a multi-objective optimization model was proposed. The first objective was to maximize the funds from donors to cover all the requirements. The second objective was to minimize the unmet demands by ensuring a fair distribution of the urgent funds based on the requirements of the target countries. RESULTS: Predictions of the basic reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes were calculated for all target countries. The urgent requirements were estimated, and the requirements issued by the humanitarian response plan for all target countries were also considered. Moreover, a proposed response plan for the distribution network was demonstrated. Donors must provide urgent funds exceeding US$ 2,608,084,209 to cover at least 40 % of each target country's requirements. Overall, results demonstrate the importance of an urgent and fair distribution of funds to the target countries to overcome the outbreak of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid responses by donor countries to humanitarian appeals will facilitate the immediate and fair distribution of relief supplies to the poorest countries. This distribution may help to support health systems, restrain the spread of COVID-19, and prevent an unlimited catastrophe.","Hezam, Ibrahim M",ISA Trans,,19

The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors for myocardial injury and death and to investigate whether myocardial injury has an independent association with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a single-centre cohort study including consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 undergoing chest CT on admission. Myocardial injury was defined as high-sensitivity troponin I > 20 ng/L on admission. A total of 332 patients with a median follow-up of 12 days were included. There were 68 (20.5%) deaths; 123 (37%) patients had myocardial injury. PA diameter was higher in patients with myocardial injury compared with patients without myocardial injury [29.0 (25th-75th percentile, 27-32) mm vs. 27.7 (25-30) mm, <iP > < 0.001). PA diameter was independently associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury [adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.19, P = 0.01] and death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17, P = 0.01]. Compared with patients without myocardial injury, patients with myocardial injury had a lower prevalence of a CAC score of zero (25% vs. 55%, <iP > < 0.001); however, the CAC score did not emerge as a predictor of myocardial injury by multivariable logistic regression. Myocardial injury was independently associated with an increased risk of death by multivariable Cox regression (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.27-3.96, P = 0.005). Older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lower PaO<sub2>/FiO<sub2> ratio on admission were other independent predictors for both myocardial injury and death. CONCLUSIONS: An increased PA diameter, as assessed by chest CT, is an independent risk factor for myocardial injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Myocardial injury is independently associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of death. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: The present study identifies myocardial injury as a clinically relevant independent risk factor for death in the short term in a population of hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 outside of China undergoing chest computed tomography for suspected pneumonia on admission.The study also provides novel insights into the risk factors for myocardial injury, showing that an increased pulmonary artery diameter, assessed by chest computed tomography, is an independent predictor of myocardial injury as well as of mortality, suggesting that pulmonary circulation dysfunction is a pivotal pathological event with cardiac implications in COVID-19.","Ferrante, Giuseppe; Fazzari, Fabio; Cozzi, Ottavia; Maurina, Matteo; Bragato, Renato; D039,; Orazio, Federico; Torrisi, Chiara; Lanza, Ezio; Indolfi, Eleonora; Donghi, Valeria; Mantovani, Riccardo; Liccardo, Gaetano; Voza, Antonio; Azzolini, Elena; Balzarini, Luca; Reimers, Bernhard; Stefanini, Giulio G; Condorelli, Gianluigi; Monti, Lorenzo",Cardiovasc. res,,19

While, at the initial outbreak, the treatment of patients had focused on the respiratory symptoms, many diverse clinical manifestations of the disease have to date been reported. However, the complete course of the disease has not yet been fully clarified. In particular, several reports from the real-world clinical practice have highlighted the noxious effects of SARS-CoV-2 on skeletal muscles. In this brief review, we summarized the main current findings about muscular and neuromuscular damages that may be triggered by the virus or by the drugs used to treat COVID-19. Moreover, we underlined the need of attentive care and vigilance for patients with neuro-muscular disorders, who may be particularly susceptible to infection and at increased risk for severe COVID-19.","De Giorgio, Maria Rita; Di Noia, Stefania; Morciano, Cinzia; Conte, Diana",Acta Myol,,19

409926,Photo-catalyzed TiO2 inactivates pathogenic viruses by attacking viral genome,2021,"Currently, we witness the severe spread of the pandemic of the new Corona virus, COVID-19, which causes dangerous symptoms to humans and animals, its complications may lead to death. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is considered the current state-of-the-art image classification technique, it needs massive computational cost for deployment and training. In this paper, we propose an improved hybrid classification approach for COVID-19 images by combining the strengths of CNNs (using a powerful architecture called Inception) to extract features and a swarm-based feature selection algorithm (Marine Predators Algorithm) to select the most relevant features. A combination of fractional-order and marine predators algorithm (FO-MPA) is considered an integration among a robust tool in mathematics named fractional-order calculus (FO). The proposed approach was evaluated on two public COVID-19 X-ray datasets which achieves both high performance and reduction of computational complexity. The two datasets consist of X-ray COVID-19 images by international Cardiothoracic radiologist, researchers and others published on Kaggle. The proposed approach selected successfully 130 and 86 out of 51 K features extracted by inception from dataset 1 and dataset 2, while improving classification accuracy at the same time. The results are the best achieved on these datasets when compared to a set of recent feature selection algorithms. By achieving 98.7%, 98.2% and 99.6%, 99% of classification accuracy and F-Score for dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively, the proposed approach outperforms several CNNs and all recent works on COVID-19 images.","Sahlol, Ahmed T; Yousri, Dalia; Ewees, Ahmed A; Al-Qaness, Mohammed A A; Damasevicius, Robertas; Elaziz, Mohamed Abd",Sci Rep,,19

413149,Poly-l-lysine Glycoconjugates Inhibit DC-SIGN-mediated Attachment of Pandemic Viruses,2021,"Driving under the influence (DUI) is illegal in the United States because a driver's mental and motor skills can be seriously impaired by alcohol or drugs. Consequently, DUI violators' involvement in severe crashes is high. Motivated by the spatial and temporal nature of traffic crashes, this study introduces an integrated spatio-temporal approach to analyzing highway safety data. Specifically, this study estimates Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) models to understand the consequences of DUI in crashes. GTWR can theoretically outperform traditional regression methods by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity that may be related to the location and time of a crash. Using Southeast Michigan crash data, this study finds that DUI is associated with a 25% higher likelihood of injury in a crash. The association between injury severity and DUI varies significantly across space and time. From the spatial aspect, DUI crashes in rural or small-town areas are more likely to cause injuries than urban crashes. From the temporal aspect, different times are associated with varying relationships between injury severity and DUI. If focusing on DUI crashes in late nights and early mornings, on Fridays, the entire northeast part from Clinton Charter Township to Port Huron is associated with severer injuries than other regions including Detroit's urban area and its south. On Mondays, the DUI crashes in the northwest are also more likely to cause severe injuries. The methodology introduced in this study takes advantage of modern computational tools and localized crash/inventory data. This method offers researchers and practitioners an opportunity to understand highway safety outcomes in great spatial and temporal details and customize safety countermeasures for specific locations and times such as saturation patrols.","Liu, Jun; Li, Xiaobing; Khattak, Asad J",Accid Anal Prev,,19

Nurses, anesthesiologists and surgeons in the operating room of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from January 2020 to March 2020 were selected as the research objects. The psychological state of medical staff was investigated by SAS and PSS-14. As on February 29, 2020, 301 valid questionnaires and one invalid questionnaire were received. The survey showed that there was anxiety but no moderate or severe anxiety in the occupational behavior of operating room medical staff, while some medical staff had a certain degree of psychological pressure (P < 0.05). The present survey suggested that medical staff was under anxiety and pressure in different degrees in the operation room because of novel coronavirus contamination during occupational activities, much attention is required to improve mental health of medical professionals and to reduce their negative emotions.","Lian, Ailing; Jin, Dexiang; Zhang, Tong; Wu, Yonghui",,,19
415195,Nanomaterials against pathogenic viruses: greener and sustainable approaches,2020,"This paper examines the ‘anti-lockdown’ protests in the US beginning in April 2020 through the concepts of necropolitics (Mbembe) and microfascism (Deleuze and Guattari). The paper argues that these protests are examples of what it coins, necropopulism. What if the libertarian, hyper-individualistic, and reactionary populism we witness in these and other manifestations (e.g. mass shooters, alt-right street fights) are both fixated on their identity as a ‘people,’ yet simultaneously indifferent to their own persistence? Examining the anti-lockdown and anti-masking protests and their precursors, the paper argues that microfascism is infused with homi-suicidal aesthetics. The essay seeks to refine our analysis when it comes to the cultural (necro)politics of this ‘downsurgency,’ in which decline accelerates rapidly and might even be detached, ultimately, from its own demise. This analysis matters if we are to antagonize this necrotic force, not simply through a battle of ideas but by preventing a fascist social body from being fully activated and mobilized.","Bratich, Jack",Cultural Studies,,19

Future decision-making policies require consistent data on the management and prognosis of the older patients (> 70 years old) with COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Characteristics, management, and prognosis of critically ill old patients (> 70 years) were extracted from the international prospective COVID-ICU database. A propensity score weighted-comparison evaluated the impact of intubation upon admission on Day-90 mortality. RESULTS: The analysis included 1199 (28% of the COVID-ICU cohort) patients (median [interquartile] age 74 [72-78] years). Fifty-three percent, 31%, and 16% were 70-74, 75-79, and over 80 years old, respectively. The most frequent comorbidities were chronic hypertension (62%), diabetes (30%), and chronic respiratory disease (25%). Median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3 (2-3). Upon admission, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 154 (105-222). 740 (62%) patients were intubated on Day-1 and eventually 938 (78%) during their ICU stay. Overall Day-90 mortality was 46% and reached 67% among the 193 patients over 80 years old. Mortality was higher in older patients, diabetics, and those with a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio upon admission, cardiovascular dysfunction, and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission. In propensity analysis, early intubation at ICU admission was associated with a significantly higher Day-90 mortality (42% vs 28%; hazard ratio 1.68; 95% CI 1.24-2.27; p < 0·001). CONCLUSION: Patients over 70 years old represented more than a quarter of the COVID-19 population admitted in the participating ICUs during the first wave. Day-90 mortality was 46%, with dismal outcomes reported for patients older than 80 years or those intubated upon ICU admission.","Dres, Martin; Hajage, David; Lebbah, Said; Kimmoun, Antoine; Pham, Tai; Béduneau, Gaëtan; Combes, Alain; Mercat, Alain; Guidet, Bertrand; Demoule, Alexandre; Schmidt, Matthieu",Ann Intensive Care,,19

The rapid transition from in-person to remote learning dramatically altered student-instructor interactions and ushered in a new set of educational challenges. Despite recent publications by experienced researchers that address the impacts of remote instruction on undergraduate research at a holistic level, we currently lack evidence for successful implementation of best practices in a remote research environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, to enhance remote scientific experiences and improve the skills of young biologists facing uncertain challenges in their future academic careers, we make nine recommendations for best practices in maintaining quality undergraduate research experiences, especially for computationally adapted projects, during online learning periods in times of crisis. Based on our experience participating in an undergraduate Stanford Summer Research Program that was conducted entirely remotely during the summer of 2020, we describe nine recommendations for best practices that institutions, faculty mentors, and undergraduate mentees can execute to maintain a high quality of biological research. Further elucidating the ways in which distance learning can be improved at the undergraduate research level will offer insights into making the most out of remote biological research in the months and years ahead.","Parrington, B.

425659,Validation of Inactivation Methods for Arenaviruses,2021,"This work aims to assess the efficacy of x-ray quality assurance tests undertaken on fluoroscopy units in the UK. Information was gathered on the results of image quality tests recommended by the reports of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, and those additionally undertaken by medical physics departments. The assessment of efficacy considers the frequency with which a test result breaches the remedial level or other relevant threshold where applicable. The third quartile of those results exceeding the remedial level or threshold is used to estimate the severity of such a breach in terms of potential impact on patient dose and image quality. A risk assessment approach is then used to recommend to what degree, if any, the test should be included in an on-going test regimen. Data was analysed from 469 testing sessions to 337 unique fluoroscopy units throughout the UK. Across all tests, the rate with which the remedial level was exceeded varied from 0 - 10.6%, with severity ranging from little or none to major degradation to image quality or significant increase on population dose. Where possible, the data has also been used to produce representative ranges for the results of image quality tests. These could be useful as an up to date comparator for those sites considering the purchase of or commissioning new equipment. Overall the results indicate a wide range for the efficacy of those tests undertaken at present; this can be used to review local test protocols and to inform future changes to national guidance in the UK. The results also highlight some tests where measurement technique varies significantly throughout the UK, making any valid comparison difficult. This may indicate a need for further guidance on how best to undertake these tests.","Shaw, Daniel; Worrall, Mark; Baker, Chris; Charnock, Paul; Fazakerley, Jason; Honey, Ian; Iball, Gareth Richard; Koutalonis, Manthos; Price, Mandy; Renaud, Caroline; Rose, Amy; Wood, Tim J",Phys. med. biol,,19

Following the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several immunotherapies were applied to modulate the immune responses of the affected patients. In this review, we aimed to describe the role of the immune system in response to COVID-19. We also provide a systematic review to collate and describe all published reports of the using immunotherapies, including convalescent plasma therapy, monoclonal antibodies, cytokine therapy, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and intravenous immunoglobulin and their important outcomes in COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A thorough search strategy was applied to identify published research trials in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and EMBASE from Dec 1, 2019, to May 4, 2020, for studies reporting clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with immunotherapies along with other standard cares. KEY FINDINGS: From an initial screen of 80 identified studies, 24 studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of immunotherapies for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, including convalescent plasma therapy (33 patients), monoclonal antibodies (55 patients), interferon (31 patients), mesenchymal stem cell therapy (8 patient), and immunoglobulin (63 patients). Except for nine severe patients who died after treatment, most patients were recovered from COVID-19 with improved clinical symptoms and laboratory assessment. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the available evidence, it seems that treatment with immunotherapy along with other standard cares could be an effective and safe approach to modulate the immune system and improvement of clinical outcomes.","Mansourabadi, Amir Hossein; Sadeghalvad, Mona; Mohammadi-Motlagh, Hamid-Reza; Rezaei, Nima",Life Sci,,19

432471,The Coevolution of Cellularity and Metabolism Following the Origin of Life,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To present the COVID-19-associated GBS, the prototypic viral-triggered autoimmune disease, in the context of other emerging COVID-19-triggered autoimmunities, and discuss potential concerns with ongoing neuroimmunotherapies. METHODS: Eleven GBS cases in four key COVID-19 hotspots are discussed regarding presenting symptoms, response to therapies and cross-reactivity of COVID spike proteins with nerve glycolipids. Emerging cases of COVID-19-triggered autoimmune necrotizing myositis (NAM) and encephalopathies are also reviewed in the context of viral invasion, autoimmunity and ongoing immunotherapies. RESULTS: Collective data indicate that in this pandemic any patient presenting with an acute paralytic disease-like GBS, encephalomyelitis or myositis-even without systemic symptoms, may represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion. In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19-bearing gangliosides and peripheral nerve glycolipids was addressed. Elevated Creatine Kinase (>10,000) is reported in 10% of COVID-19-infected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19-triggered NAM is an overlooked entity. Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity. Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics (i.e. eculizumab) were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation. Although COVID-19 infection, like most other viruses, can potentially worsen patients with pre-existing autoimmunity, there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection.","Dalakas, Marinos C",,,19

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to investigate internet search behaviors related to COVID-19 and examine the circulation of infodemic monikers through two platforms-Google and Instagram-during the current global pandemic. METHODS: We have defined infodemic moniker as a term, query, hashtag, or phrase that generates or feeds fake news, misinterpretations, or discriminatory phenomena. Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags, we explored internet search activities and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 6, 2020. We investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and information related to the adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We computed the average peak volume with a 95% CI for the monikers. RESULTS: The top six COVID-19-related terms searched in Google were ""coronavirus,"" ""corona,"" ""COVID,"" ""virus,"" ""corona virus,"" and ""COVID-19."" Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google. The monikers ""coronavirus ozone,"" ""coronavirus laboratory,"" ""coronavirus 5G,"" ""coronavirus conspiracy,"" and ""coronavirus bill gates"" were widely circulated on the internet. Searches on ""tips and cures"" for COVID-19 spiked in relation to the US president speculating about a ""miracle cure"" and suggesting an injection of disinfectant to treat the virus. Around two thirds (n=48,700,000, 66.1%) of Instagram users used the hashtags ""COVID-19"" and ""coronavirus"" to disperse virus-related information. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19, and numerous infodemic monikers continue to circulate on the internet. Based on our findings, we hope to encourage mass media regulators and health organizers to be vigilant and diminish the use and circulation of these infodemic monikers to decrease the spread of misinformation.","Rovetta, Alessandro; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth",J Med Internet Res,,19

To minimize the risk of health problems, visitors should be able to access information on the health care systems of the places they visit. Most short-term overseas visitors are young adults. Although they are not very likely to get sick from noncommunicable diseases, they are at high risk for injury and often experience stomach ailments, fever, or nausea when travelling. The objective of this study is to evaluate culturally and linguistically appropriate health information on preventive health behaviours and the health care system in Japan. We will examine the level of satisfaction of overseas visitors to Japan with health care-related educational materials using a five-minute digital game named Sa-Chan Japan.

We will contact overseas visitors who have either visited or wish to visit Japan from the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia. The participants will fill out a self-administered questionnaire online in the first quarter of 2021. We will determine the participants' levels of satisfaction with the CSQ-8 (8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire). We will analyse the median score of the overseas visitors with both the Wilcoxon rank-sum and the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Our protocol of randomized controlled trials follows the SPIRIT guidelines. DISCUSSION: Our research will utilize unique digital education strategies in a game that promotes health and safety among overseas visitors to Japan. We believe the results of this study will be useful in overcoming the current challenges regarding pretravel health requirements for overseas visitors worldwide.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 (n = 280) among K-12 students at a research school in North Central Florida. Bivariate analysis and logistic and multinomial logistic regression models were used to examine socio-demographic and knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) predictors of indicators of anxiety-related, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD)-related symptoms. Outcomes (anxiety, OCD, and depressive related symptoms) were measured by indices generated based on reported symptoms associated with each psychosocial outcome. RESULTS: Loss of household income was associated with increased risk for all three index-based outcomes: depressive symptoms [aOR = 3.130, 95% CI = (1.41-6.97)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 2.531, 95%CI = (1.154-5.551)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 2.90, 95%CI = (1.32-6.36)]. Being female was associated with being at higher risk for depressive symptoms [aOR = 1.72, 95% CI = (1.02-2.93)], anxiety-related symptoms [aOR = 1.75, 95% CI = (1.04-2.97)], and OCD-related symptoms [aOR = 1.764, 95%CI = (1.027-3.028)]. Parental practices protective against COVID-19 were associated with children being at higher risk of depressive symptoms [aOR = 1.55, 95% CI = (1.04-2.31)]. Lower school level was associated with children being at higher risk of anxiety-related and OCD-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, schools should prioritize mental health interventions that target younger, female students, and children of families with income loss. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 through school closure may exacerbate negative psychosocial health outcomes in children, thus school administrators should move quickly to target those at greatest risk.","McKune, Sarah L; Acosta, Daniel; Diaz, Nick; Brittain, Kaitlin; Beaulieu, Diana Joyce-; Maurelli, Anthony T; Nelson, Eric J",BMC Public Health,,19

Transforming clinical text into structured data can enable large-scale research studies with electronic health records (EHR) data. Natural language processing (NLP) can be used for text information retrieval, reducing the need for labor-intensive chart review. Here we present an application of NLP to large-scale analysis of medical records at 2 large hospitals for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Our study goal was to develop an NLP pipeline to classify the discharge disposition (home, inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing inpatient facility [SNIF], and death) of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 based on hospital discharge summary notes. METHODS: Text mining and feature engineering were applied to unstructured text from hospital discharge summaries. The study included patients with COVID-19 discharged from 2 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital) between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The data were divided into a training set (70%) and hold-out test set (30%). Discharge summaries were represented as bags-of-words consisting of single words (unigrams), bigrams, and trigrams. The number of features was reduced during training by excluding n-grams that occurred in fewer than 10% of discharge summaries, and further reduced using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization while training a multiclass logistic regression model. Model performance was evaluated using the hold-out test set. RESULTS: The study cohort included 1737 adult patients (median age 61 [SD 18] years; 55% men; 45% White and 16% Black; 14% nonsurvivors and 61% discharged home). The model selected 179 from a vocabulary of 1056 engineered features, consisting of combinations of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The top features contributing most to the classification by the model (for each outcome) were the following: ""appointments specialty,"" ""home health,"" and ""home care"" (home); ""intubate"" and ""ARDS"" (inpatient rehabilitation); ""service"" (SNIF); ""brief assessment"" and ""covid"" (death). The model achieved a micro-average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.98) and average precision of 0.81 (95% CI 0.75-0.84) in the testing set for prediction of discharge disposition. CONCLUSIONS: A supervised learning-based NLP approach is able to classify the discharge disposition of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This approach has the potential to accelerate and increase the scale of research on patients' discharge disposition that is possible with EHR data.","Fernandes, Marta; Sun, Haoqi; Jain, Aayushee; Alabsi, Haitham S; Brenner, Laura N; Ye, Elissa; Ge, Wendong; Collens, Sarah I; Leone, Michael J; Das, Sudeshna; Robbins, Gregory K; Mukerji, Shibani S; Westover, M Brandon",JMIR Med Inform,,19

METHODS: Since February 21, 2020, staff in high risk areas such as the ED and ICU of King Hamad University Hospital have worn N95 masks when doing aerosol-generating procedures to protect against the novel coronavirus 2019. At that time, without education enablers or resources that could be directly translated into practice, the hospital's Pressure Injury Prevention Committee explored and created a stepwise process to protect the skin under these masks. This procedure was developed over time and tested to make sure that it did not interfere with the effectiveness of the N95 mask seal. RESULTS: Skin protection was achieved by repurposing a readily available silicone border dressing cut into strips. This was tested on 10 volunteer staff members of various skin types and both sexes who became part of this evidence generation project. Oxygen saturation values taken before and after the 4-hour wear test confirmed that well-fitted facial protection did not compromise the mask seal, but rather improved it. An added advantage was increased comfort with less friction as self-reported by the staff. An educational enabler to prevent MDRPI from N95 mask wear was an important additional resource for the staff. CONCLUSIONS: This creative and novel stepwise process of developing a safe skin protection method by which staff could apply a repurposed silicone border dressing beneath an N95 mask was largely effective and aided by the creation of the enabler.","Smart, Hiske; Opinion, Francis Byron; Darwich, Issam; Elnawasany, Manal Aly; Kodange, Chaitanya",Adv. skin wound care,,19

We explored the inclusion of pregnant women in treatment trials of COVID-19 by reviewing ten international clinical trial registries at two timepoints in 2020. We identified 155 COVID-19 treatment studies of non-biological drugs for the April 7-10, 2020 timepoint, of which 124 (80%) specifically excluded pregnant women. The same registry search for the July 10-15, 2020 timepoint, yielded 722 treatment studies, of which 538 (75%) specifically excluded pregnant women. We then focused on studies that included at least one of six drugs (remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon beta, corticosteroids, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin) under evaluation for COVID-19. Of 176 such studies, 130 (74%) listed pregnancy as an exclusion criterion. Of 35 studies that evaluated high-dose vitamin treatment for COVID-19, 27 (77%) excluded pregnant women. Despite the surge in treatment studies for COVID-19, the proportion excluding pregnant women remains consistent. Exclusion was not well justified as many of the treatments being evaluated have no or low safety concerns during pregnancy.

447643,A Focus on Vaccines Against Viruses,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019, also known as Covid-19, is an infectious disease that has infected more than nineteen million people all around the world. This virus is a member of coronavirus family but it is the most mortal one. It has named as 2019-nCoV by World Health Organization(WHO) after Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) discovered a new coronavirus from a swab sample of a patient. As we know this pandemic started December 2019 in China, and it is still spreading and causing deaths all around the world. In this paper, we aimed to estimate the right size of epidemic. For that purpose, we chose 10 countries, which are affected by, and still fighting with this disease, to forecast the upcoming death rates by using the previous week deaths. These 10 countries are Argentina, Austria, Brazil, France, Iran, Italy, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States of America. We used the death data of WHO with assumption that data is accurate. For this estimation, firstly. we used the assumption that the reported death delay distributed according to a gamma distribution. Then, we used a binomial distribution for assumption of deaths. This binomial formula led us to find a posterior distribution which is an extension of Bayes' theorem for death ratio. Lastly, we compared our estimations with real data.","Hincal, E.; Kaymakamzade, B.; Suren, F. N.; Gokbulut, N.",International Conference on Analysis and Applied Mathematics,,19

METHODS: 105 COVID-19 patients were enrolled as the disease group. 197 non-COVID-19 patients served as the control group. Magnetic chemiluminescent immunoassay (MCLIA) was used to detect the IgM and IgG. RESULTS: The peak of positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgM was about 1 week earlier than that of IgG. It reached to peak within 15-21 days and then began a slowly decline. The positive rates of IgG were increased with the disease course and reached the peak between 22 and 39 days. The differences in sensitivity of the three detection modes (IgM, IgG, and IgM + IgG) were statistically significant. The largest group of test cases (illness onset 15-21 days) showed that the positive rate of IgG was higher than IgM. Also, the sensitivity of IgM combined with IgG was higher than IgM or IgG. IgM and IgG were monitored dynamically for 16 patients with COVID-19, the results showed that serological transformation of IgM was carried out simultaneously with IgG in seven patients, which was earlier than IgG in four patients and later than IgG in five patients. CONCLUSION: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG is very important to determine the course of COVID-19. Nucleic acid detection combined with serum antibody of SARS-CoV-2 may be the best laboratory indicator for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the phrase and predication for prognosis of COVID-19.","Wu, Li-Xiang; Wang, Hui; Gou, Dan; Fu, Gang; Wang, Jing; Guo, Bian-Qin",J Clin Lab Anal,,19
449951,To the Editor,2020,"Background: It is twenty years since the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) defined quality in healthcare, as comprising six domains: person-centredness, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, safety and equity. Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of ""service-oriented"" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or ""kin-centred care"" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what ""person-centredness"" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","Lachman, P.; Batalden, P.; Vanhaecht, K.",,,19

In response, the US government, utilizing the Defense Production Act ordered the development of 200,000 ventilators from 11 different manufacturers. These ventilators have different capabilities and it is not evident whether all are able to support COVID-19 patients. RESEARCH QUESTION: Evaluate ventilator requirements for affected COVID-19 patients, assess the clinical performance of current SNS ventilators employed during the pandemic, and finally compare ordered ventilators functionality based on COVID-19 patient needs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Current published literature, publicly available documents, and lay press articles were reviewed by a diverse team of disaster experts. Data was assembled into tabular format which formed the basis for analysis and future recommendations. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients often develop severe hypoxemic acute respiratory failure and ARDS requiring high levels of ventilator support. Current SNS ventilators were unable to fully support all COVID-19 patients, and only about half of newly ordered ventilators have the capacity to support the most severely affected patients; ventilators with less capacity for providing high level support are still of significant value in caring for many patients. INTERPRETATION: Current SNS ventilators and those on order are capable of supporting most but not all COVID-19 patients. Technologic, logistic, and educational challenges encountered from current SNS ventilators are summarized, with potential next generation SNS ventilator updates offered.

454474,On Demand Attachment and Detachment of rac-2-Br-DMNPA Tailoring to Facilitate Chemical Protein Synthesis,2021,"Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) that offer protection from particulates are deployed in different workplace environments. Usage of PAPRs by healthcare workers is rapidly increasing; these respirators are often considered the best option in healthcare settings, particularly during public health emergency situations, such as outbreaks of pandemic diseases. At the same time, lack of user training and certain vigorous work activities may lead to a decrease in a respirator's performance. There is a critical need for real-time performance monitoring of respiratory protective devices, including PAPRs. In this effort, a new robust and low-cost real-time performance monitor (RePM) capable of evaluating the protection offered by a PAPR against aerosol particles at a workplace was developed. The new device was evaluated on a manikin and on human subjects against a pair of condensation nuclei counters (P-Trak) used as the reference protection measurement system. The outcome was expressed as a manikin-based protection factor (mPF) and a Simulated Workplace Protection Factor (SWPF) determined while testing on subjects. For the manikin-based testing, the data points collected by the two methods were plotted against each other; a near-perfect correlation was observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.997. This high correlation is particularly remarkable since RePM and condensation particle counter (CPC) measure in different particle size ranges. The data variability increased with increasing mPF. The evaluation on human subjects demonstrated that RePM prototype provided an excellent Sensitivity (96.3% measured on human subjects at a response time of 60 sec) and a Specificity of 100%. The device is believed to be the first of its kind to quantitatively monitor PAPR performance while the wearer is working; it is small, lightweight, and does not interfere with job functions.","Grinshpun, Sergey A; Corey, Jonathan; Yermakov, Michael; Wu, Bingbing; Strickland, Kevin T; Bergman, Michael; Zhuang, Ziqing",J Occup Environ Hyg,,19

Reports from earlier in the pandemic suggested that patients hospitalized for COVID19 are at particularly high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). To estimate the incidences of PE during hospitalization for COVID19, we performed a rigorous systematic review of published literature. METHODS: We searched for case series, cohort studies and clinical trials from December 1, 2019 to July 13, 2020 that reported the incidence of PE among consecutive patients who were hospitalized for COVID19 in ICUs and in non-ICU hospital wards. To reflect the general population of hospitalized COVID19 patients, we excluded studies in which subject enrollment was linked to the clinical suspicion for venous thromboembolism (VTE). RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis. The combined random effects estimate of PE incidence among all hospitalized COVID19 patients was 7.1% (95% CI: 5.2%, 9.1%). Studies with larger sample sizes reported significantly lower PE incidences than smaller studies (r2 = 0.161, p = 0.036). The PE incidence among studies that included 400 or more patients was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.7%, 4.6%). Among COVID19 patients admitted to ICUs, the combined estimated PE incidence was 13.7% (95% CI: 8.0%, 20.6%). The incidence of ICU-related PE also decreased as the study sample sizes increased. The single largest COVID19 ICU study (n = 2215) disclosed a PE incidence of 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7%, 3.0%). CONCLUSION: PE incidences among hospitalized COVID19 patients are much lower than has been previously postulated based on smaller, often biased study reports. The incidence of ""microthrombosis,"" leading to occlusion of microscopic blood vessels, remains unknown.","Gallastegui, Nicolas; Zhou, Jenny Y; Drygalski, Annette von; Barnes, Richard F W; Fernandes, Timothy M; Morris, Timothy A",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,19

DESIGN: A regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) analysis of daily service-level activity. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Mental healthcare data were extracted from 10 UK providers. OUTCOME MEASURES: Daily (weekly for one site) deaths from all causes, referrals and discharges, inpatient care (admissions, discharges, caseloads) and community services (face-to-face (f2f)/non-f2f contacts, caseloads): Adult, older adult and child/adolescent mental health; early intervention in psychosis; home treatment teams and liaison/Accident and Emergency (A&E). Data were extracted from 1 Jan 2019 to 31 May 2020 for all sites, supplemented to 31 July 2020 for four sites. Changes around the commencement and lifting of COVID-19 'lockdown' policy (23 March and 10 May, respectively) were estimated using a RDiT design with a difference-in-difference approach generating incidence rate ratios (IRRs), meta-analysed across sites. RESULTS: Pooled estimates for the lockdown transition showed increased daily deaths (IRR 2.31, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.87), reduced referrals (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70) and reduced inpatient admissions (IRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.83) and caseloads (IRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.91) compared with the pre lockdown period. All community services saw shifts from f2f to non-f2f contacts, but varied in caseload changes. Lift of lockdown was associated with reduced deaths (IRR 0.42, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.66), increased referrals (IRR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60) and increased inpatient admissions (IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42) and caseloads (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12) compared with the lockdown period. Site-wide activity, inpatient care and community services did not return to pre lockdown levels after lift of lockdown, while number of deaths did. Between-site heterogeneity most often indicated variation in size rather than direction of effect. CONCLUSIONS: MH service delivery underwent sizeable changes during the first national lockdown, with as-yet unknown and unevaluated consequences.","Bakolis, Ioannis; Stewart, Robert; Baldwin, David; Beenstock, Jane; Bibby, Paul; Broadbent, Matthew; Cardinal, Rudolf; Chen, Shanquan; Chinnasamy, Karthik; Cipriani, Andrea; Douglas, Simon; Horner, Philip; Jackson, Caroline A; John, Ann; Joyce, Dan W; Lee, Sze Chim; Lewis, Jonathan; McIntosh, Andrew; Nixon, Neil; Osborn, David; Phiri, Peter; Rathod, Shanaya; Smith, Tanya; Sokal, Rachel; Waller, Rob; Landau, Sabine",BMJ Open,,19

One of the ways that can be done to stop its spreading is to break the spreading chain of the virus by detecting and doing quarantine. X-Ray imaging can be used as an alternative in detecting COVID-19. X-Ray is considered able to describe the condition of the lungs for COVID-19 suspected patients and can be a supporting tool for clinical diagnosis. In this study, we propose a residual based deep learning approach for COVID-19 detection using chest X-Ray images. Evaluation is carried out to determine the performance of the proposed method in the form of precision, recall, F1 and accuracy. Experiments results show that our proposed method provides precision, recall, F1 and accuracy respectively 0.98, 0.95, 0.97 and 99%.

Here we characterize antibody responses in a cohort of participants recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection with follow up to 6 months. We measure IgA, IgM, and IgG binding and avidity to viral antigens and assess neutralizing antibody responses over time. Further, we correlate the effect of fever, gender, age, and time since symptom onset with antibody responses. We observe that total anti-S trimer, anti-RBD, and anti-NP IgG are relatively stable over 6 months of follow-up and anti-S and anti-RBD avidity increases over time, and that fever is associated with higher levels of antibodies. However, neutralizing antibody responses rapidly decay and are strongly associated with declines in IgM levels. Thus, while total antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may persist, functional antibody, particularly IgM, is rapidly lost. These observations have implications for the duration of protective immunity following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Harrington, Whitney E; Trakhimets, Olesya; Andrade, Daniela V; Dambrauskas, Nicholas; Raappana, Andrew; Jiang, Yonghou; Houck, John; Selman, William; Yang, Ashton; Vigdorovich, Vladimir; Yeung, Winnie; Haglund, Micaela; Wallner, Jackson; Oldroyd, Alyssa; Hardy, Samantha; Stewart, Samuel W A; Gervassi, Ana; Van Voorhis, Wes; Frenkel, Lisa; Sather, D Noah",Cell Rep Med,,19

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the human cell after binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptors, that are present in various organs. The involvement of the respiratory system is common and may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Besides the involvement of respiratory system other systems like cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and central nervous are not uncommon. In-depth understanding of the pathophysiological basis of organs and systems involvement and disease progression aids in the safe and effective management of the COVID-19 patients. It also helps to guide future well-designed clinical trials, which is the need of time. This review aims to explore the current understanding of pathophysiological basis of various organ system involvement in patients with COVID-19, that can have relevance for patient management and future research.

Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human &#945;7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human &#945;7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.","Lagoumintzis, George; Chasapis, Christos T; Alexandris, Nikolaos; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Tzartos, Socrates; Eliopoulos, Elias; Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos",Food Chem Toxicol,,19

We assessed tubular 20-HETE contribution to hypertension by generating transgenic mice overexpressing the CYP4A12-20-HETE synthase (PT-4a12 mice) under the control of the proximal tubule (PT)-specific promoter, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). 20-HETE levels in the kidney cortex of male (967±210 vs. 249±69 pg/mg protein), but not female (121±15 vs. 92±11 pg/mg protein) PT-4a12 mice, showed a 2.5-fold increase compared to WT. Renal cortical Cyp4a12 mRNA and CYP4A12 protein in male, but not female PT-4a12 mice increased by 2-3-fold compared to WT. Male PT-4a12 mice displayed elevated BP (142±1 vs. 111±4 mmHg, p<0.0001), whereas BP in females PT-4a12 mice was not significantly different from WT (118±2 vs. 117±2 mmHg; p=0.98). In male PT-4a12 mice, BP decreased when transitioned from a control salt (0.4%) to a low-salt diet (0.075%) from 135±4 to 120±6 mmHg (p<0.01) and increased to 153±5 mmHg (p<0.05) when placed on a high-salt diet (4%). Female PT-4a12 mice did not show changes in BP on either low- or high-salt diet. In conclusion, the expression of Cyp4a12 driven by the PEPCK promoter is sex-specific probably due to its X-linkage. The salt-sensitive hypertension seen in PT-4a12 male mice suggests a potential anti-natriuretic activity of 20-HETE that needs to be further explored.","Gilani, Ankit; Agostinucci, Kevin; Pascale, Jonathan V; Hossain, Sakib; Kandhi, Sharath; Pandey, Varunkumar; Garcia, Victor; Nasjletti, Alberto; Laniado Schwartzman, Michal","Am. j. physiol, regul. integr. comp. physiol",,19

The aim of this review was to identify the frequency and microbial etiologies of bacterial coinfections that are present upon admission to the hospital and that occur during hospitalization for COVID-19. We found that bacterial coinfections were present in <4% of patients upon admission and the yield of routine diagnostic tests for pneumonia was low. When bacterial coinfections did occur, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens and atypical bacteria were rare. Although uncommon upon admission, bacterial infections frequently occurred in patients with prolonged hospitalization, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and S. aureus were common pathogens. Antibacterial therapy and diagnostic testing for bacterial infections are unnecessary upon admission in most patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but clinicians should be vigilant for nosocomial bacterial infections.","Westblade, Lars F; Simon, Matthew S; Satlin, Michael J",Trends microbiol,,19
510338,Endolysosomal Ca2+ signaling in cardiovascular health and disease,2021,"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the worst global threats in the 21st century since World War II. This pandemic has led to a worldwide economic recession and crisis due to lockdown. Biomedical researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and premier institutes throughout the world are claiming that new clinical trials are in progress. During the severe phase of this disease, mechanical ventilators are used to assist in the management of outcomes; however, their use can lead to the development of pneumonia. In this context, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes can serve as an immunomodulation treatment for COVID-19 patients. Exosomes possess anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory properties that can be explored in an effort to improve the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Currently, only one ongoing clinical trial (NCT04276987) is specifically exploring the use of MSC-derived exosomes as a therapy to treat SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia. The purpose of this review is to provide insights of using exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells in management of the co-morbidities associated with SARS-CoV-2-infected persons in direction of improving their health outcome. There is limited knowledge of using exosomes in SARS-CoV-2; the clinicians and researchers should exploit exosomes as therapeutic regime.","Raghav, Alok; Khan, Zeeshan Ahmad; Upadhayay, Viabhav Kumar; Tripathi, Prashant; Gautam, Kirti Amresh; Mishra, Brijesh Kumar; Ahmad, Jamal; Jeong, Goo-Bo",,,19

EBM+ is a development of EBM that systematically considers mechanistic studies alongside association studies. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore examples of the importance of mechanistic evidence to coronavirus research. METHODS: We have reviewed the mechanistic evidence in four major areas that are relevant to the management of COVID-19. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: (a) Assessment of combination therapy for MERS highlights the need for systematic assessment of mechanistic evidence. (b) That hypertension is a risk factor for severe disease in the case of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that altering hypertension treatment might alleviate disease, but the mechanisms are complex, and it is essential to consider and evaluate multiple mechanistic hypotheses. (c) Confidence that public health interventions will be effective requires a detailed assessment of social and psychological components of the mechanisms of their action, in addition to mechanisms of disease. (d) In particular, if vaccination programmes are to be effective, they must be carefully tailored to the social context; again, mechanistic evidence is crucial. We conclude that coronavirus research is best situated within the EBM+ evaluation framework.","Aronson, Jeffrey K; Auker-Howlett, Daniel; Ghiara, Virginia; Kelly, Michael P; Williamson, Jon",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice (Online),,19
513883,MR1-restricted T cells with MAIT-like characteristics are functionally conserved in the pteropid bat Pteropus alecto,2020,"Despite the availability of a highly effective yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccine, outbreaks of yellow fever frequently occur in Africa and South America with significant mortality, highlighting the pressing need for antiviral drugs to manage future outbreaks. To support the discovery and development of antiviral drugs against YFV, we characterized a panel of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the three YFV structural proteins and five non-structural proteins and demonstrated these antibody reagents in conjunction with viral RNA metabolic labeling, double-stranded RNA staining and membrane floatation assays as powerful tools for investigating YFV polyprotein processing, replication complex formation, viral RNA synthesis and high throughput discovery of antiviral drugs. Specifically, the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein can be analyzed by Western blot assays. The predominant nuclear localization of NS5 protein as well as the relationship between intracellular viral non-structural protein distribution and foci of YFV RNA replication can be revealed by immunofluorescence staining and membrane flotation assays. Using an antibody against YFV NS4B protein as an example, in-cell western and high-content imaging assays have been developed for high throughput discovery of antiviral agents. A synergistic antiviral effect of an YFV NS4B-targeting antiviral agent BDAA and a NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (Sofosbuvir) was also demonstrated with the high-content imaging assay. Apparently, the antibody-based assays established herein not only facilitate the discovery and development of antiviral agents against YFV, but also provide valuable tools to dissect the molecular mechanism by which the antiviral agents inhibit YFV replication.","Gao, Zhao; Zhang, Lin; Ma, Julia; Jurado, Andrea; Hong, Seon-Hui; Guo, Ju-Tao; Rice, Charles M; MacDonald, Margaret R; Chang, Jinhong",Antiviral Res,,19

One year after it became a pandemic, the current COVID-19 situation in Brazil is an example of how the impacts of a pandemic are beyond health outcomes and how health, social, and political actions are intertwined. Objectives: We aimed to provide an overview of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, from a social and political point of view, and to discuss the perspectives from now on. Methods: This is a narrative review using official, scientific (PubMed, Medline, and SciELO databases) and publicly available data. Press articles were also used that contain important information not found in these databases. Findings: We address the impacts of COVID-19 in different regions of Brazil, on indigenous populations, health care workers, and how internal social contrasts impacted the pandemics advance across the country. We also discuss key points that culminated in the countrys failed management of the COVID-19 spread, such as poor management of the public health care system, disparities between public and private health care infrastructure, lack of mass testing and viral spread tracking, lack of preparedness and planning to implement strict isolation and social distancing measures, and, most importantly, political instability, a deteriorating Health Ministry and sabotaging attitudes of the countrys president, including anti-scientific actions, underplaying COVID-19 severity, spreading and powering fake news about the pandemic, promoting knowingly inefficient medications for COVID-19 treatment, and interference in collective health policies, including the countrys vaccination plan. Conclusions: After one year of COVID-19 and a disastrous management of the disease, Brazil has more than 11 million cases, 270,000 deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the world, most of which could have been avoided and can be credited to negligence of municipal, state, and federal authorities, especially President Jair Messias Bolsonaro. Unfortunately, the country is an example of what not to do in a pandemic setting. Key Points: One year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Brazil had the second higher number of cases and deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to the disease. Lack of massive testing, non-stringent and ineffective collective health policies, poor management of the public health care system, and political instability were the main drivers of the countrys flawed management of the COVID-19 advancement. Anti-science and sabotaging actions by government had a pivotal role in the countrys current situation. Brazil has a large territory and is marked by social contrasts among different regions and states, which showed contrasting data regarding the impact caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 databases and data sharing are important to provide an overview of epidemiological aspects of the disease; however, Brazil lacks standardization in these datasets.","Boschiero, Matheus Negri; Palamim, Camila Vantini Capasso; Ortega, Manoela Marques; Mauch, Renan Marrichi; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",Ann Glob Health,,19

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory infection, and the pathogenesis and clinical features resemble with those of Nazla-e-Wabaiya (influenza) and Zatul Riya (pneumonia) which were well described many years ago in Unani text such as high-grade fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, running nose, dry cough, respiratory distress, alternate and small pulse, asthenia, foul smell from breath, insomnia, frothy stool, syncope, coldness in both upper and lower extremities, etc. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global emergency pandemic. Unani scholars like Hippocrates (370-460 BC), Galen (130-200 AD), Rhazes (865-925 AD), and Avicenna (980-1037 AD) had described four etiological factors for Amraz-e-Waba viz., change in quality of air, water, Earth, and celestial bodies, accordingly mentioned various preventive measures to be adopted during epidemics such as restriction of movement, isolation or ""quarantena"", and fumigation with loban (Styrax benzoin W.

The COVID-19 is highly transmissible and deadly. Despite ""tracking the call"" and carefully examining patient contact, it is not yet clear how the virus is transmitted from one sick person to another. Why it is so transmissible? Can viruses be transmitted through speech and exhalation aerosols? How far can these aerosols go? How long can an aerosol containing a virus stay in the air? Is the virus amount in these aerosols enough to lead to an infection? There is no consensus on aerosols' role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Findings show that SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission is possible. Therefore, to effectively reduce SARS-CoV-2, precautionary control strategies for aerosol transfer should be considered.

We aimed to an evaluated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) efficiency of nasopharyngeal swabs stored in viral transport medium (VTM) in different temperatures. Ninety swabs taken into VTM were analyzed at the first hour, then divided into two groups with similar numbers of positive and negative samples. Positive samples of each group were also subgrouped according to Fam CT values as low CT (<25), medium CT (25–32), and high CT (32–38) groups. One group was stored at 4°C, while the other was stored at room temperature, PCR analyses were repeated every 24 h for 5 days and on Day 12. There was a total of 30 positive samples (12 low CT, 11 medium CT, and 7 high CT). The CT values of both groups remained unchanged in first 3 days while the CT values of the room temperature group increased after the third day. All of the positive samples remained positive in both groups for the first 5 days. On the 12th day, the total number of positives decreased to 8 in the room temperature group and 11 in the 4°C groups. All the low CT samples remained positive in both groups. In conclusion, it is safe to store positive samples in room temperature for up to 5 days. Only samples with high viral loads remain positive for 12 days, regardless of whether stored at room temperature or 4°C. Negative samples don't turn to invalid if stored in VTM.","Yilmaz Gulec, Elif; Cesur, Nevra P.; Yesilyurt Fazlioğlu, Gonca; Kazezoğlu, Cemal",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260086/,19

Crown ethers readily bind metallic and organic cations, including positively charged amino acid side chains. We elucidated the crystal structures of several protein-crown ether co-crystals grown in the presence of 18-crown-6. We then employed biophysical methods and molecular dynamics simulations to compare these complexes with the corresponding apoproteins and with similar complexes with ring-shaped low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycols. Our studies show that crown ethers can modify protein surface behavior dramatically by stabilizing either intra- or intermolecular interactions. Consequently, we propose that crown ethers can be used to modulate a wide variety of protein surface behaviors, such as oligomerization, domain–domain interactions, stabilization in organic solvents, and crystallization.","Lee, Cheng-Chung; Maestre-Reyna, Manuel; Hsu, Kai-Cheng; Wang, Hao-Ching; Liu, Chia-I; Jeng, Wen-Yih; Lin, Li-Ling; Wood, Richard; Chou, Chia-Cheng; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Wang, Andrew H-J",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201405664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25287606/,19

These conditions are especially important in educational buildings, where students, teachers and staff spend long periods of the day and are vulnerable to these factors. Recently, indoor air quality has been a focus of attention to ensure that disease transmission in these spaces is minimised. In order to increase the knowledge in this field, experimental tests have been carried out to characterise the impact of natural ventilation strategies on indoor air quality and the acoustic environment. This study has evaluated three ventilation scenarios in four different classrooms in buildings of the University of Granada, considering different window and door opening configurations. Ventilation rates were estimated using the CO(2) Decay Method, and background noise recordings were made in each classroom for acoustic tests. Results show that specific natural ventilation strategies have a relevant impact that is worth considering on the background noise in indoor spaces. In this sense ventilation rates provided by the different configurations varied between 3.7 and 39.8 air changes per hour (ACH) and the acoustic tests show a background noise ranging from 43 to 54 dBA in these scenarios. Consequently, managers and teachers should take into account not only the ACH, but also other collateral impacts on the indoor environmental conditions such as the thermal comfort or the acoustic environment.","de la Hoz-Torres, María L.; Aguilar, Antonio J.; Ruiz, Diego P.; Martínez-Aires, María Dolores",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577328/,19
592648,The present and future of solution NMR in investigating the structure and dynamics of channels and transporters,2013-08-01,"The spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection across the world accelerated the adoption of social media as the platform of choice for real-time dissemination of medical information. Though this allowed useful clinical anecdotes and links to the latest articles related to COVID-19 to quickly circulate, the broad use of social media also highlighted the power of platforms such as Twitter to spread misinformation. Trainees in medicine have important perspectives to share on social media but may be reluctant to do so for a variety of reasons. There is a need to provide guidance on how to safely engage with social media as well as move the conversation forward in a meaningful way. In this manuscript, we suggest a stepwise approach for trainee social media engagement that integrates the modified Bloom’s Taxonomy for social media with Aristotle’s principles of rhetoric. This provides trainees with guidance on making ethical, logical, and persuasive cases on social media when creating, consuming, promoting, and discussing content produced by themselves or others.","Santhosh, Lekshmi; Carroll, Christopher L.; Seam, Nitin",Ats Scholar,https://doi.org/10.34197/ats-scholar.2020-0155ps; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409413/,19

As a response to this, large-scale systematic replications of the literature have emerged as a way to assess the problem empirically. The Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative is one such effort, aimed at estimating the reproducibility of Brazilian biomedical research. Its goal is to perform multicentre replications of a quasi-random sample of at least 60 experiments from Brazilian articles published over a 20-year period, using a set of common laboratory methods. In this article, we describe the challenges of managing a multicentre project with collaborating teams across the country, as well as its successes and failures over the first two years. We end with a brief discussion of the Initiative’s current status and its possible future contributions after the project is concluded in 2021.","Neves, Kleber; Carneiro, Clarissa FD; Wasilewska-Sampaio, Ana Paula; Abreu, Mariana; Valério-Gomes, Bruna; Tan, Pedro B; Amaral, Olavo B",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111750/; https://doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760200328,19

However, most of the current clinical studies are observational studies, and there are few well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Hence, we designed a multicentre RCT to assess the advantages and efficacy of acupuncture for post-stroke epilepsy (PSE). Methods/Design: This is a two-arm, parallel, participants-blinded and assessor-blinded and multicentre RCT. A total of 120 patients with PSE aged from 18 to 75 years will be randomly assigned to two groups (routine treatment plus acupuncture group and routine treatment plus sham acupuncture group) at a 1:1 ratio. The participants will perform acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment three times a week and be ongoing 8-week treatment. The primary endpoint is the proportion of seizure-free patients. A safety profile will be established. We will record adverse events for the safety evaluation. Discussion: The study will provide high-quality clinical evidence on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for treating patients with epilepsy after stroke.

They seem to invariably disappoint, the written equivalent of empty calories. This paper asks: is this true? If so, how so? And why? To answer, a selection method produced a modest subset of current, topical white papers to analyze – hence this article as a fragment on recent, topical white papers. A simple discourse analysis was performed to find if there was a broad pattern the documents followed, and if a more analysis was required. A clue as to why this pattern prevailed came from criticisms of prognostications about the current pandemic (as of this writing), leading to a return to the reports: who authored them, and how they are situated in political-sociological terms in LIS discourse? The concluding findings fit with earlier analyses, suggesting much about prestige in LIS and how that is maintained, how practices are (and are not) formulated – and what that has to do with the white papers.","Buschman, John",The Journal of Academic Librarianship,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170985/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099133320301063; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099133320301063,19
593437,Assessing the Evidence Supporting Fruit Bats as the Primary Reservoirs for Ebola Viruses,2015-08-13,"BACKGROUND: The first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brazil were diagnosed in February 2020. Our Emergency Department (ED) was designated as a COVID-19 exclusive service. We report our first 500 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: From 14 March to 16 May 2020, we enrolled all patients admitted to our ED that had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirate PCR. The outcomes included hospital discharge, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death, among others. RESULTS: From 2219 patients received in the ED, we included 506 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that 333 patients were discharged home (65.9%), 153 died (30.2%), and 20 (3.9%) remained in the hospital. A total of 300 patients (59.3%) required ICU admission, and 227 (44.9%) needed invasive ventilation. The multivariate analysis found age, number of comorbidities, extension of ground glass opacities on chest CT and troponin with a direct relationship with all-cause mortality, whereas dysgeusia, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker and number of lymphocytes with an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality CONCLUSIONS: This was a sample of severe patients with COVID-19, with 59.2% admitted to the ICU and 41.5% requiring mechanical ventilator support. We were able to ascertain the outcome in majority (96%) of patients. While the overall mortality was 30.2%, mortality for intubated patients was 55.9%. Multivariate analysis agreed with data found in other studies although the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker as a protective factor could be promising but would need further studies.

ReMindCare is a smartphone app that has been systematically implemented in a first episode of psychosis program (FEPP) for patients with early psychosis since 2018. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of ReMindCare after 19 months of use in the clinic and varying use by individual patients. METHODS: The integration of the ReMindCare app into the FEPP started in October 2018. Patients with early psychosis self-selected to the app (ReMindCare group) or treatment as usual (TAU group). The outcome variables considered were adherence to the intervention and number of relapses, hospital admissions, and visits to urgent care units. Data from 90 patients with early psychosis were analyzed: 59 in the ReMindCare group and 31 in the TAU group. The mean age of the sample was 32.8 (SD 9.4) years, 73% (66/90) were males, 91% (83/90) were White, and 81% (74/90) were single. RESULTS: Significant differences between the ReMindCare and TAU groups were found in the number of relapses, hospitalizations, and visits to urgent care units, with each showing benefits for the app. Only 20% (12/59) of patients from the ReMindCare group had a relapse, while 58% (18/31) of the TAU patients had one or more relapses (χ(2)=13.7, P=.001). Moreover, ReMindCare patients had fewer visits to urgent care units (χ(2)=7.4, P=.006) and fewer hospitalizations than TAU patients (χ(2)=4.6, P=.03). The mean of days using the app was 352.2 (SD 191.2; min/max: 18-594), and the mean of engagement was 84.5 (SD 16.04). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first eHealth intervention that has preliminarily proven its benefits in the real-world treatment of patients with early psychosis.

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis was demonstrated by the presence of viral particles in the placenta identified by immunohistochemistry. As we excluded all possible etiological factors for non-immunologic hydrops fetalis, we believe that the fetal consequences of our case are related to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

This could be explained by a combination of environmental (exposure), immunological (previous infection), epigenetic, and genetic factors. Aiming to identify genetic factors involved in immune response in symptomatic COVID-19 as compared to asymptomatic exposed individuals, we analyzed 83 Brazilian couples where one individual was infected and symptomatic while the partner remained asymptomatic and serum-negative for at least 6 months despite sharing the same bedroom during the infection. We refer to these as “discordant couples”. We performed whole-exome sequencing followed by a state-of-the-art method to call genotypes and haplotypes across the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. The discordant partners had comparable ages and genetic ancestry, but women were overrepresented (65%) in the asymptomatic group. In the antigen-presentation pathway, we observed an association between HLA-DRB1 alleles encoding Lys at residue 71 (mostly DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*04:01) and DOB*01:02 with symptomatic infections and HLA-A alleles encoding 144Q/151R with asymptomatic seronegative women. Among the genes related to immune modulation, we detected variants in MICA and MICB associated with symptomatic infections. These variants are related to higher expression of soluble MICA and low expression of MICB. Thus, quantitative differences in these molecules that modulate natural killer (NK) activity could contribute to susceptibility to COVID-19 by downregulating NK cell cytotoxic activity in infected individuals but not in the asymptomatic partners.","Castelli, Erick C.; de Castro, Mateus V.; Naslavsky, Michel S.; Scliar, Marilia O.; Silva, Nayane S.

Identifying PCR-based viruses is a well-known and relatively stable protocol. Unfortunately, the high mutation rates may lead to widespread changes in viral nucleic acid sequences, and so using specific primers for PCR can be recommended. In this study, we evaluated the power of a conventional RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the five set primer sets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The five genomic regions of the Coronavirus SARS-2 virus including Nucleocapsids (N), Envelope (E), RNA depended RNA Polymerase (RdRp), ORF1ab and Spike (S) were selected for primer designing. A conventional RT-PCR was performed to compare sensitivity, specificity and other analytical characteristics of primers designed against two Real Time PCR commercial kits. RESULTS: The result of the comparative analysis showed that the ORF1ab, N and RdRp primers had a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value higher than other primers. A significant difference in the analytical sensitivity between the studied primer sets in RT-PCR kits was observed. CONCLUSION: In this study, the ORF1ab, Nucleocapsid and RdRp regions have the best primers for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between different genes that have been suggested.","Mollaei, Hamid Reza; Afshar, Abass Aghaei; Kalantar-Neyestanaki, Davood; Fazlalipour, Mehdi; Aflatoonian, Behnaz",Iran J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32685113/,19
598716,Characterizing transcriptional regulatory sequences in coronaviruses and their role in recombination,2020-06-21,"In managing the COVID-19 pandemic, several compelling narratives seem to have played a significant role in the decision-making processes regarding which risk mitigation and management measures to implement. Many countries were to a large extent unprepared for such a situation, even though predictions about a significant probability for a pandemic to occur existed, and national governments of several countries often acted in an uncoordinated manner, which resulted in many inconsistencies in the disaster risk reduction processes. Limited evidence has also made room for strategic narratives meant to persuade the public of the chosen set of actions, even though the degree of uncertainty regarding the outcomes of these was high, further complicating the situation. In this article, we assume a normative standpoint regarding rhapsodic decision making and suggest an integrated framework for a more elaborated decision analysis under the ambiguity of how to contain the virus spread from a policy point of view, while considering epidemiologic estimations and socioeconomic factors in a multi-stakeholder-multi-criteria context based on a co-creative work process for eliciting attitudes, perceptions, as well as preferences amongst relevant stakeholder groups. The framework, applied in our paper on Romania for demonstrative purposes, is used for evaluating mitigation measures for catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 situation, to mobilize better response strategies for future scenarios related to pandemics and other hazardous events, as well as to structure the production and analysis of narratives on the current pandemic effects.","Ekenberg, Love; Mihai, Adriana; Fasth, Tobias; Komendantova, Nadejda; Danielson, Mats",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.583706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968871/,19

Subjects and methods. – Self-administered mail questionnaires survey to 308 SARS patients after discharging from hospital. Both patients and their families were asked about symptoms related to various neuropsychiatric domains, and the questions covered both acute and convalescent phases. Results. – Among the 102 (33%) valid replies, 65% had strong symptoms in convalescent phase as indicated by GHQ28 score ≥ 5. In multiple linear regression analysis, use of pulse steroid and total dosages of pulse steroid during hospitalisation were predictive for anxiety-depression, psychosis and behavioural symptoms in acute phase, the effects persisted in convalescent phase. Disease severity had direct correlation with symptoms in all neuropsychiatric domains at acute phase and anxiety-depression and cognition at convalescent phase. Health care workers had more neuropsychiatric complaints in both phases. Severity of symptoms, corticosteroids and social factors explained about half of the variances (R(2) = 52) in anxiety-depression at acute phase and 33% at convalescent phase.

To describe the results of a virtual and in-person accompaniment strategy based on person-centered care of patients hospitalized for suspected or confirmed disease due to the novel 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19). METHOD. Retrospective descriptive observational study conducted in five health facilities of the Colsanitas clinic network that implemented an accompaniment strategy with seven modalities: virtual information, personal mobile devices, virtual visits, contacts by other means, round-the-clock companion, in-person visit, and compassionate contact. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS. The accompaniment strategy was used with 871 patients with hospital stays ranging from 1 to 90 days; 70% were positive for COVID-19. The families of 764 patients were contacted through 3984 calls in the virtual information modality; an average of 71 virtual visits per day occurred; 428 letters, voice messages, and videos, among others, were received; 114 patients had a round-the-clock companion; 154 patients had an in-person visit; and 20 families made a posthumous in-person visit to the patient. CONCLUSION. The results of the virtual and in-person accompaniment strategy with a person-centered approach showed that family involvement is important to patient care and improves communication and interaction among patients, families, and the healthcare team.","Erazo-Muñoz, Marcela; Benavides Cruz, Johana; Cantor-Cruz, Francy; Acosta Martínez, Adriana; Castillo, Ana María; Aranguren Aranguren, Diana",Rev Panam Salud Publica,https://doi.org/10.26633/rpsp.2021.97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584519/,19

The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility and safety of a simple, reliable prescription of incremental HD in patients with incident DDKD and RKF. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This parallel-group, open-label randomised pilot trial will enrol 50 patients from 14 outpatient dialysis units. Participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive twice-weekly HD with adjuvant pharmacological therapy for 6 weeks followed by thrice-weekly HD (incremental HD group) or outright thrice-weekly HD (standard HD group). Age ≥18 years, chronic kidney disease progressing to DDKD and urine output ≥500 mL/day are key inclusion criteria; patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <30% and acute kidney injury requiring dialysis will be excluded. Adjuvant pharmacological therapy (ie, effective diuretic regimen, patiromer and sodium bicarbonate) will complement twice-weekly HD. The primary feasibility end points are recruitment rate, adherence to the assigned HD regimen, adherence to serial timed urine collections and treatment contamination. Incidence rate of clinically significant volume overload and metabolic imbalances in the first 3 months after randomisation will be used to assess intervention safety. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina, USA. Patient recruitment began on 14 June 2019, was paused between 13 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, resumed on 01 June 2020 and will last until the required sample size has been attained.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic at a given point in time does not impact all hospitals equally—even within a single healthcare system, one hospital may be caring for patients in the hallways, while another has available inpatient beds. Here, we demonstrate a program to level-load COVID-19 patients between 2 academic medical centers in a healthcare system by transferring patients at the time of admission from the emergency department of one institution directly to an inpatient bed of the other institution. Over 42 days, 50 patients were transferred which saved 432 bed-days at the home academic medical center without any adverse events during transfer or upgrades to the ICU within the first 24 hours of admission. Programs like this can expand a healthcare system’s ability to allocate personnel and resources efficiently for patients and maximize the quality of care delivered even during a pandemic.","Lee, Andy H.; Dunn, Peter F.; Cooper, Stephanie; Seger, Robert; Raja, Ali S.; Safavi, Kyan C.; Yun, Brian J.",Am J Med Qual,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34225276/; https://doi.org/10.1097/01.jmq.0000743384.54212.e7,19

Although the role of chest CT for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia is still debatable, the modality has been used in scenarios of constrained real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. The epidemiologic reports indicate an unexplored difference between men and women in disease severity. We aimed to study the role of sex on disease severity and its correlation with CT-scan findings. METHODS: We retrospectively studied all confirmed cases of COVID-19 with thoracic CT-scans obtained at three hospitals from February 25, 2020 to March 15, 2020 in Tehran, Iran. CT involvement patterns of COVID-19 were analyzed based on sex and age of patients. RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen patients (64.3% [74/115] men) were enrolled with a median age of 57 (min:21, max:89). Thirty patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and thirty patients died during the hospital stay. Seventy-seven percent (37/48) of patients with unfavorable prognosis were males. Peripheral distribution of opacities was more common in males than females. When grouped by an age cut-off of 60 years, the females in the elder group had peribronchovascular distribution pattern, and younger males showed an anterior distribution of opacities. Females younger than 60 years had significantly lower CT-scores (7.5 ± 6.8). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated a CT-score cut-off of 14.5 to have 100% sensitivity and 91.9% specificity for predicting poor prognosis in females younger than 60 years. CONCLUSION: Opacity patterns on chest CT in COVID-19 are different based on sex and age, and males are at higher risk of disease severity and death.","Moradi, Behnaz; Ghanaati, Hosein; Kazemi, Mohamad Ali; Gity, Masoumeh; Hashemi, Hassan; Davari-tanha, Fateme; Chavoshi, Mohammadreza; Rouzrokh, Pouria; Kolahdouzan, Kasra",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33778607/; https://doi.org/10.1148/ryct.2020200248,19

Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) have proven useful in collecting medical data as well in tracing an individual carrying the virus. The data collected or traced belongs to an individual and should be revealed to themselves and hospital providers, but not to any third-party unauthorized agencies. In this paper we use an off-chain distributed storage solution for loading large medical data sets and a blockchain implementation to securely transfer the data from the infected person to the hospital system using the edge infrastructure, and call it CoviChain. The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) statistics are loaded on to the edge, and moved to InterPlanetary File Systems (IPFS) storage to retrieve the hash of the data file. Once the hash is obtained, it is moved to the blockchain by means of smart contracts. As the information is being hashed twice, CoviChain addresses the security and privacy issues and avoid exposing individuals’ data while achieving larger data storage on the blockchain with reduced cost and time.","Vangipuram, Sukrutha L.

To address this issue, we chose firms’ credit rating transition dynamics as a proxy of the credit market and discuss how statistical process control tools can be used to surveil structural breaks in firms’ rating transition dynamics. After reviewing some commonly used Markovian models for firms’ rating transition dynamics, we present several surveillance rules for detecting changes in generators of firms’ rating migration matrices, including the likelihood ratio rule, the generalized likelihood ratio rule, the extended Shiryaev’s detection rule, and a Bayesian detection rule for piecewise homogeneous Markovian models. The effectiveness of these rules was analyzed on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations. We also provide a real example that used the surveillance rules to analyze and detect structural breaks in the monthly credit rating migration of U.S. firms from January 1986 to February 2017.","Xing, Haipeng; Wang, Ke; Li, Zhi; Chen, Ying",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33286841/; https://doi.org/10.3390/e22101072,19

Although dromedaries are the main reservoir, other animal species might be susceptible to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and potentially serve as reservoirs. To determine whether other animals are potential reservoirs, we inoculated MERS-CoV into llamas, pigs, sheep, and horses and collected nasal and rectal swab samples at various times. The presence of MERS-CoV in the nose of pigs and llamas was confirmed by PCR, titration of infectious virus, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization; seroconversion was detected in animals of both species. Conversely, in sheep and horses, virus-specific antibodies did not develop and no evidence of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was found. These results prove the susceptibility of llamas and pigs to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, the possibility of MERS-CoV circulation in animals other than dromedaries, such as llamas and pigs, is not negligible.","Vergara-Alert, Júlia; van den Brand, Judith M.A.; Widagdo, W.; Muñoz, Marta; Raj, Stalin; Schipper, Debby; Solanes, David; Cordón, Ivan; Bensaid, Albert; Haagmans, Bart L.; Segalés, Joaquim",Emerg Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2302.161239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27901465/,19

The new virtual format upended a system that has relied on programmes and applicants balancing the likelihood of acceptance with the financial and time demands of cross-country travel.In this commentary, we address the history of residency interviewing in the USA and the emerging changes that are taking place in light of virtual interviews. We discuss the advantages of the new online format, including the reduced cost for applicants and programmes, as well as the decreased carbon footprint.We also discuss the inequities of virtual interviewing, involving a national maldistribution of interviews to only the top-tier candidates. We share previously unpublished data on the number of virtual interviews accepted by Stanford's 2020 residency applicants, compared with those conducted in person in 2019. We find Stanford applicants in all fields accepted more interviews: from a mean of 8 in 2019 to 14 in 2020, a change of 160% on average. Despite this, only half of Stanford 2020 applicants interviewing in the virtual format thought they had accepted more interviews than they would have in person.We comment on how transitions to online interviewing may be affecting medical schools and applicants disproportionately. Ultimately, we highlight the need and offer ideas for additional regulation on behalf of the AAMC to ensure a more equitable distribution of interview opportunities.","Beshar, Isabel; Tate, William J; Bernstein, Dan",Postgrad. med. j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611038/; https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2021-140897,19
604915,At the Center of Autophagy: Autophagosomes,2016-12-31,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the causative agent of PED, is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus in the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. PEDV non-structural accessory protein ORF3 is an ion channel related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Our previous study showed that PEDV ORF3 has expression characteristic of aggregation in cytoplasm, but its biological function remains elusive. Thus in this study, we initiated the construction of various vectors to express ORF3, and found ORF3 localized in the cytoplasm in the aggregation manner. Subsequently, confocal microscopy analysis showed that the aggregated ORF3 localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to trigger ER stress response via up-regulation of GRP78 protein expression and activation of PERK-eIF2α signaling pathway. In addition, our results showed that PEDV ORF3 could induce the autophagy through inducing conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, but couldn’t influence the apoptosis. In contrast, conversion of LC3-I/LC3-II could be significantly inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, indicating that ORF3-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress response. This work not only provides some new findings for the biological function of the PEDV ORF3 protein, but also help us for the further understanding the molecular interaction between PEDV ORF3 protein and cells.","Zou, Dehua; Xu, Jiaxin; Duan, Xulai; Xu, Xin; Li, Pengfei; Cheng, Lixin; Zheng, Liang; Li, Xingzhi; Zhang, Yating; Wang, Xianhe; Wu, Xuening; Shen, Yujiang; Yao, Xiangyu; Wei, Jiaqi; Yao, Lili; Li, Liyang; Song, Baifen; Ma, Jinzhu; Liu, Xinyang; Wu, Zhijun; Zhang, Hua; Cao, Hongwei",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383304/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519305280; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519305280; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.07.005,19

There is no data documenting the effect of metformin taken as an outpatient on COVID-19 related hospitalizations. Our aim was to evaluate if metformin decreases hospitalization and severe COVID-19 among minority Medicare patients who acquired the SARS-CoV2 virus. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including elderly minority Medicare COVID-19 patients across eight states. We collected data from the inpatient and outpatient electronic health records, demographic data, as well as clinical and echocardiographic data. We classified those using metformin as those patients who had a pharmacy claim for metformin and non-metformin users as those who were diabetics and did not use metformin as well as non-diabetic patients. Our primary outcome was hospitalization. Our secondary outcomes were mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: We identified 1,139 COVID-19 positive patients of whom 392 were metformin users. Metformin users had a higher comorbidity score than non-metformin users (p < 0.01). The adjusted relative hazard (RH) of those hospitalized for metformin users was 0.71; 95% CI 0.52–0.86. The RH of death for metformin users was 0.34; 95% CI 0.19–0.59. The RH of ARDS for metformin users was 0.32; 95% CI 0.22–0.45. Metformin users on 1000 mg daily had lower mortality, but similar hospitalization and ARDS rates when compared to those on 500–850 mg of metformin daily. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin is associated with lower hospitalization, mortality and ARDS among a minority COVID-19 population. Future randomized trials should confirm this finding and evaluate for a causative effect of the drug preventing disease.","Ghany, Reyan; Palacio, Ana; Dawkins, Elissa; Chen, Gordon; McCarter, Daniel; Forbes, Emancia; Chung, Brian; Tamariz, Leonardo",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187140212100045X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662839/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.02.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187140212100045X?v=s5,19

Endoscopy has become evasive since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate methods that use the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-jejunostomy (PEG-J) tubes without endoscopy. METHODS: We included 19 patients in this study. The contrast agent was injected into the PEG-J tube to clarify the AEs related to the use of the tube. When the kink of the PEG-J tube was found, it was pulled approximately 5–10 cm. When placing or replacing the PEG-J tube, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was pushed into the gastrostomy hole to bring its tip closer to the pylorus before a new PEG-J tube was inserted into it. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 63.1 ± 9.9 years, while the mean duration of PD was 16.7 ± 6.3 years. Tube-related AEs included PEG-J tube kinks (32 events), connector failures (20 events), and PEG-J tube entanglements without/with bezoars (9 events/5 events). All PEG-J tube kinks were resolved by tube manipulation with a fluoroscopic guide. In 66 of 85 events (77.6%), the PEG-J tube was placed or replaced without endoscopy. We believe that the use of the antispasmodic agent just before PEG-J operation reduced this rate. CONCLUSION: Our methods were able to resolve most AEs associated with PEG-J tube use without endoscopy.","Mukai, Yohei; Toyoda, Hiroyuki; Miyama, Kenji; Takahashi, Yuji",Clin Park Relat Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prdoa.2020.100079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316657/,19

Considerable published studies have investigated the relationship between various immune cells and RSA. Here, we review current knowledge on this area, and discuss the five main categories of immune cells involved in RSA; these include innate lymphocytes (ILC), macrophages, decidual dendritic cells (DCs), and T cells. Furthermore, we sought to summarize the impact of the multiple interactions of various immune cells on the emergence of RSA.

605843,An essay on the nominal vs. real definitions of aging,2021-06-06,"BACKGROUND: Early reports indicate that AKI is common during COVID-19 infection. Different mortality rates of AKI due to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, based on the degree of organic dysfunction and varying from public to private hospitals. However, there is a lack of data about AKI among critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 424 critically ill adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and AKI, both associated with SARS-CoV-2, admitted to six public ICUs in Brazil. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify risk factors for AKI severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The average age was 66.42 ± 13.79 years, 90.3% were on mechanical ventilation (MV), 76.6% were at KDIGO stage 3, and 79% underwent hemodialysis. The overall mortality was 90.1%. We found a higher frequency of dialysis (82.7% versus 45.2%), MV (95% versus 47.6%), vasopressors (81.2% versus 35.7%) (p < 0.001) and severe AKI (79.3% versus 52.4%; p = 0.002) in nonsurvivors. MV, vasopressors, dialysis, sepsis-associated AKI, and death (p < 0.001) were more frequent in KDIGO 3. Logistic regression for death demonstrated an association with MV (OR = 8.44; CI 3.43–20.74) and vasopressors (OR = 2.93; CI 1.28–6.71; p < 0.001). Severe AKI and dialysis need were not independent risk factors for death. MV (OR = 2.60; CI 1.23–5.45) and vasopressors (OR = 1.95; CI 1.12–3.99) were also independent risk factors for KDIGO 3 (p < 0.001).

The data from 306 games for German Bundesliga and 296 games for Polish Ekstraklasa were divided into before- and after-lockdown periods. The physical performance of German Bundesliga teams after the 63-day COVID-19 lockdown did not differ significantly from that in the first part of the season. In contrast, Polish Ekstraklasa teams, after the 81-day lockdown, displayed significantly shorter total distances (p < 0.001), shorter high-intensity running distances (p = 0.03), and fewer high-intensity actions (p = 0.02). Moreover, when the effective playing time was considered, teams covered significantly less relative total distance (p < 0.001) and relative high-intensity running distance (p = 0.02). The results of the current study suggest that physical performance during the matches of the German Bundesliga was not influenced by the COVID-19 lockdown, contrary to those of the Polish Ekstraklasa. This difference could have been caused by different break lengths and different restrictions implemented in these countries during the pandemic lockdown.","Radzimiński, Łukasz; Padrón-Cabo, Alexis; Konefał, Marek; Chmura, Paweł; Szwarc, Andrzej; Jastrzębski, Zbigniew",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444559/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168796,19

Grossly, multiple bowel loops in all ferret kits were distended by mucoid faecal material. Microscopically, there was no evidence of inflammation or notable alteration to the normal mucosal morphology. Gram-positive coccoid bacteria colonized variable segments of the small intestine. These bacteria were identified as Staphylococcus delphini by phenotypic and molecular analyses. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Staphylococcus enterotoxins was positive and polymerase chain reaction detected the gene for Staphylococcus enterotoxin E in the isolates. The hypersecretory diarrhoea in these ferret kits may have been associated with colonization of the small intestine by S. delphini, cultures of which were shown in vitro to be potentially capable of producing enterotoxin E.

Thus, our aim was to assess, in a cohort of patients regularly followed up in a devoted outpatient clinic of Southern Italy, the association between their gastrointestinal symptoms changes, stress, and anxiety reported during the Italian lockdown. METHODS: We recruited patients from the outpatient clinic of the University of Salerno, devoted to functional gastrointestinal disorders, selecting only patients for whom an evaluation was available in the last 6 months before the lockdown. Gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated at each visit through standardized questionnaire and pooled in a database. On 45th days from the beginning of the lockdown, patients were re‐assessed by phone with the same questionnaire. Anxiety and stress levels were assessed through a self‐administered online questionnaire based on Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 test and Perceived Stress Scale 10 test. KEY RESULTS: The intensity‐frequency scores of several upper gastrointestinal symptoms improved (Wilcoxon test <0.05). Higher anxiety levels had a higher risk of worsening chest pain (OR 1.3 [1.1–1.7]), waterbrash (OR 1.3 [1.0–1.7]), epigastric burning (OR 1.3 [1.0–1.6]), and abdominal pain (OR 1.6 [1.0–2.3]). When compared to the interval preceding the outbreak, half of the patients declared their symptoms remained unchanged, 13.6% worsened, and 36.4% improved.

Internet-based psychological measurement can play an important role in collecting imperative data, assisting to guide evidence-based decision making in practice and policy, and subsequently facilitating immediate reporting of measurement results to participants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P<.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81. Participants who demonstrated problematic scores for at least one of the mental health outcomes increased from 58% (n=197/340) before COVID-19 to 79% (n=532/673) during COVID-19, leading to only 21% (n=141) of measured participants displaying good mental health during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrate deterioration in mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Although further research is needed, our findings support the serious mental health implications of the pandemic and highlight the utility of internet-based data collection tools in providing evidence to innovate and strengthen practice and policy during and after the pandemic.","van Agteren, Joep; Bartholomaeus, Jonathan; Fassnacht, Daniel B; Iasiello, Matthew; Ali, Kathina; Lo, Laura; Kyrios, Michael",JMIR Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.2196/20696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490845/,19
608745,Applications of Bacterial Degrons and Degraders — Toward Targeted Protein Degradation in Bacteria,2021-05-07,"IMPORTANCE: Clinical effectiveness data on remdesivir are urgently needed, especially among diverse populations and in combination with other therapies. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether remdesivir administered with or without corticosteroids for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with more rapid clinical improvement in a racially/ethnically diverse population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective comparative effectiveness research study was conducted from March 4 to August 29, 2020, in a 5-hospital health system in the Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, area. Of 2483 individuals with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection assessed by polymerase chain reaction, those who received remdesivir were matched to infected individuals who did not receive remdesivir using time-invariant covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, body mass index, and do-not-resuscitate or do-not-intubate orders) and time-dependent covariates (ratio of peripheral blood oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein level, complete white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, albumin level, alanine aminotransferase level, glomerular filtration rate, dimerized plasmin fragment D [D-dimer] level, and oxygen device). An individual in the remdesivir group with k days of treatment was matched to a control patient who stayed in the hospital at least k days (5 days maximum) beyond the matching day. EXPOSURES: Remdesivir treatment with or without corticosteroid administration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was rate of clinical improvement (hospital discharge or decrease of 2 points on the World Health Organization severity score), and the secondary outcome, mortality at 28 days. An additional outcome was clinical improvement and time to death associated with combined remdesivir and corticosteroid treatment. RESULTS: Of 2483 consecutive admissions, 342 individuals received remdesivir, 184 of whom also received corticosteroids and 158 of whom received remdesivir alone. For these 342 patients, the median age was 60 years (interquartile range, 46-69 years), 189 (55.3%) were men, and 276 (80.7%) self-identified as non-White race/ethnicity. Remdesivir recipients had a shorter time to clinical improvement than matched controls without remdesivir treatment (median, 5.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-8.0 days] vs 7.0 days [interquartile range, 4.0-10.0 days]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.22-1.79]). Remdesivir recipients had a 28-day mortality rate of 7.7% (22 deaths) compared with 14.0% (40 deaths) among matched controls, but this difference was not statistically significant in the time-to-death analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.38-1.28). The addition of corticosteroids to remdesivir was not associated with a reduced hazard of death at 28 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.67-5.57). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness research study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19, receipt of remdesivir was associated with faster clinical improvement in a cohort of predominantly non-White patients. Remdesivir plus corticosteroid administration did not reduce the time to death compared with remdesivir administered alone.","Garibaldi, Brian T.; Wang, Kunbo; Robinson, Matthew L.; Zeger, Scott L.; Bandeen-Roche, Karen; Wang, Mei-Cheng; Alexander, G.

We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient characteristics associated with short hospital length-of-stay. Results: Of 3103 patients, 648 (20.9%) were hospitalized for less than 48 h. These patients were significantly less likely to have an age greater than 60, diabetes, chronic kidney disease; emergency department vital sign abnormalities, or abnormal initial diagnostic testing. For patients with no significant risk factors, the adjusted probability of short-stay hospitalization was 62.4% (95% CI 58.9–69.6).

609833,Diverse microbial interactions with the basement membrane barrier,2012-01-31,"In the global context, the health and quality of life of people are adversely affected by either one or more types of chronic diseases. The chronic pain associated with diagnosed patients may include heavy medical expenditure along with the physical and mental suffering they undergo. Usually, unbearable amounts of medical expenses are incurred, to improve or sustain the health condition of the patient. Consequently, the heavy financial burden tends to push households from a comfortable or secure life, or even from bad to worse, towards the probability of becoming poor. Hence, this study is conducted to identify the impact chronic illnesses have on poverty using data from a national survey referred as the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), with data gathered by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) of Sri Lanka in 2016. As such, this study is the first of its kind in Sri Lanka, declaring the originality of the study based on data collected from the local arena. Accordingly, the study discovered that married females who do not engage in any type of economic activity, in the age category of 40–65, having an educational level of tertiary level or below and living in the urban sector have a higher likelihood of suffering from chronic diseases. Moreover, it was inferred that, if a person is deprived from access to basic education in the level of education, lives in the rural or estate sector, or suffers from a brain disease, cancer, heart disease or kidney disease, he is highly likely to be poor. Some insights concluded from this Sri Lankan case study can also be applied in the context of other developing countries, to minimise chronic illnesses and thereby the probability of falling into poverty.","Jayathilaka, Ruwan; Joachim, Sheron; Mallikarachchi, Venuri; Perera, Nishali; Ranawaka, Dhanushika",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095818/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241232,19

In this exploratory, proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of FMT in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). METHODS: In this double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, superiority trial, we randomly allocated (1:1) adults with active peripheral PsA (≥3 swollen joints) despite ongoing treatment with methotrexate to one gastroscopic-guided FMT or sham transplantation into the duodenum. Safety was monitored throughout the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants experiencing treatment failure (ie, needing treatment intensification) through 26 weeks. Key secondary endpoints were change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR20) response at week 26. RESULTS: Of 97 screened, 31 (32%) underwent randomisation (15 allocated to FMT) and 30 (97%) completed the 26-week clinical evaluation. No serious adverse events were observed. Treatment failure occurred more frequently in the FMT group than in the sham group (9 (60%) vs 3 (19%); risk ratio, 3.20; 95% CI 1.06 to 9.62; p=0.018). Improvement in HAQ-DI differed between groups (0.07 vs 0.30) by 0.23 points (95% CI 0.02 to 0.44; p=0.031) in favour of sham. There was no difference in the proportion of ACR20 responders between groups (7 of 15 (47%) vs 8 of 16 (50%)). CONCLUSIONS: In this first preliminary, interventional randomised controlled trial of FMT in immune-mediated arthritis, we did not observe any serious adverse events.

The aim of the research is to determine if particulate matter (PM) has been the primary cause of the high CoViD-19 spread rapidity in some areas of Northern Italy. Data of PM for all the 41 studied cities were collected from the local environmental protection agencies. To compare air quality data with epidemiological data, a statistical analysis was conducted identifying the correlation matrices of Pearson and Spearman, considering also the possible incubation period of the disease. Moreover, a model for the evaluation of the epidemic risk, already proposed in literature, was used to evaluate a possible influence of PM on CoViD-19 spread rapidity. The results exclude that PM alone was the primary cause of the high CoVid-19 spread rapidity in some areas of Northern Italy. Further developments are necessary for a better comprehension of the influence of atmospheric pollution parameters on the rapidity of spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2, since a synergistic action with other factors (such as meteorological, socio-economic and cultural factors) could not be excluded by the present study.

In this study, we applied a high-throughput screening approach to identify the diversity of viruses in 118 samples of birds captured between October 2006 to October 2010 in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil. We found nearly complete genomes of novel species of astrovirus and calicivirus in cloacal swabs of ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) collected in Coroa do Avião islet, Pernambuco State. These viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a genome of ~7 to 8 kb, and were designated as Ruddy turnstone astrovirus (RtAstV) and Ruddy turnstone calicivirus (RTCV), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RtAstV and RTCV grouped in a monophyletic clade with viruses identified from poultry samples (i.e., chicken, goose, and turkey), including viruses associated with acute nephritis in chickens. Attempts of viral propagation in monkey and chicken cell lines for both viruses were unsuccessful. Also, we found genomes related with viral families that infect invertebrates and plants, suggesting that they might be ingested in the birds’ diet. In sum, these findings shed new light on the diversity of viruses in migratory birds with the notable characterization of a novel astrovirus and calicivirus.","de Souza, William Marciel; Fumagalli, Marcílio Jorge; de Araujo, Jansen; Ometto, Tatiana; Modha, Sejal; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Durigon, Edison Luís; Murcia, Pablo Ramiro; Figueiredo, Luiz Tadeu Moraes",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42110-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944402/,19
611531,Host nutritional status: the neglected virulence factor,2004-07-30,"With effective and safe COVID-19 vaccines beginning to be distributed across the United States, questions about who should receive the vaccine first have been the focus of public discussions. Yet, over the long-term, questions about the order of distribution will be displaced by questions about how to achieve high levels of vaccination rates. Historically, absent incentives or mandates, Americans have shown ambivalence, if not general antipathy, towards vaccinations, and vaccination rates have generally been low for many vaccines. There is evidence that vaccination requirements across educational settings are an effective policy instrument to increase vaccination rates. We administered a large national survey to assess American’s attitudes towards vaccination requirements across three educational settings (daycares, K-12 schools, and universities) in general and for COVID-19 specifically. Partisanship, gender, race, rurality, and perceptions about the appropriate role schools should play in providing health services are substantive predictors of public opinion. While Americans generally support vaccination mandates across all three settings for both types of requirements, support is consistently and significantly lower for COVID19 requirements. The effect of partisanship is accentuated for COVID-19 requirements as compared to general requirements. Drop off in support between general and COVID-19 specific requirements are driven by partisanship, gender, political knowledge, rurality, and having children in the household. Nonetheless, mandates are supported by a majority of Americans. Assessing Americans’ opinions of vaccination requirements in educational settings offers an important opportunity to explore the potential of mandates as policy instrument in the government’s arsenal against COVID-19 and guide public policy on the issues.","Haeder, Simon F.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810906/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21003480; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21003480?v=s5,19

We searched six databases from inception through September 2019 and selected English-language studies investigating accuracy of any of the above tests for VAP diagnosis. Reference standard was histopathological analysis. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We included 25 studies (1639 patients). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of physical examination findings for VAP were poor: fever (66.4% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.7–85.0], 53.9% [95% CI 34.5–72.2]) and purulent secretions (77.0% [95% CI 64.7–85.9], 39.0% [95% CI 25.8–54.0]). Any infiltrate on chest radiography had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI 73.9–95.8) and specificity of 26.1% (95% CI 15.1–41.4). ETA had a sensitivity of 75.7% (95% CI 51.5–90.1) and specificity of 67.9% (95% CI 40.5–86.8). Among bronchoscopic sampling methods, PSB had a sensitivity of 61.4% [95% CI 43.7–76.5] and specificity of 76.5% [95% CI 64.2–85.6]; while BAL had a sensitivity of 71.1% [95% CI 49.9–85.9] and specificity of 79.6% [95% CI 66.2–85.9]. CPIS > 6 had a sensitivity of 73.8% (95% CI 50.6–88.5) and specificity of 66.4% (95% CI 43.9–83.3). Classic clinical indicators had poor accuracy for diagnosis of VAP. Reliance upon these indicators in isolation may result in misdiagnosis and potentially unnecessary antimicrobial use.

Specific information about critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is rare. To describe the clinical course and complications of critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received IMV and were successfully weaned from it. This retrospective study included patients admitted to 3 intensive care units (ICUs) and 1 sub-ICU of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital between December 24, 2019, and March 12, 2020. Eleven patients who had been diagnosed with critically ill COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance, received invasive ventilation, and were finally successfully weaned from it, were enrolled in our study. Their presenting symptoms, comorbidity conditions, laboratory values, ICU course, ventilator parameters, treatments, and relative complications were recorded. Of 108 critically ill COVID-19 patients who received invasive ventilation, 11 patients who underwent tracheal extubation or terminal weaning were included. The mean age of the 11 patients was 52.8 years (range, 38–70 years), 8 (72.7%) were male, and 2 were health care workers. The median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 6.6 days (range, 3–13 days), and the median duration of IMV was 15.7 days (range, 6–29 days). All 11 patients presented with acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and received IMV, and 1 patient switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance. A lung-protective strategy with lower tidal volume ventilation and proper driving pressure is the main strategy of IMV. All patients had extrapulmonary manifestations, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, myocardial damage, and/or lymphopenia. Hospital-acquired infections occurred in 7 (63.6%) patients. Critical COVID-19 illness is characterized by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and subsequent dysfunction of other organs with a high mortality rate. Correct ventilation strategies and other clinical strategies to improve oxygenation based on the skilled trained group and the availability of equipment are the key methods to rescue lives.","Liu, Yulan; Xie, Wenjie; Meng, Yang; Sun, Lifang; Yan, Juanjuan; Dong, Weiguo; Zhou, Chenliang; Yu, Zhui",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879732/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025619,19

We analyzed 450 webpages returned by searching the string 'are face masks dangerous' in Italy, the UK and the USA using three search engines (Bing, Duckduckgo and Google). The majority (64-79%) were pages from news outlets, with few (2-6%) pages from government and public health agencies. Webpages with a positive stance on masks were more frequent in English (50%) than in Italian (36%), and those with a negative stance were more frequent in Italian (28% vs. 19% in English). Google returned the highest number of mask-positive pages and Duckduckgo the lowest. Google also returned the lowest number of pages mentioning conspiracy theories and Duckduckgo the highest. Webpages in Italian scored lower than those in English in transparency (reporting authors, their credentials and backing the information with references). When issues about the use of face masks were analyzed, mask effectiveness was the most discussed followed by hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide), contraindication in respiratory disease, and hypoxia, with issues related to their contraindications in mental health conditions and disability mentioned by very few pages. This study suggests that: 1) public health agencies should increase their web presence in providing correct information on face masks; 2) search engines should improve the information quality criteria in their ranking; 3) the public should be more informed on issues related to the use of masks and disabilities, mental health and stigma arising for those people who cannot wear masks.","Meta, S.; Ghezzi, D.; Catalani, A.; Vanzolini, T.; Ghezzi, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.23.20218271; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218271v1?rss=1,19

Almost 20% of women will elect surgical correction of this condition by age 85. Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) with concomitant vaginal vault suspension is a long-standing practice in POP surgery to address apical (uterine) prolapse. Yet, contemporary evidence on the merits of this approach relative to preservation of the uterus through suspension is needed to better inform surgical decision making by patients and their healthcare providers. The objective of this study is to evaluate POP-specific health outcomes and service utilisation of women electing uterine suspension compared with those electing hysterectomy and vaginal vault suspension for POP surgery up to 1-year postsurgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective cohort study planning to enrol 321 adult women with stage ≥2 POP from multiple sites in Alberta, Canada. Following standardised counselling from study surgeons, participants self-select either a hysterectomy based or uterine preservation surgical group. Data are being collected through participant questionnaires, medical records and administrative data linkage at four time points spanning from the presurgical consultation to 1-year postsurgery. The primary outcome is anatomic failure to correct POP, and secondary outcomes include changes in positioning of pelvic structures, retreatment, subjective report of bulge symptoms, pelvic floor distress and impact, sexual function and health service use. Data will be analysed using inverse probability weighting of propensity scores and generalised linear models. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary (REB19-2134). Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, presentations at national and international conferences, and educational handouts for patients.

Therefore, weight maintenance after a successful weight loss intervention is not very common, especially in obese individuals. This randomized controlled study was conducted to explore the efficacy of following dietary and psychological support in a group of 36 obese individuals. Participants (22 women, 14 men aged 35.58 ± 9.85 years, BMI 35.04 ± 3.80 kg/m(2)) who completed a 12-month weight loss phase (balanced energy-restricted diet) were randomly allocated to receive 18-month support (SG) or no additional care (CG). The support phase included some elements of Ten Top Tips (TTT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI) in combination with nutritional education and assessment of the level of physical activity. The primary outcome was the maintenance of anthropometric parameters at an 18-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes included evaluation of biochemical parameters and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes connected with obesity. A comparison of SG vs. CG after a 30-month period of the study revealed significant differences in weight changes (−3.83 ± 6.09 vs. 2.48 ± 6.24 kg), Body Mass Index (−1.27 ± 2.02 vs. 0.72 ± 2.12 kg/m(2)), visceral adipose tissue (−0.58 ± 0.63 vs. 0.45 ± 0.74 L), and waist circumference (−4.83 ± 4.05 vs. 1.83 ± 5.97 cm). Analysis of SNPs (rs9939609 FTO, rs987237 TFAP2B, and rs894160 PLIN1) provided further insight into the potential modulating effect of certain genotypes on weight loss and maintenance and extended the knowledge of the potential benefits of personalized medicine. Post-therapeutical support in current clinical practice may increase the chances of long-term weight loss maintenance in obesity treatment even in patients with a genetic predisposition to excessive weight.","Iłowiecka, Katarzyna; Glibowski, Paweł; Skrzypek, Michał; Styk, Wojciech",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13062020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208363/,19

Therefore, clarifying the effects of this infection on the cardiovascular system is of importance in terms of the clinical course of the disease. The increases in cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 have been associated with poor prognosis and mortality. However, there are no specific laboratory markers yet to assess the severity of the disease. In this context, the combination of available biomarkers is needed to better define the clinical course of this disease. Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125) has become a remarkable marker in recent years as a result of the correlation of increasing levels in cardiovascular diseases with clinical, hemodynamic, echocardiographic parameters and its relation with mortality or re-hospitalization due to heart failure.

The determination of their phase diagrams proved challenging, and indeed those of hard-disks, hard regular polygons, and inverse power-law potentials, have been only recently clarified. In this context, the role of attractive forces is currently speculative, despite their prevalence at both the molecular and colloidal scale. Here we demonstrate, via numerical simulations, that attraction promotes a discontinuous melting scenario with no hexatic phase. At high-temperature, Lennard-Jones particles and attractive polygons follow the shape-dominated melting scenario observed in hard-disks and hard polygons, respectively. Conversely, all systems melt via a first-order transition with no hexatic phase at low temperature, where attractive forces dominate. The intermediate temperature melting scenario is shape-dependent. Our results suggest that, in colloidal experiments, the tunability of the strength of the attractive forces allows for the observation of different melting scenario in the same system.","Li, Yan-Wei; Ciamarra, Massimo Pica",Physical review letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530644/; https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.218002; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13792v1.pdf,19

We built a simplified computational model, called SpikePro, to predict the SARS-CoV-2 fitness from the amino acid sequence and structure of the spike protein. It contains three contributions: the viral transmissibility predicted from the stability of the spike protein, the infectivity computed in terms of the affinity of the spike protein for the ACE2 receptor, and the ability of the virus to escape from the human immune response based on the binding affinity of the spike protein for a set of neutralizing antibodies. Our model reproduces well the available experimental, epidemiological and clinical data on the impact of variants on the biophysical characteristics of the virus. For example, it is able to identify circulating viral strains that, by increasing their fitness, recently became dominant at the population level. SpikePro is a useful instrument for the genomic surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, since it predicts in a fast and accurate way the emergence of new viral strains and their dangerousness.

We hypothesized these age differences to be related to the perception of closeness to family/friends or the engagement in daily activities during the pandemic. AIM: To investigate age differences in positive and negative emotional experiences and whether the perception of closeness to family/friends and the engagement in daily activities during pandemic explained such age-related differences. METHODS: Through a cross-sectional study, 1,457 adults aged 18–87 years old completed an online survey assessing positive and negative emotional experiences, the perception of more closeness to family/friends, and daily activities that participants started/re-started during the pandemic. RESULTS: Increasing age was associated with more positive and less negative emotional experiences. Age differences in positive emotional experience were explained by the perception of more closeness to friends and not by the engagement in daily activities. For negative emotional experience age, differences remained significant even after accounting for the perception of closeness to family/friends and engagements in daily activities. DISCUSSION: Older adults’ greater overall level of positive emotional experience was explained by their greater perception of more closeness to friends. We speculate that social closeness provides a coping mechanism to increase emotional wellbeing employed especially in older adults. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the link between perceived social closeness and emotional wellbeing especially in older adults. To cope with stressful situation, it is important to encourage older adults to increase the closeness to their social network.","Cavallini, Elena; Rosi, Alessia; van Vugt, Floris Tijmen; Ceccato, Irene; Rapisarda, Filippo; Vallarino, Martine; Ronchi, Luca; Vecchi, Tomaso; Lecce, Serena",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34247344/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01927-7,19

Although SARS‐CoV‐2 mainly attacks respiratory systems, manifestations of multiple organs have been detected. A significant concern was raised about whether COVID‐19 may affect female and male reproductive functions. These findings imposed more restrictions on social relationships between individuals even if inside the family, adding more physiologic load. In this context, there is a crucial need to identify the biological and behavioral reproductive risk factors associated with COVID­19 disease. Questions regarding the potential risks of sexual transmission during intercourse and/or application of ART, vertical transmission (throughout pregnancy, delivery, and breastfeeding), the health of pregnant and postpartum women, and fetal or postnatal health problems of neonates/children remain largely unanswered. The contribution of individuals to different social and economic activities depends on the maintenance of good quality life and health. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic raised on the end of December 2019 has drastically affected different aspects of human wellbeing. The pandemic not only affected the health of individuals, but also negatively affected mental health and social interaction. This review illustrates: a) scientific findings related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reproductive process, considering gender, hormonal balance, gonad functions, pregnancy, and ART, b) the sociosexual dimension of COVID-19 disease and precautions that should be taken to avoid infection via sexual transmission or vertical transmission, which may alleviate the fear associated with continuing normal social relationships and economic activities.","Hashem, Nesrein M.; Abdelnour, Sameh A.; Alhimaidi, Ahmad R.; Swelum, Ayman A.",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519273/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X20306677; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.12.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X20306677,19

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily interacts with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and other accessory proteins such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CD147. Thus, altered receptor signals in aging and chronic disease play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are associated with a higher risk of deterioration in different organs. In this review, after a brief introduction to the link between aging and receptors for SARS-CoV-2, we focus on the risk of deterioration in different organs of COVID-19 patients considering aging as the main factor.

Later the pathogen was reported to be a novel coronavirus designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease outspread was followed by WHO declaration of COVID-19 pandemic as a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern"". SARS-CoV-2 is a novel pathogenic beta coronavirus that infects humans causing severe respiratory illness. However, multifarious factors can contribute to the susceptibility to COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality such as age, gender, and underlying comorbidities. Infection initiates when viral particles bind to the host cell surface receptors where SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein subunit 1 binds to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is of importance to mention that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses' mediate entry into the host cells via ACE2 receptor which might be correlated with the structural similarity of spike glycoprotein subunit 1 of both SARS viruses. However, the structural binding differs, whereas ACE2 receptor binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 is 4 folds higher than that with SARS-CoV. Moreover, amino acids sequence divergence between the two S glycoproteins might be responsible for differential modulations of the specific immune response to both viruses. Identification of different aspects such as binding affinity, differential antigenic profiles of S-glycoproteins, and ACE2 mutations might influence the investigation of potential therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding interface. In this review, we aim to elaborate on the expression of hACE2 receptor protein and its binding with SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit, the possible immunogenic sequences of spike protein, effect of ACE 2 polymorphism on viral binding, and infectivity/susceptibility to disease. Furthermore, targeting of hACE2 receptor binding with SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit via various mechanisms will be discussed to understand its role in therapeutics.","Al-Zaidan, Lobna; Mestiri, Sarra; Raza, Afsheen; Merhi, Maysaloun; Inchakalody, Varghese Philipose; Fernandes, Queenie; Taib, Nassiba; Uddin, Shahab; Dermime, Said",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420993/; https://doi.org/10.3233/tub-200084,19

Nous avons considéré qu’un patient était guéri lorsqu’aucun des trois symptômes principaux (fièvre, dyspnée et douleur thoracique) n’était signalé après les derniers symptômes connus via l’application en ligne. Résultats Un total de 186 patients ont été inclus (âge médian, 41 ans [intervalle interquartile, 19–78 ans] ; 74,2 % de femmes), dont 132 (71 %) étaient des professionnels de santé.

619342,MMP-2 knockdown blunts age-dependent carotid stiffness by decreasing elastin degradation and augmenting eNOS activation,2021,"Lassa virus causes hemorrhagic fever characterized by immunosuppression. The nucleoprotein of Lassa virus, termed NP, binds the viral genome. It also has an additional enzymatic activity as an exonuclease that specifically digests double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is a strong signal to the innate immune system of viral infection. Digestion of dsRNA by the NP exonuclease activity appears to cause suppression of innate immune signaling in the infected cell. Although the fold of the NP enzyme is conserved and the active site completely conserved with other exonucleases in its DEDDh family, NP is atypical among exonucleases in its preference for dsRNA and its strict specificity for one substrate. Here, we present the crystal structure of Lassa virus NP in complex with dsRNA. We find that unlike the exonuclease in Klenow fragment, the double-stranded nucleic acid in complex with Lassa NP remains base-paired instead of splitting, and that binding of the paired complementary strand is achieved by “relocation” of a basic loop motif from its typical exonuclease position. Further, we find that just one single glycine that contacts the substrate strand and one single tyrosine that stacks with a base of the complementary, non-substrate strand are responsible for the unique substrate specificity. This work thus provides templates for development of antiviral drugs that would be specific for viral, rather than host exonucleases of similar fold and active site, and illustrates how a very few amino acid changes confer alternate specificity and biological phenotype to an enzyme.","Hastie, Kathryn M.; King, Liam B.; Zandonatti, Michelle A.; Saphire, Erica Ollmann",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22937163/,19
619553,Program and Abstracts for the 18th ICAR,2005-03-31,"The coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic is a major challenge for the health systems worldwide. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is one of the most common complications of the COVID-19 infection. The activation of the coagulation system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. The development of lung coagulopathy involves thrombin generation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Unfractionated heparin and its recently introduced counterpart low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), are widely used anticoagulants with a variety of clinical indications allowing for limited and manageable physio-toxicologic side effects while the use of protamine sulfate, heparin's effective antidote, has made their use even safer. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is approved as intravenous thrombolytic treatment. The present narrative review discusses the use of heparin and tPA in the treatment of COVID-19-induced ARDS and their related potential physio-toxicologic side effects. The article is a quick review of articles on anticoagulation in COVID infection and the potential toxicologic reactions associated with these drugs.","Mazilu, Laura; Katsiki, Niki; Nikolouzakis, Taxiarchis Konstantinos; Aslanidis, Minas I.; Lazopoulos, George; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Suceveanu, Andra-Iulia; Stoian, Anca-Pantea; Parepa, Irinel-Raluca; Voinea, Felix; Suceveanu, Adrian Paul; Arsene, Andreea Letiția; Velescu, Bruno Ștefan; Vesa, Cosmin; Nitipir, Cornelia",Food Chem Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.111974; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691521000089; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691521000089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421462/,19

Virtual visiting is one tool to help deal with this challenge. When introducing virtual visiting into our ICU, we identified 5 criteria for a sustainable system that aligned with patient-family-centered care: virtual visiting needed to (1) simulate open and flexible visiting; (2) be able to accommodate differences in family size, dynamics, and cultural practices; (3) utilize a video conferencing platform that is private and secure; (4) be easy to use and not require special teams to facilitate meetings; and (5) not increase the workload of ICU staff. There is a growing body of literature demonstrating a global movement toward virtual visiting in ICU, however there are no publications that describe a system which meet all 5 of our criteria. Importantly, there are no papers describing systems of virtual visiting which mimic open and flexible family presence at the bedside. We were unable to find any off-the-shelf video conferencing platforms that met all our criteria. To come up with a solution, a multidisciplinary team of ICU staff partnered with healthcare technology adoption consultants and two technology companies to develop an innovative system called HowRU. HowRU uses the video conferencing platform Webex with the integration of some newly designed software that automates many of the laborious and complex processes. HowRU is a cloud based, supported, and simplified system that closely simulates open and flexible visiting while ensuring patient and family privacy, dignity, and security. We have demonstrated the transferability of HowRU by implanting it into a second ICU. HowRU is now commercially available internationally. We hope HowRU will improve patient-family-centered care in ICU.","Thomas, Kathleen A. S.; O’Brien, Bernadine F.; Fryday, Agatha T.; Robinson, Ellen C.; Hales, Marissa J.

Abstract Introduction We analysed the neurological complications of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective, observational, descriptive study of consecutive patients admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory symptoms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 April and 1 June 2020. Results We included 30 patients with neurological symptoms; 21 were men (72.40%), and mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 57.41 years (11.61). The mean duration of ICU stay was 18.83 days (14.33). The neurological conditions recorded were acute confusional syndrome in 28 patients (93.33%), neuromuscular disease in 15 (50%), headache in 5 (16.66%), cerebrovascular disease in 4 (13.33%), and encephalopathies/encephalitis in 4 (13.33%). CSF analysis results were normal in 6 patients (20%). Brain MRI or head CT showed alterations in 20 patients (66.6%). EEG was performed in all patients (100%), with 8 (26.66%) showing abnormal findings. In 5 of the 15 patients with clinical myopathy, diagnosis was confirmed with electroneuromyography. We found a correlation between older age and duration of ICU stay (P = .002; 95% CI, 4.032-6.022; OR:). Conclusions Severe COVID-19 mainly affects men, as observed in other series. Half of our patients presented acute myopathy, and almost all patients left the ICU with acute confusional syndrome, which fully resolved; no correlation was found with EEG or neuroimaging findings. Older age is associated with longer ICU stay.","Abenza-Abildua, Maria Jose",Neurologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912745/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213485320302462?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213485320302462,19

In Sub-Saharan Africa (sSA), the region with the highest HIV-1 burden, information about such transmission dynamics is sparse. Phylogenetic inference is a powerful method for the study of HIV-1 transmission networks and source attribution. In this review, we assessed available phylogenetic data on mixing between HIV-1 hotspots (geographic areas and populations with high HIV-1 incidence and prevalence) and areas or populations with lower HIV-1 burden in sSA. We searched PubMed and identified and reviewed 64 studies on HIV-1 transmission dynamics within and between risk groups and geographic locations in sSA (published 1995–2021). We describe HIV-1 transmission from both a geographic and a risk group perspective in sSA. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing phylogenetic inference in mixed epidemics in sSA and offer our perspectives and potential solutions to the identified challenges.","Nduva, George M.; Nazziwa, Jamirah; Hassan, Amin S.; Sanders, Eduard J.; Esbjörnsson, Joakim",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205246/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061174,19
623290,ADP-ribosylation of DNA and RNA(),2021-09-11,"BACKGROUND: The first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the virus to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the airway epithelium. Asthma affects over 300 million people world-wide, many of whom may encounter SARS-CoV-2. Epidemiologic data suggests that asthmatics who get infected may be at increased risk of more severe disease. Our objective was to assess whether maintenance inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), a major treatment for asthma, is associated with airway ACE2 expression in asthmatics. METHODS: Large airway epithelium (LAE) of asthmatics treated with maintenance ICS (ICS(+)), asthmatics not treated with ICS (ICS(−)), and healthy controls (controls) was analyzed for expression of ACE2 and other coronavirus infection-related genes using microarrays. RESULTS: As a group, there was no difference in LAE ACE2 expression in all asthmatics vs controls. In contrast, subgroup analysis demonstrated that LAE ACE2 expression was higher in asthmatics ICS(+) compared to ICS‾ and ACE2 expression was higher in male ICS(+) compared to female ICS(+) and ICS‾ of either sex. ACE2 expression did not correlate with serum IgE, absolute eosinophil level, or change in FEV1 in response to bronchodilators in either ICS(−) or ICS(+). CONCLUSION: Airway ACE2 expression is increased in asthmatics on long-term treatment with ICS, an observation that should be taken into consideration when assessing the use of inhaled corticosteroids during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of a standardized patient encounter on first year medical student confidence and satisfaction in using telemedicine. METHODS: One hundred and sixty two first year medical students recruited from Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine-Carolinas campus were surveyed on their confidence and satisfaction with using telemedicine platforms before and after conducting a patient encounter. Participant confidence and satisfaction were assessed with a five point Likert scale: ""not confident,"" ""a little confident,"" ""somewhat confident,"" ""confident,"" and ""extremely confident."" RESULTS: Of 162 students, 103 (63.6%) completed the preencounter survey and 74 (45.7%) completed the postencounter survey. Before the standardized patient encounter, 37 participants (35.9%) reported that they were ""a little confident"" and 20 participants (19.4%) reported that they were ""not confident"" in their ability to conduct a patient interview using a telemedicine platform. Following the encounter, 24 students (32.4%) reported feeling ""somewhat confident"", and 32 (43.2%) reported feeling ""confident"" in their ability. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students' confidence and satisfaction with telemedicine improved after a standardized patient telemedicine experience in this study.

624705,Drug repositioning against COVID-19: a first line treatment,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND: Scarce data are available on what variables affect the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the development of symptomatic COVID-19, and, particularly, the relationship with viral load. We aimed to analyse data from linked index cases of COVID-19 and their contacts to explore factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this cohort study, patients were recruited as part of a randomised controlled trial done between March 17 and April 28, 2020, that aimed to assess if hydroxychloroquine reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 and their contacts were identified by use of the electronic registry of the Epidemiological Surveillance Emergency Service of Catalonia (Spain). Patients with COVID-19 included in our analysis were aged 18 years or older, not hospitalised, had quantitative PCR results available at baseline, had mild symptom onset within 5 days before enrolment, and had no reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections in their accommodation or workplace within the 14 days before enrolment. Contacts included were adults with a recent history of exposure and absence of COVID-19-like symptoms within the 7 days preceding enrolment. Viral load of contacts, measured by quantitative PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab, was assessed at enrolment, at day 14, and whenever the participant reported COVID-19-like symptoms. We assessed risk of transmission and developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics using regression analysis. We assessed the relationship of viral load and characteristics of cases (age, sex, number of days from reported symptom onset, and presence or absence of fever, cough, dyspnoea, rhinitis, and anosmia) and associations between risk of transmission and characteristics of the index case and contacts. FINDINGS: We identified 314 patients with COVID-19, with 282 (90%) having at least one contact (753 contacts in total), resulting in 282 clusters. 90 (32%) of 282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 17% (125 of 753 contacts), with a variation from 12% when the index case had a viral load lower than 1 × 10(6) copies per mL to 24% when the index case had a viral load of 1 × 10(10) copies per mL or higher (adjusted odds ratio per log(10) increase in viral load 1·3, 95% CI 1·1–1·5). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact (3·0, 1·59–5·65) and age of the contact (per year: 1·02, 1·01–1·04). 449 contacts had a positive PCR result at baseline. 28 (6%) of 449 contacts had symptoms at the first visit. Of 421 contacts who were asymptomatic at the first visit, 181 (43%) developed symptomatic COVID-19, with a variation from approximately 38% in contacts with an initial viral load lower than 1 × 10(7) copies per mL to greater than 66% for those with an initial viral load of 1 × 10(10) copies per mL or higher (hazard ratio per log(10) increase in viral load 1·12, 95% CI 1·05–1·20; p=0·0006). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5–10) for individuals with an initial viral load lower than 1 × 10(7) copies per mL to 6 days (4–8) for those with an initial viral load between 1 × 10(7) and 1 × 10(9) copies per mL, and 5 days (3–8) for those with an initial viral load higher than 1 × 10(9) copies per mL. INTERPRETATION: In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic COVID-19 was strongly associated with the viral load of contacts at baseline and shortened the incubation time of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner.

624797,Current strategies and opportunities to manufacture cells for modeling human lungs,2020-08-22,"Prior studies of clay–virus interactions have focused on the stability and infectivity of nonenveloped viruses, yielding contradictory results. We hypothesize that the surface charge distribution of the clay and virus envelope dictates how the components react and affect aggregation, viral stability, and infectivity. The bacteriophage Cystoviridae species φ6 used in this study is a good model for enveloped pathogens. The interaction between φ6 and montmorillonite (MMT) clay (the primary component of bentonite) is explored by transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that MMT–φ6 mixtures undergo heteroaggregation, forming structures in which virtually all the virions are either sequestered between MMT platelet layers or attached to platelet edges. The virions swell and undergo disassembly resulting in partial or total envelope loss. Edge-attached viral envelopes distort to increase contact area with the positively charged platelet edges indicating that the virion surface is negatively charged. The nucleocapsid (NCs) remaining after envelope removal also exhibit distortion, in contrast to detergent-produced NCs which exhibit no distortion. This visually discernible disassembly is a mechanism for loss of infectivity previously unreported by studies of nonenveloped viruses. The MMT-mediated sequestration and disassembly result in reduced infectivity, suggesting that clays may reduce infectivity of enveloped pathogenic viruses in soils and sediments.","Block, Karin A; Trusiak, Adrianna; Katz, Al; Gottlieb, Paul; Alimova, Alexandra; Wei, Hui; Morales, Jorge; Rice, William J; Steiner, Jeffrey C",Microbiologyopen,https://doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24357622/,19

625344,An aurora of natural products-based drug discovery is coming,2020-06-06,"BACKGROUND: A Hepatozoon parasite was initially reported from a cat in India in 1908 and named Leucocytozoon felis domestici. Although domestic feline hepatozoonosis has since been recorded from Europe, Africa, Asia and America, its description, classification and pathogenesis have remained vague and the distinction between different species of Hepatozoon infecting domestic and wild carnivores has been unclear. The aim of this study was to carry out a survey on domestic feline hepatozoonosis and characterize it morphologically and genetically. METHODS: Hepatozoon sp. DNA was amplified by PCR from the blood of 55 of 152 (36%) surveyed cats in Israel and from all blood samples of an additional 19 cats detected as parasitemic by microscopy during routine hematologic examinations. Hepatozoon sp. forms were also characterized from tissues of naturally infected cats. RESULTS: DNA sequencing determined that all cats were infected with Hepatozoon felis except for two infected by Hepatozoon canis. A significant association (p = 0.00001) was found between outdoor access and H. felis infection. H. felis meronts containing merozoites were characterized morphologically from skeletal muscles, myocardium and lungs of H. felis PCR-positive cat tissues and development from early to mature meront was described. Distinctly-shaped gamonts were observed and measured from the blood of these H. felis infected cats. Two fetuses from H. felis PCR-positive queens were positive by PCR from fetal tissue including the lung and amniotic fluid, suggesting possible transplacental transmission. Genetic analysis indicated that H. felis DNA sequences from Israeli cats clustered together with the H. felis Spain 1 and Spain 2 sequences. These cat H. felis sequences clustered separately from the feline H. canis sequences, which grouped with Israeli and foreign dog H. canis sequences. H. felis clustered distinctly from Hepatozoon spp. of other mammals. Feline hepatozoonosis caused by H. felis is mostly sub-clinical as a high proportion of the population is infected with no apparent overt clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: This study aimed to integrate new histopathologic, hematologic, clinical, epidemiological and genetic findings on feline hepatozoonosis and promote the understanding of this infection. The results indicate that feline infection is primarily caused by a morphologically and genetically distinct species, H. felis, which has predilection to infecting muscular tissues, and is highly prevalent in the cat population studied. The lack of previous comprehensively integrated data merits the redescription of this parasite elucidating its parasitological characteristics.","Baneth, Gad; Sheiner, Alina; Eyal, Osnat; Hahn, Shelley; Beaufils, Jean-Pierre; Anug, Yigal; Talmi-Frank, Dalit",Parasit Vectors,https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587213/,19

Accumulating evidence suggests that female scientists’ productivity dropped during the initial lockdown period. With more time being spent on caregiving responsibilities, women may be struggling to collaborate on grant applications and launch new experiments. Scientists with disabilities or who belong to Indigenous nations or communities of color may have less time to devote to research due to health, family, or community needs. Collateral damage in this situation, the appropriate integration of sex, gender, and other identity characteristics in research content may also suffer. Sex and gender are better attended to when female scientists form part of the research team. Research funding agencies have a role to play in mitigating these effects by putting in place gender equity policies that support all applicants and ensure research quality. Accordingly, a national health research funder implemented gender policy changes that included extending deadlines and factoring sex and gender into COVID-19 grant requirements. Following these changes, the funder received more applications from female scientists, awarded a greater proportion of grants to female compared to male scientists, and received and funded more grant applications that considered sex and gender in the content of COVID-19 research. Whether or not these strategies will be sufficient in the long-term to prevent widening of the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine requires continued monitoring and oversight. Further work is urgently required to mitigate inequities associated with identity characteristics beyond gender.","Witteman, Holly O.; Haverfield, Jenna; Tannenbaum, Cara",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.26.355206,19

In cancer patients, the expression of lectin‐type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX‐1) on granulocytic MDSC identifies a subset of MDSC that retains the most potent immunosuppressive properties. The main objective of the present work was to explore the presence of LOX‐1+ MDSC in bacterial and viral sepsis. To this end, whole blood LOX‐1+ cells were phenotypically, morphologically, and functionally characterized. They were monitored in 39 coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19, viral sepsis) and 48 septic shock (bacterial sepsis) patients longitudinally sampled five times over a 3 wk period in intensive care units (ICUs). The phenotype, morphology, and immunosuppressive functions of LOX‐1+ cells demonstrated that they were polymorphonuclear MDSC. In patients, we observed the significant emergence of LOX‐1+ MDSC in both groups. The peak of LOX‐1+ MDSC was 1 wk delayed with respect to ICU admission.

Intramedullary nailing is the gold standard treatment of this type of fracture. The aim of the study is to analyze the results obtained with the Elos Intrauma nail by the experience of two Departments of Orthopedics and Traumatology (“Guglielmo da Saliceto” Hospital in Piacenza and the Maggiore hospital in Bologna). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 400 patients with lateral femoral neck fracture surgically treated with Elos Intrauma standard nail. The examined period is from 1(st) Jannuary 2018 to 31(st) Dicember 2020. In all patients we implanted Elos® - Intrauma nail, a titanium cervical diaphyseal nail, according to the standard technique. RESULTS: We evaluate at a minumum of three months of follow up 286/400 patients. Average follow up was 3.94 months, minimum 3 months and maximum 24 months. We obtain the 96.85 % of fracture healing, recording 33 complications (11.54%). The incidence of surgical revision was 2.8% (8 cases). No mechanical complications was found in stable fractures treated with short nail and without distal locking. CONCLUSIONS: With the use of Elos nail we obtained 95% of radiographic healings within three months with a complication rate comparable to literature report. Distal locking is absolutely recommended in complex fractures, it may be superfluous after careful evaluation of the fracture pattern and morphological characteristics of the femur to be treated; future in-depth studies may narrow the criteria to choose distal locking or non locking.

628667,Enzymatic Assays to Explore Viral mRNA Capping Machinery,2021-08-03,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer treatments are increasingly based on therapeutic antibodies to clear tumors. While in vivo mouse models are useful to predict effectiveness of human antibodies it is not completely clear how useful these models are to test antibodies engineered with enhanced effector functions designed for humans. One of the changes considered for many new antibody-based drugs is the removal of fucose (resulting in afucosylated IgG) which enhances IgG-Fc receptor (FcγR) mediated effector functions in humans through FcγRIIIa. Here we show that afucosylated human IgG1 also have enhanced effector functions against peritoneal metastasis of melanoma cells in mice through the evolutionary related mouse FcγRIV. This shows that afucosylated human IgG is functionally recognized across species and shows that mouse tumor models can be used to assess the therapeutic potential of afucosylated IgG1. ABSTRACT: Promising strategies for maximizing IgG effector functions rely on the introduction of natural and non-immunogenic modifications. The Fc domain of IgG antibodies contains an N-linked oligosaccharide at position 297. Human IgG antibodies lacking the core fucose in this glycan have enhanced binding to human (FcγR) IIIa/b, resulting in enhanced antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity and phagocytosis through these receptors. However, it is not yet clear if glycan-enhancing modifications of human IgG translate into more effective treatment in mouse models. We generated humanized hIgG1-TA99 antibodies with and without core-fucose. C57Bl/6 mice that were injected intraperitoneally with B16F10-gp75 mouse melanoma developed significantly less metastasis outgrowth after treatment with afucosylated hIgG1-TA99 compared to mice treated with wildtype hhIgG1-TA99. Afucosylated human IgG1 showed stronger interaction with the murine FcγRIV, the mouse orthologue of human FcγRIIIa, indicating that this glycan change is functionally conserved between the species. In agreement with this, no significant differences were observed in tumor outgrowth in FcγRIV(-/-) mice treated with human hIgG1-TA99 with or without the core fucose. These results confirm the potential of using afucosylated therapeutic IgG to increase their efficacy. Moreover, we show that afucosylated human IgG1 antibodies act across species, supporting that mouse models can be suitable to test afucosylated antibodies.","Braster, Rens; Bögels, Marijn; Benonisson, Hreinn; Wuhrer, Manfred; Plomp, Rosina; Bentlage, Arthur E.

628815,Viral transport and the cytoskeleton,2001-02-01,"Wireless sensors networks (WSNs) are characterized by flexibility and scalability in any environment. These networks are increasingly used in agricultural and industrial environments and have a dual role in data collection from sensors and transmission to a monitoring system, as well as enabling the management of the monitored environment. Environment management depends on trust in the data collected from the surrounding environment, including the time of data creation. This paper proposes a trust model for monitoring humidity and moisture in agricultural and industrial environments. The proposed model uses a digital signature and public key infrastructure (PKI) to establish trust in the data source, i.e., the trust in the sensor. Trust in data generation is essential for real-time environmental monitoring and subsequent analyzes, thus timestamp technology is implemented here to further ensure that gathered data are not created or changed after the assigned time. Model validation is performed using the Castalia network simulator by testing energy consumption at the receiver and sender nodes and the delay incurred by creating or validating a trust token. In addition, validation is also performed using the Ascertia TSA Crusher application for the time consumed to obtain a timestamp from the free TSA. The results show that by applying different digital signs and timestamps, the trust entity of the WSN improved significantly with an increase in power consumption of the sender node by up to 9.3% and receiver node by up to 126.3% for a higher number of nodes, along with a packet delay of up to 15.6% and an average total time consumed up to 1.186 s to obtain the timestamp from the best chosen TSA, which was as expected.","Prodanović, Radomir; Sarang, Sohail; Rančić, Dejan; Vulić, Ivan; Stojanović, Goran M.; Stankovski, Stevan; Ostojić, Gordana; Baranovski, Igor; Maksović, Dušan",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34073687/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113636,19

To assess the telehealth implementation experiences of ambulatory personnel in different disciplines and their perspectives on potential telehealth disparities, and to make recommendations for more equitable telehealth delivery. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Clinic managers from geriatric medicine, internal medicine, and psychiatry e-mailed a survey to clinicians and staff regarding experiences with telehealth care delivery. Quantitative survey responses were analyzed with Fisher’s Exact tests. Qualitative responses were coded thematically. Recommendations were categorized by type of implementation strategy. Quantitative and qualitative findings on telehealth disparities were merged in a joint data display. Respondents (n = 147, 57% response rate) were distributed across three specialties: 66% internal medicine, 19% psychiatry, and 14% geriatric medicine. Prior to 2020, 77% of clinicians had never delivered telehealth services. By Spring 2020, 78% reported conducting more than half of clinic visits by telehealth. Among clinicians, 52% agreed/strongly agreed that rapid telehealth implementation exacerbated access to care disparities to: older adult patients, those with limited internet access, and those needing interpretation services. Staff expressed similar difficulties with telehealth set-up especially for these patients. To improve telehealth equity, clinicians recommended to: (i) change infrastructure; (ii) train and educate stakeholders; and (iii) support clinicians.

Current recommendations on infant care and feeding when mother has COVID-19 ranges from mother–infant separation and avoidance of human milk feeding, to initiation of early skin-to-skin contact and direct breastfeeding. Health care providers fearing risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) maternal–infant transmission may veer toward restricted breastfeeding practices. We reviewed guidelines and published literature and propose three options for infant feeding depending on various scenarios. Option A involves direct breastfeeding with the infant being cared for by the mother or caregiver. In option B, the infant is cared for by another caregiver and receives mother's expressed milk. In the third option, the infant is not breastfed directly and does not receive mother's expressed milk. We recommend joint decision making by parents and the health care team. This decision is also flexible as situation changes. We also provide a framework for counseling mothers on these options using a visual aid and a corresponding structured training program for health care providers. Future research questions are also proposed. We conclude that evidence and knowledge about COVID-19 and breastfeeding are still evolving. Our options can provide a quick and flexible reference guide that can be adapted to local needs. Key Points: SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely transmitted via human milk. A shared decision making on infant feeding is the preferred approach. Mothers can safely breastfeed with appropriate infection control measures.","Ng, Yvonne Peng Mei; Low, Yi Fen; Goh, Xin Lei; Fok, Doris; Amin, Zubair",Am J Perinatol,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1716506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32898920/,19
629472,Virus transmission by ultrasonic scaler and its prevention by antiviral agent,2021-02-13,"RESEARCH OBJECTIVE To investigate the extent to which telehealth visits mitigated COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts on in-person outpatient visits among Medicare beneficiaries, including those who are high-cost high-need. High-cost high-need patients were defined as those 65 years or older and with 2 or higher Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) scores. STUDY DESIGN A difference-in-difference design was used to estimate the change in outpatient in-person and telehealth utilization for the COVID-19 pandemic cohort compared to the control cohort in the prior year. POPULATION STUDIED Medicare patients from an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) were used as the study sample. The pandemic cohort was defined as those enrolled in the ACO in 2019-2020 (N = 21,361). The control cohort was defined as those enrolled in the ACO in 2018-2019 (N = 20,028). The study period was defined as April-September 2020 for the pandemic cohort and the same months in 2019 for the control cohort, with the preceding 12 months used as the baseline periods, respectively. Over 740,000 patient-month records were analyzed using logistic and negative binomial regressions. The models were adjusted for patient-level characteristics, including HCC scores, which reflect the complexity of patient health conditions and risk for future healthcare costs. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS The total number of outpatient encounters (in-person and telehealth) in both primary and specialty care decreased by 41.5% in April 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic period. Telehealth comprised 78% of all outpatient encounters in April 2020 but declined to 22% by the end of September 2020. Only about 40% of all patients had at least one telehealth encounter between April-September 2020. Compared to the control cohort, the pandemic cohort experienced a monthly average of 113 fewer primary care encounters per 1000 patients (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: [0.73, 0.77]) and 49 fewer specialty care encounters (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: [0.80, 0.85]) over the six-month study period. This represented a decline of 25.6% and 17.3% in primary care and specialty encounters, respectively, among high-cost high-need patients. High-cost high-need patients or those with disabilities were more likely to use telehealth and experienced a lesser reduction in outpatient care utilization than other Medicare beneficiaries (OR: 1.20 and 1.06). Medicare beneficiaries with dual Medicaid coverage, those of non-white race/ethnic groups, and those living in rural/suburban areas were less likely to use telehealth and experienced a greater reduction in total outpatient care (OR: 0.86, 0.96 and 0.90). CONCLUSIONS While there was a substantial significant increase in telehealth use in April 2020, utilization declined significantly during the six-month study period, and did not fully mitigate the decline in in-person outpatient visits resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. While high-cost high-need Medicare patients and those with disabilities were more likely to use telehealth, disparities in telehealth usage and reductions in outpatient care remain among low-income, non-white, and rural Medicare beneficiaries. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY OR PRACTICE Older patients insured by Medicare, including those with high-cost high-need or disabilities were able to make use of telehealth services for outpatient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health policies and interventions should target improving telehealth access and delivery for advancing sustainability and equity among Medicare beneficiaries.

629641,Automatically fixing errors in glycoprotein structures with Rosetta,2019-01-01,"Bovine viral diarrhea viruses (BVDV) have significant impact on beef and dairy production worldwide. The infections are widespread in the cattle populations, and in many production systems, vaccinations are utilized. BVDV strains have the hallmark of adversely affecting the immune system's many components, both the innate and acquired systems. While BVDV do cause primary infections and disease, their role in the pathogenesis of other agents underscores the complexity of viral–bacterial synergy. A greater understanding of the role of the persistently infected (PI) animal resulting from susceptible females infected at a critical stage of pregnancy has permitted acknowledgment of a major source of infection to susceptible animals.

Thus, a systematic review has been performed to define the role of D-dimer in the disease, the prevalence of DIC and the usefulness of anticoagulant treatment in these patients. A literature search was performed to analyze the studies of COVID-19 patients. Four recommendations were drawn based on expert opinion and scientific knowledge, according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The present review suggests the presence of higher levels of D-dimer in those with worse prognosis, there may be an overdiagnosis of DIC in the course of the disease and there is no evidence on the benefit of starting anticoagulant treatment based only on isolated laboratory data.","Moreno, G.; Carbonell, R.; Bodí, M.; Rodríguez, A.",Medicina Intensiva (English Edition),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2173572720302101; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2173572720302101,19

METHODS: We conducted descriptive and individually matched case-control studies using a nationwide register for COVID-19 testing of travelers from 3 August to 31 October 2020 at airport/port quarantine stations across Japan. Case patients, defined as travelers positive for COVID-19 on arrival, were individually matched with 4 controls for arrival date and airport or port. We assessed associations between test positivity and traveler characteristics using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 157 507 travelers arriving from 146 countries/areas at 17 quarantine stations across Japan were tested for COVID-19. The percentage of test positivity during the study period was 0.35%. In the case-control study, with 536 case patients and 2144 controls, we found evidence of lower test positivity in travelers aged 3–19 years, female travelers, and travel corridor users (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.36 [.22–.60], 0.71 [.56–.89], and 0.48 [.30–.77], respectively), whereas higher positivity was associated with arrival from South-East Asia (1.88 [1.33–2.65]) or lower-middle- or low-income countries (2.46 [1.69–3.58] and 7.25 [2.22–23.66], respectively), any symptom (4.08 [1.43–11.65]), and nasopharyngeal compared with saliva sampling (2.75 [1.85–4.09]). A higher 14-day average incidence in the countries of stay was also associated with higher test positivity (1.64 [1.16–2.33] and 3.13 [1.88–5.23] for those from countries and areas where the 14-day average incidence was from 10 to <100 and ≥100 cases per million, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings justify travel restrictions based on the epidemic situation in countries of stay, although underestimation of the epidemic in lower-income countries should be considered. A strict travel corridor could also reduce the risk of COVID-19 importation.","Tsuboi, Motoyuki; Hachiya, Masahiko; Ohtsu, Hiroshi; Akashi, Hidechika; Miyoshi, Chiaki; Umeda, Tamami",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318872/,19

632634,Infectious Hepatopathies in Dogs and Cats,2009-11-26,"Previous studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are closely related to many viral infections. However, the molecular mechanism of how miRNAs regulate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection remains unclear. In this study, we first constructed a PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cytopathic model to validate the relationship between miR-129a-3p expression levels and PEDV resistance. Secondly, we explored the effect of miR-129a-3p on PEDV infection by targeting the 3′UTR region of the ligand ectodysplasin (EDA) gene. Finally, transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the downstream regulatory mechanism of EDA. The results showed that after 48 h of PEDV infection, IPEC-J2 cells showed obvious pathological changes, and miR-129a-3p expression was significantly downregulated (p < 0.01). Overexpression of miR-129a-3p mimics inhibited PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells; silencing endogenous miR-129a-3p can promote viral replication. A dual luciferase assay showed that miR-129a-3p could bind to the 3′UTR region of the EDA gene, which significantly reduced the expression level of EDA (p < 0.01). Functional verification showed that upregulation of EDA gene expression significantly promoted PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells. Overexpression of miR-129a-3p can activate the caspase activation and recruitment domain 11 (CARD11) mediated NF-κB pathway, thus inhibiting PEDV replication. The above results suggest that miR-129a-3p inhibits PEDV replication in IPEC-J2 cells by activating the NF-κB pathway by binding to the EDA 3′UTR region. Our results have laid the foundation for in-depth study of the mechanism of miR-129a-3p resistance and its application in porcine epidemic diarrhea disease-resistance breeding.","Qi, Xiaoyi; Cao, Yue; Wu, Shenglong; Wu, Zhengchang; Bao, Wenbin",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360898/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158133,19

632982,A Balancing Act: MDA5 in Antiviral Immunity and Autoinflammation,2019-01-11,"Now it has been more than 12 months since the first cases of the new Corona virus variant SARS Cov2 have been detected in China. The first wave of the pandemic hit a lot of countries hard and many patients died. Not enough specialized equipment and limited knowledge of the disease added to the severity of this first phase. We all learned from our mistakes made during this first wave of the pandemic and due to that the confidence to be able to manage the second wave a lot better was high. Nevertheless, much higher infection numbers, more patients in ICUs and in some countries also more deaths were seen during the second wave. In this editorial we will describe the differences between the first and second wave from a European-German perspective and look at the impact it had on different parts of our lives. In general, some shortcomings were relatively easy to prevent from happening again. Basic equipment such as face masks, FFP2 masks and disinfectant is not an issue anymore. The respective political systems have solved that problem. Some countries also have learned from the first wave that prevention is the only option to reduce patient numbers hitting the hospitals and especially the ICUs. Due to those facts, most of the European countries now thought they could deal with higher infection numbers. This, however, was an erroneous belief. Theoretical constructs such as a “Lockdown light” have failed to prove successful. Finally, only a hard Lockdown can bring down numbers sufficiently. In Hospitals, the experience from the first wave helped to treat patients more effectively, leading to an improved infection number/death ratio. However, the political decision to react slow and sometimes only in increments and not with full force led to a huge increase in patient numbers and consecutively soaring numbers of cases needing treatment in hospitals and ICUs. While some countries managed this second wave a lot better than the first, Germany for example did not. Meanwhile more than 20 000 deaths compared to less than 10 000 in the entire first wave is a sure indication and it was certainly not caused by the medical performance in Hospitals being poorer the second time around. For Orthopaedic surgeons, the second wave led to the same restrictions as the first one. Again, they became part of the interdisciplinary COVID-19 teams on the wards and again, the numbers of elective surgeries plummeted dramatically. Financial consequences will remain throughout 2021. The second wave was a hard test for society, particularly as it hit its peak around Christmas time. Contact restrictions, closed hotels, forbidden fireworks at New Year all that is a challenge in particular for the younger people in the societies. All those restrictions, however, can never be an excuse for people delivering abstruse theories via social media or during demonstrations. Scientists all over the world deliver reliable information, these are the people to trust - they are the only experts. Some of them also successfully developed what we all hoped for – a vaccine. Although vaccination started some days back, it will take at least until autumn 2021 to have our normal lives back. Hopefully we all learned a lesson.","Graichen, Heiko",J Orthop,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0972978X21000118?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2021.01.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0972978X21000118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519131/,19
633330,Exploring targets and signaling pathways of paeonol involved in relieving inflammation based on modern technology,2021-08-31,"Sepsis is an extremely complex clinical syndrome, usually involving an excessive inflammatory response including an overshooting cytokine release that damages tissue and organs of the patient. Due to the severity of this condition, it is estimated that over 11 million people die from sepsis each year. Despite intensive research in the field, there is still no specific therapy for sepsis. Many sepsis patients show a marked deficiency of vitamin C. 9 out of 10 sepsis patients have a hypovitaminosis C, and every third patient even shows a clinical deficiency in the scurvy range. In addition, low vitamin C levels of intensive care sepsis patients correlate with a higher need for vasopressors, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, and increased mortality. Based on this observation and the conducted clinical trials using vitamin C as sepsis therapy in intensive care patients, the aim of the present ex vivo study was to evaluate the effects of high-dose vitamin C alone and in a triple combination supplemented with vitamin B1 (thiamine) and hydrocortisone on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human donors. We found that all corticosteroid combinations strongly reduced the cytokine response on RNA- and protein levels, while high-dose vitamin C alone significantly diminished the PBMC mediated secretion of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, IL-23, and monocyte chemo-attractant protein (MCP-1), which mediate the inflammatory response. However, vitamin C showed no enhancing effect on the secretion of further cytokines studied. This data provides important insights into the possible immunomodulatory function of vitamin C in an ex vivo setting of human PBMCs and the modulation of their cytokine profile in the context of sepsis. Since vitamin C is a vital micronutrient, the restoration of physiologically adequate concentrations should be integrated into routine sepsis therapy, and the therapeutic effects of supraphysiological concentrations of vitamin C in sepsis patients should be further investigated in clinical trials.","Lauer, Annie; Burkard, Markus; Niessner, Heike; Leischner, Christian; Renner, Olga; Vollbracht, Claudia; Michels, Holger; Busch, Christian; Sinnberg, Tobias; Venturelli, Sascha",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371879/,19

This history reviews developments in the field through the centuries and is writen so that it does not overlap the contribution to this series by Baker and Katz entitled ‘Childhood Vaccine Development in the United States.' Remarkable descriptions of selected pediatric infections existed long before the invention of printing, and early pediatric texts included many chapters devoted to various infections. Coincident with the establishment of pediatric organizations in America in the late 19(th) and early 20(th) Centuries, major attention was focused on diphtheria, infant diarrheal illnesses, tuberculosis, streptococcal infections and their complications, and other pediatric infections, and substantial progress was made. The American Pediatric Society (1888), the American Academy of Pediatrics (1930), the Society for Pediatric Research (1931), and the American Board of Pediatrics (1933) all contributed to the evolution of the discipline of Pediatric Infectious Disease, and numerous leaders of these organizations had significant infectious diseases interests. The establishment of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases sub-board, and an accreditation process for training programs, as well as sub-specialty textbooks and journal, further validated the development of this specialty, particularly in North America. The many remaining challenges related to infectious diseases in children (including HIV, emerging infections, antimicrobial resistance, opportunistic infections, and infections in the developing world) insure the future of the specialty. The genomic era of medicine and the tools of molecular biology will lead to new insights into pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of infections.

In recent years, epitope-based subunit vaccines have been introduced as a safer alternative to traditional vaccines. However, they suffer from limited immunogenicity. Nanotechnology has shown value in solving this issue. Different kinds of nanovaccines have been employed, among which virus-like nanoparticles (VLPs) and self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPNs) seem very promising. Recently, SAPNs have attracted special interest due to their unique properties, including molecular specificity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. They also resemble pathogens in terms of their size. Their multivalency allows an orderly repetitive display of antigens on their surface, which induces a stronger immune response than single immunogens. In vaccine design, SAPN self-adjuvanticity is regarded an outstanding advantage, since the use of toxic adjuvants is no longer required. SAPNs are usually composed of helical or β-sheet secondary structures and are tailored from natural peptides or de novo structures. Flexibility in subunit selection opens the door to a wide variety of molecules with different characteristics. SAPN engineering is an emerging area, and more novel structures are expected to be generated in the future, particularly with the rapid progress in related computational tools. The aim of this review is to provide a state-of-the-art overview of self-assembled peptide nanoparticles and their use in vaccine design in recent studies.

Methods Mixed-methods study of patients in an urban Toronto multidisciplinary Family Health Team who were between 20 weeks pregnant and 5 months postpartum from June to August 2020. Using a questionnaire and qualitative interviews, we explored psychosocial and behavioral impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including access to prenatal care, lifestyle changes, and strategies for mitigating distress. Results Forty-seven pregnant (and 62 postpartum individuals responded (response rate 52%)); 12 semi structured interviews were completed. Respondents indicated a loss of freedom (93%), lonely/lack of support (66%), and nearly/totally housebound (63%). About half (46-54%) were worried/very worried for themselves ortheir baby contracting COVID-19 and 13% scored > 13 on EPDS indicating depression. Helpful strategies included keeping busy (86%), exercise (84%), and talking to their healthcare provider (79%).

635791,The use of coiled-coil proteins in drug delivery systems,2009-12-25,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted daily-life activities around the world. Multiple countries and cities are implementing different mitigation strategies to reduce their transmission (e.g., physical distancing, stay-at-home orders, avoiding large gatherings). Such interventions have been related to positive and negative health externalities. Currently, the selection of mitigation strategies has not been systematically considering a long-term vision for urban health equity. This review presents evidence and a framework linking COVID-19 mitigation strategies, the built environment, and transport to health determinants and outcomes. In addition, the paper provides a set of urban interventions aimed at supporting COVID-19 mitigation strategies and promoting a long-term health equity vision. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, in addition to helping reduce disease transmission, have also decreased urban road transport, resulting in indirect benefits on air quality, traffic noise, and traffic incidents. On the other hand, the same mitigation strategies have had negative impacts on physical activity, mental health, home isolation, and access to transport options, among others. COVID-19 mitigation strategies are an opportunity to test and implement built environment and transport interventions aimed to maximize health equity and minimize health risks. National and local authorities should systematically integrate a long-term urban health equity vision when designing and implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies. SUMMARY: COVID-19 offers an opportunity to rethink the built environment and transport infrastructure with the aim to support short-term mitigation strategies and reduce long-term urban health inequities.

We infected fully differentiated human nasal epithelium cultures derived from healthy children (1-12 years old), young adults (26-34 years old) and older adults (56-62 years old) with SARS-COV-2 to identify age-related cell-intrinsic differences that may influence viral entry, replication and host defence response. We integrated imaging, transcriptomics, proteomics and biochemical assays revealing age-related changes in transcriptional regulation that impact viral replication, effectiveness of host responses and therapeutic drug targets. Viral load was lowest in infected older adult cultures despite the highest expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry and detection factors. We showed this was likely due to lower expression of hijacked host machinery essential for viral replication. Unlike the nasal epithelium of young adults and children, global host response and induction of the interferon signalling was profoundly impaired in older adults, which preferentially expressed proinflammatory cytokines mirroring the “cytokine storm” seen in severe COVID-194,5. In silico screening of our virus-host-drug network identified drug classes with higher efficacy in older adults. Collectively, our data suggests that cellular alterations that occur during ageing impact the ability for the host nasal epithelium to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection which could guide future therapeutic strategies.","Capraro, Alexander; Wong, Sharon L; Adhikari, Anurag; Allan, Katelin M; Patel, Hardip R; Zhong, Ling; Raftery, Mark; Jaffe, Adam; Yeang, Malinna; Aggarwal, Anupriya; Wu, Lindsay; Pandzic, Elvis; Whan, Renee M; Turville, Stuart; Vittorio, Orazio; Bull, Rowena A; Kaakoush, Nadeem; Rawlinson, William D; Tedla, Nicodemus; Vafaee, Fatemeh; Waters, Shafagh A",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.05.437453,19

This study compared the mental health condition of residents in the epicenter province of Hubei with that of other Chinese residents during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, and to examine emerging issues revolving around health disparities in disease prevention. A survey was administered in February 2020 to 433 Chinese adults spanning 28 regions across China. Participants residing in Hubei reported lower levels of affective and cognitive well-being than those in other regions. Perceived behavioral control and healthy lifestyle maintenance were associated with both dimensions of well-being and sleep quality for all participants. Income level was positively associated with facemask use and healthy lifestyle maintenance. These results indicate that Hubei residents reported poorer mental health than those of other regions, but perceived behavioral control and healthy lifestyle maintenance correlate with better mental health across regions. The likelihood of undertaking preventive measures for COVID-19 tends to be greater among residents with higher income, reflecting the need to address the oft-neglected concerns of health disparities in preventing this highly contagious novel disease.","Cheng, Cecilia; Wang, Hsin-yi; Chau, Chor-lam",Psychiatry Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016517812100367X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114070; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016517812100367X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217100/,19
636528,Autologous Antibody Capture to Enrich Immunogenic Viruses for Viral Discovery,2013-11-04,PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ocular surface is a potential site of ocular involvement by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a review of the literature to understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 disease manifestations on the ocular surface as well as to elucidate emerging treatment patterns and practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: The ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are likely limited to a mild and transient conjunctivitis. Other manifestations have not been validated in larger cohorts. Ocular surface tissue should be considered potentially infectious due to the presence of host receptors on surface tissues. The availability of donor tissue in lower-middle income countries has been greatly impacted by the pandemic and would benefit from further investigation into transmissibility through donor tissue. SUMMARY: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the ocular surface has yet to be confirmed. The most common ocular manifestation is a mild conjunctivitis. Ocular surface surgeons face specific challenges in the use of donor tissues and aerosolizing procedures and have adapted practice patterns accordingly.,"Bal, Sila; Chodosh, James; Venkateswaran, Nandini",Curr Ophthalmol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40135-021-00271-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377601/,19

637319,The endoplasmic reticulum—Golgi intermediate compartment,1992-08-31,"Background: Lymphopenia due to a plummeting T-cell count is a major feature of severe COVID-19. T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and TL shortens with age. Older persons are disproportionally affected by severe COVID-19, and we hypothesized that those with short TL have less capacity to mount an adequate T-cell proliferative response to SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis predicts that among older patients with COVID-19, shorter telomeres of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be associated with a lower lymphocyte count. Methods: Our sample comprised 17 COVID-19 and 21 non-COVID-19 patients, aged 87(8) (mean(SD)) and 87 (9) years, respectively. We measured TL by the Telomere Shortest Length Assay, a novel method that measures and tallies the short telomeres directly relevant to telomere-mediated biological processes. The primary analysis quantified TL as the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases. For comparison, we also quantified TL by Southern blotting, which measures the mean length of telomeres. Results: Lymphocyte count (109/L) was 0.91 (0.42) in COVID-19 patients and 1.50(0.50) in non-COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). In COVID-19 patients, but not in non-COVID-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kilobases (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with the mean of telomeres measured by TeSLA (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte counts showed no statistically significant correlations with Southern blotting results in COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that a compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response contributes to lymphopenia and the resulting disproportionate severity of COVID-19 among old adults. We infer that infection with SARS-CoV-2 uncovers the limits of the TL reserves of older persons.","Benetos, A.; Lai, T.-P.; Toupance, S.; Labat, C.; Verhulst, S.; Perret-Guillaume, C.; Gautier, S.; Ungeheuer, M.-N.; Levy, D.; Susser, E.; Aviv, A.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.20205393v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.01.20205393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024983/,19

The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and early outcomes of a European cohort of liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: We conducted an international prospective study across Europe on liver transplant recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by microbiological assay during the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, management of immunosuppressive therapy and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 57 patients were included (70% male, median (IQR) age at diagnosis 65 (57–70) years). 21 (37%), 32 (56%) and 21 (37%) patients had one cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, respectively. The most common symptoms were fever (79%), cough (55%), dyspnoea (46%), fatigue or myalgia (56%) and GI symptoms (33%). Immunosuppression was reduced in 22 recipients (37%) and discontinued in 4 (7%). With this regard, no impact on outcome was observed. Forty-one (72%) subjects were hospitalised and 11 (19%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, we estimated a case fatality rate of 12% (95% CI 5% to 24%), which increased to 17% (95% CI 7% to 32%) among hospitalised patients. Five out of the seven patients who died had a history of cancer. CONCLUSION: In this European multicentre prospective study of liver transplant recipients, COVID-19 was associated with an overall and in-hospital fatality rate of 12% (95% CI 5% to 24%) and 17% (95% CI 7% to 32%), respectively.

This research introduces the Great Recession Index (GRI), a place-based composite measure that captures the multidimensional nature of the GR. The GRI can be used to examine macro-level outcomes and is especially well-suited for examining the spatial variation and longterm effects of the GR. The GRI is adaptable to a variety of geospatial units of analysis, and in this article, we develop measures for countries, U.S. states, and U.S. metropolitan areas. Then, using the state-based GRI, we provide a research application to demonstrate the utility of the GRI for explaining state-level income inequality in the post-Recession period. The results show that the initial shock of the GR decreased the income share of upper-class households, but the aftershock of the Recession increased their income share, resulting in increased income inequality in the U.S. since the Recession. This paper concludes by considering the feasibility of using similar measures for evaluating the effects of catastrophic events such as wars, civil unrest, climate change, natural disasters, or pestilence on societal outcomes.","Wallace, Michael; Li, Angran; Hyde, Allen",Soc Indic Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02799-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629685/,19

The present study examined age differences in pandemic-related stress and social ties, and links with psychological well-being. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants included 645 adults (43% women) ages 18 to 97 (M = 50.8; SD = 17.7) from the May 2020 nationally representative Survey of Consumers. Participants reported the extent to which they felt stress related to the pandemic in the last month, the extent to which their lives had changed due to the pandemic, as well as social isolation, negative relationship quality, positive relationship quality, and frequency of depression, anxiety and rumination in the past week. RESULTS: Results showed that older people reported less pandemic-related stress, less life change, less social isolation, and lower negative relationship quality than younger people. Greater pandemic-related stress, life change, social isolation, and negative relationship quality were associated with poorer psychological well-being. Poorer social ties (i.e., greater social isolation, and negative quality) exacerbated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (stress, life change) on psychological well-being. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Researchers have indicated that older adults may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic-related stress and social isolation, but this study indicates that young adults may be relatively more vulnerable. Because isolation and negative relationship quality appear to exacerbate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, reducing social isolation and negative relations are potential targets for intervention.","Birditt, Kira S; Turkelson, Angela; Fingerman, Karen L; Polenick, Courtney A; Oya, Akari",Gerontologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346806/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa204,19

It has stretched to the limit acute care systems, indirectly it has shaped new and innovative ways to deliver care for those with chronic conditions. Herein we describe initial outcomes of the rapid virtualization of the Heart Function Clinic at a major quaternary Hospital in Toronto, Ontario. Methods Consecutive patients attending the heart function clinic at the Toronto General Hospital between March 9, 2020 and June 30, 2020 were included. Visits were classified as “in-person” if patients were physically present for the clinical interaction and “virtual” if the clinical interaction occurred while the patient was away using currently available modes of communication: telephone or web-enabled (Ontario Telemedicine Network -OTN, or other available web-based applications). The purpose of the individual visit was categorized as: “surveillance”, “titration”, “new assessment” or “Clinical trial”. Results A total of 292 patients had a total of 521 clinical encounters during the lockdown period. Of these, 168 (32.2%) were “in-person”, while 353 (67.8%) were “virtual”. 101 (19.3%) were primarily for the purposes of titration. These virtual assessments led to 14(2.7%) in-person assessments. 258 (49.5%) of patients had an LVEF < 40%, among these patients 220 (85.3%) were on an ACEi, ARB or ARNi, 242 (93.8%) on a Betablocker, 191 (74%) on an MRA, 46 (17.8%) on SGLT2inhibitor. Conclusion Rapid virtualization of a large academic multi-disciplinary clinic is possible. This allows for ongoing delivery of safe care to patients with chronic conditions and can be used as a model for other clinics facing the pandemic. Lessons learned will be used to transition to a hybrid model of in-person and virtual even after the pandemic has come to an end.","Linghorne, M.; O'Sullivan, M.; Moayedi, Y.; Aleksova, N.; Delgado, D.; Luk, A.

639493,Mechanochemical Preparation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Monitored by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy,2020-10-30,"BACKGROUND: Provision of contraception to women in the immediate postnatal period has been endorsed by professional bodies, to reduce the incidence of short inter-pregnancy intervals. This study examined the views of postnatal women and practising midwives regarding provision of contraceptive advice and contraceptive methods by midwives, in a region of the United Kingdom. METHODS: A mixed-method approach using qualitative interviews with midwives, and a postnatal survey followed by qualitative interviews with postnatal women, in five hospitals in the East of England. Twenty-one practising midwives and ten women were interviewed. Two hundred and twenty-seven women returned a survey. Survey data was analysed descriptively, augmented by Student’s t-tests and Chi-squared tests to examine associations within the data. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed guided by the phases of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Midwives and women supported the concept of increased midwifery provision of contraceptive advice, and provision of contraceptive methods in the postnatal period. Convenience and an established trusting relationship were reasons for preferring midwifery provision over visiting a doctor for contraception. The best time for detailed discussion was reported to be antenatal and community visits. The Progesterone-only-pill (POP) was the method, in which women indicated most interest postnatally. Concerns for midwives included the need for increased education on contraceptive methods and training in supplying these. Structural barriers to such provision were time pressures, low prioritisation of contraceptive training and disputes over funding. CONCLUSIONS: Women reported interest in midwives supplying contraceptive methods and expressed the view that this would be convenient and highly acceptable. Midwives are supportive of the concept of providing enhanced contraceptive advice and methods to women in their care, and believe that it would be advantageous for women. Institutional support is required to overcome structural barriers such as poor access to continuous professional development, and to allow contraceptive provision to be fully recognised as integral to the midwifery role, rather than a marginalised addition.

Since viruses depend on the host cell to obtain the macromolecules needed for their proper replication, they have evolved numerous strategies to shape cellular metabolism and the biosynthesis machinery of the host according to their specific needs. Technologies for the rigorous analysis of metabolic alterations in cells have recently become widely available and have greatly expanded our knowledge of these crucial host–pathogen interactions. We have learned that most viruses enhance specific anabolic pathways and are highly dependent on these alterations. Since uninfected cells are far more plastic in their metabolism, targeting of the virus-induced metabolic alterations is a promising strategy for specific antiviral therapy and has gained great interest recently. In this review, we summarize the current advances in our understanding of metabolic adaptations during viral infections, with a particular focus on the utilization of this information for therapeutic application.","Mayer, Katharina A.; Stöckl, Johannes; Zlabinger, Gerhard J.; Gualdoni, Guido A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333664/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01533,19

The study is focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), a trace gas which can be related to emissions from industrial activities, heating, and transportation. The investigation is based on in situ observations from local Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) and mobile remote sensing observations by Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. We also show results of the NO(2) vertical column measured by TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument), a space instrument onboard of satellite mission Sentinel-5P, to complement local ground-based measurements. For in situ observations, the lockdown interval (23 March 2020–15 May 2020) was separated from normal periods. The decrease in local NO(2) concentration during lockdown, measured in situ, is rather small, of about 10–40% at the most, is observed only at some stations, and is better seen during workdays than during weekends. We conclude that the decrease in NO(2) content over Galati city during lockdown is relatively small and may be attributed to the reduction in local traffic, a consequence of special measures and restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 lockdown by the Romanian authorities.","Roșu, Adrian; Constantin, Daniel-Eduard; Voiculescu, Mirela; Arseni, Maxim; Roșu, Bogdan; Merlaud, Alexis; Van Roozendael, Michel; Georgescu, Puiu Lucian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440815/,19

640785,Liquid Biomolecular Condensates and Viral Lifecycles: Review and Perspectives,2021-02-25,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small non-coding RNAs expressed by almost all metazoans, have key roles in the regulation of cell differentiation, organism development and gene expression. Thousands of miRNAs regulating approximately 60 % of the total human genome have been identified. They regulate genetic expression either by direct cleavage or by translational repression of the target mRNAs recognized through partial complementary base pairing. The active and functional unit of miRNA is its complex with Argonaute proteins known as the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). De-regulated miRNA expression in the human cell may contribute to a diverse group of disorders including cancer, cardiovascular dysfunctions, liver damage, immunological dysfunction, metabolic syndromes and pathogenic infections. Current day studies have revealed that miRNAs are indeed a pivotal component of host-pathogen interactions and host immune responses toward microorganisms. miRNA is emerging as a tool for genetic study, therapeutic development and diagnosis for human pathogenic infections caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. Many pathogens can exploit the host miRNA system for their own benefit such as surviving inside the host cell, replication, pathogenesis and bypassing some host immune barriers, while some express pathogen-encoded miRNA inside the host contributing to their replication, survival and/or latency. In this review, we discuss the role and significance of miRNA in relation to some pathogenic viruses.","Ojha, Chet Raj; Rodriguez, Myosotys; Dever, Seth M.; Mukhopadhyay, Rita; El-Hage, Nazira",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27784307/,19
641159,"The Role of Genomics in the Identification, Prediction, and Prevention of Biological Threats",2009-10-26,"AIMS: This study examined the predictors of student nurses’ intention to vaccinate against COVID‐19. We measured the nursing students’ risk perceptions, anxiety, fears and beliefs on COVID‐19 vaccine; attitudes towards it and vaccine literacy (VL). DESIGN: This study is a multi‐university study utilizing the quantitative, cross‐sectional and predictive approach. METHODS: Using convenience sampling (n = 1170), we surveyed 10 Saudi universities from November 26, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Forward stepwise multinomial logistic regression was performed in identifying the factors predicting student nurses’ intention to vaccinate against COVID‐19. RESULTS: The overall mean in the risk perception, anxiety and fear was 9.59 (SD = 2.82, possible range = 1–15), 3.95 (SD = 4.77, possible range = 0–20) and 18.17 (SD = 6.65, possible range = 7–35) respectively. They also reported a mean of 29.90 (SD = 6.56, possible range = 8–40) on COVID‐19 belief. COVID‐19 positive and negative attitudes mean score was 3.64 (SD = 0.92) and 2.72 (SD = 0.90) in a 1–4 range of scores respectively. The functional and interactive‐critical COVID‐19 VL of the students were at moderate levels. More than half of the respondents (55.9%) intended to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, 17.6% did not intend to do so and 26.5% were unsure. High‐risk perceptions, low levels of COVID‐19 anxiety, positive beliefs and attitudes towards COVID‐19 vaccine, and high levels of interactive‐critical COVID‐19 VL were significant predictors of student nurses’ intentions to vaccinate against COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Policymakers could consider the factors identified in this study and why the students did not intend to receive the vaccine in planning a nationwide vaccination program. The colleges of nursing could also utilize the findings in developing educational programs that aim to improve VL and beliefs and attitudes towards COVID‐19 vaccine.","Alshehry, Abdualrahman Saeed; Cruz, Jonas Preposi; Alquwez, Nahed; Alsharari, Abdalkarem F.; Tork, Hanan M.

In Europe, the question is not just about the total supply of foods, but it includes even the accessibility of prices and their nutritional and qualitative adequacy. In this context many countries recognize the importance of trade policies to ensure adequate levels of food security. The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of trade openness on the level of food security in European countries, using a dynamic panel analysis with the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. We selected two different indicators of food security (average protein supply, average dietary energy supply adequacy) capable of offering information both on the quantity and on the nutritional quality of the food supply. In order to improve the robustness of the empirical results, we developed three different regressions, with three trade openness indicators (trade openness, tariff, globalization) for each food security indicator. The results showed that commercial opening has, on average, a statistically significant net positive impact on the food security of European countries. Additional results indicate that also economic development, together with the importance of the agricultural sector, can improve food security levels.","Fusco, Giulio; Coluccia, Benedetta; De Leo, Federica",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32560272/,19

Yet, its pathogenesis is still not completely understood. Although there have been numerous studies on host transcriptional response to EBOV, with an emphasis on the clinical features, the impact of EBOV infection on post-transcriptional regulatory elements, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), remains largely unexplored. MiRNAs are involved in inflammation and immunity and are believed to be important modulators of the host response to viral infection. Here, we have used small RNA sequencing (sRNA-Seq), qPCR and functional analyses to obtain the first comparative miRNA transcriptome (miRNome) of a human liver cell line (Huh7) infected with one of the following three EBOV strains: Mayinga (responsible for the first Zaire outbreak in 1976), Makona (responsible for the West Africa outbreak in 2013–2016) and the epizootic Reston (presumably innocuous to humans). Our results highlight specific miRNA-based immunity pathways and substantial differences between the strains beyond their clinical manifestation and pathogenicity. These analyses shed new light into the molecular signature of liver cells upon EBOV infection and reveal new insights into miRNA-based virus attack and host defense strategy.","Diallo, Idrissa; Ho, Jeffrey; Laffont, Benoit; Laugier, Jonathan; Benmoussa, Abderrahim; Lambert, Marine; Husseini, Zeinab; Soule, Geoff; Kozak, Robert; Kobinger, Gary P.; Provost, Patrick",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917562/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073792,19

Although COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the lungs with florid respiratory manifestations, there are increasing reports of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and thromboembolic complications. Developing an effective and reliable vaccine was emergently pursued to control the catastrophic spread of the global pandemic. We report a fatal case of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. We attribute this fatal thrombotic condition to the vaccine due to the remarkable temporal relationship. The proposed mechanism of VITT is production of rogue antibodies against platelet factor-4 resulting in massive platelet aggregation. Healthcare providers should be aware of the possibility of such fatal complication, and the vaccine recipients should be warned about the symptoms of VITT.","Aladdin, Yasser; Algahtani, Hussein; Shirah, Bader",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305721003414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171649/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305721003414; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105938,19

This, along with emerging research and clinical findings, supported broader uptake of HCQ as a potential treatment for COVID-19 globally at the beginning of the pandemics. Therefore, many COVID-19 patients have been or will be exposed to HCQ, including specific populations with underlying intrinsic and/or extrinsic characteristics that may affect the disposition and drug actions of HCQ. It is critical to update our PBPK model of HCQ with adequate drug absorption and disposition mechanisms to support optimal dosing of HCQ in these specific populations. We conducted relevant in vitro and in vivo experiments to support HCQ PBPK model update. Different aspects of this model are validated using PK study from 11 published references. With parameterization informed by results from monkeys, a permeability-limited lung model is employed to describe HCQ distribution in the lung tissues. The updated model is applied to optimize HCQ dosing regimens for specific populations, including those taking concomitant medications. In order to meet predefined HCQ exposure target, HCQ dose may need to be reduced in young children, elderly subjects with organ impairment and/or coadministration with a strong CYP2C8/CYP2D6/CYP3A4 inhibitor, and be increased in pregnant women. The updated HCQ PBPK model informed by new metabolism and distribution data can be used to effectively support dosing recommendations for clinical trials in specific COVID-19 patients and treatment of patients with malaria or autoimmune diseases.","Zhang, Miao; Yao, Xueting; Hou, Zhe; Guo, Xuan; Tu, Siqi; Lei, Zihan; Yu, Zhiheng; Liu, Xuanlin; Cui, Cheng; Chen, Xijing; Shen, Ning; Song, Chunli; Qiao, Jie; Xiang, Xiaoqiang; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Dongyang",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.585021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643034/,19

Although passively delivered neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require monocytes for therapeutic efficacy. Thus, potently neutralizing mAbs require Fc effector functions for maximal therapeutic benefit during therapy to modulate protective immune responses and mitigate lung disease.","Winkler, Emma S.; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Yu, Jinsheng; Bailey, Adam L.; Chen, Rita E.; Zost, Seth J.; Jang, Hyesun; Huang, Ying; Allen, James D.; Case, James Brett; Sutton, Rachel E.; Carnahan, Robert H.; Darling, Tamarand L.; Boon, Adrianus C.

To investigate SCoV S protein, full-length and individual domains of S protein were expressed on the surface of insect cells and were characterized for cleavability and reactivity with serum samples obtained from patients during the convalescent phase of SARS. S protein could be cleaved by exogenous trypsin but not by coexpressed furin, suggesting that the protein is not normally processed during infection. Reactivity was evident by both flow cytometry and Western blot assays, but the pattern of reactivity varied according to assay and sequence of the antigen. The antibody response to SCoV S protein involves antibodies to both linear and conformational epitopes, with linear epitopes associated with the carboxyl domain and conformational epitopes associated with the amino terminal domain. Recombinant SCoV S protein appears to be a suitable antigen for the development of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic test for SARS, but our data suggest that assay format and choice of S antigen are important considerations.","Yao, Yong Xiu; Ren, Junyuan; Heinen, Paul; Zambon, Maria; Jones, Ian M.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15195247/,19

644056,Methods to Study Viruses,2017-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Hospital admissions due to the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are costly for individuals and health services. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is known to reduce hospital readmissions when delivered after hospitalization, but the uptake and completion of PR following hospitalization remains poor (<10% of those eligible in the UK audit data). A web-based platform of the SPACE (Self-management Program of Activity Coping and Education) for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) has previously shown promising results in patients with stable COPD but has not been tested following an AECOPD. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a web-based self-management program. METHODS: A nonrandomized feasibility study for patients with confirmed AECOPD who were deemed web literate was conducted. All patients consented during their hospitalization and received access to the website following discharge in addition to usual care. The program aims to facilitate patients to better understand and manage their condition through education and home-based exercises. Participants were asked to complete the Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months. A total of 14 participants were also interviewed (n=8 completers; n=6 noncompleters) regarding their experiences with the web-based program and trial. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 2080 patients were screened for eligibility, of which 100 patients (age: mean 71.2 years, SD 9.3 years; male: 55/100, 55%; forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ratio: mean 0.46, SD 0.14; pack-years: mean 50.2, SD 31.0; current smokers: 35/100, 35%) were recruited (4.8% of those screened). The main reason for ineligibility was a lack of web literacy (1366/1980, 68.98%). In total, 18% (18/100) of patients had completed the web program by 6 months, with others still registered in the program (27/100, 27%), and more than half did not register (55/100, 55%). There was a mean change in Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire scores at 6 months of 7.8 (SD 10.2) points. Qualitative interviews identified three main themes: preparing for, engagement with, and benefits of the study and program. A total of 57% (57/100) accepted a referral to PR on discharge and 19% (19/100) had completed the program after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the challenges of recruiting, retaining, and engaging participants in a web-based self-management program, it is not a feasible approach to roll out widely. This study acknowledges that this is a challenging time for patients with an AECOPD to engage in exercise and self-management education. However, for patients who were able to engage in such an intervention, the completion rate of PR was double the previous audit estimates from the United Kingdom, disease knowledge improved, and the intervention was of value to patients.

645670,A SH3_5 Cell Anchoring Domain for Non-recombinant Surface Display on Lactic Acid Bacteria,2021-01-27,"Capsule endoscopy (CE) emerged out of the pressing clinical need to image the small bowel (SB) in cases of midgut bleeding and provide an overall comfortable and reliable gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis 1 . Since its wider adoption in clinical practice, significant progress has been made in several areas including software development, hardware features and clinical indications, while innovative applications of CE never cease to appear 2 3 . Currently, several manufacturers provide endoscopic capsules with more or less similar technological features 4 . Although there is engaging and continuous academic and industry-fueled R&D, promising furtherment of CE technology 4 5 , the current status of clinical CE remains that of by and large an imaging modality. Clinical relevance of CE images is cornerstone in the decision-making process for medical management. In one of the larger to date SB CE studies, 4,206 abnormal images were detected in 3,280 patients 6 . Thus, CE leads to the identification of a large amount of potential pathology, some of which are pertinent (or relevant) while some (probably the majority) are not. Soon artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to carry out several roles currently performed by humans; in fact, we are witnessing only the first stages of a transition in the clinical adoption of AI-based solutions in several aspects of gastroenterology including CE 7 . Until then though, human-based decision-making profoundly impacts patient care and – although not suggested in the updated European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) European curriculum 8 9 – it should be an integral part of CE training. Frequently, interpretation of CE images by experts or at least experienced readers differs. In a tandem CE reading study, expert review of discordant cases revealed a 50 % (13/25 discordant results) error rate by experienced readers, corresponding (in 5/13 cases) to ‘over-classification’ of an irrelevant abnormality 10 . Another comparative study showed an ‘over-classification’ of such irrelevant abnormalities in ~10 % of CE readings 11 . One thing which has been for a while on the table – in relation to optimizing and/or standardizing CE reporting and subsequent decision-making – is the need for reproducible scoring systems and for a reliable common language among clinicians responsible for further patient’s management. Over the years, several of these scoring systems were developed while others appear in the wake of software and hardware improvements aiming to replace and/or complement their predecessors. This review presents a comprehensive account of the currently available classification/scoring systems in clinical CE spanning from predicting the bleeding potential of identified SB lesions (with emphasis on vascular lesions), and the individual rebleeding risk; scoring systems for the prediction of SB lesions in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGlB), having the potential to improve patient selection and rationalize the use of enteroscopy, with better allocation of resources, optimized diagnostic workflow and tailored treatment. This review also includes scores for reporting the inflammatory burden, the cleansing level that underscores confidence in CE reporting and the mass or bulge question in CE. Essentially, the aim is to become a main text for reference when scoring is required and facilitate the inclusion of -through readiness of access- one of the other in the final report.","Rosa, Bruno; Margalit-Yehuda, Reuma; Gatt, Kelly; Sciberras, Martina; Girelli, Carlo; Saurin, Jean-Christophe; Valdivia, Pablo Cortegoso; Cotter, Jose; Eliakim, Rami; Caprioli, Flavio; Baatrup, Gunnar; Keuchel, Martin; Ellul, Pierre; Toth, Ervin; Koulaouzidis, Anastasios",Endosc Int Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079861/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1372-4051,19

The purpose of this research was to report on the student experience of the integration of VR education for both medical imaging (MI) and radiation therapy (RT) students in learning computed tomography (CT) scanning. METHODS: A survey was performed to evaluate students’ perceived confidence in performing diagnostic and planning CT scans in the clinical environment following VR CT simulation tutorials. Students from both MI and RT participated in providing quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: The MI students (n = 28) and RT students (n = 38) provided quantitative results linking their engagement (perceived usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment) with their perceived confidence. The 15 (54%) MI students who recorded a maximum engagement score had a mean confidence score 1.02 higher than the students not fully engaged (Fisher’s exact test 14.549, P = 0.00). The results from the RT cohort revealed 68% of students agreed or strongly agreed to the addition of VR CT simulation helping in the learning of CT. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the integration of innovative learning opportunities such as VR CT simulation has the potential to increase student confidence and improve student preparation for the clinical environment.","Gunn, Therese; Rowntree, Pamela; Starkey, Deborah; Nissen, Lisa",J Med Radiat Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000561/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmrs.436,19

Though only a small percentage of infected individuals reach the critical stage of the disease, i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), this percentage represents a significant number of patients that can overwhelm the healthcare system. Patients presenting with ARDS need mechanical ventilation, as their lungs are unable to oxygenate blood on their own due to fluid accumulation. One way to manage this excess pressure of fluid build-up around the lung tissues is to relieve the dorsal alveoli by prompting the patient to lie face down on the stomach; this is called awake proning. It is a procedure that is directed towards the recruitment of lung parenchyma when infected with pneumonia or when the condition has worsened into ARDS. This helps in relieving the pressure from the dorsal lung surface that has markedly higher perfusion than the ventral surface. Awake proning delays the use of mechanical ventilation and facilitates the patients with severe ARDS or severe pneumonia in maintaining the supply of oxygen to the body tissues. Since medical institutes are overburdened and limited ventilators are available, awake proning can reduce not only the burden on hospitals but also decrease the need for ventilators.","Khan, Sheharyar; Choudry, Erum; Mahmood, Syed Uzair; Mulla, Aisha Y; Mehwish, Syeda",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32775071/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8989,19

Laboratory testing is required to definitively distinguish infecting influenza virus from other pathogens, resulting in prolonged emergency department (ED) visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. Recently available rapid point‐of‐care tests (POCT) may allow for appropriate use of antiviral and antibiotic treatments and decrease patient lengths of stay. We undertook a systematic review to assess the effect of POCT for influenza on three outcomes: (1) antiviral prescription, (2) antibiotic prescription, and (3) patient length of stay in the ED. The databases Medline and Embase were searched using MeSH terms and keywords for influenza, POCT, antivirals, antibiotics, and length of stay. Amongst 245 studies screened, 30 were included. The majority of papers reporting on antiviral prescription found that a positive POCT result significantly increased use of antivirals for influenza compared with negative POCT results and standard supportive care. A positive POCT result also led to decreased antibiotic use. The results of studies assessing the effect of POCT on ED length of stay were not definitive. The studies assessed in this systematic review support the use of POCT for diagnosis of influenza in patients suffering an acute respiratory infection. Diagnosis using POCT may lead to more appropriate prescription of treatments for infectious agents. Further studies are needed to assess the effect of POCT on the length of stay in ED.","Egilmezer, Ece; Walker, Gregory J.; Bakthavathsalam, Padmavathy; Peterson, Joshua R.; Gooding, J.

648356,Establishment of serological test to detect antibody against ferret coronavirus,2016-03-03,"Non-communicable diseases (NCD) represent an increasing global challenge with the majority of mortality occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Concurrently, many humanitarian crises occur in these countries and the number of displaced persons, either refugees or internally displaced, has reached the highest level in history. Until recently NCDs in humanitarian contexts were a neglected issue, but this is changing. Humanitarian actors are now increasingly integrating NCD care in their activities and recognizing the need to harmonize and enhance NCD management in humanitarian crises. However, there is a lack of a standardized response during operations as well as a lack of evidence-based NCD management guidelines in humanitarian settings. An informal working group on NCDs in humanitarian settings, formed by members of the World Health Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross and others, and led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, teamed up with the University of Geneva and Geneva University Hospitals to develop operational considerations for NCDs in humanitarian settings. This paper presents these considerations, aiming at ensuring appropriate planning, management and care for NCD-affected persons during the different stages of humanitarian emergencies. Key components include access to treatment, continuity of care including referral pathways, therapeutic patient education/patient self-management, community engagement and health promotion. In order to implement these components, a standardized approach will support a consistent response, and should be based on an ethical foundation to ensure that the “do no harm” principle is upheld. Advocacy supported by evidence is important to generate visibility and resource allocation for NCDs. Only a collaborative approach of all actors involved in NCD management will allow the spectrum of needs and continuum of care for persons affected by NCDs to be properly addressed in humanitarian programmes.","Bausch, F.

Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large, and there are still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients. Tocilizumab is a blocker of IL-6R, which can effectively block IL-6 signal transduction pathway. So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhao, Hong; Wang, Gui-Qiang",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32234467/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105954; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301047?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301047,19
649441,Optimizing Viral Discovery in Bats,2016-02-11,"BACKGROUND: The last few decades have seen the rising global acknowledgment of the importance of ethics in the conduct of health research. But research ethics committees or institutional review boards (IRBs) have also been criticized for being barriers to research. This article examines the case of the Philippines, where little has been done to interrogate the health research and IRB culture, and whose circumstances can serve as reflection points for other low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted from July to October 2020 to elicit health researchers’ perspectives and experiences regarding IRBs and the ethics approval process in the country, as well as counterpoint narratives from researchers who have also worked for IRBs. RESULTS: Across the fields of clinical, public health, and social science research, the issue of ethics review revealed itself to be foremost an issue of inequity. IRB processes serve as a barrier for those outside the academe; those belonging to institutions, cities, or entire regions without their own accredited IRBs; and researchers working independently, without ample budget, or on highly specialized topics—more so for non-clinical researchers who must grapple with the primarily biomedical framework of most IRBs. Consequently, the research landscape invariably favors those with the resources to do research, and researches that tend to attract funding. CONCLUSION: The broader challenge of equity in health research will entail more fundamental reforms, but proximal interventions can be done to make the ethics approval process more equitable, such as enhancing institutional oversight, regulating IRB fees, and enabling a more supportive and welcoming environment for early-career, student, independent, and non-clinical health researchers.

The diagnostic potentials of specific porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) accessory and nonstructural proteins, if any, have not yet been investigated. In order to determine and compare which of the viral proteins may be useful as diagnostic antigens, whole virus (WV) particles and a panel of structural and nonstructural PEDV proteins [spike subunit 1 (S1), the C-terminal part of ORF3 (ORF3C), envelope (E), nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), Nsp2, Ac (acidic domain of Nsp3), and ADRP (ADP-ribose-1-monophosphatase domain of Nsp3), expressed individually in bacterial and/or mammalian cells] were tested for reactivity with sera from PEDV-infected pigs by ELISA and/or western blot analysis. According to western blots, serum antibody interactions with the S1 protein were relatively more sensitive and specific than ORF3C, E and Ac. Furthermore, a total of 851 serum samples from diarrheal pigs of different ages were analyzed by ELISA, with most showing immune-reactivity towards the WV, S1, ORF3C, and E proteins. The earliest IgG antibody response was observed in the one-week-old piglets, with similar antibody ontogeny and patterns of seroconversion for S1, ORF3C, E, and WV antigens. In addition, the pattern of neutralizing antibody was more similar to that of IgA in weaning piglets after PEDV infection. Collectively, these data provide more reliable information on the host immune response to different viral proteins, which will be useful for development of novel serological assays and for design of vaccines that better stimulate protective immunity.","Lei, Xi-Mei; Yang, Yong-Le; He, Yong-Qiang; Peng, Lei; Zhao, Pengwei; Xu, Shu-Ya; Cao, Hongwei; Fang, Pengfei; Qiu, Wenying; Qin, Pan; Wang, Bin; Huang, Yao-Wei",Vet Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108387; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113519304365; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113519304365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31500721/,19

The theoretical analysis of this study indicates that the optimal scale of pollution depends on the local initial endowment, economic investment capital and the marginal cost of environmental pollution caused by government's economic activities. Furtherly, the economic activities have a worsening impact on environmental pollution, but when the government implements environmental protection and water price policy measures in response to environmental pollution caused by economic activities, it has a significant impact on the decline in the scale of pollution. The government has promoted the pollution suppression model in the formulation of water prices, which has internalized the external cost of pollution in economic activities and can effectively reduce the scale of agricultural water pollution discharge.","Chou, Lichen; Dai, Jie; Qian, Xiaoyan; Karimipour, Aliakbar; Zheng, Xuping",Agric Water Manag,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100487/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378377420321302; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378377420321302,19

650416,Chapter 14 Family Astroviridae,2017-12-31,"BACKGROUND: With COVID-19 there was a rapid and abrupt rise in telemedicine implementation often without sufficient time for providers or patients to adapt. As telemedicine visits are likely to continue to play an important role in health care, it is crucial to strive for a better understanding of how to ensure completed telemedicine visits in our health system. Awareness of these barriers to effective telemedicine visits is necessary for a proactive approach to addressing issues. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify variables that may affect telemedicine visit completion in order to determine actions that can be enacted across the entire health system to benefit all patients. METHODS: Data were collected from scheduled telemedicine visits (n=362,764) at the University of Miami Health System (UHealth) between March 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020. Descriptive statistics, mixed effects logistic regression, and random forest modeling were used to identify the most important patient-agnostic predictors of telemedicine completion. RESULTS: Using descriptive statistics, struggling telemedicine specialties, providers, and clinic locations were identified. Through mixed effects logistic regression (adjusting for clustering at the clinic site level), the most important predictors of completion included previsit phone call/SMS text message reminder status (confirmed vs not answered) (odds ratio [OR] 6.599, 95% CI 6.483-6.717), MyUHealthChart patient portal status (not activated vs activated) (OR 0.315, 95% CI 0.305-0.325), provider’s specialty (primary care vs medical specialty) (OR 1.514, 95% CI 1.472-1.558), new to the UHealth system (yes vs no) (OR 1.285, 95% CI 1.201-1.374), and new to provider (yes vs no) (OR 0.875, 95% CI 0.859-0.891). Random forest modeling results mirrored those from logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: The highest association with a completed telemedicine visit was the previsit appointment confirmation by the patient via phone call/SMS text message. An active patient portal account was the second strongest variable associated with completion, which underscored the importance of patients having set up their portal account before the telemedicine visit. Provider’s specialty was the third strongest patient-agnostic characteristic associated with telemedicine completion rate. Telemedicine will likely continue to have an integral role in health care, and these results should be used as an important guide to improvement efforts. As a first step toward increasing completion rates, health care systems should focus on improvement of patient portal usage and use of previsit reminders. Optimization and intervention are necessary for those that are struggling with implementing telemedicine. We advise setting up a standardized workflow for staff.","Gmunder, Kristin Nicole; Ruiz, Jose W; Franceschi, Dido; Suarez, Maritza M",JMIR Med Inform,https://doi.org/10.2196/27977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34254936/,19

There are many detailed investigations of PrP, but proteomic studies of other proteins in verified infectious TSE particles have not been pursued, even though brain homogenates without PrP retain their complete infectious titer. To define proteins that may be integral to, process, or protect an agent genome, we developed a streamlined, high‐yield purification of infectious FU‐CJD mouse brain particles with minimal PrP. Proteinase K (PK) abolished all residual particle PrP, but did not reduce infectivity, and viral‐size particles lacking PrP were ∼70S (vs. 90–120S without PK). Furthermore, over 1,500 non‐PrP proteins were still present and positively identified in high titer FU‐CJD particles without detectable PrP by mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS); 114 of these peptides were linked to viral motifs in the environmental–viral database, and not evident in parallel uninfected controls. Host components were also identified in both PK and non‐PK treated particles from FU‐CJD mouse brain and human sCJD brain. This abundant cellular data had several surprises, including finding Huntingtin in the sCJD but not normal human brain samples. Similarly, the neural Wiskott–Aldrich sequence and multivesicular and endosome components associated with retromer APP (Alzheimer amyloid) processing were only in sCJD. These cellular findings suggest that new therapies directed at retromer–vesicular trafficking in other neurodegenerative diseases may also counteract late‐onset sCJD PrP amyloid pathology. J. Cell.

Identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that make T2D patients prone to aggressive course of the disease can help in the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve our response to the disease pandemic. Herein, we employed a system genetics approach to explore potential genomic, transcriptomic alterations in genes specific to lung and pancreas tissues, affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and study their association with susceptibility to T2D in Emirati patients. Our results identified the Exocyst complex component, 6 (EXOC6/6B) gene (a component for docks insulin granules to the plasma membrane) with documented INDEL in 3 of 4 whole genome sequenced Emirati diabetic patients. Publically available transcriptomic data showed that lung infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed significantly lower expression of EXOC6/6B compared to healthy lungs.

Although the traditional vaccine development process is quite long, more than ten COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use in about a year. The COVID-19 vaccines that have been administered are highly effective enough, but achieving herd immunity is required to end the pandemic. The motivation of this study is to contribute to review the countries’ vaccine policies and adjusting the manufacturing plans of the vaccine companies. In this study, the total number of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 was forecasted in the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and the World with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, which is a new approach in vaccination studies. Additionally, for herd immunity, the percentage of fully vaccinated people in these regions at the beginning of 2021 summer was determined. ARIMA results show that in the US, Asia, Europe, Africa, South America, and the World will reach 139 million, 109 million, 127 million, 8 million, 38 million, and 441 million people will be fully vaccinated on 1 June 2021, respectively.

It intends to mimic a naturally occurring infection while avoiding the disease, exposing our bodies to viral antigens to trigger an immune response that will protect us from future infections. Among different strategies for vaccine development, recombinant vaccines are one of the most efficient ones. Recombinant vaccines use safe viral vectors as vehicles and incorporate a transgenic antigen of the pathogen against which we intend to generate an immune response. These vaccines can be based on replication-deficient viruses or replication-competent viruses. While the most effective strategy involves replication-competent viruses, they must be attenuated to prevent any health hazard while guaranteeing a strong humoral and cellular immune response. Several attenuation strategies for adenoviral-based vaccine development have been contemplated over time. In this paper, we will review them and discuss novel approaches based on the principle that protein synthesis from individual genes can be modulated by codon usage bias manipulation.

Methods: We used internet-based strategies to enroll C3 participants beginning March 28th, 2020. Following baseline questionnaire completion, study participants will be contacted monthly (for 6 months) to complete assessments of engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., use of cloth masks, avoiding large gatherings); COVID-19 symptoms; SARS/COV2 testing and diagnosis; hospitalizations; healthcare access; and uptake of health messaging. Dried blood spot (DBS) specimens will be collected at the first follow-up assessment (last week of April 2020) and at month 3 (last week of June 2020) and stored until a validated serologic test is available. Results: As of April 20, 2020, the number of people that completed the baseline survey and provided contact information for follow-up was 7,070. Participants resided in all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. At least 24% of participants were frontline workers (healthcare and other essential workers). Twenty-three percent (23%) were 60+ years, 24% were Black or Hispanic, 52% were men, and 52% were currently employed. Nearly 20% reported recent COVID-like symptoms (cough, fever or shortness of breath) and a high proportion reported engaging in non-pharmaceutical interventions that reduce SARS/COV2 spread (93% avoided groups >20, 58% wore masks; 73% quarantined). More than half (54%) had higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness should they become infected with SARS/COV2 based on age, underlying health conditions (e.g., chronic lung disease), or daily smoking. Discussion: A geographically and socio-demographically diverse group of participants was rapidly enrolled in the C3 during the upswing of the SARS/COV2 pandemic. Strengths of the C3 include the potential for direct observation of, and risk factors for, seroconversion and incident COVID disease (among those with or without antibodies to SARS/COV2) in areas of active transmission.","Robertson, M.; Kulkarni, S.; Berry, A.; Mirzayi, C.; Maroko, A.

Work patterns have changed, risk stratification has been proposed, and the mental health of clinicians has been adversely affected. The COVID-19 prevalence among GPs is unknown. This study focuses on assessing the impact of COVID-19 on GPs in Leicestershire, the first UK city to lock down locally. AIM: This survey assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 in GPs and explored GP work patterns in comparison with national guidance. It used a validated perceived stress tool to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on GP stress perception. DESIGN & SETTING: The cross-sectional retrospective survey was sent to all the GPs in Leicestershire. METHOD: A total of 111 GPs in Leicestershire took part voluntarily in an anonymised questionnaire-based study. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence in GPs in Leicestershire was 8.1%; 70.3% of GPs were of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) origin; 91.9% of GPs had undergone risk stratification; and 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice, but only 59.5% felt supported with mental health. GPs described feeling more stressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than they had been previously. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating COVID-19 prevalence among GPs in Leicestershire. Despite government interventions, GPs felt less supported with their mental health compared with pre-COVID-19 times. Thus, the NHS in England should focus on GP stress and wellbeing as they work towards the restoration and recovery of primary care while battling the second wave.","Trivedi, Namrata; Trivedi, Vivek; Moorthy, Arumugam; Trivedi, Hina",BJGP open,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2020.0151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199303/,19

Here we present a dataset based on a survey (N = 4,154) of public risk perception in Italy and Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both countries were heavily affected by the first wave of infections in Spring 2020, but their governmental responses were very different. As such, the dataset offers unique opportunities to investigate the role of governmental responses in shaping public risk perception. In addition to epidemics, the survey considered indirect effects of COVID-19 (domestic violence, economic crises), as well as global (climate change) and local (wildfires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, terror attacks) threats. The survey examines perceived likelihoods and impacts, individual and authorities’ preparedness and knowledge, and socio-demographic indicators.

Despite promising preventive measures being taken, there is no vaccine or drug therapy officially approved to prevent or treat the infection. Everybody is waiting the findings of ongoing clinical trials in various chemical and biological products. This review is specifically aimed to summarize the available evidence and ongoing clinical trials of remdesivir as a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. Remdesivir is an investigational drug having broad spectrum antiviral activity with its target RNA dependent RNA polymerase. It has not yet been officially approved for Ebola and Coronaviruses. Several studies showed that remdesivir had promising in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV strains. On the top of this, it exhibited a promising in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 strains though there are no published studies that substantiate its activity in vivo until the time of this review. There are few phase 3 randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials on the way to investigate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. Of which, one completed double blind, placebo controlled trial showed that remdesivir showed faster time to clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients compared to placebo though not found statistically significant.

Diagnostics which detect active asymptomatic infection, which are suitable for monitoring and surveillance, may be of benefit to the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) elimination campaign on the ISC. Methodology/Principal Findings: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the direct agglutination test (DAT), and the Leishmania antigen ELISA were carried out on blood and urine samples collected from 720 household and neighbouring contacts of 276 VL and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) index cases, with no symptoms or history of VL and PKDL, in endemic regions of Bangladesh between September 2016 and March 2018. Of the 720 contacts of index cases, asymptomatic infection was detected in 69 (9.6%) participants by a combination of qPCR (1.0%), LAMP (2.1%), DAT (3.9%), and Leishmania antigen ELISA (3.3%). Only 1 (0.1%) participant was detected positive by all 4 diagnostic tests. Poor agreement between tests was calculated using Cohen's kappa statistics, however the Leishmania antigen ELISA and DAT in combination capture all participants positive by more than one test. We find strong evidence for association between the index case being a PKDL case (OR 1.94, p = 0.009), specifically macular PKDL (OR 2.12, p = 0.004) and being positive for at least one of the four tests. Conclusions/Significance: Leishmania antigen ELISA detects active asymptomatic infection, requires a non-invasive sample, and therefore may be of benefit for monitoring transmission and surveillance in an elimination setting in combination with serology. Development of an antigen detection test in RDT format would be of benefit to the elimination campaign.","Owen, S. I.; Hossain, F.; Ghosh, P.; Chowdhury, R.; Hossain, M.

The aims of the study were to investigate the prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among university students during the period of the first lockdown in Germany, and the associations of possible risk and protective factors with all three outcome variables. METHODS: A total of 2.548 university students were included in the study. The study took place during the period of the first lockdown in Germany. Multiple hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to explore the role of demographic variables, personality traits, psychological capital variables, mindfulness, COVID-19 related variables, and coping strategies on anxiety, depression and stress. RESULTS: Results showed on average mild depressive and anxiety symptoms, and moderate perceived stress among the students. Alarmingly, 35.9% of the students showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 27.7% reported moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 25.1% perceived high stress. Mindfulness and optimism were the most relevant protective factors against depression, anxiety and stress, whereas COVID-related stressors (e.g., worries about study and financial problems, being stressed by the Corona-pandemic and media reporting, quarantine experience) as well as personal characteristics (e.g., neuroticism, older age, being female) were risk factors for increasing mental health issues and/ or stress.

As COVID-19 presentation and outcomes are heterogeneous in cancer patients, decision-making tools for hospital admission, severity prediction and increased monitoring for early intervention are critical. ObjectiveTo identify features of COVID-19 in cancer patients predicting severe disease and build a decision-support online tool; COVID-19 Risk in Oncology Evaluation Tool (CORONET) MethodData was obtained for consecutive patients with active cancer with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 presenting in 12 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom (UK). Univariable logistic regression was performed on pre-specified features to assess their association with admission ([â¥]24 hours inpatient), oxygen requirement and death. Multivariable logistic regression and random forest models (RFM) were compared with patients randomly split into training and validation sets. Cost function determined cut-offs were defined for admission/death using RFM. Performance was assessed by sensitivity, specificity and Brier scores (BS). The CORONET model was then assessed in the entire cohort to build the online CORONET tool. ResultsTraining and validation sets comprised 234 and 66 patients respectively with median age 69 (range 19-93), 54% males, 46% females, 71% vs 29% had solid and haematological cancers. The RFM, selected for further development, demonstrated superior performance over logistic regression with AUROC predicting admission (0.85 vs. 0.78) and death (0.76 vs. 0.72). C-reactive protein was the most important feature predicting COVID-19 severity. CORONET cut-offs for admission and mortality of 1.05 and 1.8 were established. In the training set, admission prediction sensitivity and specificity were 94.5% and 44.3% with BS 0.118; mortality sensitivity and specificity were 78.5% and 57.2% with BS 0.364. In the validation set, admission sensitivity and specificity were 90.7% and 42.9% with BS 0.148; mortality sensitivity and specificity were 92.3% and 45.8% with BS 0.442. In the entire cohort, the CORONET decision support tool recommended admission of 99% of patients requiring oxygen and of 99% of patients who died. Conclusions and RelevanceCORONET, a decision support tool validated in hospitals throughout the UK showed promise in aiding decisions regarding admission and predicting COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer presenting to hospital.

However, evidence from small-scale studies globally suggest there is a lack of awareness of such guidelines among some groups of healthcare professionals. For the first time in a large representative sample of patient-facing healthcare professionals, we aimed to identify: (a) which healthcare professionals are aware of guidelines for the management of self-harm; (b) the perceived availability of training; (c) the use of risk screening tools; and (d) the extent to which healthcare professionals implement guidelines for the management of self-harm. Methods: 1020 UK healthcare professionals completed a cross-sectional survey online. Results: 85.6% (873/1020) of the sample had heard of the national guidelines, but only 24.3% (248/1020) knew “a fair amount” or more about them. Of the respondents who had previously encountered a patient who had self-harmed or was at risk of repeat self-harm, the guidelines were implemented in fewer than 50% (M = 43.89%, SD = 38.79) of encounters. 31% (312/1020) of the sample had received training in managing self-harm and, contrary to guidelines, 2.25% (23/1020) of the sample had used self-harm risk screening tools. Conclusions: Our findings highlight a need to improve knowledge of self-harm management guidelines, and identifies professional groups where awareness and knowledge is currently low. Further work is required to develop interventions to change healthcare professional practice with respect to the implementation of self-harm management guidelines.","Leather, Jessica Z.; O’Connor, Rory C.; Quinlivan, Leah; Kapur, Navneet; Campbell, Stephen; Armitage, Christopher J.",J Psychiatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891028/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395620309432?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.08.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022395620309432,19

658168,β-Coronaviruses use lysosomes for egress instead of the biosynthetic secretory pathway,2020-10-27,"Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is one of the most common skin diseases and is characterized by allergic skin inflammation, redness, and itchiness and is associated with a hyperactivated type 2 immune response. The leading causes of AD include an imbalance in the immune system, genetic predisposition, or environmental factors, making the development of effective pharmacotherapies complex. Steroids are widely used to treat AD; however, they provide limited efficacy in the long term and can lead to adverse effects. Thus, novel treatments that offer durable efficacy and fewer side effects are urgently needed. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Huangbai Liniment (HB), a traditional Chinese medicine, using an experimental AD mouse model, following our clinical observations of AD patients. In both AD patient and the mouse disease model, HB significantly improved the disease condition. Specifically, patients who received HB treatment on local skin lesions (3–4 times/day) showed improved resolution of inflammation. Using the 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD model in BALB/c mice, we observed that HB profoundly alleviated severe skin inflammation and relieved the itching. The dermatopathological results showed markedly reversed skin inflammation with decreased epidermal thickness and overall cellularity. Correspondingly, HB treatment largely decreased the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13, associated with declined gene expression of IL-33, ST2, and GATA3, which are connected to the type 2 immune response. In addition, HB restored immune tolerance by promoting regulatory T (T(REG)) cells and inhibiting the generation of T(H)1, T(H)2, and T(H)17 cells in vitro and in the DNCB-induced AD mouse model. For the first time, we demonstrate that HB markedly mitigates skin inflammation in AD patients and the DNCB-induced AD mouse model by reinvigorating the T cell immune balance, shedding light on the future development and application of novel HB-based therapeutics for AD.","Zheng, Ting; Fan, Miao; Wei, Yunbo; Feng, Jinhong; Zhou, Pengcheng; Sun, Xin; Xue, Anqi; Qin, Cheng Xue; Yu, Di",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.726035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531749/,19

The mechanism of action of many vaccines in common use remains incompletely understood. Understanding how such vaccines protect is an ongoing subject of study using increasingly sophisticated immunological tools, such as B cell and T cell repertoire and transcriptome analysis. Such tools are also being applied to the design of vaccines against those viral targets that have evaded vaccine-mediated protection thus far. As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use. Basic immunology, empirical vaccine testing, and regulatory science are all necessary contributors to developing the next generation of vaccines, including vaccines effective against the pathogens for which vaccines are not currently available.","Greenberg, Harry B.; Dormitzer, Philip R.",Encyclopedia of Immunobiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123742797140160; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123742797140160,19

We aim to develop a model to predict isolation length for non-severe patients. METHODS: Among 188 non-severe patients, 96 patients were enrolled as training cohort to identify factors associated with isolation length via Cox regression model and develop a nomogram. Other 92 patients formed as validation cohort to validate nomogram. Concordance index (C-index), area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curves were used to evaluated nomogram. RESULTS: Increasing absolute eosinophil count (AEC) after admission was correlated with shorter isolation length (P = 0.02). Baseline activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 30 s was correlated with longer isolation length (P = 0.03). A nomogram to predict isolation probability at 11-, 16- and 21-day was developed and validated. The C-indices of training and validation cohort were 0.604 and 0.682 respectively. Both cohorts showed a good discriminative ability (AUC, 11-day: 0.646 vs 0.730; 16-day: 0.663 vs 0.750; 21-day: 0.711 vs 0.783; respectively) and calibration power. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline APTT and dynamic change of AEC were two significant factors associated with isolation length of non-severe patients.

We have followed the time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic in ten countries on four continents. We examined > 383,500 complete SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID (Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data) with sampling dates extending until April 05, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, United States, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the 77 to 100 novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased in prevalence over time. VUI2012/01 (B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), the so‐called UK and South Africa variants, respectively, and two variants from Brazil, 484K.V2, now called P.1 and P.2, increased in prevalence. Despite lockdowns, worldwide active replication in genetically and socio‐economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS‐CoV‐2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally. Rapidly evolving new variant and mutant strains might give rise to escape variants, capable of limiting the efficacy of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tests.","Weber, Stefanie; Ramirez, Christina M; Weiser, Barbara; Burger, Harold; Doerfler, Walter",EMBO Mol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931941/; https://doi.org/10.15252/emmm.202114062,19
662039,RNA helicases and remodeling proteins,2011-08-20,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) mostly relies on the generation of singlet oxygen, via the excitation of a photosensitizer, so that target tumor cells can be destroyed. PDT can be applied in the settings of several malignant diseases. In fact, the earliest preclinical applications date back to 1900’s. Dougherty reported the treatment of skin tumors by PDT in 1978. Several further studies around 1980 demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT. Thus, the technique has attracted the attention of numerous researchers since then. Hematoporphyrin derivative received the FDA approval as a clinical application of PDT in 1995. We have indeed witnessed a considerable progress in the field over the last century. Given the fact that PDT has a favorable adverse event profile and can enhance anti-tumor immune responses as well as demonstrating minimally invasive characteristics, it is disappointing that PDT is not broadly utilized in the clinical setting for the treatment of malignant and/or non-malignant diseases. Several issues still hinder the development of PDT, such as those related with light, tissue oxygenation and inherent properties of the photosensitizers. Various photosensitizers have been designed/synthesized in order to overcome the limitations. In this Review, we provide a general overview of the mechanisms of action in terms of PDT in cancer, including the effects on immune system and vasculature as well as mechanisms related with tumor cell destruction. We will also briefly mention the application of PDT for non-malignant diseases. The current limitations of PDT utilization in cancer will be reviewed, since identifying problems associated with design/synthesis of photosensitizers as well as application of light and tissue oxygenation might pave the way for more effective PDT approaches. Furthermore, novel promising approaches to improve outcome in PDT such as selectivity, bioengineering, subcellular/organelle targeting, etc. will also be discussed in detail, since the potential of pioneering and exceptional approaches that aim to overcome the limitations and reveal the full potential of PDT in terms of clinical translation are undoubtedly exciting. A better understanding of novel concepts in the field (e.g. enhanced, two-stage, fractional PDT) will most likely prove to be very useful for pursuing and improving effective PDT strategies.","Gunaydin, Gurcan; Gedik, M.

662868,Establishment of minimal positive-control conditions to ensure brain safety during rapid development of emergency vaccines,2017-08-22,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lateral flow assays can detect anti-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies to monitor transmission. However, standardized evaluation of their accuracy and tools to aid in interpreting results are needed. METHODS: We evaluated 20 IgG and IgM assays selected from available tests in April 2020. We evaluated the assays’ performance using 56 pre-pandemic negative and 56 SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples, collected 10–40 days after symptom onset, confirmed by a molecular test and analyzed by an ultra-sensitive immunoassay. Finally, we developed a user-friendly web app to extrapolate the positive predictive values based on their accuracy and local prevalence. RESULTS: Combined IgG + IgM sensitivities ranged from 33.9 to 94.6%, while combined specificities ranged from 92.6 to 100%. The highest sensitivities were detected in Lumiquick for IgG (98.2%), BioHit for both IgM (96.4%), and combined IgG + IgM sensitivity (94.6%). Furthermore, 11 LFAs and 8 LFAs showed perfect specificity for IgG and IgM, respectively, with 15 LFAs showing perfect combined IgG + IgM specificity. Lumiquick had the lowest estimated limit-of-detection (LOD) (0.1 μg/mL), followed by a similar LOD of 1.5 μg/mL for CareHealth, Cellex, KHB, and Vivachek. CONCLUSION: We provide a public resource of the accuracy of select lateral flow assays with potential for home testing. The cost-effectiveness, scalable manufacturing process, and suitability for self-testing makes LFAs an attractive option for monitoring disease prevalence and assessing vaccine responsiveness. Our web tool provides an easy-to-use interface to demonstrate the impact of prevalence and test accuracy on the positive predictive values.

664699,Selective regulation in ribosome biogenesis and protein production for efficient viral translation,2020-10-29,"This early work aims to allow organizations to diagnose their capacity to properly adopt microservices through initial milestones of a Microservice Maturity Model (MiMMo). The objective is to prepare the way towards a general framework to help companies and industries to determine their microservices maturity. Organizations lean more and more on distributed web applications and Line of Business software. This is particularly relevant during the current Covid-19 crisis, where companies are even more challenged to offer their services online, targeting a very high level of responsiveness in the face of rapidly increasing and diverse demands. For this, microservices remain the most suitable delivery application architectural style. They allow agility not only on the technical application, as often considered, but on the enterprise architecture as a whole, influencing the actual financial business of the company. However, microservices adoption is highly risk-prone and complex. Before they establish an appropriate migration plan, first and foremost, companies must assess their degree of readiness to adopt microservices. For this, MiMMo, a Microservices Maturity Model framework assessment, is proposed to help companies assess their readiness for the microservice architectural style, based on their actual situation. MiMMo results from observations of and experience with about thirty organizations writing software. It conceptualizes and generalizes the progression paths they have followed to adopt microservices appropriately. Using the model, an organization can evaluate itself in two dimensions and five maturity levels and thus: (i) benchmark itself on its current use of microservices; (ii) project the next steps it needs to achieve a higher maturity level and (iii) analyze how it has evolved and maintain a global coherence between technical and business stakes.","Gouigoux, Jean-Philippe; Tamzalit, Dalila; Noppen, Joost","15th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science, RCIS 2021",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14935v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75018-3_34,19

We aimed to assess the potential changes in the technical outcomes of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures carried out in patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We conducted an international, multicenter, retrospective, matched case-control study of ERCP procedures carried out in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The main outcome was technical success of the procedure as assessed by the endoscopist, and the secondary outcome was the development of procedure-related adverse events. Each case was matched in a 1:4 ratio with controls extracted from each center’s database in order to identify relevant changes in outcome measures compared with the pre-pandemic era. RESULTS: Eighteen procedures performed in 16 COVID-19 patients [14 men, 65 years (9–82)] and 67 controls were included in the final analysis. Technical success was achieved in 14/18 COVID-19 cases, which was significantly lower as compared with the control group (14/18 versus 64/67, p = 0.034), with an endoscopic reintervention required in 9/18 cases. However, the rate of procedure-related adverse events was low in both groups (1/18 versus 10/67, p = 0.44). On multivariable analysis, COVID-19 status remained the only risk factor for technical failure of the procedure [odds ratio of 19.9 (95% confidence interval 1.4–269.0)]. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the volume and practice of ERCP, resulting in lower technical success rates without significantly impacting patient safety.

665886,Virtual screening for the discovery of bioactive natural products,2008,"COVID-19 has created significant concern surrounding the impact of pandemic lockdown on mental health. While the pandemic lockdown can be distressing, times of crisis can also provide people with the opportunity to think divergently and explore different activities. Novelty seeking, where individuals explore novel and unfamiliarly stimuli and environments, may enhance the creativity of individuals to solve problems in a way that allows them to adjust their emotional responses to stressful situations. This study employs a longitudinal design to investigate changes in novelty seeking and mental health outcomes (namely, stress, anxiety, and depression) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, among a group of students (final N = 173; M(age) = 19.81; SD(age) = 0.98; 135 females and 38 males) from a university in southeast China. Participants were surveyed at three points: November, 2019 (prior to the COVID-19 pandemic); between February and March, 2020 (during the peak of the pandemic and intense lockdown in China); and between May and June, 2020 (after lockdown had been lifted in China). Cross-sectionally, correlation analysis indicated that greater novelty seeking was associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression at all three time points. Univariate latent curve modeling (LCM) indicated a growth trajectory in which novelty seeking increased over time and then remained high during the post-lockdown period. Stress, anxiety, and depression all showed V-shaped growth trajectories in which these variables decreased during lockdown, before increasing in the post-lockdown period. Multivariate LCM indicated the growth trajectory for novelty seeking was associated with the growth trajectories for stress, anxiety, and depression. This suggests that the observed decreases in stress, anxiety, and depression during the lockdown period may be attributable to the sample’s observed increase in novelty seeking. These findings are valuable in that they challenge the notion that lockdown measures are inherently detrimental to mental health. The findings indicate the important role of novelty seeking in responding to crises. It may be possible for future public health measures to incorporate the promotion of novelty seeking to help individuals’ respond to stressful situations and maintain good mental health in the face of crises.","Li, Wendy Wen; Yu, Huizhen; Miller, Dan J.; Yang, Fang; Rouen, Christopher",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.600739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343473/,19

There are few reports of MIS-C from Asia. This observational study aimed to identify the clinical features in children presenting with KDSS in Japan over a 5-year period and to summarize similarities and differences between KDSS and MIS-C. We retrospectively collected data on patient characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, treatment, and prognosis including coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), which were compared with data of patients with KDSS worldwide and patients with MIS-C from a review. KDSS was identified in 6 (1.1%) of 552 patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) treated at a single institution in Japan between 2015 and 2020 (1 in 2020). In patients with KDSS in Japan or worldwide vs. patients with MIS-C, KDSS was more likely to have a diagnosis of complete KD (100, 70 vs. 6.3%), a higher incidence of CAAs (50, 65 vs. 11%), and a greater requirement for vasoactive agonists (67, 67 vs. 43%) because of circulatory shock (100, 50 vs. 26%). Both KDSS and MIS-C had good prognosis (mortality 0, 6.7 vs. 1.7%). Although KDSS in Japan and MIS-C show some overlap in clinical symptoms, they are unlikely to be the same disease entity.

In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep neural network called DeepDRIM which utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRN from scRNA-seq data. Due to the consideration of TF-gene pair’s neighborhood context, DeepDRIM can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene–gene interactions. We compared DeepDRIM with nine GRN reconstruction algorithms designed for either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. It achieves evidently better performance for the scRNA-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The simulated data show that DeepDRIM is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number and the size of the training data. We further applied DeepDRIM to the scRNA-seq gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the cell-type-specific GRN alteration and observed targets of TFs that were differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.","Chen, Jiaxing; Cheong, ChinWang; Lan, Liang; Zhou, Xin; Liu, Jiming; Lyu, Aiping; Cheung, William K; Zhang, Lu",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424948/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab325,19

A total of 52 geriatric patients with non-specific chronic neck pain were included in the present study. All participants were included in a physical therapy and rehabilitation program for five sessions per week that lasted 3 weeks. All participants were evaluated before and after the treatment. Pain and disability were assessed with the Visual Analog Scale-pain (VAS-pain), VAS-disability, muscle spasm, CNFDS, NDI, NBQ, NPDS scales. Additionally, patient satisfaction scores were questioned both before and after the treatment. Following the 3-week physical therapy and rehabilitation program, significant improvements were detected in the VAS-pain, VAS-disability, muscle spasm, CNFDS, NDI, NBQ, and NPDS scores (p < 0.05). Responsiveness values were found to be as follows: CNFDS [effect size (ES) = 0.78; standardized response mean (SRM) = 0.90], NDI (ES = 0.66; SRM = 1.18), NBQ (ES = 0.82; SRM = 0.97) and NPDS (ES = 0.87; SRM = 0.98). Our study demonstrated that CNFDS, NDI, NBQ, and NPDS are responsive scales in determining treatment-related changes in geriatric patients with non-specific neck pain. These results also suggest that all of these four scales can be used in the assessment of treatment induced changes in geriatric patients with chronic neck pain.","Akaltun, Mazlum Serdar; Kocyigit, Burhan Fatih",Rheumatol Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04957-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34302231/,19

As of today, there are no proven vaccines, therapies, or even strategies to fight off this virus. Here, we describe the in silico docking results of a novel broad range anti-infective fusion protein RTAM-PAP1 against the various key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest protein-ligand docking software. RTAM-PAP1 was compared against the SARS-CoV-2 B38 antibody, ricin A chain, a pokeweed antiviral protein from leaves, and the lectin griffithsin using the special CoDockPP COVID-19 version. These experiments revealed novel binding mechanisms of RTAM-PAP1 with a high affinity to numerous SARS-CoV-2 key proteins. RTAM-PAP1 was further characterized in a preliminary toxicity study in mice and was found to be a potential therapeutic candidate. These findings might lead to the discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 targets and therapeutic protein structures with outstanding functions.","Hassan, Yasser; Ogg, Sherry; Ge, Hui",Toxins (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12090602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32957454/,19

Resource reallocation, socioeconomic confinement and reorganization of production activities are current challenges being faced both at the national and international levels, in a frame of uncertainty and fear. Hospitals have been restructured to provide the best care to COVID-19 patients while adopting preventive strategies not to spread the infection among healthcare providers and patients affected by other diseases. As a consequence, the concept of urgency and indications for elective treatments have been profoundly reshaped. In addition, several providers have been recruited in COVID-19 departments despite their original occupation, resulting in a profound rearrangement of both inpatient and outpatient care. Orthopaedic daily practice has been significantly affected by the pandemic. Surgical indications have been reformulated, with elective cases being promptly postponed and urgent interventions requiring exceptional attention, especially in suspected or COVID-19(+) patients. This has made a strong impact on inpatient management, with the need of a dedicated staff, patient isolation and restrictive visiting hour policies. On the other hand, outpatient visits have been limited to reduce contacts between patients and the hospital personnel, with considerable consequences on post-operative quality of care and the human side of medical practice. In this review, we aim to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the orthopaedic practice. Particular attention will be dedicated to opportune surgical indication, perioperative care and safe management of both inpatients and outpatients, also considering repercussions of the pandemic on resident education and ethical implications.","Ambrosio, Luca; Vadalà, Gianluca; Russo, Fabrizio; Papalia, Rocco; Denaro, Vincenzo",J Exp Orthop,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-020-00255-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32458150/,19

Transmissible diseases affecting both human and animal health are the focus of surveillance networks. Early detection of potential infectious threats is based on the screening of “ alert signals “ identified through routine surveillance networks and other systems. The quality and accuracy of these signals is first verified, before assessing, through a multidisciplinary approach, the risk of introduction and dissemination. This article examines specific cases illustrating the process of detection, risk analysis and response, with respect to infectious threats that are endemic in tropical regions and have the potential to be imported into metropolitan France. For both novel pathogens and exotic diseases — which, not being endemic in France, are less well known — the analysis and response process must regularly be adapted to the latest epidemiological, clinical and biological findings, taking interactions between the pathogen, host, and environment into consideration. The need to improve reaction times and risk assessment is also discussed.","Bitar, Dounia; Tarantola, Arnaud; Capek, Isabelle; Barboza, Philippe; Che, Didier",Bulletin de l'Académie Nationale de Médecine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919324185; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919324185,19

Consequently, the world of education entered a new era of E-learning. This descriptive study, thus, aims to evaluate the standpoint of medical and dental undergraduates regarding E-learning amid the Covid-19 lockdown. METHODS: A descriptive online questionnaire was used to gather responses via Google forms. The questionnaire consisted of questions categorized as technology access, online skills and relationships, students’ views, and student’s perception of possible advantages of E-learning. Two hundred and eighty three medical and dental students of CMH Lahore Medical College participated in the study. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy nine female and 104 male students responded to the questionnaire. The results of the study showed students encouraging the accommodation of E-learning into current teaching practices. Students agreed online study material not only provides flexibility in the learning process (p=0.003) but also saves time (p = 0.012). Female participants showed a more positive readiness response towards e learning than males (p =0.001). Results also showed students have easier access to online teaching resources. Regarding online lectures, the students believe that online lectures were more organized (p= 0.001) and stimulated student interest (p=0.026).

668782,Virus-Vectored Ebola Vaccines,2017,"In COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and thrombotic events are frequent, life-threatening complications. Autopsies commonly show arterial thrombosis and severe endothelial damage. Endothelial damage, which can play an early and central pathogenic role in ARDS and thrombosis, activates the lectin pathway of complement. Mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2), the lectin pathway’s effector enzyme, binds the nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulting in complement activation and lung injury. Narsoplimab, a fully human immunoglobulin gamma 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody against MASP-2, inhibits lectin pathway activation and has anticoagulant effects. In this study, the first time a lectin-pathway inhibitor was used to treat COVID-19, six COVID-19 patients with ARDS requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or intubation received narsoplimab under compassionate use. At baseline and during treatment, circulating endothelial cell (CEC) counts and serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were assessed. Narsoplimab treatment was associated with rapid and sustained reduction of CEC and concurrent reduction of serum IL-6, IL-8, CRP and LDH. Narsoplimab was well tolerated; no adverse drug reactions were reported. Two control groups were used for retrospective comparison, both showing significantly higher mortality than the narsoplimab-treated group. All narsoplimab-treated patients recovered and survived. Narsoplimab may be an effective treatment for COVID-19 by reducing COVID-19-related endothelial cell damage and the resultant inflammation and thrombotic risk.","Rambaldi, Alessandro; Gritti, Giuseppe; Micò, Maria Caterina; Frigeni, Marco; Borleri, Gianmaria; Salvi, Anna; Landi, Francesco; Pavoni, Chiara; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Gianatti, Andrea; Binda, Francesca; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Di Marco, Fabiano; Lorini, Luca; Remuzzi, Giuseppe; Whitaker, Steve; Demopulos, Gregory",Immunobiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298520304459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32943233/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2020.152001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298520304459?v=s5,19

PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence on the prevalence, levels, and durability of detectable antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confer natural immunity. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization global literature database, and Covid19reviews.org from 1 January through 15 December 2020, limited to peer-reviewed publications available in English. STUDY SELECTION: Primary studies characterizing the prevalence, levels, and duration of antibodies in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); reinfection incidence; and unintended consequences of antibody testing. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators sequentially extracted study data and rated quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Moderate-strength evidence suggests that most adults develop detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that IgG levels peak approximately 25 days after symptom onset and may remain detectable for at least 120 days. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that IgM levels peak at approximately 20 days and then decline. Low-strength evidence suggests that most adults generate neutralizing antibodies, which may persist for several months like IgG. Low-strength evidence also suggests that older age, greater disease severity, and presence of symptoms may be associated with higher antibody levels. Some adults do not develop antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection for reasons that are unclear. LIMITATION: Most studies were small and had methodological limitations; studies used immunoassays of variable accuracy. CONCLUSION: Most adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR develop antibodies. Levels of IgM peak early in the disease course and then decline, whereas IgG peaks later and may remain detectable for at least 120 days.

The primary infection site is likely to be a mucosal surface, mainly the lungs or the intestine, where epithelial cells can be infected with virus. Although it is clear that virus within the lungs can cause severe pathology, driven by an exaggerated immune response, infection within the intestine generally seems to cause minor or no symptoms. In this review, we compare the disease processes between the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, and what might drive these different responses. As the microbiome is a key part of mucosal barrier sites, we also consider the effect that microbial species may play on infection and the subsequent immune responses. Because of difficulties obtaining tissue samples, there are currently few studies focused on the local mucosal response rather than the systemic response, but understanding the local immune response will become increasingly important for understanding the mechanisms of disease in order to develop better treatments.","Pearson, Claire F; Jeffery, Rebecca; Thornton, Emily E",Oxf Open Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585820/; https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfimm/iqab002,19

From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracajú, Salvador, Recife, and Maceió, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV. Some of these findings differ from those reported for other regions in Brazil and may be used to guide policies that address LRTI.","Gurgel, Ricardo Queiroz; Bezerra, Patrícia Gomes de Matos; Duarte, Maria do Carmo Menezes Bezerra; Moura, Adriana Ávila; Souza, Edna Lucia; Silva, Luciana Sobral da Silveira; Suzuki, Claudia Eiko; Peixoto, Rodrigo Buzzatti",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000003090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27082548/,19

If the DL algorithm achieves a performance equivalent to that achieved by physicians in chest radiography (CR) diagnoses with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, the automatic interpretation of the CR with DL algorithms can significantly reduce the burden on clinicians and radiologists in sudden surges of suspected COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR compared with formal radiology reports. This is a retrospective study of adult patients that were diagnosed as positive COVID-19 cases based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction among all the patients who were admitted to five emergency departments and one community treatment center in Korea from February 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The CR images were evaluated with a publicly available DL algorithm. For reference, CR images without chest computed tomography (CT) scans classified as positive for COVID-19 pneumonia were used given that the radiologist identified ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or other infiltration in retrospectively reviewed CR images. Patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest CT scans were also classified as COVID-19 pneumonia positive outcomes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR were 95.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the DL algorithm for the detection of COVID-19 with pneumonia was 0.921. The DL algorithm demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance comparable with that of formal radiology reports in the CR-based diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The DL algorithm may offer fast and reliable examinations that can facilitate patient screening and isolation decisions, which can reduce the medical staff workload during COVID-19 pandemic situations.","Jang, Se Bum; Lee, Suk Hee; Lee, Dong Eun; Park, Sin-Youl; Kim, Jong Kun; Cho, Jae Wan; Cho, Jaekyung; Kim, Ki Beom; Park, Byunggeon; Park, Jongmin; Lim, Jae-Kwang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232368/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242759,19

The pandemic presented new barriers to pediatric vaccinations. Furthermore, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has complicated factors underlying vaccine hesitancy. We performed a cross-sectional mobile phone-based survey at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles querying parents regarding perspectives on vaccines before and during the pandemic. Our primary aim was to understand the impact of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine hesitancy. Secondarily, we examined intent to vaccinate, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and key contributing demographic factors. Among 252 participants, we found overall increased childhood vaccine hesitancy (p = 0.006), increased risk perception (p = 0.006), and unchanged vaccine confidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased hesitancy did not translate into decreased intent to vaccinate with routine childhood vaccines or influenza vaccines. During the pandemic, households with higher income (50–99 K, > 100 K) correlated with decreased routine childhood vaccine hesitancy, while Hispanic ethnicity and African American race had increased risk perception. For COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, households with higher income (> 100 K) correlated with decreased hesitancy, while non-White ethnicity and race had increased risk perception. We found that routine childhood vaccine hesitancy increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly due to increased risk perception. Key contributing demographic factors behind both childhood vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included household income and race. Understanding factors behind routine childhood vaccine hesitancy is crucial to maintaining pediatric vaccination rates and promoting vaccine confidence during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","He, Kaidi; Mack, Wendy J.; Neely, Michael; Lewis, Laura; Anand, Vikram",J Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34297272/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-01017-9,19

Additionally, the responses collected were further analysed according to gender for a holistic understanding of the trust element. A cross-sectional quantitative research approach was adopted. Specifically, snowball sampling method was used to collect responses from online consumers. The findings revealed that benevolence, integrity, and competence trust are found to be positively associated with product promotion effectiveness. Competence trust recorded a large effect size followed by benevolence and integrity trust. Both male and female consumers shown different degrees of trust level. The findings provide practical implications for online merchants. They were suggested to focus on enhancing online consumers’ trust level and capitalize on competence trust for effective product promotion.

Several widely available drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have immunometabolic activities that (among other things) maintain or restore endothelial cell function. For this reason, we undertook an observational study in four Belgian hospitals to determine whether in-hospital treatment with these drugs could improve survival in 959 COVID-19 patients. We found that treatment with statins and ACEIs/ARBs reduced 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, combination treatment with these drugs resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the odds of hospital mortality (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.69). These findings were in general agreement with other published studies. Additional observational studies and clinical trials are needed to convincingly show that in-hospital treatment with statins, ACEIs/ARBs, and especially their combination saves lives.","Byttebier, G.; Belmans, L.; Alexander, M.; Saxberg, B.

673650,Biologically active polymer nanosystems,2018-01-26,"Pure water will become a golden resource in the context of the rising pollution, climate change and the recycling economy, calling for advanced purification methods such as the use of nanostructured adsorbents. However, coming up with an ideal nanoadsorbent for micropollutant removal is a real challenge because nanoadsorbents, which demonstrate very good performances at laboratory scale, do not necessarily have suitable properties in in full-scale water purification and wastewater treatment systems. Here, magnetic nanoadsorbents appear promising because they can be easily separated from the slurry phase into a denser sludge phase by applying a magnetic field. Yet, there are only few examples of large-scale use of magnetic adsorbents for water purification and wastewater treatment. Here, we review magnetic nanoadsorbents for the removal of micropollutants, and we explain the integration of magnetic separation in the existing treatment plants. We found that the use of magnetic nanoadsorbents is an effective option in water treatment, but lacks maturity in full-scale water treatment facilities. The concentrations of magnetic nanoadsorbents in final effluents can be controlled by using magnetic separation, thus minimizing the ecotoxicicological impact. Academia and the water industry should better collaborate to integrate magnetic separation in full-scale water purification and wastewater treatment plants.","Mudhoo, Ackmez; Sillanpää, Mika",Environ Chem Lett,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-021-01289-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34341658/,19

A new genotype of feline morbillivirus, tentatively named feline morbillivirus genotype 2 (FeMV-GT2), was isolated from urine of cats with urinary tract diseases. Whole genome sequencing showed about 78% nucleotide homology to known feline morbilliviruses. The virus was isolated in permanent cell lines of feline and simian origin. To investigate the cell tropism of FeMV-GT2 feline primary epithelial cells from the kidney, the urinary bladder and the lung, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as organotypic brain slice cultures were used for infection experiments. We demonstrate that FeMV-GT2 is able to infect renal and pulmonary epithelial cells, primary cells from the cerebrum and cerebellum, as well as immune cells in the blood, especially CD4(+) T cells, CD20(+) B cells and monocytes. The cats used for virus isolation shed FeMV-GT2 continuously for several months despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the blood. Our results point towards the necessity of increased awareness for this virus when clinical signs of the aforementioned organs are encountered in cats which cannot be explained by other etiologies.","Sieg, Michael; Busch, Johannes; Eschke, Maria; Böttcher, Denny; Heenemann, Kristin; Vahlenkamp, Annett; Reinert, Anja; Seeger, Johannes; Heilmann, Romy; Scheffler, Kira; Vahlenkamp, Thomas W.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30744110/,19

675401,Bioinformatics Resources and Tools for Phage Display,2011-01-18,"BACKGROUND: During coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, various adverse skin reactions to long‐term mask wearing have been reported. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the clinical features of mask‐induced dermatoses and recommend prevention and treatment options. METHODS: From April to August 2020, questionnaires including preexisting skin disorders, patients’ reported mask‐related symptoms, their daily mask wearing duration and frequency, types of masks used, whether they are health care workers, and demographic information were distributed to patients of 12 hospitals. Dermatologists assessed skin lesions, confirmed diagnosis, and recorded treatment modalities. RESULTS: Itchiness was the most frequent symptom, mostly affecting the cheeks. Most common skin disease was new‐onset contact dermatitis (33.94%), followed by new‐onset acne (16.97%) and aggravation of preexisting acne (16.97%). Daily wearing (p=0.018) was significantly associated with new‐onset contact dermatitis. More than half of the patients with preexisting skin problems experienced aggravation while wearing masks. Longer duration (more than 6 hours/day, p=0.043) and cotton masks (p<0.001) significantly increased acne flare‐up. Healthcare workers had a higher incidence of skin disease. Skin lesions were generally mild and well tolerated with topical agents. LIMITATIONS: Effect of seasonal characteristics and other risk factors were not assessed. The patients were visiting dermatologic clinics and had interest in their skin status. Thus, a selection bias may exist.

No original studies exist on audiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. The main objective was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 may affect auditory function in clinically ill COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods COVID-19 patients with moderate-severe disease and without prior history of hearing abnormalities were enrolled from a tertiary referral center, and matched with controls. Participants performed an audiometric evaluation, and thresholds were compared. Results 120 ears from 60 patients were enrolled. Patients with COVID-19 showed worse mean auditory thresholds starting from 1000 Hz through higher frequencies, when compared to controls ( 1000 Hz : 18.52 ± 5.49 dB HL in controls vs 25.36 ± 6.79 dB HL in COVID-19, p<0.001; 2000Hz : 17.50 ± 5.57 dB HL in controls vs 21.96 ± 7.05 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.010; 3000Hz : 17.97 ± 8.07 dB HL in controls vs 25 ± 9.38 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.003; 4000 Hz : 20.16 ± 10.12 dB HL in controls vs 29.55 ± 11.26 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.001; 8000 Hz : 31.09 ± 12.75 dB HL in controls vs 40.71 ± 19.40 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.030; Pure Tone Average : 20.42 ± 4.29 dB HL in controls vs 24.85 ± 5.62 dB HL in COVID-19, p=0.001). Statistical significance persisted after adjusting for confounders such as age, gender and various comorbidities (p<0.05). Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 may affect hearing in COVID-19 patients with moderate-severe disease. Results are in line with the previous suggested effects of COVID-19 on auditory system.

AIMS: To determine whether hypertensive patients hospitalized with Covid‐19 are at risk of worse outcomes if on treatment with ACEIs or ARBs compared to other anti‐hypertensive medications. METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted at a single academic medical center [Fondazione Policlinico A.Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, Italy] from March 1(st) to 31 (st), 2020. We compared patients on treatment with an ACEIs/ARBs (ACEIs/ARBs group) to patients receiving other anti‐hypertensive medications (No‐ACEIs/ARBs group). The endpoints of the study were the all‐cause in‐hospital death and the combination of in‐hospital death or need for ICU admission. RESULTS: The sample included 166 Covid‐19 patients; median age was 74 years and 109 were men (66%). Overall, 111 patients (67%) were taking an ACEIs or ARBs. Twenty‐nine patients (17%) died during hospital stay, and 51 (31%) met the combined endpoint. After adjustment for comorbidities, age and degree of severity at the presentation, ACEIs or ARBs treatment was an independent predictor neither of in‐hospital death nor of the combination of in‐hospital death/need for ICU. No differences were documented between treatment with ACEIs compared to ARBs. CONCLUSIONS: Among hypertensive patients hospitalized for Covid‐19, treatment with ACEIs or ARBs is not associated with an increased risk of in‐hospital death. This article is protected by copyright.

675833,Virus diseases of farmed shrimp in the Western Hemisphere (the Americas): A review,2011-01-31,"RATIONALE: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) 2, the entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AT2) that may play key roles in post-injury repair. Imbalance between ACE2 and ACE has also been hypothesized to contribute to lung injury. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the expression and distribution of ACE2 and ACE and to compare AT2 versus endothelial cell expression in COVID-related or -unrelated ARDS and controls. METHODS: Lung tissue stainings (using multiplex immunofluorescence) and serum concentrations of ACEs were determined retrospectively in two different cohorts of patients. AT2 and endothelial cells were stained in lung tissue for ProSPC and CD31, respectively. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary ACE2 expression was increased in patients with COVID-related and -unrelated ARDS (0.06% of tissue area and 0.12% vs. 0.006% for controls; p=0.013 and p<0.0001 respectively). ACE2 was upregulated in endothelial cells (0.32% and 0.53% vs. 0.01%, p=0.009 and p<0.0001) but not in AT2 cells (0.13% and 0.08% vs. 0.03%, p=0.94 and p=0.44). Pulmonary expression of ACE was decreased in both COVID-related and -unrelated ARDS (p=0.057 and p=0.032). Similar increases in ACE2 and decreases in ACE were observed in sera of COVID-19 (p=0.0054 and p<0.0001) and non-COVID-19 ARDS (p<0.0001 and p=0.016). In addition, AT2 cells were decreased in patients with COVID-related ARDS compared to COVID-unrelated ARDS (1.395% vs. 2.94%, p=0.0033). CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 is upregulated in lung tissue and serum of both COVID-related and -unrelated ARDS whereas a loss of AT2 cells is selectively observed in COVID-related ARDS.

Of the restrictions enacted during COVID-19, among the more controversial surround alcohol. Like many infectious diseases, the principal mode of transmission for COVID-19 is direct respiration of droplets emitted during close social contact, and health officials warn that alcohol consumption may lead to decreased adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Governing bodies have acted to close bars before restaurants and have also specifically restricted alcohol sales, while at the same time those in the nightlife industry have labeled such actions unfounded and discriminatory. Complicating such debates is the lack of evidence on alcohol’s effects on physical distance. In the current study we employed a randomized alcohol-administration design paired with computer-vision measures, analyzing over 20,000 proximity readings derived from video to examine the effect of alcohol consumption on physical distance during social interaction. Results indicated that alcohol caused individuals to draw significantly closer to an unfamiliar interaction partner during social exchange, reducing physical proximity at a rate with potentially important implications for public health. In contrast, alcohol had no effect on physical distance with a familiar interaction partner. Findings suggest that alcohol might act to overcome a natural caution people feel towards strangers and thus promote virus transmission between previously unconnected social groups.","Gurrieri, Laura; Fairbairn, Catharine E.; Sayette, Michael A.; Bosch, Nigel",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33972448/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2101937118,19

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to social restrictions in many countries to prevent virus spreading, restrictions that dramatically altered daily routines and limited outdoor daylight exposure. We previously reported that sleep duration increased, social jetlag decreased, and mid-sleep times delayed during social restrictions (Global Chrono Corona Survey, N = 7,517). In the present study, we investigated in the same dataset changes in wellbeing and their link to outdoor daylight exposure, and sleep-wake behaviour. In social restrictions, median values of sleep quality, quality of life, physical activity and productivity deteriorated, while screen time increased, and outdoor daylight exposure was reduced by ~58%. Yet, many survey participants also reported no changes or even improvements. Larger reductions in outdoor daylight exposure were linked to deteriorations in wellbeing and delayed mid-sleep times. Notably, sleep duration was not associated with outdoor daylight exposure loss. Longer sleep and decreased alarm-clock use dose-dependently correlated with changes in sleep quality and quality of life. Regression analysis for each wellbeing aspect showed that a model with six predictors including both levels and their deltas of outdoor daylight exposure, sleep duration and mid-sleep timing explained 5%-10% of the variance in changes of wellbeing scores (except for productivity). As exposure to daylight may extenuate the negative effects of social restriction and prevent sleep disruption, public strategies during pandemics should actively foster spending more daytime outdoors.","Korman, Maria; Tkachev, Vadim; Reis, Cátia; Komada, Yoko; Kitamura, Shingo; Gubin, Denis; Kumar, Vinod; Roenneberg, Till",J Sleep Res,https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34549481/,19

Resistance can be conferred on suckling C3H mice by postnatal transmission of maternal immunity, if transfer preceeds infection. Suckling mice succumb to infection even when they receive maternal antibodies within 1 day after infection. Prenatal transmission alone without subsequent postnatal transmission of maternal immunity is not sufficient to provide resistance. Persistence of virus without clinical consequences was observed when the supply of breast milk anti-JHMV antibodies was terminated 5 days before infection. Immune reactions restricted by histocompatibility antigens do not play a crucial role in bestowing resistance. As neutralizing anti-JHM serum antibody titers of adult mice only rise sharply 5 to 7 days after infection, these results indicate that infection of adults can be arrested by immunological means but that, in addition, the rate of virus dissemination must be limited by other non-immunological mechanisms.","Pickel, K.; Müller, M.

METHOD: This is a retrospective single-center study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan No. 3 Hospital (January 31 to March 27, 2020). According to whether Epstein-Barr virus reactivation was detected, the patients were divided into an EBV group and a Non-EBV group. Baseline data were collected including epidemiological, larithmics, clinical and imaging characteristics, and laboratory examination data. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients with COVID-19, 17 (13.3%) were infected with Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. In the symptoms,the rate of tachypnoea in the EBV group was apparently higher than that in the Non-EBV group. In lab tests, the lymphocyte and albumin of EBV group decreased more significantly than Non-EBV group, and the D-dimer and serum calcium of EBV group was higher than Non-EBV group. Regarding the infection index, CRP of EBV group was apparently above the Non-EBV group, and no significant difference was found in procalcitonin of the two groups. The incidence of respiratory failure, ARDS, and hypoproteinaemia of EBV group had more incidence than Non-EBV group. The 28-day and 14-day mortality rates of EBV group was significantly higher than that of Non-EBV group.

This was necessary due to changes in workload and working practice guidelines that have evolved during the pandemic. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiography practice, service delivery and workforce wellbeing. METHODS: A systematic review methodology was adopted to obtain data from primary studies of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs from databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and SCOPUS: all 2020 to present). The included articles were subjected to information extraction and results-based convergent synthesis. RESULTS: The electronic database search yielded 10,420 articles after removal of duplicates. Of these, 31 articles met the final inclusion criteria with some (n = 8) fully focussed on radiotherapy workforce and service delivery. The pandemic impact on radiography practice is broadly themed around: training, communication, and information dissemination; infrastructure, technology, and clinical workflow; and workforce mental health and well-being. CONCLUSION: Globally, most radiographers received inadequate training for managing COVID-19 patients during the initial acute phase of the pandemic. Additionally, there were significant changes to clinical practice, working patterns and perceived increase in workload due to surges in COVID-19 patients and the consequent strict adherence to new infection protocols. These changes, coupled with fear emanating from the increased risk of the workforce to contracting the infection, contributed to anxiety and workplace-related stress during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Local pandemic response strategies must be appropriately developed from standard protocols in readiness for safe clinical practice and well-being management training of practitioners.","Akudjedu, T.N.; Mishio, N.A.; Elshami, W.; Culp, M.P.; Lawal, O.; Botwe, B.O.; Wuni, A.-R.; Julka-Anderson, N.; Shanahan, M.; Totman, J.J.; Franklin, J.M.",Radiography (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078817421000845?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303601/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2021.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078817421000845,19

679180,Pharmacological validation of targets regulating CD14 during macrophage differentiation,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread to 32 countries and regions within a few months in 2003. There were 5327 SARS cases from November 2002 to May 2003 in Mainland China, which involved 29 provinces, resulted in 349 deaths, and directly caused economic losses of $18.3 billion. METHODS: This study used an in-out flow model and flow mapping to visualize and explore the spatial pattern of SARS transmission in different regions. In-out flow is measured by the in-out degree and clustering coefficient of SARS. Flow mapping is an exploratory method of spatial visualization for interaction data. RESULTS: The findings were as follows. (1) SARS in-out flow had a clear hierarchy. It formed two main centers, Guangdong in South China and Beijing in North China, and two secondary centers, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, both connected to Beijing. (2) “Spring Festival travel” strengthened external flow, but “SARS panic effect” played a more significant role and pushed the external flow to the peak. (3) External flow and its three typical kinds showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, such as self-spreading flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases only within the province or municipality of onset and medical locations); hospitalized flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases that had been seen by a hospital doctor); and migrant flow (spatial displacement of SARS cases among migrant workers). (4) Internal and external flow tended to occur in younger groups, and occupational differentiation was particularly evident. Low-income groups of male migrants aged 19–35 years were the main routes of external flow. CONCLUSIONS: During 2002–2003, SARS in-out flow played an important role in countrywide transmission of the disease in Mainland China. The flow had obvious spatial heterogeneity, which was influenced by migrants’ behavior characteristics.

681065,Editorial: Comparative Genomics and Functional Genomics Analyses in Plants,2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of at-risk drinking is far higher among those in contact with the criminal justice system (73%) than the general population (35%). However, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) in reducing risky drinking among those in the criminal justice system, including the prison system and, in particular, those on remand. Building on earlier work, A two-arm parallel group individually randomised Prison Pilot study of a male Remand Alcohol Intervention for Self-efficacy Enhancement (APPRAISE) is a pilot study designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an ABI, delivered to male prisoners on remand. The findings of APPRAISE should provide the information required to design a future definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: APPRAISE will use mixed methods, with two linked phases, across two prisons in the UK, recruiting 180 adult men on remand: 90 from Scotland and 90 from England. Phase I will involve a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomised pilot study. The pilot evaluation will provide data on the likely impact of A two-arm parallel group individually randomised Prison Pilot study of a male Remand Alcohol Intervention for Self-efficacy Enhancement (APPRAISE), which will be used to inform a future definitive multicentre RCT. Phase II will be a process evaluation assessing how the ABI has been implemented to explore the change mechanisms underpinning the ABI (figure 1) and to assess the context within which the ABI is delivered. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The APPRAISE protocol has been approved by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Committee (19/ES/0068), National Offender Management System (2019-240), Health Board Research and Development (2019/0268), Scottish Prison Service research and ethics committee, and by the University of Edinburgh’s internal ethics department.

An online cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in November 2020 among 6000 Japanese adults (aged 20–64 years) registered with a research company and gathered data on demographics, socioeconomic factors, medical history, COVID-19 status of the respondent’s family and neighbors, fear of COVID-19, and changes in lifestyle and dietary habits since the COVID-19 outbreak. To the question “Have you made healthier changes to your dietary habits compared with the dietary habits before the spread of COVID-19 (1 year ago, November 2019)?”, 1215 (20.3%), 491 (8.2%), and 4294 (71.6%) participants answered that their dietary habits were healthier, unhealthier, and unchanged, respectively. Healthier and unhealthier dietary habits were associated with greater fear of COVID-19, altered exercise and sleep times, and smoking. Unhealthy habits were positively associated with living alone, decreasing household income, colleagues with COVID-19, stress, and weight loss/gain. Annual household income, changing household income, COVID-19 in friends, health literacy, exercise frequency, weight loss, and starting smoking were positively associated with healthier dietary changes. The generalizability of these results and strategies to inculcate healthy diets in this “new normal” should be investigated.","Shimpo, Misa; Akamatsu, Rie; Kojima, Yui; Yokoyama, Tetsuji; Okuhara, Tsuyoshi; Chiba, Tsuyoshi",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13062039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198633/,19
682019,Discovery and Development of Antiviral Drugs for Biodefense: Experience of a Small Biotechnology Company,2008-01-01,"Assisting patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a crucial role for nurses, and as future nurses, students should demonstrate sound clinical judgment. Well-structured, high-quality simulations are useful alternatives to prepare students for clinical practice. However, nursing simulation scenarios focused on enhancing clinical judgment in managing upper gastrointestinal bleeding are limited. This study aims to develop, apply, and evaluate an effective nursing simulation scenario for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding based on Tanner’s clinical judgment model using a mixed methods study design. A high-fidelity patient simulation was conducted among 80 undergraduate nursing students divided into a simulated control group (n = 39) and an experimental group (n = 41). Subsequent student performance evaluations used questionnaires and video recordings. After scenario simulations, the students showed a statistically significant increase in theoretical knowledge (p = 0.001) and clinical performance skills (p < 0.001), but there was no significant increase in self-confidence (p = 0.291). According to the video analysis, the “noticing” clinical judgment phase was the most frequently observed phase, while “reflection” was the least frequently observed phase. Additionally, “education” was the most frequently observed nursing domain, and “anxiety” was the least frequently observed domain. Although further simulation repetitions are required to reinforce students’ self-confidence when caring for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the scenario was deemed effective. Moreover, emphasis should be placed on developing various scenarios to strengthen students’ clinical judgment skills, especially “reflecting” and “emotional care.”","Jang, AeRi; Park, Hyunyoung",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33939752/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251029,19

In this study, we report our experiences on evaluating the effects of COVID‐19 in patients with recent liver transplants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated patients who received liver transplants during three close consecutive periods of time. For transplants conducted between October 1 and December 31, 2019, January 1 and March 10, 2020 and March 11 and June 22, 2020, the lung tomographies of patients were inspected for radiological signs of viral pneumonia. For patients after March 11, 2020, the hospital's electronic database system was scanned for preoperative and postoperative SARS‐CoV‐2 testing from Real‐time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT‐PCR) of the respiratory tract samples. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients over the age of 18 who received liver transplants at our centre between October 1, 2019 and June 22, 2020 were evaluated. During this time span, our centre conducted liver transplants on patients from 34 different provinces and also abroad. Within this time period, a total of nine patients had respiratory samples with a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐PCR test. PCR of respiratory tract samples was performed in 21 (14%) patients to identify the other potential infective agents in the respiratory tracts; Rhinovirus and Influenza A were detected in two and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in one patient. During the transplant periods, 99 (67.1%) patients were evaluated with computed tomography (CT). The CT findings of 18 (12%) patients were consistent with viral pneumonia. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups only in terms of air bronchogram findings (P = .012). CONCLUSION: The clinical status of our short‐term liver transplant patients was far better than we originally anticipated, but it remains obvious that the necessary precautions should continue to be taken.","Altunisik Toplu, Sibel; Bayindir, Yasar; Yilmaz, Sezai; Yalçınsoy, Murat; Otlu, Baris; Kose, Adem; Sahin, Tevfik Tolga; Akbulut, Sami; Isik, Burak; Başkiran, Adil; Koc, Cemalettin",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327793/,19

In addition, vaccine development for people with compromised immunity and other pre-existing medical conditions has remained a major challenge. Besides the traditional inactivated or live attenuated, virus-vectored and subunit vaccines, emerging non-viral vaccine technologies, such as viral-like particle and nanoparticle vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, and rational vaccine design, offer innovative approaches to address existing challenges of vaccine development. They have also significantly advanced our understanding of vaccine immunology and can guide future vaccine development for many diseases, including rapidly emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and diseases that have not traditionally been addressed by vaccination, such as cancers and substance abuse.

So, the goal of the present study is to learn from the pathophysiology of COVID-19 clinical features, laboratory results, and high-resolution CT manifestations in different stages of disease severity to provide significant reference values for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. METHODS: This was a multicentered study that included 128 patients. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, in addition to chest HRCT findings, were evaluated. According to chest HRCT features, radiologic scoring were grade 1 and 2 for mild grades of the disease, 3 and 4 for moderate grades of the disease, and 5 and 6 for severe grades of the disease. RESULTS: Patient clinical symptoms ranged between fever, dry cough, muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue, dyspnea, hyposomia, sore throat, and diarrhea. Lymphocytes and WBCs were significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19. A significant negative correlation was found with WBCs (r = − 0.245, P = 0.005), lymphocytes% (r = − 0.586, P < 0.001), RBCs (r = − 0.2488, P = 0.005), Hb (gm/dl) (r = − 0.342, P < 0.001), and HCT (r = − 0.377, P < 0.001).

684778,Trends in antiviral strategies,2019-11-08,"Acute respiratory infections accounts for 20–40% of outpatient and 12–35% of inpatient attendance in a general hospital. Upper respiratory tract infections including nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and otitis media constitute 87.5% of the total episodes of respiratory infections. The vast majority of acute upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses. Common cold is caused by viruses in most circumstances and does not require antimicrobial agent unless it is complicated by acute otitis media with effusion, tonsillitis, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infection. Sinusitis is commonly associated with common cold. Most instances of rhinosinusitis are viral and therefore, resolve spontaneously without antimicrobial therapy. The most common bacterial agents causing sinusitis areS. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis,S. aureus andS. pyogenes. Amoxycillin is antibacterial of choice. The alternative drugs are cefaclor or cephalexin. The latter becomes first line if sinusitis is recurrent or chronic. Acute pharyngitis is commonly caused by viruses and does not need antibiotics. About 15% of the episodes may be due to Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABS). Early initiation of antibiotics in pharyngitis due to GABS can prevent complications such as acute rheumatic fever. The drug of choice is penicillin for 10–14 days. The alternative medications include oral cephalosporins (cefaclor, cephalexin), amoxicillin or macrolides.","Jain, Neemisha; Lodha, R.; Kabra, S.

Intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia, a condition that represents the main hallmark of obstructive sleep apnea in humans, is known to induce significant alterations in the gut microbiome and metabolism, and promotes the progression of atherosclerosis in mouse models. To further understand the role of the microbiome in the cardiovascular response to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia, we developed a new rodent cage system that allows exposure of mice to controlled levels of O(2) and CO(2) under gnotobiotic conditions. Using this experimental setup, we determined the impact of the microbiome on the transcriptional response to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia in the left ventricle of the mouse heart. We identified significant changes in gene expression in both conventionally reared and germ-free mice. Following intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia exposure, we detected 192 significant changes in conventionally reared mice (96 upregulated and 96 downregulated) and 161 significant changes (70 upregulated and 91 downregulated) in germ-free mice. Only 19 of these differentially expressed transcripts (∼10%) were common to conventionally reared and germ-free mice. Such distinct transcriptional responses imply that the host microbiota plays an important role in regulating the host transcriptional response to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia in the mouse heart.","Zhou, Dan; Xue, Jin; Miyamoto, Yukiko; Poulsen, Orit; Eckmann, Lars; Haddad, Gabriel G.",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.680275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248668/,19

Early reports from states releasing vaccination data by race show that White residents are being vaccinated at significantly higher rates than Black residents. Public health efforts are being targeted to address vaccine hesitancy among Black and other minority populations. However, health care interventions intended to reduce health disparities that do not reflect the underlying values of individuals in underrepresented populations are unlikely to be successful. OBJECTIVE: To identify key factors underlying the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: Primary data were collected from an online survey of a representative sample of the populations of the 4 largest US states (New York, California, Texas, and Florida) between August 10 and September 3, 2020. Using latent class analysis, we built a model identifying key factors underlying the disparities in COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We found that individuals who identify as Black had lower rates of vaccine hesitancy than those who identify as White. This was true overall, by latent class and within latent class. This suggests that, contrary to what is currently being reported, Black individuals are not universally more vaccine hesitant. Combining the respondents who would not consider a vaccine (17%) with those who would consider one but ultimately choose not to vaccinate (11%), our findings indicate that more than 1 in 4 (28%) persons will not be willing to vaccinate. The no-vaccine rate is highest in White individuals and lowest in Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that other factors, potentially institutional, are driving the vaccination rates for these groups. Our model results help point the way to more effective differentiated policies. DISCLOSURES: No funding was received for this study.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02 ±9.72 and 18.27 % males; aged 36.38±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. RESULTS: Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable.

A key area is work readiness, which has steadily grown in importance over the last 2 decades as tertiary institutions increasingly aim to produce graduates who perceive and are perceived as work ready. However, a large majority of graduates report a lack of skills and confidence needed for the effective transition from study to work. This may be particularly problematic for disciplines that impart both discipline-specific and transferrable skills, such as psychology. The aim of this paper is to addresses the concept of work readiness within Australian psychological training and explores the need to shed light on and integrate work readiness within the pedagogy of psychology within Australia. Specifically, this paper calls for a review of work readiness skills developed in psychological courses to ensure industry needs are met. Beyond such a review, it is suggested that tertiary centres need to facilitate students in capturing and reflecting upon the transferable skills that they develop; and build assessments that allow students to demonstrate transferable skills in a meaningful way. Further, this paper proposes that work readiness skills be routinely mapped onto graduate attributes and course learning outcomes to be readily available by students so as to increase students’ potential to articulate their learnt work readiness skills once in the workplace.","Schweinsberg, Ashleigh; Mundy, Matthew E.; Dyer, Kyle R.; Garivaldis, Filia",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897531/,19

However, the organization struggles to protect its corresponding right to receive reports from non-state actors on outbreak events. This article examines the consequences of this implementation gap between what is stated in the IHR—the right of WHO to receive reports from non-state actors on outbreak events—and the reality that states remain able and willing to act to ensure that this right is not exercised. The article examines two recent cases: the first detection of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Saudi Arabia, and the first months of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Both cases demonstrate how the WHO has struggled to balance states’ concern with managing risk communication against WHO’s right to receive reports from non-state actors. The article argues that to realize the full potential of a transparent disease outbreak reporting process, there is a need for a human rights framework that expressly articulates its right to receive reports and outlines appropriate behaviour for the WHO, states, and non-state actors.","Davies, Sara E.",Med Law Rev,https://doi.org/10.1093/medlaw/fwx011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28472502/,19

For understanding the susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cell type-specific expression of the host cell surface receptor is necessary. The key protein suggested to be involved in host cell entry is Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we report the expression pattern of ACE2 across >150 different cell types corresponding to all major human tissues and organs based on stringent immunohistochemical analysis. The results were compared with several datasets both on the mRNA and protein level. ACE2 expression was mainly observed in enterocytes, renal tubules, gallbladder, cardiomyocytes, male reproductive cells, placental trophoblasts, ductal cells, eye and vasculature. In the respiratory system, the expression was limited, with no or only low expression in a subset of cells in a few individuals, observed by one antibody only.

689032,Structural biology in antiviral drug discovery,2016-09-06,"Understanding the host regulatory mechanisms opposing virus infection and virulence can provide actionable insights to identify novel therapeutics against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have used a network biology approach to elucidate the crucial factors involved in host responses involving host–microRNA (miRNA) interactions with host and virus genes using recently published experimentally verified protein–protein interaction data. We were able to identify 311 host genes to be potentially targetable by 2,197 human miRNAs. These miRNAs are known to be involved in various biological processes, such as T-cell differentiation and activation, virus replication, and immune system. Among these, the anti-viral activity of 38 miRNAs to target 148 host genes is experimentally validated. Six anti-viral miRNAs, namely, hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-199a-3p, hsa-miR-429, hsa-miR-15a-5p, and hsa-miR-20a-5p, are previously reported to be anti-viral in respiratory diseases and were found to be downregulated. The interaction network of the 2,197 human miRNAs and interacting transcription factors (TFs) enabled the identification of 51 miRNAs to interact with 77 TFs inducing activation or repression and affecting gene expression of linked genes. Further, from the gene regulatory network analysis, the top five hub genes HMOX1, DNMT1, PLAT, GDF1, and ITGB1 are found to be involved in interferon (IFN)-α2b induction, epigenetic modification, and modulation of anti-viral activity. The comparative miRNAs target identification analysis in other respiratory viruses revealed the presence of 98 unique host miRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our findings identify prioritized key regulatory interactions that include miRNAs and TFs that provide opportunities for the identification of novel drug targets and development of anti-viral drugs.","Sardar, Rahila; Satish, Deepshikha; Gupta, Dinesh",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173539/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.571274,19

LR was mixed with NR/BR at various proportions to produce tread materials which will comply with national specifications. The blends were prepared and the cure and mechanical properties were investigated. Results have indicated that the scorch time and cure time had decreased with the increase of reclaim loading. The mechanical properties like tensile strength, tear strength, abrasion resistance decrease with the increase in the LR content. It was found that 70–80% of the mechanical properties were retained even after addition of 30 phr of LR. The thermal behaviour and activation energy of NR/BR/LR system was investigated using thermogravimetry TGA analysis and increased activation energy showed that the thermal stability has increased when the amount of LR is high.

689492,ERAD and ERAD tuning: disposal of cargo and of ERAD regulators from the mammalian ER,2010-11-13,"BACKGROUND: As of June 8, 2020, the global reported number of COVID-19 cases had reached more than 7 million with over 400 000 deaths. The household transmissibility of the causative pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among household and non-household close contacts in Guangzhou, China, using a statistical transmission model. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive contact tracing dataset from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the secondary attack rate of COVID-19 (defined as the probability that an infected individual will transmit the disease to a susceptible individual) among household and non-household contacts, using a statistical transmission model. We considered two alternative definitions of household contacts in the analysis: individuals who were either family members or close relatives, such as parents and parents-in-law, regardless of residential address, and individuals living at the same address regardless of relationship. We assessed the demographic determinants of transmissibility and the infectivity of COVID-19 cases during their incubation period. FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2020, and Feb 18, 2020, we traced 195 unrelated close contact groups (215 primary cases, 134 secondary or tertiary cases, and 1964 uninfected close contacts). By identifying households from these groups, assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days, a maximum infectious period of 13 days, and no case isolation, the estimated secondary attack rate among household contacts was 12·4% (95% CI 9·8–15·4) when household contacts were defined on the basis of close relatives and 17·1% (13·3–21·8) when household contacts were defined on the basis of residential address. Compared with the oldest age group (≥60 years), the risk of household infection was lower in the youngest age group (<20 years; odds ratio [OR] 0·23 [95% CI 0·11–0·46]) and among adults aged 20–59 years (OR 0·64 [95% CI 0·43–0·97]). Our results suggest greater infectivity during the incubation period than during the symptomatic period, although differences were not statistically significant (OR 0·61 [95% CI 0·27–1·38]). The estimated local reproductive number (R) based on observed contact frequencies of primary cases was 0·5 (95% CI 0·41–0·62) in Guangzhou. The projected local R, had there been no isolation of cases or quarantine of their contacts, was 0·6 (95% CI 0·49–0·74) when household was defined on the basis of close relatives. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible in households than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Older individuals (aged ≥60 years) are the most susceptible to household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to case finding and isolation, timely tracing and quarantine of close contacts should be implemented to prevent onward transmission during the viral incubation period.

Without effective medicines, the mainstay of PTBLD treatment evolves around disease prevention and supportive treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), a low-cost, non-pharmacological intervention has shown effectiveness in a group of PTBLD individuals but has not been tested in a clinical trial. This study aims to assess the impact of a 6-week PR programme on maximal exercise capacity and other outcomes among adults in Uganda living with PTBLD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised waiting-list controlled trial with blinded outcome measures, comparing PR versus usual care for patients with PTBLD. A total of 114 participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive either usual care (on the waiting list) or PR, with follow-up assessments at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postintervention. The primary outcome is change in walking distance measured by the Incremental Shuttle Walk Test from baseline to the end of 6 weeks of PR. All secondary outcomes will be compared between the PR and usual care arms from baseline to 6-week and 12-week follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include self-reported respiratory symptoms, physical activity, psychological well-being, health-related quality of life and cost–benefit analysis. All randomised participants will be included in the intention-to-treat analysis population. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on both per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat populations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial has received ethical clearance from the Mulago Hospital Research and Ethics Committee (MHREC 1478), Kampala, Uganda as well as the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (SS 5105). Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of Leicester, UK research ethics committee (Ref No. 22349).

690570,Antisense Oligonucleotides and RNA Interference,2011-08-12,"Wild mammalian species, including bats, constitute the natural reservoir of Betacoronavirus (including SARS, MERS, and the deadly SARS-CoV-2). Different hosts or host tissues provide different cellular environments, especially different antiviral and RNA modification activities that can alter RNA modification signatures observed in the viral RNA genome. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds specifically to CpG dinucleotides and recruits other proteins to degrade a variety of viral RNA genomes. Many mammalian RNA viruses have evolved CpG deficiency. Increasing CpG dinucleotides in these low-CpG viral genomes in the presence of ZAP consistently leads to decreased viral replication and virulence. Because ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expression, viruses infecting different tissues are expected to have different CpG signatures, suggesting a means to identify viral tissue-switching events. I show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency in all known Betacoronavirus genomes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression. A survey of CpG deficiency in viral genomes identified a virulent canine coronavirus (Alphacoronavirus) as possessing the most extreme CpG deficiency, comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that the canine tissue infected by the canine coronavirus may provide a cellular environment strongly selecting against CpG. Thus, viral surveys focused on decreasing CpG in viral RNA genomes may provide important clues about the selective environments and viral defenses in the original hosts.","Xia, Xuhua",Mol Biol Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289821/,19
