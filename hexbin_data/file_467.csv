5172,"Integrating food security into public health and provincial government departments in British Columbia, Canada",2013-01-21,"A mutation shown to cause resistance to chloramphenicol inSaccharomyces cerevisiae was mapped to the central loop in domain V of the yeast mitochondrial 21S rRNA. The mutant 21S rRNA has a base pair exchange from U(2677) (corresponding to U(2504) inEscherichia coli) to C(2677), which significantly reduces rightward frameshifting at a UU UUU UCC A site in a + 1 U mutant. There is evidence to suggest that this reduction also applies to leftward frameshifting at the same site in a − 1 U mutant. The mutation did not increase the rate of misreading of a number of mitochondrial missense, nonsense or frameshift (of both signs) mutations, and did not adversely affect the synthesis of wild-type mitochondrial gene products. It is suggested here that ribosomes bearing either the C(2677) mutation or its wild-type allele may behave identically during normal decoding and only differ at sites where a ribosomal stall, by permitting non-standard decoding, differentially affects the normal interaction of tRNAs with the chloramphenicol resistant domain V. Chloramphenicol-resistant mutations mapping at two other sites in domain V are described. These mutations had no effect on frameshifting.","Weiss-Brummer, Brigitte; Zollner, Alfred; Haid, Albert; Thomnson, Shahla",Mol Gen Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087996/,467
18826,A systematic review of reporting quality for anaesthetic interventions in randomised controlled trials,2020-11-05,"OBJECTIVE: Skin damage from visible light predominantly results from exposure to the blue light spectrum (400‐500 nm) which generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) causing a cascade of harmful effects to skin. Topical antioxidants reduce the effects of free radical damage caused by environmental exposures. This study evaluated a comprehensive topical antioxidant's ability to inhibit ROS production induced by blue light and cigarette smoke (CS) in human skin. METHODS: Two experiments were conducted utilizing human skin (Fitzpatrick Skin Types III and V; N = 3, each). After confirmed reactivity of untreated tissues at 412 nm, 20J/cm(2), untreated and pretreated (WEL‐DS, 2 mg/cm(2)) skin tissue was exposed to blue light and blue light plus CS and left overnight. A nonfluorescent probe (DCFH‐DA) was added to skin and exposed to blue light (412 nm, 20J/cm(2)) and blue light plus CS. Fluorescent 2’,7’‐DCF was generated upon enzymatic reduction and subsequent oxidation by ROS. RESULTS: ROS increased at least tenfold following initial exposure to blue light and blue light plus CS in untreated skin. Pretreatment with WEL‐DS decreased ROS in FST III exposed to blue light by 51% and 46% in skin exposed to blue light plus CS vs. untreated skin (both, P < .001). In FST V, pretreatment with WEL‐DS decreased ROS exposed to blue light by 54% (P < .001) and 50% in skin exposed to blue light plus CS vs. untreated skin (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: WEL‐DS demonstrated significant reduction in ROS induced by blue light and blue light in combination with CS compared with untreated, exposed skin.","Wortzman, Mitchell; Nelson, Diane B.",J Cosmet Dermatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8248093/,467

67491,Orofacial Motor Functions and Temporomandibular Disorders in Patients with Sjögren's Syndrome.,2019,"In this work, we reported the discovery of compound 6i with potent antiproliferative activity against MGC-803. Among these compounds, the most potent compound 6i could effectively inhibit MGC-803 (IC50 = 0.96 μM), being around 38-fold selectivity over GES-1. Further underlying mechanism studies indicated that 6i inhibited the colony formation, migration of MGC-803, and exerted anti-proliferative effect by inducing G0/G1 phase arrest in MGC-803 cells. Cell apoptosis was induced by 6i through activating mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway and the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway. 6i induced cell apoptosis by elevating the level of ROS. Also, 6i up-regulated pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 level, while down-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Furthermore, acute toxicity experiment indicated 6i exhibited good safety in vivo. Therefore, 6i may be a template for future development of [1,2,4]triazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidine-based anti-cancer agents.","Huo, Jin-Ling; Wang, Shuai; Yuan, Xiao-Han; Yu, Bin; Zhao, Wen; Liu, Hong-Min",European journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385852/,467
71217,Sudden cardiac death in persons aged 50 years or younger: diagnostic yield of a regional molecular autopsy program using massive sequencing.,2020-09-08,"BACKGROUND Letters are regularly sent by healthcare organisations to healthcare professionals to encourage them to take action, change practice or implement guidance. However, whether letters are an effective tool in delivering a change in healthcare professional behaviour is currently uncertain. In addition, there are currently no evidence-based guidelines to support health providers and authorities with advice on how to formulate the communication, what information and behaviour change techniques to include in order to optimise the potential effect on the behaviour of the receivers. To address this research gap, we seek to inform such guidance through this systematic review, which aims to provide comprehensive evidence of the effectiveness of personal letters to healthcare professionals in changing their professional behaviours. METHODS/DESIGN A comprehensive literature search of published and unpublished studies (the grey literature) in electronic databases will be conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that meet our inclusion criteria. We will include RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of personal letters to healthcare professionals in changing professional behaviours. The primary outcome will be behavioural change. The search will be conducted in five electronic databases (from their inception onwards): MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library and CINAHL. We will also conduct supplementary searches in Google Scholar, hand search relevant journals, and conduct backward and forward citation searching for included studies and relevant reviews. A systematic approach to searching, screening, reviewing and data extraction will be applied in accordance with the process recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. Two researchers will examine titles, abstracts, full-texts for eligibility independently. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomised controlled trials. Disagreements will be resolved by a consensus procedure. DISCUSSION Health policy makers across government are expected to benefit from being able to increase compliance in clinical settings by applying theories of behaviour to design of policy communications. The synthesised findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication.

72271,"Time interval between onset of symptoms and COVID-19 testing in Brazilian state capitals, August 2020.",2020,"BACKGROUND The main modalities for voice restoration after laryngectomy are the electrolarynx and the tracheoesophageal puncture. Both have limitations and new technologies may offer innovative alternatives via silent speech. OBJECTIVE To describe a novel and personalized method of voice restoration using machine learning applied to electromyographic signal from articulatory muscles for the recognition of silent speech in a patient with total laryngectomy. METHODS Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals of articulatory muscles were recorded from the face and neck of a patient with total laryngectomy who was articulating words silently. These sEMG signals were then used for automatic speech recognition via machine learning. Sensor placement was tailored to the patient's unique anatomy, following radiation and surgery. A personalized wearable mask covering the sensors was designed using 3D scanning and 3D printing. RESULTS Using seven sEMG sensors on the patient's face and neck and two grounding electrodes, we recorded EMG data while he was mouthing ""Tedd"" and ""Ed."" With data from 75 utterances for each of these words, we discriminated the sEMG signal with 86.4% accuracy using an XGBoost machine-learning model. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of sEMG-based alaryngeal speech recognition, using tailored sensor placement and a personalized wearable device. Further refinement of this approach could allow translation of silently articulated speech into a synthesized voiced speech via portable devices.","Rameau, Anaïs",Head & neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31876090/,467
73583,Adherence to physical contact restriction measures and the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil.,2020,"PURPOSE Surgical intervention with intercorporal stabilisation in spinal infections is increasingly needed. Our aim was to compare titanium and polyetheretherketon (PEEK) cages according to their adhesion characteristics of different bacteria species in vitro. METHODS Plates made from PEEK, polished titanium (Ti), two-surface-titanium (TiMe) (n = 2-3) and original PEEK and porous trabecular structured titanium (TiLi) interbody cages (n = 4) were inoculated in different bacterial solutions, S.aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S.epidermidis and E.coli. Growth characteristics were analysed. Biofilms and bacteria were visualised using confocal- and electron microscopy. RESULTS Quantitative adherence of MSSA, MRSA, S.epidermidis and E.coli to Ti, TiMe and PEEK plates were different, with polished titanium being mainly advantageous over PEEK and TiMe with significantly less counts of colony forming units (CFU) for MRSA after 56 h compared to TiMe and at 72 h compared to PEEK (p = 0.04 and p = 0.005). For MSSA, more adherent bacteria were detected on PEEK than on TiMe at 32 h (p = 0.02). For PEEK and TiLi cages, significant differences were found after 8 and 72 h for S.epidermidis (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008) and after 72 h for MSSA (p = 0.002) with higher bacterial counts on PEEK, whereas E.coli showed more CFU on TiLi than PEEK (p = 0.05). Electron microscopy demonstrated enhanced adhesion in transition areas. CONCLUSION For S.epidermidis, MSSA and MRSA PEEK cages showed a higher adherence in terms of CFU count, whereas for E.coli PEEK seemed to be advantageous. Electron microscopic visualisation shows that bacteria did not adhere at the titanium mesh structure, but at the border zones of polished material to rougher parts.","Krätzig, Theresa; Mende, Klaus Christian; Mohme, Malte; von Kroge, Simon; Stangenberg, Martin; Dreimann, Marc; Westphal, Manfred; Weisselberg, Samira; Eicker, Sven Oliver","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-020-06705-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423133/,467

METHODS The authors report a 7-year-old patient with decreased vision in his left eye after embolization of a pineal arteriovenous malformation secondary to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Ophthalmic evaluation, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, electroretinogram, examination under anesthesia, and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) were performed. RESULTS Fundus examination of the left eye revealed extensive posterior segment ischemia, vascular tortuosity, and vitreous hemorrhage. Fluorescein angiography was remarkable for partial obstruction of retinal arteries, midperipheral nonperfusion, and associated leakage from multiple areas of neovascularization. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography was normal. Electroretinogram demonstrated decreased b-wave amplitude. The patient was subsequently treated with 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, panretinal endophotocoagulation, and intravitreal bevacizumab. Five weeks after surgery, best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/40, and examination showed resolution of vitreous hemorrhage and neovascularization. CONCLUSION Retinal vascular abnormalities, posterior segment ischemia, and vitreous hemorrhage suggested a combination of retinal involvement of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia complicated by nontarget embolization.","Diaz, Rocio I; Randolph, John C; Sigler, Eric J; Calzada, Jorge I",Retinal cases & brief reports,https://doi.org/10.1097/icb.0000000000000047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372443/,467

81850,[COVID-19 outbreak in a peruvian shelter].,2020-12-02,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly throughout the world. Latin American and the Caribbean countries have been harshly affected by the pandemic mainly due to less prepared healthcare systems and fragmented social safety nets. In the region, health status population-based indicators are worse than compared to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Recent evidence suggests that the progression and severity of COVID-19 are associated with the prior health status of individuals, and studies have shown that the case fatality rate is highly stratified among different populations. This narrative review aims to describe factors associated with adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in the context of social determinants of health in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In this review, we state that genetic and biological factors interact in a sophisticated way with social determinants of health, impacting the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. Behavioral factors, such as physical inactivity, smoking, and unhealthy diets, are related to chronic systemic inflammation. Also, air pollution can prolong inflammation and the hyper-activation of the immune system. Air pollutants could facilitate the spread of the virus. Finally, frailty and comorbidities can be associated with COVID-19 severity through increasing vulnerability to stressors and leading to more severe symptoms of COVID-19 disease, including a higher mortality risk. All these factors contribute to increasing the impact of COVID-19 in Latin American and Caribbean countries. We highlight the relevance of considering social determinants of health in Latin American and the Caribbean countries, not only in controlling the likelihood of getting the disease but also its progression and severity. All these social determinants can guide the design and implementation of tailored interventions promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors, which should lower the spread of the disease, its severity, and lethality.","Balboa-Castillo, Teresa; Andrade-Mayorga, Omar; Marzuca-Nassr, Gabriel Nasri; Morales Illanes, Gladys; Ortiz, Manuel; Schiferlli, Ingrid; Aguilar-Farias, Nicolas; Soto, Álvaro; Sapunar, Jorge",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2021.04.8180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037583/,467

METHODS We will conduct a scoping review to synthesize the evidence on how matters of sex and gender have been handled in human allotransplantation research. We will survey the literature discussing sex and gender in relation to transplantation, including adult and pediatric patients, hematopoietic and solid organ transplant recipients as well as organ donors.

Two reviewers will independently evaluate the eligibility of all identified titles and abstracts for inclusion in the full text review, as well as data extraction. Descriptive data and information on how sex and gender have been considered in human transplantation research will be reported. DISCUSSION This scoping review will be an important stepping stone towards the development of good practice guidelines on study design and analysis considerations when handling sex and gender issues in human transplantation research. This scoping review can also help identify methodological issues that restrict the translation of transplantation research findings into clinical practice related to underestimation of sex/gender differences. This review will ultimately identify major gaps, inform donor-recipient selection, guide personalized interventions, and prioritize research recommendations in human transplantation research.","Laprise, Claudie; Sridhar, Vikas Srinivasan; West, Lori; Foster, Bethany; Pilote, Louise; Sapir-Pichhadze, Ruth",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-017-0578-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886721/,467
89579,A glance upon Epigenetic and COVID-19.,2020,"BACKGROUND Resection of a residual retroperitoneal tumor mass (RRRTM) is standard procedure after combination chemotherapy for metastatic nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (NSTGCT). METHODS At the University Medical Center Groningen, 79 consecutive patients with disseminated NSTGCT were treated with cisplatin combination chemotherapy between 2005 and 2007. Laparoscopic RRRTM was performed for patients with RRTM located less than 5 cm ventrally or laterally from the aorta or the vena cava. The 29 patients who fulfilled the criteria had a median age of 25 years (range, 16-59 years). The stages of disease before chemotherapy treatment according to the Royal Marsden classification were 2A (n = 6, 21%), 2B (n = 14, 48%), 2C (n = 3, 10%), and 4 with a lymph node status of N2 (n = 6, 21%). RESULTS The median duration of laparoscopy was 198 min (range, 122-325 min). The median diameter of the RRTM was 21 mm (range, 11-47 mm). Laparoscopic resection was successful for 25 patients (86%). Conversion was necessary for three patients (10%): two due to bleeding and one because of obesity. One nonplanned hand-assisted procedure (3%) also had to be performed. Histologic examination of the specimens showed fibrosis or necrosis in 12 patients (41%), mature teratoma in 16 patients (55%), and viable tumor in 1 patient (3%). The median hospital stay was 1 day (range, 1-6 days). During a median follow-up period of 47 months (29-70 months), one patient experienced an early relapse (1 month after the end of treatment) (4%). CONCLUSION For properly selected patients, laparoscopic resection of RRTM is an improvement in the combined treatment of disseminated NSTGCT and associated with a short hospital stay, minimal morbidity, rapid recovery, and a neat cosmetic result. Long-term data to prove oncologic efficacy are awaited.","Oztürk, Ciğdem; van Ginkel, Robert J; Krol, Ruby M; Gietema, Jourik A; Hofker, Hendrik S; Hoekstra, Harald J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1901-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21938584/,467
90862,Description of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in a national referral hospital in Peru.,2020,"Background: Hospital wastewater is an increasingly recognized reservoir for resistant Gramnegative organisms. Factors involved in establishment and persistence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms (KPCO) in hospital wastewater plumbing are unclear.Methods: This study was conducted at a hospital with endemic KPCO linked to wastewater reservoirs and robust patient perirectal screening for silent KPCO carriage. Over five months, both rooms occupied and not occupied by KPCO-positive patients were sampled at three wastewater sites within each room (sink drain, sink P-trap, and toilet or hopper). Risk factors for KPCO positivity were assessed using logistic regression. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified environmental seeding by KPCO-positive patients.Findings: 219/475(46%) room sampling events were KPCO-positive in at least one wastewater site. KPCO-positive patient exposure was associated with increased risk of environmental positivity for the room and toilet/hopper. Previous positivity and intensive care unit room type were consistently associated with increased risk. Tube feeds were associated with increased risk for the drain, while exposure to patients with Clostridioides difficile was associated with decreased risk. Urinary catheter exposure was associated with increased risk of P-trap positivity. P-trap heaters reduced risk of P-trap and sink drain positivity. WGS identified genomically linked environmental seeding in six of 99 room occupations by 40 KPCO-positive patients.Interpretation: KPCO-positive patients seed the environment in at least 6% of opportunities; once positive for KPCO, wastewater sites are at greater risk of being positive subsequently. Increased nutrient exposure, e.g. due to tube food disposal down sinks, may increase risk; frequent flushing may be protective.IMPORTANCE: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms (KPCOs) are bacteria that are resistant to most antibiotics and thus are challenging to treat when they cause infections in patients. These organisms can be acquired by patients who are hospitalized for other reasons, complicating their hospital stay and even leading to death. Hospital wastewater sites, such as sink drains and toilets, have played a role in many reported outbreaks over the past decade. The significance of our research is in identifying risk factors for environmental positivity for KPCOs, which will facilitate further work to prevent transmission of these organisms to patients from the hospital environment.","Park, Stacy C; Parikh, Hardik; Vegesana, Kasi; Stoesser, Nicole; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Dudley, Sarah; Peto, Timothy E A; Crook, Derrick W; Walker, A Sarah; Mathers, Amy J",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01715-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917755/,467

104785,Molecular farming of antimicrobial peptides: available platforms and strategies for improving protein biosynthesis using modified virus vectors.,2019,"A number of different viral families have developed convergent methods to infect cells. Class I fusion proteins are commonly used by members of Arenaviridae, Coronaviridae, Filovirdae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Retroviridae. Class I viral fusion proteins are trimers that are involved in recognizing the cellular receptor, with a region that is responsible for fusing the viral and target cell membranes. During the fusion process, the fusion region folds into a six-helix bundle (6HB) which approximates the two membranes leading to fusion. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the gp41 subunit is responsible for the formation of this 6HB. The fusion inhibitor drug enfuvirtide, or T20, is the only US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved drug which targets this crucial step and has been widely used in combination regimens for the treatment of HIV since March 2003.

The aim was to measure the severity and frequency of nine dumping symptoms and to evaluate the construct validity of the DSRS. Pre- and 1 and 2 years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, 47 adults and 82 adolescents completed the DSRS. Cognitive interview was performed. Reliability and construct validity were tested. Effect sizes (ES) of changes were calculated. Patients found the questionnaire relevant. A high proportion of the respondents reported no symptoms affecting them negatively at all (floor effects). However, 12 % stated, quite severe, severe, or very severe problems regarding fatigue after meal and half of them were so tired that they needed to lie down. Nearly 7 % reported quite severe, severe, or very severe problems dominated by nausea and 6 % dominated by fainting esteem. The internal consistency reliability was adequate for both severity (0.81-0.86) and frequency (0.76-0.84) scales. ES were small, since some subjects experienced symptoms already preoperatively. Although most patients reported no or mild dumping symptoms 1 and 2 years after gastric bypass surgery, around 12 % had persistent symptoms, in particular, postprandial fatigue, and needed to lie down. Another 7 % had problems with nausea and 6 % had problems with fainting esteem.

112193,"Description of COVID-19 hospitalized health worker cases in the first nine weeks of the pandemic, Brazil, 2020.",2020,"Although ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is classically considered a puerperal pathology, it can also occur in nonpuerperal settings such as endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, Crohn's disease, pelvic or gynaecological surgeries and thrombophilia. Hypercoagulation conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, factor V Leiden and protein C and S deficiency are all recognised risk factors. It is also a known complication during pregnancy often presenting with fever and lower abdominal pain within weeks after delivery. Its incidence is exceedingly rare, occurring in 0.05% of all pregnancies that result in live births and peaking around 2-6 days after delivery. Its preferential involvement of the right ovarian vein may be explained by the compression of the inferior vena cava and the right ovarian vein due to dextrorotation of the uterus during pregnancy. Furthermore, antegrade flow of blood and multiple incompetent valves in the right ovarian vein favours bacterial infection. Complications may include sepsis and thrombus extension to the inferior vena cava or left renal vein and rarely, pulmonary embolism. The authors present the case of a 27-year-old woman with lower abdominal pain 5 weeks after an elective caesarean section. Although the diagnosis of postpartum endometritis was initially considered, a CT suggested a right OVT. She commenced treatment with low-molecular weight heparin. A high index of clinical suspicion is required in order to establish the diagnosis of this rare cause of abdominal pain, which can mimic an acute abdomen.","Dunphy, Louise; Tang, Aie Wei",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2021-243872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172481/,467

METHODS CNN, widely applied in medical image classification, was used for bone scintigraphy image classification. The retrospective study included 778 sequential male patients who underwent whole-body bone scans. A nuclear medicine physician classified all the cases into 3 categories: (1) normal, (2) malignant, and (3) degenerative, which were used as the gold standard. RESULTS An efficient CNN architecture was built, based on CNN exploration performance, achieving high prediction accuracy. The results showed that the method is sufficiently precise when it comes to differentiating a bone metastasis from other either degenerative changes or normal tissue (overall classification accuracy = 91.42% ± 1.64%). To strengthen the outcomes of this study the authors further compared the best performing CNN method to other popular CNN architectures for medical imaging, like ResNet50, VGG16 and GoogleNet, as reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS The prediction results reveal the efficacy of the proposed CNN-based approach and its ability for an easier and more precise interpretation of whole-body images in bone metastasis diagnosis for prostate cancer patients in nuclear medicine. This leads to marked effects on the diagnostic accuracy and decision-making regarding the treatment to be applied.","Papandrianos, Nikolaos; Papageorgiou, Elpiniki I; Anagnostis, Athanasios",Annals of nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12149-020-01510-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839920/,467
114560,Nebivolol in preventing atrial fibrillation following coronary surgery in patients over 60 years of age.,2014,"PURPOSE The primary aim was to determine if dispensing of cyclophosphamide tablets resulted in accumulated residue on pharmacy counting tools during a simulated outpatient dispensing process. Secondary objectives included determining if cyclophosphamide contamination exceeded a defined threshold level of 1 ng/cm2 and if a larger number of prescriptions dispensed resulted in increased contamination. METHODS Mock prescriptions of 40 cyclophosphamide 50 mg tablets were counted on clean trays in three scenarios using a simulated outpatient pharmacy after assaying five cleaned trays as controls. The three scenarios consisted of five simulated dispensings of one, three, or six prescriptions dispensed per scenario. Wipe samples of trays and spatulas were collected and assayed for all trays, including the five clean trays used as controls. Contamination was defined as an assayed cyclophosphamide level at or above 0.001 ng/cm2 and levels above 1 ng/cm2 were considered sufficient to cause risk of human uptake. Mean contamination for each scenario was calculated and compared using one-way analysis of variance. P-values of < 0.05 implied significance. RESULTS Mean cyclophosphamide contamination on trays used to count one, three, and six cyclophosphamide prescriptions was 0.51 ± 0.10 (p=0.0003), 1.02 ± 0.10 (p < 0.0001), and 1.82 ± 0.10 ng/cm2 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Control trays did not show detectable cyclophosphamide contamination. Increasing the number of prescriptions dispensed from 1 to 3, 1 to 6, and 3 to 6 counts increased contamination by 0.51 ± 0.15 (p = 0.0140), 1.31 + 0.15 (p < 0.0001), and 0.80 ± 0.15 ng/cm2 (p = 0.0004), respectively. CONCLUSION Dispensing one or more prescriptions of 40 cyclophosphamide 50 mg tablets contaminates pharmacy counting tools, and an increased number of prescriptions dispensed correlates with increased level of contamination. Counting out three or more prescriptions leads to trays having contamination that surpasses the threshold at which worker exposure may be increased. Pharmacies should consider devoting a separate tray to cyclophosphamide tablets, as cross-contamination could occur with other drugs and the efficacy of decontamination methods is unclear. Employee exposure could be minimized with the use of personal protective equipment, environmental controls, and cleaning trays between uses. Future investigation should assess the extent of drug powder dispersion, the effects of various cleaning methods, and the potential extent of contamination with different oral cytotoxic drugs.","Chaffee, Bruce W; Lander, Michael J; Christen, Catherine; Redic, Kimberly A",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155218764587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29592766/,467

120676,[Concepts for good decision-making in the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile].,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is the most common reason for antibiotic prescription in adults. Antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed for patients with ARTI. This article presents best practices for antibiotic use in healthy adults (those without chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions) presenting with ARTI. METHODS A narrative literature review of evidence about appropriate antibiotic use for ARTI in adults was conducted. The most recent clinical guidelines from professional societies were complemented by meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized clinical trials. To identify evidence-based articles, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched through September 2015 using the following Medical Subject Headings terms: ""acute bronchitis,"" ""respiratory tract infection,"" ""pharyngitis,"" ""rhinosinusitis,"" and ""the common cold."" HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 1 Clinicians should not perform testing or initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with bronchitis unless pneumonia is suspected. HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 2 Clinicians should test patients with symptoms suggestive of group A streptococcal pharyngitis (for example, persistent fevers, anterior cervical adenitis, and tonsillopharyngeal exudates or other appropriate combination of symptoms) by rapid antigen detection test and/or culture for group A Streptococcus. Clinicians should treat patients with antibiotics only if they have confirmed streptococcal pharyngitis. HIGH-VALUE CARE ADVICE 3 Clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis for patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, onset of severe symptoms or signs of high fever (>39 °C) and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or onset of worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days that was initially improving (double sickening).

OBJECTIVE Primary endpoint was to evaluate the success rate of RFA to restore euthyroidism in a cohort of adult patients with small solitary AFTN compared with medium-sized nodules. Secondary endpoints included nodule volume reduction and rate of conversion from hot nodules to cold using scintiscan. METHODS This was a 24-month prospective monocentric open parallel-group trial. Twenty-nine patients with AFTN were divided into two groups based on thyroid volume: 15 patients with small nodules (<12 mL) in group A and 14 patients with medium nodules (>12 mL) in group B. All patients underwent a single session of RFA and were clinically, biochemically, and morphologically evaluated at baseline and at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. RESULTS After RFA, there was greater nodule volume reduction in group A compared with group B (p < 0.001 for each follow-up point). In group A, there was a greater increase in TSH levels than in group B at 6 (p = 0.01), 12 (p = 0.005), and 24 months (p < 0.001). At 24 months, the rate of responders was greater in group A than in group B (86 vs. 45%; p < 0.001). In group A, 86% of nodules converted from hot to cold compared with 18% in group B (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A single session of RFA was effective in restoring euthyroidism in patients with small AFTNs. Nodule volume seems to be a significant predictive factor of the efficacy of RFA in treating AFTN.","Cesareo, R; Naciu, A M; Iozzino, M; Pasqualini, V; Simeoni, C; Casini, A; Campagna, G; Manfrini, S; Tabacco, G; Palermo, A","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2018.1430868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357717/,467

Prolonged manual ventilation may be required in resource-poor locations and in severe disasters such as hurricanes, pandemics, and chemical events. In such circumstances, trained operators may not be available and lay persons may need to be quickly trained to do the job. OBJECTIVES The current study investigated whether minimally trained operators were able to manually ventilate a simulated endotracheally intubated patient for six hours. METHODS Two groups of 10 volunteers, previously unfamiliar with manual ventilation, received brief, structured BVD-tube ventilation training and performed six hours of manual ventilation on an electronic lung simulator. Operator cardiorespiratory variables and perceived effort, as well as the quality of the delivered ventilation, were recorded. Group One ventilated a ""normal lung"" (compliance 50cmH2O/L, resistance 5cmH2O/L/min). Group Two ventilated a ""moderately injured lung"" (compliance 20cmH2O/L, resistance 20cmH2O/L/min). RESULTS Volunteers' blood pressure, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) were stable throughout the study. Perceived effort was minimal. The two groups provided clinically adequate and similar RRs (13.3 [SD = 3.0] and 14.1 [SD = 2.5] breaths/minute, respectively) and minute volume (MV; 7.6 [SD = 2.1] and 7.7 [SD = 1.4] L/minute, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that minimally trained persons can effectively perform six hours of manual BVD-tube ventilation of normal and moderately injured lungs, without undue effort. Quality of delivered ventilation was clinically adequate.","Maklada, Nana; Katz Shalhav, Malka; Lagazzi, Emanuele; Halpern, Pinchas",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x20000679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475378/,467

METHODS AND RESULTS Electronic databases were searched to identify published studies that reported clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 who were or were not taking an ACEI/ARB. We studied all-cause mortality and/or severe disease outcomes. Fully adjusted effect estimates from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. In total, 34 (31 cohort-based and three case-control) studies met our eligibility criteria. Due to the inherent differences between cohort and case-control studies, we did not combine results of these studies but used them to identify the consistency of their results. The 31 cohort studies provided outcome data for 87 951 patients with COVID-19, of whom 22 383/83 963 (26.7%) were on ACEI/ARB therapy. In pooled analysis, we found no association between the use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality/severe disease [relative risk: 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86-1.03, I2 = 57%, P = 0.20] or occurrence of severe disease (relative risk: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.74-1.17, I2 = 56%, P = 0.55). Analysis of three population-based case-control studies identified no significant association between ACEI/ARB (pooled odds ratio: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.81-1.23, I2 = 0, P = 0.98) and all-cause mortality/severe disease. In 13 of the 31 cohort studies as well as in three case-control studies that reported outcomes separately for ACEI and ARB, there was no differential effect for mortality/severe disease outcomes. CONCLUSION In patients with COVID-19, we found no association between ACEI/ARB treatment and mortality/severe disease.

150464,[Causes of admission to the Cayetano Heredia Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic].,2020-12-02,OBJECTIVES The goal of this report is to describe a percutaneous approach to rerouting hepatic venous return in patients who developed progressive cyanosis due to unilateral pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) after the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) operation. BACKGROUND Unilateral PAVM can develop in patients after TCPC operation when there is unequal distribution of hepatic venous return between the two lungs. This often results in progressive cyanosis and the need for surgical re-intervention. A percutaneous based approach for rerouting hepatic venous return has never been described. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data on four patients who underwent percutaneous rerouting procedures. One patient with a misaligned TCPC underwent realignment of the circuit with a bare metal stent. In three patients a combination of bare metal and covered stents were needed to achieve the desired results. RESULTS The rerouting procedures were successful in all patients with significant improvement in oxygen saturation from a median of 75% (range 55-80%) to a median of 90% (range 84-92%) (P = 0.02). There were no recorded short term or intermediate term complications with maximum follow-up time of 43 months. CONCLUSIONS Percutaneous rerouting of hepatic venous flow is feasible and should be considered when a surgical approach is not possible; this strategy may serve as a viable alternative to complex operative approaches in select cases.

Methods: The clinical and angiographic data of 31 acutely ruptured wide-necked ACoA aneurysms treated with LVIS stent-assisted coiling between January 2014 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: All stents were successfully deployed. The immediate angiographic results were modified Raymond-Roy class I in 27 cases, modified Raymond-Roy class II in 2 cases, and modified Raymond-Roy class IIIa in 2 cases. Intraoperative thrombosis and postoperative aneurysmal rebleeding occurred in one case each. Two patients (6.5%) who were admitted due to poor clinical grade conditions died during hospital admission as a result of initial bleeding. Angiographic follow-up (mean: 12.9 months) was performed for 26 patients, the results of which demonstrated that 25 aneurysms were completely occluded and one was class II. The last clinical follow-up (mean: 25.3 months) outcomes demonstrated that 27 patients had favorable clinical outcomes and two had poor clinical outcomes. Conclusion: LVIS stent-assisted coiling for ruptured wide-necked ACoA aneurysms was safe and effective, with a relatively low rate of perioperative complications and a high rate of complete occlusion at follow-up.","Xue, Gaici; Liu, Peng; Xu, Fengfeng; Fang, Yibin; Li, Qiang; Hong, Bo; Xu, Yi; Liu, Jianmin; Huang, Qinghai",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.611875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584512/,467

161663,The challenge of including people with disabilities in the strategy to address the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.,2020-11-27,"Context For some countries, favourable climatic conditions for tourism are often associated with favourable conditions for infectious diseases, with the ensuing development constraints on the tourist sectors of impoverished countries where tourism's economic contribution has a high potential. This paper evaluates the economic implications of eradication of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola on the affected destination countries focusing on the tourist expenditures. Methods A gravity model for international tourism flows is used to provide an estimation of the impact of each travel-related disease on international tourist arrivals. Next the potential eradication of these diseases in the affected countries is simulated and the impact on tourism expenditures is estimated. Findings The results show that, in the case of Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Ebola, the eradication of these diseases in the affected countries would result in an increase of around 10 million of tourist worldwide and a rise in the tourism expenditure of 12 billion dollars. Conclusion By analysing the economic benefits of the eradication of Dengue, Ebola, Malaria, and Yellow Fever for the tourist sector-a strategic economic sector for many of the countries where these TRD are present-this paper explores a new aspect of the quantification of health policies which should be taken into consideration in future international health assessment programmes. It is important to note that the analysis is only made of the direct impact of the diseases' eradication and consequently the potential multiplicative effects of a growth in the GDP, in terms of tourism attractiveness, are not evaluated.

Gynecologic oncology patients at all stages of disease and treatment (primary, recurrence, surveillance) were asked to complete an anonymous survey during in-person outpatient appointments at an academic comprehensive cancer center. Surveys were entered into RedCAP;SPSS was used for statistical analysis. This survey was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, before the introduction of telemedicine in this practice. Of 180 patients approached, 170 completed the survey. Mean age was 59.6 years;73.4% identified as White, 23.7% as Black, and 2.9% as other race. The majority of patients had ovarian cancer (41.2%), followed by endometrial (27.1%), cervical (20.6%), vaginal/vulvar (7.1%), and other (1.2%.) The majority of patients traveled greater than 50 miles for appointments (63.8%);these patients were more likely to be from rural counties and incurred a significantly higher cost for travel per visit ($60.77 vs $37.98, p=0.026.) The majority of patients expressed interest in using telemedicine appointments (75.7%) or a smartphone app (87.5%) as a component of their cancer care. Patients with difficulty attending appointments (88.9 vs 70.2%, p=0.02), or those from rural areas (88.7% vs 69.6%, p=0.03), were especially interested in telemedicine;those with both characteristics reported 100% interest in telemedicine. The majority of patients in both urban and rural counties had the ability to access the internet and telemedicine services from home, via smart phone or computer. Patients from rural and urban counties used the internet at similarly high rates (at least daily use, 79% vs 75%.) Telemedicine is acceptable and attractive to the majority of patients even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may offer financial and logistical advantages for patients who live far from gynecologic oncology care. Overall, patients have high rates of internet use and express comfort with using technology for their healthcare. Disparities in cancer outcomes for rural patients, including survival and clinical trials enrollment, have been associated with increased distance to providers and difficulty accessing care. In our study, these patients were universally interested in telemedicine. Telemedicine should be incorporated into standard practice beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic to reduce healthcare disparities related to care access.

174765,Feedback on the COVID-19 crisis in a pediatric hospital in Île-de-France,2020,"Purpose Travel interests of tourists during pandemics and outbreaks are reduced due to the prevalence of fear. It induces lifestyle changes, which may hinder efforts to recover the tourism value chain during post-COVID-19 lockdowns. Subscribing to domestic travel and domestic tourism is deemed to mitigate fear and gradually reopen the tourism industry. Although a crucial initiative, evaluating the perceived degree of exposure of tourists to COVID-19 in tourist sites operating under domestic tourism has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, which forms the main departure of this work. Design/methodology/approach The problem domain is addressed by adopting multiple criteria sorting method - the VIKORSORT. To demonstrate such application, with 221 survey participants, 35 tourist sites in a province in the central Philippines struggling to revive the tourism industry are evaluated under six attributes that characterize tourists' exposure to COVID-19. To assess its efficacy, the performance of the VIKORSORT is compared to other distance-based multiple criteria sorting methods (i.e. TOPSIS-Sort and CODAS-SORT). Findings Results show that proximity and volume of tourist arrivals are considered on top of the priority list of attributes. The use of VIKORSORT yields the assignment of 27 sites to the ""moderate exposure"" class, and eight under the ""high exposure"" class, with no tourist site assigned to the ""low exposure"" class. Sorting the tourist sites reveals some observations that tourists prefer sites (1) with open spaces, (2) with activities having limited group dynamics, (3) that are nature-based, and (4) with tourist arrivals that are not relatively high, with enough land area to practice social distancing. In addition, the assignments of the VIKORSORT with TOPSIS-Sort and CODAS-SORT are consistent at least 90% of the time, demonstrating its efficacy in addressing multiple criteria sorting problems. Originality/value This work provides an integrative approach in evaluating tourist sites in view of tourism recovery during pandemics. The findings offer crucial insights for the primary stakeholders (i.e. government, tourist operators, and tourists) in planning, resource allocation decisions, and policy formulation. Policy insights are offered, as well as avenues for future works.","Ocampo, L.; Yamagishi, K.",Kybernetes,https://doi.org/10.1108/k-02-2021-0153,467
176105,Individual Differences in Decisions on Physical Distancing during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"A total of 6,628 PUBMED-registered publications on the relationships between the effects of vaccination and the provision of micronutrients have been studied by methods of topological analysis of text data. In case of insufficient intake of certain micronutrients, the functioning of the acquired immunity is disrupted resulting in an imbalance of populations of T-cells CD4+/CD8+ and of B-lymphocytes. Nutritional supplements of folate, vitamins A, D and B12, which are recognized regulators of cell division, support a wide range of lymphocyte populations. Trace elements zinc, iron, selenium, manganese and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also important for supporting the mechanisms of acquired immunity. The data presented show that a course intake of these micronutrients by patients planning vaccination can significantly improve its effectiveness. In particular, these micronutrients can increase the titers of antibodies to pathogens, and to reduce the percentage of patients who still contract infection after vaccination. Supplements of these micronutrients can also contribute to the safety of vaccination: to prevent malaise and, in the unfortunate case of contracting infection despite the vaccine, to reduce the severity of the course and the mortality from the corresponding infection.","Torshin, I.

Consideration of partially recovered carriers is hypothesized to play a leading role in the persistence of the disease and its introduction to new areas. A model for transmission of COVID-19 by symptomless partially recovered carriers is proposed and analysed. It is shown that key parameters can be identified such that below a threshold level, built on these parameters, the epidemic tends towards extinction, while above another threshold, it tends towards a nontrivial epidemic state. Moreover, optimal control analysis of the model, using Pontryagin's maximum principle, is performed. The optimal controls are characterized in terms of the optimality system and solved numerically for several scenarios. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number, R c , indicate that the disease is mainly driven by parameters involving the partially recovered carriers rather than symptomatic ones. Moreover, optimal control analysis of the model, using Pontryagin's maximum principle, is performed. The optimal controls were characterized in terms of the optimality system and solved numerically for several scenarios. Numerical simulations were explored to illustrate our theoretical findings, scenarios were built, and the model predicted that social distancing and treatment of the symptomatic will slow down the epidemic curve and reduce mortality of COVID-19 given that there is an average adherence to social distancing and effective treatment are administered.

The main objective of the present study was to compare the Ab titers obtained with quantitative commercial binding Ab assays, after 1 dose (convalescent individuals) or 2 doses (naive individuals) of vaccine, in healthcare workers (HCW). Antibody titers were measured in 263 sera (from 150 HCW) with 5 quantitative immunoassays (Abbott RBD IgG II quant, bioMerieux RBD IgG, DiaSorin Trimeric spike IgG, Siemens Healthineers RBD IgG, Wantai RBD IgG). One qualitative total antibody anti RBD detection assay (Wantai) was used to detect previous infection before vaccination. The results are presented in binding Ab units (BAU)/mL after application, when possible, of a conversion factor provided by the manufacturers and established from a World Health Organization (WHO) internal standard. There was a 100% seroconversion with all assays evaluated after two doses of vaccine. With assays allowing BAU/ml correction, Ab titers were correlated ({rho}= 0.84-0.99). However, a significant difference between values persisted. The titer differences varied by a mean 3.04% between Siemens and bioMerieux assays to 50.54% between Siemens and DiaSorin assays. Titer harmonization is still to be improved despite better results were obtained between assays detecting the same Ab against the same antigen. The next step towards a true standardization of the assays would be to include the International Standard in the calibration of each assays to express the results in IU/mL.","Saker, K.; Escuret, V.; Pitiot, V.; Massardier-Pilonchery, A.; Paul, S.; Mokdad, B.; Langlois-Jacques, C.; Rabilloud, M.; Goncalves, D.; Fabien, N.; Guibert, N.; Fassier, J.-B.; Bal, A.; Trouillet-Assant, S.; Trabaud, M.-A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.24.21262475v1?rss=1,467

We retrospectively analyzed adult patients who received peripheral VA-ECMO support between 2015 and 2019 at our tertiary care hospital. Results: Sixty five patients with a mean age of 37.9 +/- 14.9 years, mostly males (70.8%), were supported with femoral VA-ECMO with a median duration of 8 (IQR: 3-40) days. Hospital mortality occurred in 29 (44.6%) patients. Complications included acute kidney injury (AKI) in 39 (60%), acute cerebral strokes in 13 (20%), gastrointestinal bleeding in 14 (21.5%) and acute limb ischemia in 21 (32.3%) patients. Non-survivors had significantly higher mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and significantly increased rates of acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy, ischemic cerebral strokes, cannulation site exploration for bleeding, atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation discontinuation. Multivariable regression analysis revealed significant Odds Ratios (OR), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) of hospital mortality with: increasing SOFA scores after 48 hours (2.15, 1.441-3.214, p < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (11.351, 1.354-83.222, p = 0.025) and hyperlactatemia (2.74, 1.448-6.719, p = 0.016). Conclusion: High mortality and frequent morbidities due to emergent peripheral VA-ECMO should be considered before initiation for cardiogenic shock. According to our results, increasing trend of SOFA scores, atrial fibrillation and progressive hyperlactatemia are independent predictors of hospital mortality of peripheral VAECMO.","Laimoud, M.; Alanazi, M.; Qureshi, R.",Signa Vitae,https://doi.org/10.22514/sv.2021.118,467

In this work, we investigate correlations between online social media and Internet search for the COVID-19 pandemic among 50 U.S. states. By collecting the state-level daily trends through both Twitter and Google Trends, we observe a high but state-different lag correlation with the number of daily confirmed cases. We further find that the accuracy measured by the correlation coefficient is positively correlated to a state’s demographic, air traffic volume and GDP development. Most importantly, we show that a state’s early infection rate is negatively correlated with the lag to the previous peak in Internet searches and tweeting about COVID-19, indicating that earlier collective awareness on Twitter/Google correlates with a lower infection rate. Lastly, we demonstrate that correlations between online social media and search trends are sensitive to time, mainly due to the attention shifting of the public.","Sun, Jiachen Gloor Peter A.",Future Internet,https://doi.org/10.3390/fi13070184,467

METHODS Air samples were collected from 7 wards and 1 balcony of the Hospital, 3 times a day for 3 continuous days, using bioaerosol sampler type FA-2. Bioaerosol particles were then washed down from the samples by serum-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) culture medium. Nested-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify the N protein gene of the SARS associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from these washing solutions. The residual solutions were inoculated into prepared cell cultures to isolate live virus. The positive samples were then identified by indirect immunofluorescence assay and sequence analysis of the PCR products. RESULTS Positive rates of RT-PCR test on air samples were 29.03% in the wards and 20.0% in balcony respectively. Results from sequential analysis showed that the homology of amplified cDNA fragments to previously known SARS-CoV stains was 98%. A strain of live pathogen was isolated from one of the 36 samples. The isolate could cause typical cytopathic effects, similar to those SARS-CoV on Vero-E6 cells and the effects could be stably passed. Indirect immunofluorescence assay showed positive from serum of a SARS patient. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV existed in the air hospital, where SARS patients were admitted to, but the activity of SARS-CoV in air samples was rather low. SARS patients could still shed SARS-CoV even during the recovery phase. Potential possibility of aerosol transmission might exist within 1 meter square area around SARS patients.","Xiao, Wen-jun; Wang, Ming-lian; Wei, Wei; Wang, Jie; Zhao, Jian-jun; Yi, Bin; Li, Jin-song",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15631748/,467

We report a case of COVID-19 infection in a 64-year-old man who developed rapidly worsening respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that required intubation. As the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges widely from mild illness to ARDS with a high risk of mortality, there is a need for more research to identify early markers of disease severity. Current evidence suggests that patients with advanced age, pre-existing comorbidities or dyspnoea should be closely monitored, especially at 1-2 weeks after symptom onset. It remains to be seen if laboratory findings such as lymphopenia or elevated lactate dehydrogenase may serve as early surrogates for critical illness or markers of disease recovery.

The unexpected turn of events the world over since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may serve as stressors which can trigger or worsen mental disorders particularly psychosis. There is little or no reports about acute psychosis on the background of this current global pandemic particularly in the African context. The aim of this article describes a case series of acute schizophrenia-like disorder with COVID-19 related psychotic themes in the context of the current pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS We present a case series of 2 patients with first episode psychotic illnesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both patients presented at the mental health outpatient clinic of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. RESULTS Two patients with no previous history of mental illness presented with COVID-19 delusional themes and odd behaviours. Mental state examination revealed abnormalities in behaviour, thought system, perception and cognition. ICD10 diagnosis of Acute and Transient Psychotic disorder was made in both patients. There were no abnormal physical health findings and symptoms resolved with the use of antipsychotics. CONCLUSION Information on the COVID-19 pandemic may influence the content of psychotic experiences among the general population. A high index of suspicion and acute services are important to ensure prompt intervention and promotion of community mental health. Clinicians need to be well informed to be able to identify what deviates from the norm, and to be able to provide prompt intervention.","Oloniniyi, I O; Ibigbami, O I; Amiola, A; Esan, O A; Esan, O O",West African journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180216/,467

A reflection about its indicators.],2021-07-16,"Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 possess three distinct antigens each which are located in peplomer, membrane, and nucleoprotein virion subcomponents. Although specific antigens are associated with similar polypeptides in both viruses, neither shared antigens nor serological cross-reactions have been observed. These findings were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; rabbit whole-virus-specific antisera reacted with dissociated homologous virus and each of its subcomponents, whereas antisera monospecific to separate subcomponents (peplomers, membrane, or core) recognized only their respective components. Since neither shared antigens nor serological cross-reactions were seen between the two viruses, the specificity of the assay was similar to that of crossed-immunoelectrophoresis, virus neutralization, and complement fixation assays. However, sensitivity was increased at least 1,000-fold; complement fixation antibody titers of 2,000 corresponded to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers of 3,200,000. Similar results were obtained with human convalescent-phase sera. In addition, the most prevalent human antibodies were found to be directed against virion peplomers. However, specific antibodies to core antigens and lesser amounts to membrane antigens were found in the sera of patients, which showed significant antibody rises when purified virion subcomponents were used as antigens. Importantly, rises and declines in titers of antibody to one virus and its specific antigens were independent from levels of titers of antibody to the other virus.","Schmidt, O W",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6208213/,467

The spike (S) glycoprotein, the major target for vaccine and immune therapy, shows up to 17 substitutions in its 1,255-aa sequence; however, the biologic significance of these changes is unknown. Here, the functional effects of S mutations have been determined by analyzing their affinity for a viral receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), and their sensitivity to Ab neutralization with viral pseudotypes. Although minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003 were found, substantial functional changes were detected in S derived from a case in late 2003 from Guangdong province [S(GD03T0013)] and from two palm civets, S(SZ3) and S(SZ16). S(GD03T0013) depended less on the hACE-2 receptor and was markedly resistant to Ab inhibition. Unexpectedly, Abs that neutralized most human S glycoproteins enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus S glycoproteins. The mechanism of enhancement involved the interaction of Abs with conformational epitopes in the hACE-2-binding domain. Finally, improved immunogens and mAbs that minimize this complication have been defined. These data show that the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses can be enhanced by Abs, and they underscore the need to address the evolving diversity of this newly emerged virus for vaccines and immune therapies.","Yang, Zhi-yong; Werner, Heidi C; Kong, Wing-pui; Leung, Kwanyee; Traggiai, Elisabetta; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Nabel, Gary J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15642942/,467

To build a new predictive model for in-hospital mortality in patients over the age of 75 years admitted with pneumonia due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective study of patients older than 75 years admitted from the emergency department for COVID-19 pneumonia between March 12 and April 27, 2020. We recorded demographic (age, sex, living in a care facility or not), clinical (symptoms, comorbidities, Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), and analytical (serum biochemistry, blood gases, blood count, and coagulation factors) variables. A risk model was constructed, and the ability of the 3 scales to predict all-cause in-hospital mortality was compared. RESULTS We included 186 patients with a median age of 85 years (interquartile range, 80-89 years); 44.1% were men. Mortality was 47.3%. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were as follows for each tool: PSI, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.64-0.82); CURB-65 score, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.79); and SCAP score, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81). Risk factors included in the model were the presence or absence of symptoms (cough, dyspnea), the CCI, and analytical findings (aspartate aminotransferase, potassium, urea, and lactate dehydrogenase. The AUC for the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.88). CONCLUSION This study shows that the predictive power of the PSI for mortality is moderate and perceptibly higher than the CURB-65 and SCAP scores. We propose a new predictive model for mortality that offers significantly better performance than any of the 3 scales compared. However, our model must undergo external validation.","López-Izquierdo, Raúl; Ruiz Albi, Tomás; Bermejo-Martín, Jesús Francisco; Almansa, Raquel; Villafañe Sanz, Fátima Victoria; Arroyo Olmedo, Lucia; Urbina Carrera, Carolina Andrea; Sánchez Ramón, Susana; Martín-Rodríguez, Francisco; Moreno Torrero, Fernando; Álvarez, Daniel; Del Campo Matía, Félix",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34251141/,467

190785,Biological markers and follow-up after discharge home of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.,2021-06-01,"This article seeks to advance an understanding of the spatial dynamics of one of the great emergent viral diseases of the twentieth century-poliomyelitis. From an apparently rare clinical condition occurring only sporadically or in small outbreaks before the late nineteenth century, poliomyelitis had, by the early 1950s, developed into a globally distributed epidemic disease. But, from 1955, continued growth was suddenly and dramatically reversed by the mass administration of inactivated (killed) and live (attenuated) poliovirus vaccines. After almost half a century of vaccine control, the world now stands on the brink of the global eradication of the disease. Against this background, the article draws upon information included in the U.S. Public Health Service's Public Health Reports and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report to examine the spatial dynamics of poliomyelitis during the phases of epidemic emergence (1910-1955) and vaccine-induced retreat (1955-1971) in the United States. It is shown that epidemic emergence was accompanied by shifts in the spatial center of activity from early diffusion poles in the northeastern states, to the western seaboard, and then finally to cover all the states of the Union. This was accompanied by accelerating epidemic propagation. The introduction of mass vaccination from the mid-1950s realigned spatial transmission of the disease, producing increased spatial volatility in the geographical center of activity and heightened dependence of epidemic outbreaks upon endemic reservoirs in the most populous states. Finally, the empirical results are generalized to suggest that the emergence and reemergence of many infectious diseases is a distinctively geographical process.","Trevelyan, Barry; Smallman-Raynor, Matthew; Cliff, Andrew D",Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

Whether CLX has effects on other gastrointestinal parameters that reduce peptic ulcer has not been previously investigated. Therefore the effects of CLX on gastric acid secretion, mucus secretion and gastric ulcer scores in rats were investigated. A total of 30 albino wistar rats were used for the study. Out of this number, 10 rats each were used for gastric acid secretion, mucus secretion and ulcer scores respectively. In each of these sub groups, 5 rats served as test and were treated with CLX orally and 5 rats served as control. Standard methods were used for the estimation of these parameters of gastric function. The results showed that basal gastric acid, peak acid output following histamine stimulation and mucus secretion were significantly increased (p<0.001) in CLX-treated (test) rats than in their control. Furthermore, ulcer scores were significantly reduced (p<0.001) in the CLX-treated rats than control. In conclusion, Clarithromycin administration reduced gastric ulcers in rats. This may be attributable to not only its antibiotic property but also its ability to increase gastric mucus which counteracts the aggressive effect of the acid.","Ezomike, N E; Ezomike, U O; Osim, Eme E",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084612/,467

METHODS Dural defects 1.5 cm in diameter were created in 12 canines and repaired with one of two commercially available duraplasty onlay products. In six animals, hydrogel was applied onto the dural onlays, and the other six animals underwent duraplasty only. Before bone flap replacement, watertight closure was assessed. Before the animals were killed, the craniotomy was reopened, adhesions were rated by a neurosurgeon blinded to the treatment groups, and dural integrity was assessed using pressure testing. RESULTS The animals that received the hydrogel sealant in addition to the duraplasty withstood intraoperative Valsalva maneuvers up to 20 cm H2O without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The duraplasty-only animals leaked CSF at spontaneous pressures (p = 0.0022). Postoperatively, all six duraplasty-only dogs developed CSF subcutaneous accumulations, compared with only one (16.7%) dog who underwent hydrogel application (p = 0.0152). At the time of harvesting (8 weeks after implantation), duraplasty-only dogs had extensive scarring between the bone flap and the dura mater (median adhesion score 4, range 3-4). The animals receiving hydrogel showed minimal scarring (median adhesion score 0.5, range 0-2). In hydrogel-treated dogs, the mean adhesion score was 82.6% lower than the scores in duraplasty-only animals (p = 0.0043). In animals receiving hydrogel, the mean dural leak pressure was 56.8 +/- 2.5 cm H2O compared with 9.8 +/- 3.8 cm H2O in duraplasty-only dogs (p = 0.0392). Application of the hydrogel was not associated with neurotoxicity, delayed healing, degenerative changes, or increased dura-cortex adhesions. CONCLUSIONS The hydrogel sealant applied to collagen-based dural grafts significantly reduced CSF leakage and functioned as an adhesion barrier. Such technology could be an important tool for cranial surgery.","Preul, Mark C; Campbell, Patrick K; Bichard, William D; Spetzler, Robert F",Journal of neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17886566/,467

196854,On the organization of and preparation for the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by Spanish out-of-hospital emergency medical services.,2021,"Aging leads to changes in the proportion of several T cell subsets in peripheral blood, but it is not yet known whether these changes have prognostic significance for late-life diseases. To examine this question, levels of T cell subsets were measured at 8 and 18 mo of age in the peripheral blood of mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock, and the mice were then subsequently evaluated for life span and for cause of death. The results indicate that mice whose T cell subset patterns look like those of old mice tend to die at earlier ages, regardless of the specific cause of death. At 18 mo, 39% of the variance within the set of seven measured subsets could be combined statistically into a single number, whose correlation with individual subsets suggested that it could be interpreted as an index of immunological aging. T cell subset pattern, as represented by this index, was a predictor of life span in mice dying of lymphoma, fibrosarcoma, mammary adenocarcinoma, or of all other causes considered together. Even as early as 8 mo of age, T cell subset patterns are significant predictors of all three forms of cancer, although at this age the association is stronger in mated female mice than in virgin mice. These results support two controversial hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive: 1) early immune senescence might predispose to early death from cancer and 2) differences in aging rate, as monitored by tests of immune status, might accelerate or decelerate a wide range of late life neoplastic diseases.","Miller, Richard A; Chrisp, Clarence",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12133992/,467

The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics defining the disease are mainly from Europe and Asia. The disease symptomatology is similar to the prevalent diseases in our environment, this could result in the delay in prompt identification and appropriate management of suspected cases toward combating community transmission. This study evaluates the prevalence, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of positive cases of COVID -19. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Data on the socio-demographic, clinical characteristics and the results of the SARS-CoV-2 test of participants at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research [NIMR] Modified Drive-through Centre for COVID-19 test sample collection over two months [24th February 2020- 27th April 2020] were retrieved from the electronic medical records (EMR). Data obtained were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0. RESULTS A total number of 481 clients were evaluated in this review. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population was 14.6%. The mean age of the positive cases was 42.2 [±15.9] years. The common symptoms reported by the positive cases were fever (40.0%), cough (32.9%), sore throat (17.1%) and running nose (15.7%). Fever depicted statistical significance with positive cases with the majority being of mild to moderate clinical severity. CONCLUSION The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among this cohort was 14.6% with a male preponderance.

DESIGN Randomized clinical trial. ANIMALS 414 heifer calves. PROCEDURE Intranasal BCV antigen concentration and antibody titer against BCV were measured on entry to a feedlot. Calves were randomly assigned to receive 3.0 mL of a modified-live virus vaccine against bovine enteric coronavirus and rotavirus or 3.0 mL of saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. Calves were confined to 1 of 2 pens, depending on vaccination status, for a minimum of 17 days of observation (range, 17 to 99). Selection of calves for treatment of BRD and scoring for severity of disease were done by veterinarians unaware of treatment status. RESULTS Intranasal BCV (125/407 [31%]) and serum antibody titers > or = 20 against BCV (246/396 [62%]) were identified in calves entering the feedlot. Vaccination was associated with significant decrease in risk of treatment for BRD; intranasal BCV on entry to the feedlot was associated with increased risk of treatment. Univariate analysis revealed that control calves with intranasal BRD on entry to the feedlot and those with antibody titer < 20 were significantly more likely to be treated for BRD. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE These data provide further evidence of an association between BCV and respiratory tract disease in feedlot calves. An intranasally administered vaccine appeared to reduce risk of treatment for BRD.","Plummer, Paul J; Rohrbach, Barton W; Daugherty, Richard A; Daugherty, R Andrew; Thomas, Kathy V; Wilkes, Rebecca P; Duggan, Florence E; Kennedy, Melissa A",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15457667/,467
197337,COVID-19 complicated with acute renal failure due to mycotic bezoars in two children.,2021-09-01,"Stem cell therapy using adult stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has produced some promising results in treating the damaged heart. However, the low survival rate of MSCs after transplantation is still one of the crucial factors that limit the therapeutic effect of stem cells. In the damaged heart, oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production can cause the death of transplanted MSCs. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) has been implicated in the development of oxidative stress-related pathologic conditions. Thus, we hypothesized that down-regulation of ASK1 in human MSCs (hMSCs) might attenuate the post-transplantation death of MSCs. To test this hypothesis, we screened microRNAs (miRNAs) based on a miRNA-target prediction database and empirical data and investigated the anti-apoptotic effect of selected miRNAs on human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and on rat myocardial infarction (MI) models. Our data indicated that miRNA-301a most significantly suppressed ASK1 expression in hASCs. Apoptosis-related genes were significantly down-regulated in miRNA-301a-enriched hASCs exposed to hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these data show that miRNA-mediated down-regulation of ASK1 protects MSCs during post-transplantation, leading to an increase in the efficacy of MSC-based cell therapy.","Lee, Chang Youn; Shin, Sunhye; Lee, Jiyun; Seo, Hyang-Hee; Lim, Kyu Hee; Kim, Hyemin; Choi, Jung-Won; Kim, Sang Woo; Lee, Seahyung; Lim, Soyeon; Hwang, Ki-Chul",International journal of molecular sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27775615/,467

This review introduces the concept of population proteomics as a future direction in proteomics research. Population proteomics is the study of protein diversity in human populations. High-throughput, top-down mass spectrometric approaches are employed to investigate, define and understand protein diversity and modulations across and within populations. Population proteomics is a discovery-oriented endeavor with a goal of establishing the incidence of protein structural variations and quantitative regulation of these modifications. Assessing human protein variations among and within populations is viewed as a paramount undertaking that can facilitate clinical proteomics' effort in discovery and validation of protein features that can be used as markers for early diagnosis of disease, monitoring of disease progression and assessment of therapy. This review outlines the growing need for analyzing individuals' proteomes and describes the approaches that are likely to be applied in such a population proteomics endeavor.","Nedelkov, Dobrin",Expert review of proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000079/,467

Until recently, no specific vaccines and effective drugs have been available to protect patients from infection by this virus. To exploit a new strategy to fight this disease, we investigated the effect of interference RNA (RNAi) on the virus infection and replication with 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), plaque-forming, Western-blot and real-time PCR assays. Results showed that the plasmid-derived siRNAs targeting the non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) sequence of the SARS-CoV genome could specifically inhibit the expression of the NSP1 sequence and effectively suppress the replication and propagation of SARS-CoV in cultured Vero E6 cell lines. The expression of the Spike and Nucleoprotein genes of SARS-CoV at mRNA and protein levels in small interfering (si)RNA-expressing cells was significantly less than that in controls when analysed with PCR and Western-blot assays, 3 days post SARS-CoV infection. Our study provides strong evidence that the NSP1 sequence in the SARS-CoV genome is a valid target for RNAi and the effect of the siRNAs probably mainly resulted from effects on global reduction of subgenome synthesis and subsequent protein expression of SARS-CoV.","Ni, Bing; Shi, Xinfu; Li, Yang; Gao, Wenda; Wang, Xiliang; Wu, Yuzhang",Antiviral therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16038478/,467

As the number of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia is increasing and the epidemic is spreading, many hospitals, laboratories and pharmaceutical companies have developed diagnostic reagents that can detect SARS-CoV-2. Currently, genome sequencing or real-time PCR is a method for detecting SARS-CoV-2. However, there have been reported cases of negative results by nucleic acid detection but confirmed on the radiological CT scan. How to improve the diagnostic efficiency and the sensitivity of molecular detection remains to be solved. To analyze the variations in viral genomic sequence may be helpful in guiding the prevention and treatment of diseases infected by SARS-CoV-2. At present, controversy still exists over the source of SARS-CoV-2 even though the probable origin is bat in nature. This article summarizes the recent findings of SARS-CoV-2 from genetic, virological and evolutionary biological perspectives. By comparing the genomic variations among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, we hope the findings can be used in the viral detection and potential antiviral therapy. Also, it will be great if we can trace the spread of the virus from one person to another, which will be an much effective way to predict and control the spread from the virus-carrier without symptoms at the incubation period to the others.","Xiong, Zijun; Zhang, Zhe; Wang, Yaqi; Zhu, Deqin; Guo, Youmin",J.

It is, however, so far unclear how patients with a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) perceive their individual COVID-19 risk. Moreover, their worries and preventive behaviors and their associations with risk perception are unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A postal survey was conducted in April 2020, including participants with previous PE from the German ""Lungenembolie Augsburg"" (LEA) cohort study. The questionnaire contained items on COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception (infection likelihood, susceptibility, dangerousness), information sources and satisfaction with information, individual assignment to a high risk group due to pre-existing conditions, worries, infection likelihood, and implementation of preventive behaviors. RESULTS: From the 185 respondents, 71.7% assigned themselves to a high risk group in terms of developing a severe case of COVID-19. The likelihood of being infected was rated as verylow/low by 82.3% and the susceptability by 37.8%. A considerable percentage of patients expected a very high/high infection risk in a hospital (48.3%) or at a doctor's practice (37.9%). Major sources of information were the patients' general practitioners (48.9%) and the internet (31.5%). Assignment to a high risk group (ß = 1.04) and uncertainty in terms of assignment (ß = 1.26) were significantly (p = 0.01) associated with a higher level of health-related worries. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with previous PE feel that they belong to a high risk group in terms of severe illness from COVID-19. Support in coping with their individual COVID-19 risk is warranted.","Kirchberger, Inge; Berghaus, Thomas M; von Scheidt, Wolfgang; Linseisen, Jakob; Meisinger, Christine",Thromb Res,,467

The model enables a description of population migration at two levels. First, municipal populations are projected using the cohort-component method, and second, the spatial distribution of populations within municipalities is projected at a 500 m grid resolution with the use of the gravity model. Based on the Japanese depopulation context and the country's National Spatial Strategy, the compact scenario predicts the formation of medium-scale regional urban areas (population centers located across Japan) and the concentration of people on high-density population areas within municipalities. Meanwhile, the dispersed scenario predicts the formation of more but smaller regional urban areas and the dispersion of the population to low-density areas. The simulated population distribution for 2050 reveals spatial change in population density and age structure, as well as an abundance of areas that were inhabited in 2015 but will be zero population areas by 2050. Overlay analysis of future land use maps and the simulated population distribution maps can contribute toward identifying areas where natural capital such as farmland and forest plantation should be managed but where there will be significant population loss by 2050.","Hori, Keiko; Saito, Osamu; Hashimoto, Shizuka; Matsui, Takanori; Akter, Rumana; Takeuchi, Kazuhiko",Sustain Sci,,467

The number of trauma patients of each race/insurance status was tabulated per day. We then calculated the changes in trauma volume related to stay-at-home orders for each race/insurance status and compared the magnitude of these changes using statistical resampling. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, there was a 40.1% drop in total trauma volume, which occurred 20 days after stay-at-home orders. During stay-at-home orders, the average daily trauma volume of patients with Medicaid increased by 13.7 ± 5.3%, whereas the volume of those with Medicare, private insurance, and no insurance decreased. The average daily trauma volume decreased for White, Black, Asian, and Latino patients with the volume of Black and Latino patients dropping to a similar degree compared to White patients. CONCLUSION: This retrospective multicenter study demonstrated that patients with Medicaid had a paradoxical increase in trauma volume during stay-at-home orders, suggesting that the most impoverished groups remain disproportionately exposed to trauma during a pandemic, further exacerbating existing health disparities.","Yeates, Eric O; Juillard, Catherine; Grigorian, Areg; Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Barmparas, Galinos; Margulies, Daniel; Garber, Kent; Cryer, Henry; Tillou, Areti; Burruss, Sigrid; Penaloza-Villalobos, Liz; Lin, Ann; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Brenner, Megan; Firek, Christopher; Costantini, Todd; Santorelli, Jarrett; Curry, Terry; Wintz, Diane; Biffl, Walter L; Schaffer, Kathryn B; Duncan, Thomas K; Barbaro, Casey; Diaz, Graal; Johnson, Arianne; Chinn, Justine; Naaseh, Ariana; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Yeates, Todd O; Nahmias, Jeffry",Surgery (St. Louis),,467

We derive optimal strategies for toggling between mitigation stages using daily COVID-19 hospital admissions. With public compliance, the policy triggers ensure adequate intensive care unit capacity with high probability while minimizing the duration of strict mitigation measures. In comparison, we show that other sensible COVID-19 staging policies, including France's ICU-based thresholds and a widely adopted indicator for reopening schools and businesses, require overly restrictive measures or trigger strict stages too late to avert catastrophic surges. As cities worldwide face future pandemic waves, our findings provide a robust strategy for tracking COVID-19 hospital admissions as an early indicator of hospital surges and enacting staged measures to ensure integrity of the health system, safety of the health workforce, and public confidence.","Yang, Haoxiang; Sürer, Özge; Duque, Daniel; Morton, David; Singh, Bismark; Fox, Spencer; Pasco, Remy; Pierce, Kelly; Rathouz, Paul; Du, Zhanwei; Pignone, Michael; Escott, Mark E; Adler, Stephen I; Johnston, S Clairborne; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",,,467

Globally, since the outbreak, more than seven million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported. The rapid spread and increase in the number of new cases is due to person-to-person transmission. To further control its transmission, early laboratory diagnosis of both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients is crucial. Presently, the COVID-19 diagnosis of infected individuals is dependent on computed tomography scanning and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The latter is considered more sensitive and efficient for early diagnosis. In this review, general comparisons are made (cases, fatality rate, incubation period, clinical features, and reservoirs) and diagnostic laboratory procedures (specimens, extraction methods, and positive rates by real-time PCR) are compared between SARS, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and SARS-2. In total, 8982 SARS-2 suspected patients specimen data were retrieved, in which 40.9% (n = 3678) were detected as positive by real-time PCR. The specimen-wise high detection rate was observed from bronchoalveolar lavage, followed by saliva, nasal swabs, and sputum.

The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of these syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Δ19-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Δ19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Δ19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the Δ19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully.","Chen, C. H.; Badeti, S.; Cho, J. H.; Naghizadeh, A.; Wang, X.; Liu, D.",,,467

COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge. Biomarkers have always played an important role in clinical decision making in various infectious diseases. It is crucial to assess the role of biomarkers in evaluating severity of disease and appropriate allocation of resources. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review and meta-analysis. English full text observational studies describing the laboratory findings and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were identified searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, medRxiv using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-nCoV from 1 December 2019 to 15 August 2020 following Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. PARTICIPANTS: Studies having biomarkers, including lymphocyte, platelets, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, procalcitonin (PCT) and creatine kinase (CK), and describing outcomes were selected with the consensus of three independent reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composite poor outcomes include intensive care unit admission, oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation utilisation, severe disease, in-hospital admission and mortality. The OR and 95% CI were obtained and forest plots were created using random-effects models. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: 32 studies with 10 491 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. We found that lymphopenia (pooled-OR: 3.33 (95% CI: 2.51-4.41); p<0.00001), thrombocytopenia (2.36 (1.64-3.40); p<0.00001), elevated D-dimer (3.39 (2.66-4.33); p<0.00001), elevated CRP (4.37 (3.37-5.68); p<0.00001), elevated PCT (6.33 (4.24-9.45); p<0.00001), elevated CK (2.42 (1.35-4.32); p=0.003), elevated AST (2.75 (2.30-3.29); p<0.00001), elevated ALT (1.71 (1.32-2.20); p<0.00001), elevated creatinine (2.84 (1.80-4.46); p<0.00001) and LDH (5.48 (3.89-7.71); p<0.00001) were independently associated with higher risk of poor outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our study found a significant association between lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimer and COVID-19 severity. The results have the potential to be used as an early biomarker to improve the management of COVID-19 patients, by identification of high-risk patients and appropriate allocation of healthcare resources in the pandemic.","Malik, Preeti; Patel, Urvish; Mehta, Deep; Patel, Nidhi; Kelkar, Raveena; Akrmah, Muhammad; Gabrilove, Janice L; Sacks, Henry",BMJ Evid.

336884,Nursing's response to COVID-19: Lessons learned from SARS in Taiwan,2020,"COVID-19 hinders oxygen transport to the consuming tissues by at least 2 mechanisms: In the injured lung saturation of hemoglobin is compromised, in the tissues an associated anemia reduces the volume of delivered oxygen. For the first problem increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve ODC) is of advantage, for the 2nd, however, the contrary is the case. Indeed a right shift of the ODC has been found in former studies for anemia caused by reduced cell production or hemolysis. This resulted from increased 2,3-biphosphglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration. In 3 investigations in COVID-19, however, no change of hemoglobin affinity was detected in spite of probably high [2,3-BPG]. The most plausible cause for this finding is formation of methemoglobin, which increases the oxygen affinity and thus apparently compensates for the 2,3-BPG effect. But this ""useful effect"" is cancelled by the concomitant reduction of functional hemoglobin. In the largest study on COVID-19 even a clear left shift of the ODC was detected when calculated from measurements in fresh blood rather than after equilibration with gases outside the body. This additional ""in vivo"" left shift possibly results from various factors (e. g. concentration changes of Cl-, 2,3-BPG, ATP, lactate, nitrocompounds, glutathione, glutamate, because of time delay between blood sampling and end of equilibration, or enlarged distribution space including interstitial fluid and is useful for O2 uptake in the lungs. Under discussion for therapy are the affinity-increasing 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), erythropoiesis stimulating substances like erythropoietin, and methylene blue against MetHb formation.","Böning, Dieter; Kuebler, Wolfgang M; Bloch, Wilhelm","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,467

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The intensive care unit of a single university medical centre in The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Intensive care medicine professionals. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to wear European size 38 clogs (US male size 6½, US female size 7½) or European size 47 clogs (US male size 13½, US female size 14½) clogs and were required to run a 125 m course from the coffee break room to the elevator providing access to the emergency department. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the time to complete the running course. Height, shoe size, self-described fitness, age and staff category were investigated as possible effect modifiers. Secondary endpoints were reported clog comfort and suspected unexpected clog-related adverse events (SUCRAEs). RESULTS: 50 participants were randomized (25 to European size 38 clogs and 25 to size 47 clogs). Mean age was 37 years (SD 12) and 29 participants (58%) were female. The primary outcome was 4.4 s (95% CI -7.1; -1.6) faster in the size 5 clogs group compared to the size 12 clogs group. This effect was not modified by any of the predefined participant characteristics. No differences were found in reported clog comfort or SUCRAEs.

Goals were to evaluate whether students learning these skills would be more likely to use them in clinical practice, to examine whether learning these skills would provide personal benefits, and to compare personal instruction with video instruction. Students completed questionnaires evaluating the experience in terms of satisfaction, personal benefit, and intent to use. Students provided comments and answered open-ended questions regarding personal and professional benefits and ability to apply knowledge and skills. Results were positive, with students reporting satisfaction with the format, personal benefit from the course, and increased likelihood that they will use the techniques with clients in the future. The lowest scores were on confidence in using the technique with clients.

The risk of severe COVID-19 is increased by certain underlying comorbidities, including asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Notably, exposure to hormonally active chemicals called endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can promote such cardio-metabolic diseases, endocrine-related cancers, and immune system dysregulation and thus, may also be linked to higher risk of severe COVID-19. Bisphenol A (BPA) is among the most common EDCs and exerts its effects via receptors which are widely distributed in human tissues, including nuclear oestrogen receptors (ER&#945; and ERß), membrane-bound oestrogen receptor (G protein-coupled receptor 30; GPR30), and human nuclear receptor oestrogen-related receptor gamma. As such, this paper focuses on the potential role of BPA in promoting comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, as well as on potential BPA-induced effects on key SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Interestingly, GPR30 appears to exhibit greater co-localisation with TMPRSS2 in key tissues like lung and prostate, suggesting that BPA exposure may impact on the local expression of these SARS-CoV-2 infection mediators. Overall, the potential role of BPA on the risk and severity of COVID-19 merits further investigation.","Zahra, Aeman; Sisu, Cristina; Silva, Elisabete; De Aguiar Greca, Sophie-Christine; Randeva, Harpal S; Chatha, Kamaljit; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",,,467

Aortic dissection (AD) is an emergency often presenting as acute chest pain and warranting urgent intervention. A 32-year-old male presented to Emergency Department with acute chest pain. Clinical examination revealed feeble pulses in bilateral lower limbs with a blood pressure difference between upper and lower limbs. Two-dimensional Echocardiography was suggestive of IAA with AD in the descending thoracic aorta. This was confirmed on computed tomography scan of the aorta which revealed complete interruption of the aortic arch distal to left subclavian artery along with the presence of an intimo-medial flap in descending thoracic aorta. A diagnosis of IAA with AD was made. The patient underwent an urgent aortic repair surgery following which he has been largely asymptomatic. A suspicion of AD should always be made in any patient presenting with acute onset chest pain radiating to the back along with accelerated hypertension/feeble pulses in extremity. Occurrence of AD in an adult with IAA is a distinct rarity and has been documented only thrice.,"Kunal, Shekhar; Pathak, Pooja; Mittal, Shruti; Pathak, Vijay; Vaswani, Prateek",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,467

364508,Pandemic shows deep vulnerabilities,2020,"Starting from 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, the Neolithic lifestyle spread across Europe via separate continental and Mediterranean routes. Genomes from early European farmers have shown a clear Near Eastern/Anatolian genetic affinity with limited contribution from hunter-gatherers. However, no genomic data are available from modern-day France, where both routes converged, as evidenced by a mosaic cultural pattern. Here, we present genome-wide data from 101 individuals from 12 sites covering today's France and Germany from the Mesolithic (N = 3) to the Neolithic (N = 98) (7000-3000 BCE). Using the genetic substructure observed in European hunter-gatherers, we characterize diverse patterns of admixture in different regions, consistent with both routes of expansion. Early western European farmers show a higher proportion of distinctly western hunter-gatherer ancestry compared to central/southeastern farmers. Our data highlight the complexity of the biological interactions during the Neolithic expansion by revealing major regional variations.","Rivollat, Maïté; Jeong, Choongwon; Schiffels, Stephan; Küçükkalipçi, Isil; Pemonge, Marie-Hélène; Rohrlach, Adam Benjamin; Alt, Kurt W; Binder, Didier; Friederich, Susanne; Ghesquière, Emmanuel; Gronenborn, Detlef; Laporte, Luc; Lefranc, Philippe; Meller, Harald; Réveillas, Hélène; Rosenstock, Eva; Rottier, Stéphane; Scarre, Chris; Soler, Ludovic; Wahl, Joachim; Krause, Johannes; Deguilloux, Marie-France; Haak, Wolfgang",Sci.

In December 2019, an epidemic with low respiratory infections emerged in Wuhan, China. The disease, Covid-19 was found to be caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of January 07, 2021, WHO has confirmed 88,005,213 global cases and 1,897,568 deaths worldwide, 365,174 in the USA. Fortunately, a vaccine has recently been approved, yet there are no therapeutics for infected individuals. From advances in biotechnology, the genome and structure of SARS-CoV-2 is known. Three proteins are anchored in the viral envelope, Spike (S), Envelope (E), and Membrane (M), which is linked to the Nucleocapsid (N) protein connecting to the viral RNA genome. Our lab is developing an innovative therapy that delivers multiple therapeutic microRNAs to simultaneously block the expression of these distinct viral proteins. In the current work, we propose an anti-Covid microRNA therapy designed to degrade each of the mRNA transcripts of these critical genes, stopping viral assembly, and reducing the severity of infection. The design of the anti-Covid microRNAs 1) mimics human microRNA cluster 17-92a structural stability, 2) forms guide-RNA substrates for the RNA induced silencing complex, and 3) are complementary to specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome without off-targets effects in the human genome. Twenty-one microRNA sequences were designed to target the S gene, six for N, two for M, and one for E. These were cloned into our microRNA-17-92 therapy vector which expresses six distinct anti-Covid RNA therapeutics simultaneously. We have stably transfected the S and N gene into our tissue culture model to measure the efficacy of the anti-Covid microRNA therapy to down-regulate the S and N protein expression. We will be presenting on the efficacy of the anti-Covid microRNA to knockdown the expression of the viral proteins, S and N. In addition, we are examining the secondary structure of our RNA therapy using SHAPE-MAP to optimize RNA therapeutic stability in comparison to the stable structure of the original Mir-17-92a.","Gawargi, Flobater Sine Laura Hicks Martin",The FASEB Journal,,467

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled a total of 170 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent CTPA examination for PE suspicion. Pulmonary arteries diameters, right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio, presence, absence, and distribution of PE, pulmonary artery obstructive index (PAO index), and lobe involvement were recorded. All CT scans were reviewed to assess temporal CT changes and the COVID CT-severity score. RESULTS: A total of 76 out of 170 patients (44.7%) developed PE without having any major risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The most severe pulmonary arteries involvement, expressed in terms of PAO Index, occurred in those patients with markedly elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) values and those patients with an advanced temporal stage of lung disease. The majority PE-positive patients were hospitalized in non-intensive wards. PE-positive patients showed a slightly higher hospitalization time in comparison with PE-negative ones. In the three months of study, overall 85.9% of patients were discharged while 14.1% died, of whom 13 PE-positive (54.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection present a higher cumulative incidence of PE compared to the general population of hospitalized patients, regardless of the severity of lung inflammation or the temporal stage of the disease.","Ippolito, Davide; Giandola, Teresa; Maino, Cesare; Pecorelli, Anna; Capodaglio, Carlo; Ragusi, Maria; Porta, Marco; Gandola, Davide; Masetto, Alessandro; Drago, Silvia; Allegranza, Pietro; Corso, Rocco; Talei Franzesi, Cammillo; Sironi, Sandro",,,467

Here, we describe four different institutions' approaches to addressing the impact of curricular transformation on clerkships using an implementation science lens. Specifically, we explore four different approaches to managing the 'bulge' as classes overlap in clerkships Curriculum leaders at four medical schools report on managing the bulge of core clinical placements resulting from reducing the duration of the foundational sciences curriculum and calendar shifts for the respective clerkship curriculum. These changes, which occurred between 2014 and 2018, led to more students being enrolled in core clinical rotations at the same time than occurred previously. Schools provided respective metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of their bulge management technique. These data typically included number of students affected in each phase of their curricular transformation, performance on standardized examinations, and student and faculty feedback. Not all data were available from all schools, as some schools are still working through their 'bulge' or are affected by COVID-19. There is much to be learned about managing curricular transformations. Working on such endeavors in a learning collaborative such as the AMA Accelerating Change in Medical Education Initiative provided support and insights about how to survive, thrive and identifying lessons learned during curricular transformation.","Kraakevik, Jeff A; Beck Dallaghan, Gary L; Byerley, Julie S; Monrad, Seetha U; Davis, John A; Hammoud, Maya M; Grum, Cyril M; Carney, Patricia",Med Educ Online,,467

Due to the multidimensional characteristic of sustainability, SDGs need research activities with a multidisciplinary approach. This work aims to provide a critical review of the results concerning sustainable materials obtained by Italian researchers affiliated to the National Interuniversity Consortium of Materials Science and Technology (INSTM) and their contribution to reaching specific indicators of the 17 SDGs. Data were exposed by using the Web of Science (WoS) database. In the investigated period (from 2016 to 2020), 333 works about sustainable materials are found and grouped in one of the following categories: chemicals (33%), composites (11%), novel materials for pollutants sequestration (8%), bio-based and food-based materials (10%), materials for green building (8%), and materials for energy (29%). This review contributes to increasing the awareness of several of the issues concerning sustainable materials but also to encouraging the researchers to focus on SDGs' interconnections. Indeed, the mapping of the achievements can be relevant to the decision-makers to identify the opportunities that materials can offer to achieve the final goals. In this frame, a ""Sustainable Materials Partnership for SDGs"" is envisaged for more suitable resource management in the future.","Bontempi, Elza; Sorrentino, Giampiero P; Zanoletti, Alessandra; Alessandri, Ivano; Depero, Laura E; Caneschi, Andrea",Molecules (Basel),,467

RANZCP registrars engaged in the Psychotherapy Written Case are met with new challenges in navigating the psychodynamic processes that can occur when transitioning from in-person to videoconferencing psychotherapy. There is also a myriad of videoconferencing platforms to choose from. CONCLUSION: It has become necessary to adapt our clinical practice to the current COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing regulations. The literature recognises videoconferencing psychotherapy as a valid therapeutic medium which can facilitate healthy psychological maturation, but there are theoretical drawbacks. A transition to videoconferencing psychotherapy requires patient agreeability, consistency and reflection upon patient-therapist dynamics; this will aide in the Psychotherapy Written Case submission.

However, the virus' pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is no cure for the disease. We investigated the dynamic changes of blood immune response in patients with COVID-19 at different stages by using 5' gene expression, T cell receptor (TCR), and B cell receptors (BCR) V(D)J transcriptome analysis at a single-cell resolution. We obtained single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of 341,420 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 185,430 clonotypic T cells and 28,802 clonotypic B cells from 25 samples of 16 patients with COVID-19 for dynamic studies. In addition, we used three control samples. We found expansion of dendritic cells (DCs), CD14+ monocytes, and megakaryocytes progenitor cells (MP)/platelets and a reduction of naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with COVID-19, along with a significant decrease of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells (NKs) in patients in critical condition. The type I interferon (IFN-I), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and ferroptosis pathways were activated while the disease was active, and recovered gradually after patient conditions improved. Consistent with this finding, the mRNA level of IFN-I signal-induced gene IFI27 was significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 compared with that of the controls in a validation cohort that included 38 patients and 35 controls. The concentration of interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;) in the serum of patients with COVID-19 increased significantly compared with that of the controls in an additional cohort of 215 patients with COVID-19 and 106 controls, further suggesting the important role of the IFN-I pathway in the immune response of COVID-19. TCR and BCR sequences analyses indicated that patients with COVID-19 developed specific immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

Prognostic factors and models may assist front-line clinicians in rapid identification of high-risk patients, early management of modifiable factors, appropriate triaging and optimising the use of limited healthcare resources. We aim to systematically assess the clinical, laboratory and imaging predictors as well as prediction models for severe or critical illness and mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All peer-reviewed and preprint primary articles with a longitudinal design that focused on prognostic factors or models for critical illness and mortality related to COVID-19 will be eligible for inclusion. A systematic search of 11 databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, bioRxiv, Arxiv and MedRxiv will be conducted. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Data extraction will be performed using the modified version of the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist and quality will be evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. The association between prognostic factors and outcomes of interest will be synthesised and a meta-analysis will be conducted with three or more studies reporting a particular factor in a consistent manner.

457564,The De-escalation in Urology. Recommendations for Action in the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"WATERLIT Abstract: New studies of COVID–19 are constantly updating best practices in clinical care. Often, it is impractical to apply recommendations based on high-income country investigations to resource limited settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We present a set of pragmatic recommendations for the management of anticoagulation and thrombotic disease for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in LMICs. In the absence of contraindications, we recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with either low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis to minimize risk to healthcare workers. We recommend against the use of aspirin for VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Because of limited evidence, we suggest against the use of “enhanced” or “intermediate” prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients in LMICs. Based on current available evidence, we recommend against the initiation of empiric therapeutic anticoagulation without clinical suspicion for VTE. If contraindications exist to chemical prophylaxis, we recommend mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices or graduated compression stockings (GCS) for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs. In LMICs, we recommend initiating therapeutic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines, if there is high clinical suspicion for VTE, even in the absence of testing. If available, we recommend LMWH over UFH or Direct oral anticoagulants for treatment of VTE in LMICs to minimize risk to healthcare workers. In LMIC settings where continuous intravenous UFH or LMWH are unavailable or not feasible to use, we recommend fixed dose heparin, adjusted to body weight, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE. We suggest D-dimer measurement, if available and affordable, at the time of admission for risk stratification, or when clinical suspicion for VTE is high. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on current available evidence, we make no recommendation on the use of serial D-dimer monitoring for the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving intravenous therapeutic UFH, we recommend serial monitoring of partial thromboplastin time or anti-factor Xa level, based on local laboratory capabilities. For hospitalized COVID-19 patients in LMICs receiving LMWH, we suggest against serial monitoring of anti-factor Xa level. We suggest serial monitoring of platelet counts in patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for VTE, to assess risk of bleeding or development of heparin induced thrombocytopenia","Schultz, M.

470319,Identification tool for potential infectious situations in sport: FISICOVID-DXTGALEGO (Xunta de Galicia),2021,"The hypothalamus mediates important exercise-induced metabolic adaptations, possibly via hormonal signals. Hypothalamic leptin receptor (LepR)- and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)-expressing neurons are directly responsive to growth hormone (GH) and deletion of GH receptor (GHR) in these cells impairs neuroendocrine responses during situations of metabolic stress. In the present study, we determined whether GHR ablation in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells modifies acute and chronic metabolic adaptations to exercise. Male mice carrying deletion of GHR in LepR- or SF1-expressing cells were submitted to 8 weeks of treadmill running training. Changes in aerobic performance and exercise-induced metabolic adaptations were determined. Mice carrying GHR deletion in LepR cells showed increased aerobic performance after 8 weeks of treadmill training, whereas GHR ablation in SF1 cells prevented improvement in running capacity. Trained mice carrying GHR ablation in SF1 cells exhibited increased fat mass and reduced cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius muscle. In contrast, deletion of GHR in LepR cells reduced fat mass and increased gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy, energy expenditure and voluntary locomotor activity in trained mice. Although glucose tolerance was not significantly affected by targeted deletions, glycemia before and immediately after maximum running tests was altered by GHR ablation. In conclusion, GHR signaling in hypothalamic neurons regulates the adaptation capacity to aerobic exercise in a cell-specific manner. These findings suggest that GH may represent a hormonal cue that informs specific hypothalamic neurons to produce exercise-induced acute and chronic metabolic adaptations.","Pedroso, João A B; Santos, Lucas B P Dos; Furigo, Isadora C; Spagnol, Alexandre R; Wasinski, Frederick; List, Edward O; Kopchick, John J; Jr, Jose Donato",Peptides,,467

475061,COVID-19: fight or flight,2020,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies have suggested a higher risk of thrombotic events in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Moreover, elevated D-dimer levels have been identified as an important prognostic marker in COVID-19 directly associated with disease severity and progression. Prophylactic anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID-19 patients might not be enough to prevent thrombotic events; therefore, therapeutic anticoagulation regimens deserve clinical investigation. DESIGN: ACTION is an academic-led, pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase IV clinical trial that aims to enroll around 600 patients at 40 sites participating in the Coalition COVID-19 Brazil initiative. Eligible patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with symptoms up to 14 days and elevated D-dimer levels will be randomized to a strategy of full-dose anticoagulation for 30 days with rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or full-dose heparin if oral administration is not feasible) vs standard of care with any approved venous thromboembolism prophylaxis regimen during hospitalization. A confirmation of COVID-19 was mandatory for study entry, based on specific tests used in clinical practice (RT-PCR, antigen test, IgM test) collected before randomization, regardless of in the outpatient setting or not. Randomization will be stratified by clinical stability at presentation. The primary outcome is a hierarchical analysis of mortality, length of hospital stay, or duration of oxygen therapy at the end of 30 days. Secondary outcomes include the World Health Organization's 8-point ordinal scale at 30 days and the following efficacy outcomes: incidence of venous thromboembolism , acute myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, major adverse limb events, duration of oxygen therapy, disease progression, and biomarkers. The primary safety outcomes are major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. SUMMARY: The ACTION trial will evaluate whether in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban for stable patients, or enoxaparin for unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban through 30 days compared with standard prophylactic anticoagulation improves clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels.","Lopes, Renato D; de Barros E Silva, Pedro Gabriel Melo; Furtado, Remo H M; Macedo, Ariane Vieira Scarlatelli; Ramacciotti, Eduardo; Damini, Lucas Petri; Bronhara, Bruna; Cavalcanti, Alexandre B; Rosa, Regis G; Azevedo, Luciano C P; Veiga, Viviane C; Machado, Flávia R; Ritt, Luiz Eduardo; Martins, Priscilla de Aquino; Alexander, John H; Avezum, Alvaro; Berwanger, Otavio",Am Heart J,,467

498341,Implications on the scientific production of covid-19,2021,"While studies of urban acoustics are typically restricted to the audio range, anthropogenic activity also generates infrasound (<20 Hz, roughly at the lower end of the range of human hearing). Shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic unintentionally created ideal conditions for the study of urban infrasound and low frequency audio (20-500 Hz), as closures reduced human-generated ambient noise, while natural signals remained relatively unaffected. An array of infrasound sensors deployed in Las Vegas, NV, provides data for a case study in monitoring human activity during the pandemic through urban acoustics. The array records a sharp decline in acoustic power following the temporary shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential by the state of Nevada. This decline varies spatially across the array, with stations close to McCarran International Airport generally recording the greatest declines in acoustic power. Further, declines in acoustic power fluctuate with the time of day. As only signals associated with anthropogenic activity are expected to decline, this gives a rough indication of periodicities in urban acoustics throughout Las Vegas. The results of this study reflect the city's response to the pandemic and suggest spatiotemporal trends in acoustics outside of shutdowns.","Bird, Elijah J; Bowman, Daniel C; Seastrand, Douglas R; Wright, Melissa A; Lees, Jonathan M; Dannemann Dugick, Fransiska K",J Acoust Soc Am,,467

Confirmed COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. do not capture the total burden of the pandemic because testing has been primarily restricted to individuals with moderate to severe symptoms due to limited test availability.

Accounting for uncertainty, the number of infections during this period was 3 to 20 times higher than the number of confirmed cases. 86% (simulation interval: 64-99%) of this difference is due to incomplete testing, while 14% (0.3-36%) is due to imperfect test accuracy. The approach can readily be applied in future studies in other locations or at finer spatial scale to correct for biased testing and imperfect diagnostic accuracy to provide a more realistic assessment of COVID-19 burden.","Wu, Sean L; Mertens, Andrew N; Crider, Yoshika S; Nguyen, Anna; Pokpongkiat, Nolan N; Djajadi, Stephanie; Seth, Anmol; Hsiang, Michelle S; Colford, John M; Reingold, Art; Arnold, Benjamin F; Hubbard, Alan; Benjamin-Chung, Jade",Nat Commun,,467

This cross-sectional study assessed 436 outpatients recruited from a tertiary psychiatry clinic in Istanbul, Turkey, nearly one month after the government introduced strict measures of lockdown against the ongoing outbreak. Respondents completed a web-based survey on sociodemographic data, subjective sleep quality, and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Respondents reported high frequencies of clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (32.6%, IES-R score equal to or above 33), anxiety (36.4%, HADS anxiety score > 10), and depression (51%, HADS depression score > 10). 20.5% of respondents described that their psychological status worsened during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 12.1% of respondents described poor or very poor sleep in the prior month. Positive predictors of increased PTSD symptoms included the chronic medical diseases, knowing someone in the social vicinity diagnosed with the COVID-19 infection, job loss or being on temporary leave after the outbreak, and increased exposure time to TV or social media. In contrast, male gender, older age, higher educational attainment, and the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia and (to a lesser degree) bipolar disorder were the negative predictors. Our results suggest that patients with psychiatric disorders are prone to substantial psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and various individual, behavioral, and social factors mediate this effect.","Poyraz, Burc Cagri; Poyraz, Cana Aksoy; Turan, Senol; Demirel, Omer Faruk; Kavla, Yasin; Bulu, Ersel; Hacisalihoglu, Irem; Ersungur, Elif Burcu",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.20173468; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.12.20173468v1?rss=1,467
598289,AFHVS 2020 presidential address: pushing beyond the boundaries,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) pneumonia, thousands of patients with fever or cough were flocked into fever clinic of designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) among these outpatients. Moreover, it is almost unknown to discriminate COVID‐19 and nucleic acid negative patients based on clinical features in the fever clinics. METHODS: The infectious status of SARS‐CoV‐2 was estimated among the outpatients. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared between COVID‐19 and nucleic acid negative patients. RESULTS: The nucleic acid positive rate for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the outpatients from our fever clinic was 67·1%, while the majority of COVID‐19 patients were mild cases. The predominant initial symptom in those COVID‐19 patients was fever (78.2%), followed by cough (15.6%). Very significantly lower number of eosinophils was characterized in COVID‐19 patients as compared to that of nucleic acid negative patients. More importantly, the proportion of subjects with eosinophil counts lower than normal levels in COVID‐19 patients was much higher than that of nucleic acid negative patients. Fever combined with bilateral ground‐glass opacities in CT imaging and eosinophil count below the normal level are probably a valuable indicator of COVID‐19 infection in those outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Those findings may provide critical information for the regions such as Europe and United States that are facing the same situation as Wuhan experienced, and could be valuable to prevent those nucleic acid negative patients from misdiagnosis before antibody testing.

A joinpoint analysis of COVID-19 time series in Brazilian capitals,2020-09-21,"[Image: see text] In December 2019, a novel beta (β) coronavirus eventually named SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, causing an outbreak of severe and even fatal pneumonia in humans. The virus has spread very rapidly to many countries across the world, resulting in the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Clinically, the diagnosis of this unprecedented illness, called coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), becomes difficult because it shares many symptoms with other respiratory pathogens, including influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis is crucial for the clinical management of patients and the implementation of disease control strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 at clinical and population level. Here, we summarize the main clinical and imaging findings of COVID-19 patients and discuss the advances, features, advantages, and limitations of different laboratory methods used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","da Silva, Severino Jefferson Ribeiro; Silva, Caroline Targino Alves da; Guarines, Klarissa Miranda; Mendes, Renata Pessôa Germano; Pardee, Keith; Kohl, Alain; Pena, Lindomar",ACS Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32786280/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00274,467

METHOD. “Strategy” was defined as the planned use of resources to achieve of materialize certain objectives — in this case, fighting the infodemic. The official ministry of health websites in each country were examined from 28 September to 10 October 2020 in search of materials, electronic pages or apps suggesting the existence of an infodemic management strategy, information about the infodemic for citizens, and communication materials such as videos and posters. Additionally, using “infodemic” as a keyword, official documents (rulings, decrees, protocols) mentioning infodemic management measures were searched. The results were classified into three categories: existence of an infodemic management strategy; existence of infodemic control actions; absence of information on the topic. RESULTS. Of the 10 countries analyzed, only Argentina had an infodemic management strategy. Infodemic was mentioned as a topic in the ministry of health websites in Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, and Paraguay; and no mention was identified in the ministry of health websites in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

To inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, the main protease (Mpro) that performs key biological functions in the virus has been the focus of extensive studies. With the fast-response experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently. Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro’s pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes. By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called “anchor” site. Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro’s inhibitors with a high binding affinity.","Huynh, Tien; Wang, Haoran; Luan, Binquan",J Phys Chem Lett,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c00994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406687/,467

Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in COVID-19 patients and to compare outcomes between patients with a mild/moderate and a severe/critical course of the disease. METHODS: Patients in the post-acute phase of a mild to critical course of COVID-19 admitted to a comprehensive three-week inpatient PR were included in this prospective, observational cohort study. Several measures of exercise performance (6-minute walk distance, 6MWD), lung function (forced vital capacity, FVC), and quality of life (36 question short-form health survey, SF-36) were assessed before and after PR. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included in the study (24 with mild/moderate and 26 with severe/critical COVID-19). On admission, patients had a reduced 6MWD (mild: 509 m [426–539]; severe: 344 m [244–392]), an impaired FVC (mild: 80% [59–91]; severe: 75% [60–91]) and a low SF-36 mental health score (mild: 49 pts [37–54]; severe: 39 pts [30–53]). Patients attended a median of 100% [94–100] of all provided PR sessions. At discharge, patients in both subgroups improved in 6MWD (mild/moderate: +48 m [35–113 m]; severe/critical: +124 m [75–145 m], both p<0.001), FVC (mild/moderate: +7.7% [1.0–17.8], p=0.002; severe/critical: +11.3% [1.0–16.9], p<0.001) and SF-36 mental component (mild/moderate +5.6 pts [1.4–9.2], p=0.071; severe/critical: +14.4 pts [−0.6–24.5], p<0.001).

BACKGROUND: With the spread of COVID-19 transmission, people are refraining from going out, reducing their physical activity. In South Korea, COVID-19 broke out in the 4th week of 2020 and experienced the first cycle phases of the pandemic, such as outbreak, widespread, and decline. In response to the pandemic, the government encouraged voluntary participation in social distancing campaigns, and people reduced their outside activities. METHODS: This article examines the decrease and increase of the Prevalence of Regular Walking (&#8805;30 min of moderate walking a day, on &#8805;5 days a week) by the COVID-19 phases. This study is based on weekly walking data for 15 weeks in 2020, via the smartphone healthcare app, which is managed by 25 public health offices of the Seoul government. RESULTS: According to the findings, the level of prevalence of regular walking (PRW) has a significant difference before and after the outbreak, and every interval of the four-stage COVID-19 phases, that is, pre-pandemic, initiation, acceleration, and deceleration. The level of PRW sharply decreased during initiation and acceleration intervals. In the deceleration interval of COVID-19, the PRW kept increasing, but it has not yet reached the same level as the previous year when the COVID-19 did not exist. CONCLUSIONS: As a preliminary study, this study explains empirically how COVID-19 changed PRW in Seoul.

Aim of our study was to assess the rate of disease flare before and during COVID‐19 lockdown to investigate its impact on disease course in JIA children. METHODS: A single‐center retrospective study was conducted, including patients presenting inactive JIA between September 1(st), 2018 and March 9(th), 2019 (group A) and between September 1(st), 2019 and March 9(th), 2020 (group B). For each patient, demographic and clinical data were collected. The rate of JIA flare from March 10(th), 2019 to June 30(th), 2019 for group A and from March 10(th), 2020 to June 30(th), 2020 for group B was compared. RESULTS: Group A included 126 patients and group B 124 patients. Statistical analysis did not show significant differences among the two cohorts with respect to age, sex, age of JIA onset, JIA subtype, co‐occurrence of uveitis, ANA positivity and past or ongoing medications. The rate of disease flare during lockdown at time of first COVID‐19 pandemic wave, was significantly higher in comparison to the previous year (16.9% vs 6.3%, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Our study showed that COVID‐19 lockdown was associated with a higher rate of joint inflammation in JIA children. This finding has a considerable clinical implication, since restrictive measures may be necessary in order to contain pandemics.

Nineteen study volunteers tested randomly allocated head- or full body-ventilated PPE suits equipped with powered-air-purifying-respirators and performed four different tasks (two laboratory tutorials, a timed test of selective attention and a test investigating reaction time, mobility, speed and physical exercise) during 6 working hours at 22°C on one day and 4 working hours at 28°C on another day. Error rates and physical parameters (fluid loss, body temperature, heart rate) were determined and ergonomic-related parameters were assessed hourly using assessment sheets. Depending on the PPE system the most restrictive factors, which however had no negative impact on performance (speed and error rate), were: reduced dexterity due to multiple glove layers, impaired visibility by flexible face shields and back pain related to the respirator of the fully ventilated suit.

However, a little considered aspect of this call is the relationship between a test's accuracy and the tested demographic. What are the implications of frequent, universal testing in otherwise asymptomatic demographics? By applying Bayesian statistics, it becomes clear that as the odds of having COVID decreases, there is a non-linear increase in the odds that each positive test is, in fact, a false positive. This phenomenon has precedence in the historical narrative surrounding universal mammogram screening which is no longer recommended due to the unacceptably high rate of false positives. The solution to combat the inflation of false positives is also suggested by Bayesian statistics: intelligently integrating multiple COVID diagnostic tests and symptoms via Bayes' Theorem, an approach conceptually similar to pre-screening for mammograms. This extra information is readily available (e.g olfactory function and fever) and will minimize the economic and emotional costs incurred by false positives while simultaneously improving the information available for policy-makers. In summary, along with the push for universal testing should be an equally rigorous approach to interpreting the test results.","Meyer, C.; Kralj, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.23.21255984; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.23.21255984v1?rss=1,467

Furthermore, unprecedented lifestyle stressors associated with the pandemic may aggravate the childhood obesity epidemic, but the role of BMI on child activity levels and psychological outcomes during COVID‐19 is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We investigated how emotional responses (positive/negative affect), physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviours related to anxiety among U.S. children with healthy weight and overweight/obesity during the pandemic. METHODS: Sixty‐four typically developing children (63% girls, 53% healthy weight) aged 9 to 15 years completed two virtual visits during the height of ‘stay‐at‐home’ measures from April 22 to July 29, 2020. Children completed 24‐hours PA recalls, state portion of State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children and the 10‐item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children. RESULTS: Independent of child BMI status, child anxiety scores were over five standard deviations greater than normative values from paediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Higher positive affect and PA were each associated with reduced anxiety levels in children with overweight/obesity, whereas higher positive affect was associated with reduced anxiety in children with healthy weight. Greater leisure screen time was associated with higher negative affect irrespective of child BMI status. CONCLUSIONS: These associations highlight the potential mental health benefits of maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA and limiting leisure screen time for children during the pandemic and suggest that these associations may be particularly relevant for children with overweight/obesity.","Alves, Jasmin M.; Yunker, Alexandra G.; DeFendis, Alexis; Xiang, Anny H.; Page, Kathleen A.",Pediatr Obes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720550/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpo.12786,467

COVID-19 could also be spread when patients touches a contaminated surface with infected droplets and then touch their nose, mouth, or eyes. It is time to consider a dental practice quite similar to a hospital surgery room, where particular attention should be addressed to problems related to the spreading of infections due to air and surface contamination. The effectiveness of conventional cleaning and disinfection procedures may be limited by several factors; first of all, human operator dependence seems to be the weak aspect of all procedures. The improvement of these conventional methods requires the modification of human behavior, which is difficult to achieve and sustain. As alternative sterilization methods, there are some that do not depend on the operator, because they are based on devices that perform the entire procedure on their own, with minimal human intervention. In conclusion, continued efforts to improve the traditional manual disinfection of surfaces are needed, so dentists should consider combining the use of proper disinfectants and no-touch decontamination technologies to improve sterilization procedures.","Cumbo, Enzo; Gallina, Giuseppe; Messina, Pietro; Scardina, Giuseppe Alessandro",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784414/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165736,467

The comparison of NBCZones among 169 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and viral (chymo)trypsin-like proteases suggested the existence of 15 distinct groups determined by the combination of amino acids located at two “key” structure-functional positions 54(T) and 55(T) near the catalytic base His57(T). Most eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteases fell into two major groups, [ST]A and TN. Usually, proteases of [ST]A group contain a disulfide bond between cysteines Cys42(T) and Cys58(T) of the NBCZone. In contrast, viral proteases were distributed among seven groups, and lack this disulfide bond. Furthermore, only the [ST]A group of eukaryotic proteases contains glycine at position 43(T), which is instrumental for activation of these enzymes.

STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted in Ankara City Hospital between April, 15, 2020 and June, 5, 2020. A total of 206 asymptomatic pregnant women (103 low-risk pregnant women without any defined risk factor and 103 high-risk pregnant women) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 positivity upon admission to hospital for delivery. Detection of SARS-CoV2 in nasopharyngeal samples was performed by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method targeting RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene. Two groups were compared in terms of demographic features, clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: Three of the 206 pregnant women participating in the study had positive RT-PCR tests (1.4%) and all positive cases were in the high-risk pregnancy group. Although, one case in the high-risk pregnancy group had developed symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19, two repeated RT-PCR tests were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity rate was significantly higher in the high-risk pregnancy group (2.9% vs 0%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals should be cautious in the labor and delivery of high-risk pregnant women during the pandemic period and universal testing for COVID-19 may be considered in selected populations.","Tanacan, Atakan; Erol, Seyit Ahmet; Turgay, Batuhan; Anuk, Ali Taner; Secen, Elcin Islek; Yegin, Gulin Feykan; Ozyer, Sebnem; Kirca, Fisun; Dinc, Bedia; Unlu, Serpil; Yapar Eyi, Elif Gul; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Sahin, Dilek; Surel, Aziz Ahmet; Tekin, Ozlem Moraloglu",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211520304930?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763728/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301211520304930,467

649912,Food frights: COVID-19 and the specter of hunger,2020-05-13,"Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has previously shown mortality benefit in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a randomized controlled trial. As the illness is considered to reflect a hyperinflammatory state, this therapeutic effectiveness is presumably ascribed to broad anti-inflammatory activities of glucocorticoids. Here, an unbiased analysis of available transcriptomic data on lung and blood immune cells from severe COVID-19 patients and matching cellular models of dexamethasone treatment is presented that supports this presumption. Comparison of differentially expressed genes in severe COVID-19 with that in dexamethasone treated cells reveals a small set of genes that are regulated in opposite direction between the disease and the drug, and are enriched for genes and processes related to glucocorticoid pathway and receptor binding. This expression signature differentiates as a whole various cytokines from a set of anti-cytokine/anti-inflammatory agents, with the former resembling COVID-19 and the latter dexamethasone in gene regulation. The signature apparently relates to TNF- α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ signaling, but not IL-6 signaling, suggesting that therapeutic effect of dexamethasone in COVID-19 does not involve IL-6 pathway. However, as all these observations are purely based on bioinformatic analysis, experimental evidence will be required to validate the inferences drawn. In conclusion, the present analysis seems to provide a proof of concept for therapeutic mechanisms of dexamethasone in COVID-19.","Sharma, Abhay",Gene,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2021.145665; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378111921002596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887367/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111921002596?v=s5,467

Laboratory exposure to ultraviolet irradiance in the UVC range inactivates many viruses and bacteria in times less than 30 min. Estimated UVB inactivation doses from sunlight in J/m(2) are obtained from UVC measurements and radiative transfer calculations, weighted by a virus inactivation action spectrum, using OMI satellite atmospheric data for ozone, clouds, and aerosols. For SARS CoV, using an assumed UVC dose near the mid-range of measured values, D(90) = 40 J/m(2), 90% inactivation times T(90) are estimated for exposure to midday 10:00–14:00 direct plus diffuse sunlight and for nearby locations in the shade (diffuse UVB only). For the assumed D(90) = 40 J/m(2) model applicable to SARS CoV viruses, calculated estimates show that near noon 11:00–13:00 clear-sky direct sunlight gives values of T(90) < 90 min for mid-latitude sites between March and September and less than 60 min for many equatorial sites for 12 months of the year. Recent direct measurements of UVB sunlight inactivation of the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 show shorter T(90) inactivation times less than 10 min depending on latitude, season, and hour. The equivalent UVC 254 nm D(90) dose for SARS CoV-2 is estimated as 3.2 ± 0.7 J/m(2) for viruses on a steel mesh surface and 6.5 ± 1.4 J/m(2) for viruses in a growth medium. For SARS CoV-2 clear-sky T(90) on a surface ranges from 4 min in the equatorial zone to less than 30 min in a geographic area forming a near circle with solar zenith angle < 60(O) centered on the subsolar point for local solar times from 09:00 to 15:00 h.

In this study, we present a multitarget real-time TaqMan reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 and some of its circulating variants harboring mutations that give SARS-CoV-2 a selective advantage. Seven different primer-probe sets that included probes containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides were designed to amplify specific wild-type and mutant sequences in Orf1ab, Envelope (E), Spike (S), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes. Furthermore, a newly developed primer-probe set targeted human beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) as a highly sensitive internal control for RT efficacy. All singleplex and fourplex assays detected less than or equal to 14 copies/reaction of quantified synthetic RNA transcripts, with a linear amplification range of 9 logarithmic orders. Primer-probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited no false-positive amplifications with other common respiratory pathogens, including human coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU-1. Given the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their rapid spread in some populations, fourplex rRT-PCR assay containing four primer-probe sets represents a reliable approach to detect multiple viral target sequences containing typical mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a single reaction, allowing quicker detection of circulating relevant variants.","Durand, M.; Thibault, P.; Levesque, S.; Brault, A.; Carignan, A.; Valiquette, L.; Martin, P.; Labbe, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.23.21254196; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.23.21254196v1?rss=1,467

According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), health-related behavior is determined by perceived barriers and motivators. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how physical activity and sedentary behavior has changed by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. The following results were statistically significant at p < .05. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%; strength-based activity, -30%) and more sedentary (+11%) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents’ whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, anxiety r = -.12). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%,), lacked social support (+6%), or had limited access to equipment (+23%) or space (+41%). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%) or strength (-14%) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, Maryam Yvonne; Nicholson, Emma; Ogrodnik, Michelle; Fenesi, Barbara; Heisz, Jennifer J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793550/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239244,467

Here, we explored associations between COVID-19 mortalities and medical and public health capacities in individual prefectures. The following data by prefecture were abstracted from open resources provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan as of May 24, 2020: total number of COVID-19 deaths; polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive ratio (i.e., number of patients with PCR-positive results/number of patients aiming diagnosis of COVID-19 or individuals in close contacted with COVID-19 patients); number of call centers, outpatient centers, and hospital beds specifically for patients diagnosed with COVID-19; and others. The primary outcome was COVID-19 mortality per million population. Multiple and simple linear regression models were applied. Two variables were significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality: PCR-positive ratio (P < 0.001) and number of critical care medical centers per million population (P = 0.001). PCR-positive ratio was positively associated with COVID-19 mortality (aR-sqr = 0.522). Low PCR-positive ratio, especially ≤ 4%, was associated with low COVID-19 mortality. Critical care medical centers may also play an important role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 death.","Ishikawa, Yohei; Hifumi, Toru; Urashima, Mitsuyoshi",SN Compr Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00547-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33015554/,467

The workers at the universities have had to start a period of teleworking that could give rise to consequences for the musculoskeletal system. The objective of this article is to analyze the impact of the confinement on the musculoskeletal health of the staff of two Spanish universities. A cross-sectional, observational study was carried out on the workers. Data was taken in April–May 2020 and included: The Standardized Kuorinka Modified Nordic Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale and another one on sociodemographic data. This study comprised 472 people. The areas of pain noted during the confinement period concluded that it was less in all cases (p < 0.001). The frequency of physical activity carried out increased significantly during the period of confinement (p < 0.04), especially in women. The type of physical activity done was also seen to modify during this period (p < 0.001), with a preference for strength training and stretching exercises. In conclusion, the confinement gave rise to changes in the lifestyle and in the musculoskeletal pain of the workers at the universities. All of this must be taken into account by health institutions and those responsible for the Prevention of Occupational Risks at Spanish universities.","Rodríguez-Nogueira, Óscar; Leirós-Rodríguez, Raquel; Benítez-Andrades, José Alberto; Álvarez-Álvarez, María José; Marqués-Sánchez, Pilar; Pinto-Carral, Arrate",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374537/,467
