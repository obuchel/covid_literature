604,"Demographic, etiological, and histological pulmonary analysis of patients with acute respiratory failure: a study of 19 years of autopsies",2011-07-11,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory failure has been one of the most important causes of death in intensive care units, and certain aspects of its pulmonary pathology are currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to describe the demographic data, etiology, and pulmonary histopathological findings of different diseases in the autopsies of patients with acute respiratory failure. METHOD: Autopsies of 4,710 patients with acute respiratory failure from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed, and the following data were obtained: age, sex, and major associated diseases. The pulmonary histopathology was categorized as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia. The odds ratio of the concordance between the major associated diseases and specific autopsy findings was calculated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Bacterial bronchopneumonia was present in 33.9% of the cases and cancer in 28.1%. The pulmonary histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 40.7% (1,917) of the cases. A multivariate analysis showed a significant and powerful association between diffuse alveolar damage and bronchopneumonia, HIV/AIDS, sepsis, and septic shock, between liver cirrhosis and pulmonary embolism, between pulmonary edema and acute myocardial infarction, between dilated cardiomyopathy and cancer, between alveolar hemorrhage and bronchopneumonia and pulmonary embolism, and between lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia and HIV/AIDS and liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchopneumonia was the most common diagnosis in these cases. The most prevalent pulmonary histopathological pattern was diffuse alveolar damage, which was associated with different inflammatory conditions. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the complete pathophysiological mechanisms involved with each disease and the development of acute respiratory failure.","de Matos Soeiro, Alexandre; Ruppert, Aline D; Canzian, Mauro; Parra, Edwin R; Farhat, Cecília; Capelozzi, Vera L",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3148463/,218
673,"Multinational, observational study of procalcitonin in ICU patients with pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation: a multicenter observational study",2011-03-07,"INTRODUCTION: The intent of this study was to determine whether serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels are associated with prognosis, measured as organ dysfunctions and 28-day mortality, in patients with severe pneumonia. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational study of critically ill adult patients with pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation conducted in 10 academic hospitals in Canada, the United States, and Central Europe. PCT was measured daily for 14 days using an immuno-luminometric assay. RESULTS: We included 175 patients, 57 with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 61 with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and 57 with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). Initial PCT levels were higher in CAP than VAP patients (median (interquartile range: IQR); 2.4 (0.95 to 15.8) vs. 0.7 (0.3 to 2.15), ng/ml, P < 0.001) but not significantly different to HAP (2.2 (0.4 to 8.0) ng/ml). The 28-day ICU mortality rate for all patients was 18.3% with a median ICU length of stay of 16 days (range 1 to 142 days). PCT levels were higher in non-survivors than in survivors. Initial and maximum PCT levels correlated with maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score r(2 )= 0.50 (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.61) and r(2 )= 0.57 (0.46 to 0.66), respectively. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis on discrimination of 28-day mortality showed areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.74, 0.70, and 0.69 for maximum PCT, initial PCT, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, respectively. The optimal cut-off to predict mortality for initial PCT was 1.1 ng/ml (odds ratio: OD 7.0 (95% CI 2.6 to 25.2)) and that for maximum PCT was 7.8 ng/ml (odds ratio 5.7 (95% CI 2.5 to 13.1)). CONCLUSIONS: PCT is associated with the severity of illness in patients with severe pneumonia and appears to be a prognostic marker of morbidity and mortality comparable to the APACHE II score.","Bloos, Frank; Marshall, John C; Dellinger, Richard P; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Gutierrez, Guillermo; Rivers, Emanuel; Balk, Robert A; Laterre, Pierre-Francois; Angus, Derek C; Reinhart, Konrad; Brunkhorst, Frank M",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219347/,218
2807,Telerehabilitation Solution Conceptual Paper for Community-Based Exercise Rehabilitation of Patients Discharged After Critical Illness,2016-12-15,"A novel service oriented platform has been developed under the framework of the Telerehabilitation Service funded by the Cross Border Cooperation Programme Greece Cyprus 2007 – 2013 to support tele-supervised exercise rehabilitation for patients after hospitalization in intensive care units (ICU). The platform enables multiparty, interregional bidirectional audio/visual communication between clinical practitioners and post-ICU patients. It also enables patient group-based vital sign real time monitoring, patients’ clinical record bookkeeping, and individualized and group-based patient online exercise programs. The exercise programs intended for the service are based on successful cardiorespiratory rehabilitation programs, individualized and monitored by a multidisciplinary team. The eligibility study of former ICU patients to participate in such a service as well as a cost benefit analysis are presented to support the cost effectiveness of the telerehabilitation program in addition to the expected health benefits to a large proportion of former ICU patients.","TSAVOURELOU, APHRODITE; STYLIANIDES, NIKOLAS; PAPADOPOULOS, ANDREAS; DIKAIAKOS, MARIOS D.; NANAS, SERAFEIM; KYPRIANOY, THEODOROS; TOKMAKIDIS, SAVVAS P.",Int J Telerehabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5536730/,218
3820,"Neonatal Pertussis, an Under-Recognized Health Burden and Rationale for Maternal Immunization: A Systematic Review of South and South-East Asian Countries",2019-05-03,"Pertussis is an under-recognized cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. To review information on the epidemiology and disease burden of neonatal pertussis in South and Southeast Asian countries, a systematic literature review of three bibliographic databases was undertaken. Peer-reviewed original studies on neonatal pertussis epidemiology and burden published since 2000, with a geographical scope limited to South and Southeast Asian countries, were included. Data were systematically extracted based on parameters defined a priori. Our findings show that the burden of neonatal pertussis and its complications is substantial. An increase in the number of pertussis cases has been noted since early 2000, ranging from 61 to 92.9% in infants 0–3 months old. The most common symptoms an infant is likely to present with are cough with or without paroxysms, cyanosis, apnea, tachypnea, difficulty in breathing and leukocytosis. In addition, it can lead to hospitalization (length of stay: 5–7 days), complications (e.g., pneumonia, seizures) and mortality ranging from 5.6 to 14.7%. Other observations indicate that diagnosis is challenging because of non-specific clinical symptoms. Specifically, for obstetricians and gynecologists, the information available for making informed decisions on the prevention of neonatal pertussis is unreliable. Maternal immunization against pertussis during late stages of pregnancy has proven to be efficacious and well tolerated. A high burden of neonatal pertussis, as well as its complications, is observed in South and Southeast Asian countries. There is a need to intensify efforts to protect this vulnerable population with maternal vaccination.

4466,New-onset atrial fibrillation can be falsely associated with increased length of stay in ICU due to immortal time bias,2020-02-06,"BACKGROUND: High glycemic variability (GV) is common in critically ill patients; however, the prevalence and mortality association with early GV in patients with sepsis remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) in central Taiwan. Patients in the ICU with sepsis between January 2014 and December 2015 were included for analysis. All of these patients received protocol-based management, including blood sugar monitoring every 2 h for the first 24 h of ICU admission. Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and coefficient of variation (CoV) were used to assess GV. RESULTS: A total of 452 patients (mean age 71.4 ± 14.7 years; 76.7% men) were enrolled for analysis. They were divided into high GV (43.4%, 196/452) and low GV (56.6%, 256/512) groups using MAGE 65 mg/dL as the cut-off point. Patients with high GV tended to have higher HbA1c (6.7 ± 1.8% vs. 5.9 ± 0.9%, p < 0.01) and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM) (50.0% vs. 23.4%, p < 0.01) compared with those in the low GV group. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that a high GV was associated with increased 30-day mortality (log-rank test, p = 0.018). The association remained strong in the non-DM (log-rank test, p = 0.035), but not in the DM (log-rank test, p = 0.254) group. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified that high APACHE II score (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.045, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013–1.078), high serum lactate level at 0 h (aHR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003–1.014), having chronic airway disease (aHR 0.478, 95% CI 0.302–0.756), high mean day 1 glucose (aHR 1.008, 95% CI 1.000–1.016), and high MAGE (aHR 1.607, 95% CI 1.008–2.563) were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. The association with 30-day mortality remained consistent when using CoV to assess GV. CONCLUSIONS: We found that approximately 40% of the septic patients had a high early GV, defined as MAGE > 65 mg/dL. Higher GV within 24 h of ICU admission was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. These findings highlight the need to monitor GV in septic patients early during an ICU admission.","Chao, Wen-Cheng; Tseng, Chien-Hua; Wu, Chieh-Liang; Shih, Sou-Jen; Yi, Chi-Yuan; Chan, Ming-Cheng",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007493/,218
6785,New Cancer Therapies: Implications for the Perioperative Period,2018-12-06,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most frequent cause of bronchiolitis. However the pathophysiology of bronchiolitis is unclear. Leukocytes, especially neutrophils, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis. Whereas we have previously shown that neutrophils augment epithelial leakage and detachment in RSV infection in vitro, it is unknown whether epithelial damage occurs in vivo in infants with RSV bronchiolitis. We hypothesized that respiratory epithelial damage occurs in infants with RSV bronchiolitis and that surfactant proteins leak into the circulation. The plasma concentrations of surfactant protein-A and surfactant protein-B in infants with RSV bronchiolitis were measured by ELISA. Plasma immunoreactive surfactant protein-B in infants with RSV bronchiolitis was markedly higher than that in matching controls. Our study suggests that alveolocapillary permeability is increased in infants with RSV bronchiolitis in vivo and that surfactant protein-B may be a sensitive marker for lung injury in such infants.","Wang, Shan-Ze; Doyle, Ian R; Nicholas, Terence E; Forsyth, Kevin D",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102127/,218

The aim of the current study was therefore to determine the prevalence of ESBL/pAmpC producing Enterobacteriaceae and methicillin-resistant coagulase positive staphylococci in healthy dogs in Sweden, and to phenotypically and genotypically characterize any identified isolates. It was shown that 0.9% (95% confident interval 0.3–2.7%) of the dogs (n = 325) carried multi-resistant ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, but that no methicillin-resistant coagulase positive staphylococci could be detected. In conclusion, the occurrence of multi-drug resistant bacteria remains rare among healthy dogs in Sweden. In addition, the ESBL-producing E. coli identified showed genetic characteristics related to those reported from humans.","Börjesson, Stefan; Gunnarsson, Lotta; Landén, Annica; Grönlund, Ulrika",Acta Vet Scand,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7183698/,218
10627,General Adaptation in Critical Illness: Glucocorticoid Receptor-alpha Master Regulator of Homeostatic Corrections,2020-04-22,"Systemic treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment of hematological and oncological diseases in recent years. The mechanism of action hinges on enhancing the natural ability of the immune system to eliminate malignant cells. The most important substances in this arena include inhibitors of PD‑1, PD-L1 and CTLA‑4. As a consequence, the spectrum of treatment-associated adverse reactions is shifting away from classical cytotoxic effects (e.g. pancytopenia and polyneuropathy) towards novel entities of immune-mediated complex diseases. These so-called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can involve any organ system and mimic known classical autoimmune conditions. Timely recognition of irAEs is the key for rapid initiation of a suitable treatment and is especially challenging in the clinical routine as it requires an intensive interdisciplinary management. Nephrologists are particularly confronted with this kind of problem due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of their work. This article summarizes the broad spectrum of currently known renal and more frequently occuring non-renal forms of irAEs and aims to prime the reader on diagnostic and therapeutic options.","Braun, G.

11201,Oxygen saturation histograms predict nasal continuous positive airway pressure-weaning success in preterm infants,2020-01-23,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors such as ganciclovir and foscarnet have dramatically reduced the burden of CMV infection in the HCT recipient. However, their use is often limited by toxicities and resistance. Agents with novel mechanisms and favorable toxicity profiles are critically needed. We review recent developments in CMV antivirals and immune-based approaches to mitigating CMV infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Letermovir, an inhibitor of the CMV terminase complex, was approved in 2017 for primary CMV prophylaxis in adult seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients. Maribavir, an inhibitor of the CMV UL97 kinase, is currently in two phase 3 treatment studies. Adoptive immunotherapy using third-party T cells has proven safe and effective in preliminary studies. Vaccine development continues, with several promising candidates currently under study.

11207,Pretreatment with glucose–insulin–potassium improves ventricular performances after coronary artery bypass surgery: a randomized controlled trial,2019-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the effect of high dose tigecycline on severe infections are limited and remain controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess systematically the effectiveness and safety of high dose tigecycline in the treatment of severe infections. METHODS: Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials were searched up to February 20, 2019 for studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of high dose tigecycline with standard dose tigecycline or other non-tigecycline-containing regimens in the treatment of severe infections. Rates for all-cause mortality, clinical cure, microbiological eradication and adverse events were analysed. RESULTS: Ten studies with 593 patients were included. The results indicated that using high dose tigecycline resulted in better outcomes compared with controls with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30–0.66, p < 0.0001), higher clinical cure (OR 3.43, 95% CI 2.09–5.63, p < 0.00001), higher microbiological eradication (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.44–3.50, p = 0.0003), and without increasing adverse events rates. Subgroup analysis showed that high dose tigecycline reduced all-cause mortality in nosocomial acquired pneumonia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.22–0.70, p = 0.002), bloodstream infections (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06–0.58, p = 0.004) and mixed infections (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07–0.59, p = 0.003), with no statistical differences in complicated intra-abdominal infections (OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.80–5.23, p = 0.14). In carbapenem-resistant pathogens, the microbiological eradication rate in those given high dose tigecycline did not differ from controls (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.44–2.60, p = 0.87), although mortality was reduced (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09–0.45, p = 0.0001). The main limitation of the review is that most of the included studies are observational studies with small sample sizes and high risks of bias. CONCLUSIONS: High dose tigecycline treatment is effective and safe for severe infections owing to its lower all-cause mortality, higher clinical cure, microbiological eradication and comparable adverse events. However, as a result of the high risks of bias of the included studies, well-designed randomised clinical trials are warranted to establish the effectiveness and safety of high dose tigecycline compared with standard dose tigecycline and other commonly used antibiotics.","Zha, Lei; Pan, Lingling; Guo, Jun; French, Neil; Villanueva, Elmer V.; Tefsen, Boris",Adv Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223407/,218
11298,"Inhaled nitric oxide as an adjunct to neonatal resuscitation in premature infants: a pilot, double blind, randomized controlled trial",2019-10-30,"KEY MESSAGE: Transcriptomic analysis of the relationship between gene expression patterns and flavonoid contents in the flower buds of Lonicera japonica under light-induced conditions, especially the flavonoid pathway genes and transcription factors. ABSTRACT: Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (FLJ), the flower buds of Lonicera japonica Thunb., has been used to treat some human diseases including severe respiratory syndromes and hand-foot-and-mouth diseases owing to its putative antibacterial, and antiviral effects. Luteoloside is a flavonoid that is used by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia to evaluate the quality of FLJ. Light is an important environmental factor that affects flavonoid biosynthesis in the flower buds of L. japonica. However, how light triggers increases in flavonoid production remains unclear. To enhance our understanding of the mechanism involved in light-regulated flavonoid biosynthesis, we sequenced the transcriptomes of L. japonica exposed to three different light conditions: 100% light intensity (CK), 50% light intensity (LI50), and 25% light intensity (LI25) using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 System. A total of 77,297 unigenes with an average length of 809 bp were obtained. Among them, 43,334 unigenes (56.06%) could be matched to at least one biomolecular database. Additionally, 4188, 1545 and 1023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparative transcriptomics LI25-vs-CK, LI50-vs-CK, and LI25-vs-LI50, respectively. Of note, genes known to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, such as 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase (4CL), and chalcone synthase (CHS) were up-regulated. In addition, a total of 1649 transcription factors (TFs) were identified and divided into 58 TF families; 98 TFs exhibited highly dynamic changes in response to light intensity. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression profiles of the RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. This study offers insight into how transcriptional expression pattern is influenced by light in the flower buds of L. japonica, and will enhance the understanding of molecular mechanisms of flavonoid biosynthesis in response to light in L. japonica.

12972,Predicting the treatment response of certolizumab for individual adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis: protocol for an individual participant data meta-analysis,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: Growing demand for medical services has increased patient waiting time due to the limited number or unbalanced distribution of healthcare centers. Healthcare teleconsultation networks are one of the potentially powerful systems to overcome this problem. Medical pathology can hugely benefit from teleconsultation networks because having second opinions is precious for many cases; however, resource planning (i.e., assignment and distribution of pathology consultation requests) is challenging due to bulky medical images of patients. This results in high setup and operational costs. The aim of this study is to design an optimal teleconsultation network for pathology labs under the supervision of medical sciences universities in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: To avoid the setup cost, we first propose a modified hybrid peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay architecture for our telepathology network, using Iran’s National Healthcare Information Network (SHAMS) as the underlying infrastructure. Then we apply optimization techniques to solve the request assignment and distribution problems in the network. Finally, we present a novel mathematical model with the objective of minimizing the variable operational costs of the system. RESULTS: The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated by a set of practical-sized network instances simulated based on the characteristics of SHAMS. The results show that the presented model and architecture can obtain optimal solutions for network instances up to 350 nodes, which covers our target network. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the proposed method can be beneficial for designing large-scale medical teleconsultation networks by adjusting the constraints according to the rules and conditions of each country. Our findings showed that teleconsultation networks in countries with strong information technology (IT) infrastructures are under the influence of consultation fees, while in countries with weak IT infrastructure, the transmission costs are more critical. To the best of our knowledge, no research has so far addressed resource planning in medical teleconsultation networks using optimization techniques. Besides, the target network, i.e., pathology labs under the supervision of medical sciences universities in Tehran and the SHAMS network, are discussed for the first time in this work.","Taghipour, Mohammad Mahdi; Sepehri, Mohammad Mehdi",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477836/,218

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield (DY) of SBCE in overt and occult OGIB, as well as its impact on the clinical outcome. Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively included all cases of OGIB investigated by SBCE in a tertiary care referral center, between 1st January 2016 and 31st December 2018. OGIB was defined by overt or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, with negative upper and lower endoscopy. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding was either proved by a fecal test or presumptively incriminated as a cause for IDA. DY was defined as the detection rate for what were thought to be clinically significant findings. DYs for overt and occult bleeding were assessed and compared. Gender, age, hemoglobin levels, NSAID consumption and the use of anticoagulants were recorded. Following SBCE results, individual therapeutic decisions were made, and follow-up data were recorded. Results: 224 SBCE examinations were performed for OGIB, of which 148 were for overt OGIB, and 76 for unexplained IDA. Positive findings were found in 139 patients, resulting in an overall DY for OGIB of 62%, higher in overt OGIB (75%) compared to IDA (37%). The most frequent findings were small bowel angioectasias (62.2% in overt OGIB and 78.5% in IDA). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, only hemoglobin level <10 g/dL and anticoagulants were the variables independently associated with positive findings. All patients received medical, endoscopic or surgical treatment and had good clinical outcome during follow-up.

The clinical outcomes are also not satisfactory. Full-endoscopic decompression of the lumbar spinal canal has achieved satisfactory results for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. This surgery may be used for the treatment of thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) under local anesthesia. The aim of our study is to introduce the surgical techniques used for full-endoscopic decompression for thoracic OLF and to evaluate its safety and efficacy. METHODS: Fourteen patients with thoracic OLF (4 combined with dural ossification) underwent full-endoscopic decompression surgery. An interlaminar approach was performed. The anchoring method was used to establish the working passage. Spinal cord exposure began at a space between the ossification and the spinal cord, and dorsal and contralateral decompression were performed with the “Over the Top” technique. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (11 points) was used to evaluate the efficacy during follow-up. At the same time, the visual analogue scale score for assessing back pain before and after the operation was evaluated. RESULTS: The average operation time was 159.73 ± 62.09 minutes, and the hospitalization time was 7.43 ± 1.79 days. The follow-up period ranged from 8 to 22 months. Neurological function was improved. There were no serious complications. Dural tears occurred in 5 patients, intraoperative neurological deterioration occurred in 1 patient, and intraoperative headache and neck pain occurred in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Full-endoscopic decompression is an effective, safe surgical technique for thoracic OLF even the cases combined with dural ossification.","Li, Wenyi; Gao, Shangju; Zhang, Long; Cao, Can; Wei, Jingchao",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598816/,218

14372,Mortality and risk factors of disease in Nepal: Trend and projections from 1990 to 2040,2020-12-03,"The complexity of the human brain poses a substantial challenge for the development of models of the CNS. Current animal models lack many essential human characteristics (in addition to raising operational challenges and ethical concerns), and conventional in vitro models, in turn, are limited in their capacity to provide information regarding many functional and systemic responses. Indeed, these challenges may underlie the notoriously low success rates of CNS drug development efforts. During the past 5 years, there has been a leap in the complexity and functionality of in vitro systems of the CNS, which have the potential to overcome many of the limitations of traditional model systems. The availability of human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell technology has further increased the translational potential of these systems. Yet, the adoption of state-of-the-art in vitro platforms within the CNS research community is limited. This may be attributable to the high costs or the immaturity of the systems. Nevertheless, the costs of fabrication have decreased, and there are tremendous ongoing efforts to improve the quality of cell differentiation. Herein, we aim to raise awareness of the capabilities and accessibility of advanced in vitro CNS technologies. We provide an overview of some of the main recent developments (since 2015) in in vitro CNS models. In particular, we focus on engineered in vitro models based on cell culture systems combined with microfluidic platforms (e.g. ‘organ-on-a-chip’ systems).

16013,TIM-3 as a Prognostic Marker and a Potential Immunotherapy Target in Human Malignant Tumors: A Meta-Analysis and Bioinformatics Validation,2021-02-22,"School achievement and failure have become growing political and social concerns due to the negative consequences of school failure for individuals and society. The inclusive educational movement, which calls for equal access, permanence, participation, and promotion of all students worldwide, poses many challenges for schools and school systems. As a public policy strategy, some countries have provided additional funds for incorporating non-teaching professionals such as school psychologists and social workers in regular K-12 schools. However, there is lack of research on the effects of these psychosocial professionals on student outcomes. This national multilevel study explored the effect of psychologists (n = 8,469) and social workers (n = 3,524) on indicators of eighth-grade (n = 147,531) and 10th-grade (n = 106,347) students' academic achievement and dropout in Chile. A multilevel secondary analysis was performed using national records of non-teaching professionals working as school staff members, achievement scores on the national SIMCE test, and dropout rates based on official records. Results showed that after controlling for individual and school variables known to affect achievement and dropout, schools with psychologists and social workers working as staff members had lower short- and long-term dropout rates. The presence and higher number of school psychologists per school was positively associated with higher math achievement, with a reduced effect in low-SES schools. Lower-SES schools with more social workers had higher math scores. These results support policies that increase funding for school psychologists and social workers, since their incorporation partly explains better school achievement and less school failure when controlling for individual and school characteristics, but emphasize the need to further explore the mechanisms through which school achievement and failure are developed with the support of psychologists and social workers in schools. We discuss the need to regulate the type of prevention and intervention strategies from a whole-school, evidence-based approach, as well as to incorporate psychosocial training modules and comprehensive guidelines as part of professional training programs and as certified requisites for working in schools.","López, Verónica; Cárdenas, Karen; González, Luis",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940187/,218
16277,Practical Application of Patient-Reported Health Status Measures for Transcatheter Valve Therapies: Insights From the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapies Registry,2021-02-18,"Background: Distraction is a functional emotion regulation strategy utilized to relieve emotional distress. Within the attention economy perspective, distraction is increasingly associated with digital technology use, performance impairments and interference with higher-order cognitive processes. Research on smartphone distraction and its association with problematic smartphone use is still scarce and there is no available psychometric assessment tool to assess this cognitive and emotive process parsimoniously. Method: The present study reports the development and evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Smartphone Distraction Scale (SDS) through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, construct validity, gender invariance, and latent mean differences. The study was conducted in a sample of British university students (N = 1,001; M = 21.10 years, SD = 2.77). Results: The 16-item SDS was best conceptualized in a four-factor model solution comprising attention impulsiveness, online vigilance, emotion regulation, and multitasking. Construct validity was established using relevant psychosocial and mental health measures, with SDS scores being moderately associated with deficient self-regulation and problematic social media use. Gender measurement invariance was achieved at the configural, metric, and scalar levels, and latent mean differences indicated that females had significantly higher means than males across all four SDS latent factors. Discussion: The SDS presents with several strengths, including its theoretical grounding, relatively short length, and sound psychometric properties. The SDS enables the assessment of distraction, which appears to be one of the pathways to problematic smartphone use facilitating overuse and overreliance on smartphones for emotion regulation processes. The assessment of distraction in relation to problematic use in vulnerable populations may facilitate interventions that could encourage metacognition and benefit these groups by allowing sustained productivity in an increasingly disrupted work and social environment.","Throuvala, Melina A.; Pontes, Halley M.; Tsaousis, Ioannis; Griffiths, Mark D.; Rennoldson, Mike; Kuss, Daria J.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982468/,218
17249,Hunger-Based Versus Conventional Oral Feeding in Moderate and Severe Acute Pancreatitis: A Randomized Controlled Trial,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Although many studies emphasize the importance of using oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) targets in the NICUs, there is a wide variability in used saturation ranges among centers. Primary aim was to draw a representative picture on how the management of oxygen monitoring is performed in the Italian NICUs. Second aim was to identify healthcare-professionals related factors associated with oxygen targeting in the preterm population. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with data collection via an electronic survey form. A questionnaire containing pre-piloted and open questions on monitoring and management of the SpO(2) was administered to neonatologists across the network of the Italian Society of Neonatology. The questions focused on: the infrastructure, specific training, healthcare professionals and patients-related factors. The results of the survey were anonymously collected, summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 378 questionnaires, 93 were correctly filled. Thirty-six different SpO(2) ranges were observed. Centers using written standard operating procedures on oxygen management and SpO(2) monitoring maintained a correct average range of SpO(2) 90–95%, avoided hyperoxia and reconsidered saturation targets in relation to comorbidities. 39.8% of responders disabled alarms during neonatal care. One center used biomarkers for complete monitoring of neonatal oxygenation status. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in SpO(2) targets for preterm infants in the Italian NICUs. Standard operating procedures and specific training for health care personnel are the main factors playing a role for the correct maintenance of the recommended oxygen targets in preterms.","Perrone, Serafina; Giordano, Maurizio; De Bernardo, Giuseppe; Lugani, Paola; Sarnacchiaro, Pasquale; Stazzoni, Gemma; Buonocore, Giuseppe; Esposito, Susanna; Tataranno, Maria Luisa",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8091159/,218
17970,Neonatal healthcare-associated infections in Brazil: systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-06-01,"INTRODUCTION: Centhaquine (Lyfaquin(®)) showed significant safety and efficacy in preclinical and clinical phase I and II studies. METHODS: A prospective, multicentric, randomized phase III study was conducted in patients with hypovolemic shock, systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90 mmHg, and blood lactate levels ≥ 2 mmol/L. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the centhaquine group (n = 71) or the control (saline) group (n = 34). Every patient received standard of care (SOC) and was followed for 28 days. The study drug (normal saline or centhaquine 0.01 mg/kg) was administered in 100 mL of normal saline infusion over 1 h. The primary objectives were to determine changes (mean through 48 h) in SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood lactate levels, and base deficit. The secondary objectives included the amount of fluids, blood products, and vasopressors administered in the first 48 h, duration of hospital stay, time in intensive care units, time on ventilator support, change in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and the proportion of patients with 28-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of patients and baseline vitals in both groups were comparable. The cause of hypovolemic shock was trauma in 29.4 and 47.1% of control group and centhaquine group patients, respectively, and gastroenteritis in 44.1 and 29.4%, respectively. Shock index (SI) and quick sequential organ failure assessment at baseline were similar in the two groups. An equal amount of fluids and blood products were administered in both groups during the first 48 h of resuscitation. A lesser amount of vasopressors was needed in the first 48 h of resuscitation in the centhaquine group. An increase in SBP from baseline was consistently higher up to 48 h (12.9% increase in area under the curve from 0 to 48 h [AUC(0–48)]) in the centhaquine group than in the control group. A significant increase in pulse pressure (48.1% increase in AUC(0–48)) in the centhaquine group compared with the control group suggests improved stroke volume due to centhaquine. The SI was significantly lower in the centhaquine group from 1 h (p = 0.032) to 4 h (p = 0.049) of resuscitation. Resuscitation with centhaquine resulted in a significantly greater number of patients with improved blood lactate (control 46.9%; centhaquine 69.3%; p = 0.03) and the base deficit (control 43.7%; centhaquine 69.8%; p = 0.01) than in the control group. ARDS and MODS improved with centhaquine, and an 8.8% absolute reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed in the centhaquine group. CONCLUSION: Centhaquine is an efficacious resuscitative agent for treating hypovolemic shock. The efficacy of centhaquine in distributive shock is being explored.

18354,Efficacy of interventions to increase physical activity for people with heart failure: a meta-analysis,2021-06-09,"The aging of the population is leading to an increase in the number of people with loss of autonomy, placing a strain on the health care system. Its prevention at early stages such as the frailty stage would allow an improvement in the quality of life of seniors while limiting health care expenses. The “Atout Age” prevention program set up by the health public authorities of Reunion Island for retired people and the new frailty assessment tools based on mathematical machine learning algorithms could improve the ambulatory care of senior citizens. At present, referral care remains hospital with comprehensive geriatric assessment and there is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of a prevention pathway for loss of autonomy in primary care. For these reasons, the 5P program “Personalized and Participative Primary Prevention Pathway” has been started in order to obtain scientific evidence. In this article, we present the objectives, design and first results, used in the 5P program up to the implementation of a clinical trial in general practice. The program is articulated in 3 phases. A first phase to evaluate the acceptability of innovative screening tools for frailty. A second pilot phase evaluates the feasibility of a large-scale ambulatory clinical trial in general practice. The last phase described in this article, is a multisite, pseudo-randomized, controlled clinical trial measuring the impact of the “Atout Age” workshops on the physical performance and the quality of life of seniors compared with their usual ambulatory follow-up.","Legrand, Florian; Eychene, Jean-Marc; Audiffren, Julien; Klein, Armelle; Labourdette, Christophe; Nicolaï, Alice; Sandron, Frédéric; Vidal, Pierre-Paul",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196042/,218

19493,A clinical prediction model to identify children at risk for revisits with serious illness to the emergency department: A prospective multicentre observational study,2021-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Chronic widespread pain (CWP) including fibromyalgia has a prevalence of up to 15% and is associated with substantial morbidity. Supporting psychosocial and behavioural self-management is increasingly important for CWP, as pharmacological interventions show limited benefit. We systematically reviewed the effectiveness of interventions applying self-management principles for CWP including fibromyalgia. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry were searched for studies reporting randomised controlled trials of interventions adhering to self-management principles for CWP including fibromyalgia. Primary outcomes included physical function and pain intensity. Where data were sufficient, meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. Studies were narratively reviewed where meta-analysis could not be conducted Evidence quality was rated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) (PROSPERO-CRD42018099212). RESULTS: Thirty-nine completed studies were included. Despite some variability in studies narratively reviewed, in studies meta-analysed self-management interventions improved physical function in the short-term, post-treatment to 3 months (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.20, 0.64) and long-term, post 6 months (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.20, 0.53), compared to no treatment/usual care controls. Studies reporting on pain narratively had greater variability, however, those studies meta-analysed showed self-management interventions reduced pain in the short-term (SMD -0.49, 95% CI -0.70, -0.27) and long-term (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.58, -0.19) compared to no treatment/usual care. There were few differences in physical function and pain when self-management interventions were compared to active interventions. The quality of the evidence was rated as low. CONCLUSION: Reviewed studies suggest self-management interventions can be effective in improving physical function and reducing pain in the short and long-term for CWP including fibromyalgia. However, the quality of evidence was low. Future research should address quality issues whilst making greater use of theory and patient involvement to understand reported variability.","Geraghty, Adam W.

In classical epidemic models, a major simplification consists in assuming that the infectious period is exponentially distributed, then implying that the chance of recovery is independent on the time since infection. Here, we first attempt to investigate the consequences of relaxing this assumption on the performances of time-variant disease control strategies by using optimal control theory. In the framework of a basic susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) model, an Erlang distribution of the infectious period is considered and optimal isolation strategies are searched for. The objective functional to be minimized takes into account the cost of the isolation efforts per time unit and the sanitary costs due to the incidence of the epidemic outbreak. Applying the Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we prove that the optimal control problem admits only bang–bang solutions with at most two switches. In particular, the optimal strategy could be postponing the starting intervention time with respect to the beginning of the outbreak. Finally, by means of numerical simulations, we show how the shape of the optimal solutions is affected by the different distributions of the infectious period, by the relative weight of the two cost components, and by the initial conditions.","Bolzoni, Luca; Della Marca, Rossella; Groppi, Maria",J Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8456197/,218

However, microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices for point-of-care diagnostics can suffer from slow analysis due to poor mixing. Here, we experimentally explore the mixing effect within a microfluidic chamber, as obtained from superparamagnetic beads exposed to an out-of-plane (vertical) rotating magnetic field. Various magnetic protocols are explored, and the level of sample homogeneity is measured by determining the mixing efficiency index. In particular, we introduce a method to induce effective mixing in a microfluidic chamber by the actuation of the same beads to perform global swarming behavior, a collective motion of a large number of individual entities often seen in nature. The microparticle swarming induces high fluid velocities in initially stagnant fluids, and it can be externally controlled. The method is pilot-tested using a point-of-care test featuring a bioluminescent assay for the detection of antibodies. The mixing by the magnetic beads leads to increased assay kinetics, which indeed reduces the time to sensor readout substantially. Magnetic microparticle swarming is expected to be beneficial for a wide variety of point-of-care devices, where fast homogeneity of reagents does play a role.","Shanko, Eriola-Sophia; Ceelen, Lennard; Wang, Ye; van de Burgt, Yoeri; den Toonder, Jaap",ACS Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8457298/,218

With the rapid progress in DNA nanotechnology, multitudinous DNA nanomaterials have been designed with different shape and size based on the classic Watson–Crick base-pairing for molecular self-assembly. Some DNA materials could functionally change cell biological behaviors, such as cell migration, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, autophagy, and anti-inflammatory effects. Some single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs) or RNAs with secondary structures via self-pairing, named aptamer, possess the ability of targeting, which are selected by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and applied for tumor targeted diagnosis and treatment. Some DNA nanomaterials with three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures and stable structures are investigated as drug carrier systems to delivery multiple antitumor medicine or gene therapeutic agents. While the functional DNA nanostructures have promoted the development of the DNA nanotechnology with innovative designs and preparation strategies, and also proved with great potential in the biological and medical use, there is still a long way to go for the eventual application of DNA materials in real life. Here in this review, we conducted a comprehensive survey of the structural development history of various DNA nanomaterials, introduced the principles of different DNA nanomaterials, summarized their biological applications in different fields, and discussed the current challenges and further directions that could help to achieve their applications in the future.","Ma, Wenjuan; Zhan, Yuxi; Zhang, Yuxin; Mao, Chenchen; Xie, Xueping; Lin, Yunfeng",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8497566/,218

The prodrome of renal angina stratifies patients by risk for severe acute kidney injury, but the predictive discrimination for fluid overload is unknown. METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of patients admitted to a tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The primary outcome was the performance of renal angina fulfillment on day of ICU admission to predict fluid overload ≥15% on Day 3. RESULTS: 77/139 children (55%) fulfilled renal angina (RA+). After adjusting for covariates, RA+ was associated with increased odds of fluid overload on Day 3 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.1, 95% CI 1.23–21.2, p = 0.025, versus RA-). RA- resulted in a 90% negative predictive value for fluid overload on Day 3. Median fluid overload was significantly higher in RA+ patients with severe acute kidney injury compared to RA+ patients without severe acute kidney injury (% fluid overload on Day 3: 8.8% vs. 0.73%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Among critically ill children, fulfillment of renal angina was associated with increased odds of fluid overload versus the absence of renal angina and a higher fluid overload among patients who developed acute kidney injury. Renal angina directed risk classification may identify patients at highest risk for fluid accumulation. Expanded study in larger populations is warranted.

We analyze the numbers of infected people who tested positive (cases) in selected eleven countries (Japan, USA, Russia, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia, Spain, South Korea, UK, and Sweden). By using the double exponential function called the Gompertz function, f(G)(x) = exp(–e(–x)), the number of cases is well described as N(t) = N(0)f(G)(γ(t – t(0))), where N(0), γ and t(0) are the final number of cases, the damping rate of the infection probability and the peak time of the daily number of new cases, dN(t)/dt, respectively. The scaled data of cases in most of the analyzed countries are found to collapse onto a common scaling function f(G)(x) with x = γ(t – t(0)) being the scaling variable in the range of f(G)(x) ± 0.05. The recently proposed indicator so-called the K value, the increasing rate of cases in one week, is also found to show universal behavior. The mechanism for the Gompertz function to appear is discussed from the time dependence of the produced pion numbers in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which is also found to be described by the Gompertz function.","Ohnishi, Akira; Namekawa, Yusuke; Fukui, Tokuro",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665699/,218

Factors were extracted by EFA (Principal Components Analysis) and confirmed by Analysis of Moment Structures. No floor-ceiling effects were observed. No significant differences of skewness and kurtosis were observed between the two Domains. All goodness of fit indices generated by CFA were found satisfactory (TLI = 0.962 > 0.95, RMSEA = .035 < 0.08, CFI = 0.943 ≥ 0.90, χ(2)(34) = 57.93, p = .000 and SRMR = 0.034 < 0.08). Cronbach’s alpha value formed at α = .764. SEND teachers’ attitudes towards Efficacy in Distance Education and Difficulties Related to Distance Education are considered as significant factors for the implementation of distance education during COVID-19 crisis. Consequently, universities, education technology corporations and policy makers should take consideration of these factors so as to train SEND teachers’ and support emergency remote-teaching scenarios.","Tzivinikou, Sotiria; Charitaki, Garyfalia; Kagkara, Dimitra",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667012/,218

51679,COVID-19-induced vascular angiopathy: CTPA signs in critically ill patients other than acute pulmonary embolism and high-lung opacity scores,2021-04-19,"Background: The literature has shown a significant association between traumatic experiences and eating psychopathology, showing a greater symptomatology in patients with trauma history. Less is known about the associations between trauma and cognitive schemas, and personality traits and the differences between childhood and adulthood trauma experiences. Thus, this paper aims to assess the clinical and psychological characteristics of eating disorder (ED) patients, looking for differences between patients without a history of trauma and patients with trauma experiences, as well as at possible differences between exposure in childhood, adulthood, or repeated events. Another aim of the paper is to evaluate the possible mediation role of cognitive schemas and personality traits in the relationship between early trauma and eating psychopathology. Methods: From January to November 2020, 115 consecutive inpatients admitted for a specific multidisciplinary ED treatment in a dedicated Unit were evaluated for trauma, differentiating between trauma occurring in childhood and adulthood. The subjects were evaluated for early maladaptive schemas (EMS), personality traits, trauma symptomatology, quality of life, and specific psychopathologies linked to EDs. Mediation analyses between childhood and adulthood trauma and eating psychopathology were performed, with EMS and personality traits as mediators. Results: Patients with a history of trauma showed higher physical and psychological symptomatology scores, with a more impaired clinical profile in patients with both childhood and adulthood trauma exposure. The mediation analysis showed a specific mediator role for the “disconnection and rejection (DR)” EMS factor in the relationship between childhood trauma (cT) and eating psychopathology. Conclusion: Trauma experiences are associated with more severe clinical symptomatology in EDs and may need a specific assessment in patients with failed outpatient standard treatments. Specific cognitive schemas linked to DR domain should be evaluated in treatments for ED patients with history of trauma due to the mediation role between trauma and eating psychopathology. The need for outcome studies about treatment approaches for ED patients with history of trauma is discussed.","Meneguzzo, Paolo; Cazzola, Chiara; Castegnaro, Roberta; Buscaglia, Francesca; Bucci, Enrica; Pillan, Anna; Garolla, Alice; Bonello, Elisa; Todisco, Patrizia",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044897/,218

Massive research efforts are underway globally to develop COVID-19 vaccines. For the newly developed vaccines, given that safety beyond the trial population and the worldwide accessibility remains to be determined, there is also an opportunity to explore repurposing the pre-existing safe vaccines like the oral polio vaccine (OPV) leveraging their potential to provide cross-protection. The plausible mechanisms by which OPV might provide partial cross-immunity against SARS-CoV-2 include inhibition of PVR-TIGITCD226 axis and stimulation of trained innate immunity. Inhibition of PVR-TIGIT-CD226 axis by OPV unleashes the immunosuppressive effects of TIGIT, thus priming the immune system against the invading pathogen. Stimulation of trained innate immunity by OPV due to metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications provides partial protection. This paper reviews the literature about live-attenuated OPV as a potential source of protection against COVID-19 and highlights the need for randomized, multicentric trials in India.","Rao US, Vishal; Rao, Ujjwal; Kunigal, Sateesh S.; Kannan, Swetha; Kumar, Jitendra; Gulia, Ashish",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219020/,218

However, most use the American and European Societies’ standard (ATS/ERS) which stops sessions once a repeatability threshold is met which may not accurately represent intra-session variability. Our goal was to repeat trials beyond the repeatability threshold and evaluate alternative reporting methods. 130 adults performed spirometry across two visits. Spirometry indices were reported using the ATS/ERS standard and four alternatives. 78 participants (60%) had valid data for all methods and visits. Intra-session coefficients of variation were low (FEV(1): 3.1–3.7%; FVC: 2.3–2.8%). Our four alternative methods yielded FEV(1) and FVC values ≤ 0.08 L different from ATS/ERS standard, which is not clinically meaningful. Intraclass correlation coefficients were ≥ 0.97 indicating consistency across repeated measures. The smallest real differences ranged from FEV(1): 0.20–0.27 L and FVC: 0.18–0.24 L indicating consistency and low measurement error. Overall, all methods for reporting FEV(1) and FVC demonstrated similar measurement error, precision, and stability within- and between-visits. These results suggest that once ATS/ERS repeatability is achieved, which approach is used for reporting spirometric variables may be of low clinical significance in a healthy population.","Therkorn, Jennifer H.; Toto, Daniella R.; Falvo, Michael J.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8298454/,218

This may hinder low developed regions in a country from achieving development in a socioeconomic perspective, such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of eradicating poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2). We use observed data (1991–2010) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)eq) emissions and a sub-national human development index (MicroHDI, range [0, 1]) for Brazilian microregions to design a framework where regional mitigation burdens are proportional to the MicroHDI, without compromising national mitigation pledges. According to our results, the less developed Brazilian regions have not been basing their development in emission-intensive activities; instead, the most developed regions have. Between 2011 and 2050, Brazilian cumulative emissions from the sectors most correlated with MicroHDI are expected to be 325 Gt CO(2)eq, of which only 50 Gt are associated with regions of MicroHDI < 0.8. Assuming a national GHG mitigation target of 56.5% in 2050 over 2010 (consistent with limiting global warming to 2 ºC), Brazil would emit 190 Gt CO(2)eq instead of 325 Gt and the 135 Gt reduction is only accounted for by regions after reaching MicroHDI ≥ 0.8. Allocating environmental restrictions to the high-developed regions leaves ground for the least developed ones to pursue development with fewer restrictions. Our heterogeneous framework represents a fairer allocation of mitigation burdens which could be implemented under the concepts of green economy. This work could be an international reference for addressing both environmental and socioeconomic development in developing countries at sub-national level as emphasized by the SDGs.

Current research suggests that IDD is a complex cell-mediated process. Inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mechanical load, telomere shortening, DNA damage, and nutrient deprivation contribute to intervertebral disc cell senescence and changes in matrix metabolism, ultimately causing IDD. Natural products are widespread, structurally diverse, afford unique advantages, and exhibit great potential in terms of IDD treatment. In recent years, increasing numbers of natural ingredients have been shown to inhibit the degeneration of nucleus pulposus cells through various modes of action. Here, we review the pharmacological effects of natural products on nucleus pulposus cells and the mechanisms involved. An improved understanding of how natural products target signalling pathways will aid the development of anti-IDD drugs.

However, its feasibility in low- and middle-income nations such as India remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of administering a smartphone-based telerehabilitation program for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in India. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was administered to stakeholders of the telerehabilitation program: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, health care professionals including pulmonary care physicians, rehabilitation nurses and physiotherapists. The survey sought to ascertain the causes, barriers, and facilitators associated with the implementation of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, as well as strategies for practice improvement. RESULTS: While 71% (n = 37/52) of the 52 healthcare professionals surveyed were aware of smartphone-based telerehabilitation, implementation was found to be extremely low (n = 4/37; 10%). The majority of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 21/30; 70%) agreed to accept smartphone-based telerehabilitation as one of their treatment options. In India, challenges to efficient telerehabilitation implementation included a lack of infrastructure, perceived time consumption, a lack of expertise and training, organizational support, and perceived inefficacy. CONCLUSION: While knowledge of smartphone-based telerehabilitation is high among healthcare professionals and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, implementation of this novel intervention measure has been limited due to perceived constraints associated with smartphone-based telerehabilitation. Adapting national and organizational policies to support smartphone-based telerehabilitation services is critical during this decade of social isolation.","Bairapareddy, Kalyana Chakravarthy; Alaparthi, Gopala Krishna; Jitendra, Romika Sawant; Prathiksha; Rao, Priyanka Prasad; Shetty, Vanitha; Chandrasekaran, Baskaran",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403547/,218

EMIRS is a FTIR spectrometer covering the range from 6.0-100+ μm (1666-100 cm(−1)) with a spectral sampling as high as 5 cm(−1) and a 5.4-mrad IFOV and a 32.5×32.5 mrad FOV. The EMIRS optical path includes a flat 45° pointing mirror to enable one degree of freedom and has a +/- 60° clear aperture around the nadir position which is fed to a 17.78-cm diameter Cassegrain telescope. The collected light is then fed to a flat-plate based Michelson moving mirror mounted on a dual linear voice-coil motor assembly. An array of deuterated L-alanine doped triglycine sulfate (DLaTGS) pyroelectric detectors are used to sample the interferogram every 2 or 4 seconds (depending on the spectral sampling selected). A single 0.846 μm laser diode is used in a metrology interferometer to provide interferometer positional control, sampled at 40 kHz (controlled at 5 kHz) and infrared signal sampled at 625 Hz. The EMIRS beamsplitter is a 60-mm diameter, 1-mm thick 1-arcsecond wedged chemical vapor deposited diamond with an antireflection microstructure to minimize first surface reflection. EMIRS relies on an instrumented internal v-groove blackbody target for a full-aperture radiometric calibration. The radiometric precision of a single spectrum (in 5 cm(−1) mode) is <3.0×10(−8) W cm(−2) sr(−1)/cm(−1) between 300 and 1350 cm(−1) over instrument operational temperatures (<∼0.5 K NE[Formula: see text] T @ 250 K). The absolute integrated radiance error is < 2% for scene temperatures ranging from 200-340 K. The overall EMIRS envelope size is 52.9×37.5×34.6 cm and the mass is 14.72 kg including the interface adapter plate. The average operational power consumption is 22.2 W, and the standby power consumption is 18.6 W with a 5.7 W thermostatically limited, always-on operational heater. EMIRS was developed by Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University in collaboration with the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre with Arizona Space Technologies developing the electronics.

We sought to assess if these modalities lead to increased aerosol dispersal compared to the use of non-humidified low-flow nasal cannula oxygen treatment (LFNC). METHODS: Aerosol dispersal from 20 healthy volunteers using HFNC, LFNC and NIV oxygen treatment was measured in a controlled chamber. We investigated effects related to coughing and using a surgical facemask in combination with the oxygen delivering modalities. An aerodynamic particle sizer measured aerosol particles (APS3321, 0.3–20 µm) directly in front of the subjects, while a mesh of smaller particle sensors (SPS30, 0.3–10 µm) was distributed in the test chamber. RESULTS: Non-productive coughing led to significant increases in particle dispersal close to the face when using LFNC and HFNC but not when using NIV. HFNC or NIV did not lead to a statistically significant increase in aerosol dispersal compared to LFNC. With non-productive cough in a room without air changes, there was a significant drop in particle levels between 100 cm and 180 cm from the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that using HFNC and NIV does not lead to increased aerosol dispersal compared to low-flow oxygen treatment, except in rare cases. For a subject with non-productive cough, NIV with double-limb circuit and non-vented mask may be a favourable choice to reduce the risk for aerosol spread.","Strand-Amundsen, Runar; Tronstad, Christian; Elvebakk, Ole; Martinsen, Tormod; Dybwad, Marius; Lingaas, Egil; Tønnessen, Tor Inge",ERJ Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8474485/,218

59865,Atelectasis is inversely proportional to transpulmonary pressure during weaning from ventilator support in a large animal model.,2018,"BACKGROUND The frequency of gastric tube cancers has increased with advances in surgical techniques and improvement of survival rates in patients with esophageal cancer. However, a standard surgical treatment has not yet been established. Total resection of the gastric tube with lymphadenectomy has been considered a radical treatment, while repeat surgery with both laparotomy and thoracotomy has been associated with severe complications, including anastomotic leakage, recurrent nerve paralysis, bronchotracheal injury, and damage to other organs. CASE PRESENTATION We present a successful case of a gastric tube cancer that was treated with surgical resection in combination with sentinel node biopsy. The tumor was diagnosed as a type 0-IIc lesion with ulceration, and was located proximal to the pyloric ring. Endoscopic submucosal dissection was not indicated because the primary lesion was submucosally invasive, and undifferentiated. By the dye-guided method, sentinel nodes were detected along the right gastroepiploic artery and vein. Intraoperative pathological examination revealed no metastasis of the sentinel nodes. Resection of the distal gastric tube was safely performed with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction, preserving the right gastroepiploic artery and vein and the perfusion of the proximal gastric tube. CONCLUSION We suggest distal resection of the gastric tube with sentinel node biopsy as a novel surgical method for a cT1N0 gastric tube cancer located in the abdomen.","Yagi, Yasumichi; Ii, Toru; Tanaka, Shigehiro; Oguri, Hikaru",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-014-0421-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25627444/,218

METHODS Between January 2007 and December 2014, 40 patients with 42 PICA aneurysms were treated with endovascular embolization at our institution. Twenty-eight patients had 29 saccular aneurysms and 12 patients had 13 fusiform/dissecting aneurysms. The endovascular modalities were: (1) selective occlusion of the aneurysm with or without stent assistance (n=19); (2) occlusion of the aneurysm and the parent artery (n=22); and (3) occlusion of the aneurysm including the vertebral artery and PICA origin (n=1). Specifically, selective embolization was performed in 93.3% of aneurysms (14/15) proximal to the telovelotonsillary segment. RESULTS Immediate angiographic results included 31 complete occlusions (74%), 3 nearly complete occlusions (7%), and 8 incomplete occlusions (19%). Mean follow-up of 20 months in 31 aneurysms showed 27 stable results, 3 further thromoboses, and 1 recurrence. Final results included 27 complete occlusions (87.1%) and 4 incomplete occlusions (12.9%). There were 5 overall procedural-related complications (12.5%), including 1 infarction (2.5%) and 4 intraprocedural ruptures (10.0%).

We examined the independent association between D-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN Multicenter cohort study. SETTING ICUs at 68 hospitals across the United States. PATIENTS Critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICUs between March 4, 2020, and May 25, 2020, with a measured D-dimer concentration on ICU day 1 or 2. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary exposure was the highest normalized D-dimer level (assessed in four categories: < 2×, 2-3.9×, 4-7.9×, and ≥ 8× the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1 or 2. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among 3,418 patients (63.1% male; median age 62 yr [interquartile range, 52-71 yr]), 3,352 (93.6%) had a D-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal. A total of 1,180 patients (34.5%) died within 28 days. Patients in the highest compared with lowest D-dimer category had a 3.11-fold higher odds of death (95% CI, 2.56-3.77) in univariate analyses, decreasing to a 1.81-fold increased odds of death (95% CI, 1.43-2.28) after multivariable adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and illness severity. Further adjustment for therapeutic anticoagulation did not meaningfully attenuate this relationship (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.36-2.19).

61529,Multiple Breath Washout for Diagnosing Asthma and Persistent Wheeze in Young Children.,2019,"BACKGROUND Most research evaluating telehealth psychiatric treatment has been conducted in outpatient settings. There is a great lack of research assessing the efficacy of telehealth treatment in more acute, intensive treatment settings such as a partial hospital. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, much of behavioral health treatment has transitioned to a virtual format. In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services (MIDAS) project, we examined the effectiveness of our partial hospital program (PHP). METHOD The sample included 207 patients who were treated virtually from May 2020 to September 2020 and a comparison group of 207 patients who were treated in the in-person partial program a year earlier. Patients completed self-administered measures of patient satisfaction, symptoms, coping ability, functioning, and general well-being. RESULTS For both the in-person and telehealth methods of delivering partial hospital level of care, patients were highly satisfied with treatment and reported a significant reduction in symptoms and suicidality from admission to discharge. On the modified Remission from Depression Questionnaire, the primary outcome measure, both groups reported a significant (P < .01) improvement in functioning, coping ability, positive mental health, and general well-being. A large effect size of treatment (Cohen d > 0.8) was found in both treatment groups. The only significant difference in outcome between the patients treated in the different formats was a greater length of stay (mean ± SD of 13.5 ± 8.1 vs 8.5 ± 5.0 days, t = 7.61, P < .001) and greater likelihood of staying in treatment until completion (72.9% vs 62.3%, χ2 = 5.34, P < .05) in the virtually treated patients. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth partial hospital treatment was as effective as in-person treatment in terms of patient satisfaction, symptom reduction, suicidal ideation reduction, and improved functioning and well-being. The treatment completion rate was higher in the telehealth cohort, and several patients who were treated virtually commented that they never would have presented for in-person treatment even if there was no pandemic. Telehealth PHPs should be considered a viable treatment option even after the pandemic has resolved.","Zimmerman, Mark; Terrill, Douglas; D'Avanzato, Catherine; Tirpak, Julianne Wilner",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.20m13815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989463/,218
61806,Cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring in pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation patients in the emergency settings: A small descriptive study.,2017,"Absorption is a widely used technique for a range of different applications. It has lower sensitivity than many other techniques such as fluorescence which has 100 to 1000 times higher sensitivity than absorption. Optical cavity approaches have been developed where the light passes back and forth, within the sample, between two high reflectivity mirrors to increase the pathlength and sensitivity. These approaches have not yet, however, been widely used for analytical applications and for point-of-care diagnostics. Here we show a portable cavity enhanced absorption (CEA) spectrometer and a low cost point-of-care (POC) reader with CEA detection with mechanical elements fabricated using 3D printing. The CEA spectrometer can be used in both single pass and multi-pass cavity enhanced mode to provide measurements in the visible region that are very sensitive and over a wide dynamic range. The CEA mode was shown for Rhodamine B dye to increase the pathlength 57.8 fold over single pass measurements and an LOD of 7.1 × 10-11 M. The cost of the CEA POC reader was reduced by use of narrow band LEDs, photodiodes and removal of fibre optic coupling and with a 14 fold increase in the pathlength over conventional single pass microplate readers. The CEA POC reader was demonstrated for immunoassay of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6), towards a three biomarker panel to aid the diagnosis of sepsis. The CEA POC reader can be integrated with wireless connectivity for cloud based data sharing. We show here the potential for the wider use of optical cavity approaches where there is a need for sensitive absorption measurements and also for low cost point-of-care diagnostics.","Teggert, Andrew; Datta, Harish; McIntosh, Stephen; Warden, Barry; Bateson, Simon; Abugchem, Fathi; Ali, Zulfiqur",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an01852j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140076/,218

The effect of the procedure is based on restriction, malabsorption and changes in hormonal axis. Ghrelin is an important appetite hormone which is produced mainly in the gastric fundus. By adding a resection of the gastric fundus, we hypothesized that excessive weight loss will be more prominent and the satiety feelings less pronounced compared to standard RYGB. A total of 73 patients with standard very very long limb (VVLL) RYGB (group A) were compared with 44 patients with VVLL RYGB with resection of the fundus (group B). Outcome measures were excessive weight loss (EWL), body mass index (BMI), early postoperative morbidity, change of co-morbidities, and appetite reduction as assessed by an appetite questionnaire over a postoperative period of 24 months. Groups were comparable in basic preoperative descriptions. Additional fundus resection did not influence EWL (group A 66.1 % vs. group B 70.6 %, p = 0.383) or BMI (group A 29 kg/m(2) vs. group B 27 kg/m(2), p = 0.199). No significant difference in morbidity or change of co-morbidities occurred. The appetite and satiety questionnaire showed no difference between group A and group B, respectively. Adding a resection of the gastric fundus in RYGB did not alter the clinical results, i.e., increased excessive weight loss, decrease of appetite, or increase of satiety. The value of removing a part of the ghrelin-producing cells might be overestimated.","Delko, T; Köstler, T; Peev, M; Oertli, D; Zingg, U",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0805-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23135881/,218

The aim of this review was to identify three-dimensional printing applications related to critical care practice. A scoping review of the literature was conducted via a systematic search of three databases. A priori specified themes included airway management, procedural support, and simulation and medical education. The search identified 1544 articles, of which 65 were included. Ranging across many applications, most were published since 2016 in non - critical care discipline-specific journals. Most studies related to the application of three-dimensional printed models of simulation and reported good fidelity; however, several studies reported that the models poorly represented human tissue characteristics. Randomised controlled trials found some models were equivalent to commercial airway-related skills trainers. Several studies relating to the use of three-dimensional printing model simulations for spinal and neuraxial procedures reported a high degree of realism, including ultrasonography applications three-dimensional printing technologies. This scoping review identified several novel applications for three-dimensional printing in critical care medicine. Three-dimensional printing technologies have been under-utilised in critical care and provide opportunities for future research.","Abeysekera, Natasha; Whitmore, Kirsty A; Abeysekera, Ashvini; Pang, George; Laupland, Kevin B",Anaesthesia and intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1177/0310057x20976655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789504/,218

METHODS Thirty-five high surgical risk patients (23 men; mean age 68.6 years, range 62-90) with BTAA and LICA stenosis underwent carotid artery stenting (CAS). Left common carotid artery (LCCA) engagement was achieved by means of different techniques according to the configuration of the BTAA, arch type (I, II, or III), and angle between the innominate artery and the LCCA. The clinical, anatomical, and procedural data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database and analyzed retrospectively to identify technical modifications required during the procedure compared with planning. RESULTS The technical success rate was 100%. Transfemoral access was used in 21 (60%) cases. In this group, the soft engagement technique with hockey stick (HS) guiding catheter and buddy wire in the external carotid artery (ECA) was used in 13 (62%) cases, a simple telescopic technique with 6-F armed introducer or 7-F 40° guiding catheter in 5 (24%) cases, and a sequential technique with a MOMA proximal protection system in the remaining 3 (14%) cases. Among the 14 (40%) right brachial access cases, the telescopic technique with 6-F armed introducer was used in 13 cases. The remaining case was the only one in which the planned technique was changed (from the telescopic to sequential technique with ECA wire exchange). There were no intraprocedural or 30-day neurological events. CONCLUSION An appropriate tailored interventional strategy, planned by means of preprocedural recognition of bovine arch anatomy, is associated with satisfactory safety and good success.","Ventoruzzo, Giorgio; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Maioli, Filippo; Liistro, Francesco; Bolognese, Leonardo; Bellandi, Guido",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/11-3730mr.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22788883/,218

The purpose of this study was to compare the anxiety and depression levels of the children of health workers following the declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of Covid-19 as a global pandemic with those of age-matched children of non-health worker parents. This prospective, case-controlled, cross-sectional study was performed between July and September 2020. One hundred forty-six participants were enrolled, 71 children of health worker parents in the study group, and 75 age- and sex-matched children of non-health worker parents in the control group. While no significant difference was determined between the children of health workers and non-health workers in terms of CDI scores, total STAI-C scores were higher among children of health workers (70.36 ± 12.43) than in children of non-health worker parents (65.62 ± 11.83) (p = .02). This study shows that since their parents work in intensive and high-risk environments during the Covid-19 pandemic, the children of health workers may be at greater psychological risk than other children.","Almis, Habip; Han Almis, Behice; Bucak, Ibrahim Hakan",Clinical child psychology and psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211016527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098758/,218

CRISPR-based engineering has the potential to accelerate drug discovery, to support the reduction of high attrition rate in drug development and to enhance development of cell and gene-based therapies. AREAS COVERED How CRISPR technology is transforming drug discovery is discussed in this review. From target identification to target validation in both in vitro and in vivo models, CRISPR technology is positively impacting the early stages of drug development by providing a straightforward way to genome engineering. This property also attracted attention for CRISPR application in the cell and gene therapy area. EXPERT OPINION CRISPR technology is rapidly becoming the preferred tool for genome engineering and nowadays it is hard to imagine the drug discovery pipeline without this technology. With the years to come, CRISPR technology will undoubtedly be further refined and will flourish into a mature technology that will play a key role in supporting genome engineering requirements in the drug discovery pipeline as well as in cell and gene therapy development.","Grand Moursel, Laure; Visser, Mijke; Servant, Geraldine; Durmus, Selvi; Zuurmond, Anne-Marie",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2021.1850687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322954/,218

In this context, participants define their bodywork practices as individual activities that answer health and wellbeing needs, but notably discuss bodywork in terms of their everyday social experience. Along with other bodywork activities, yoga emerges as a shared social practice that links participants to their partners, children, and other intimates, facilitating a sense of togetherness by allowing time and space for autonomy. By giving atmospheric and sensory attention to the ethnographic data, the paper further reveals how domestic intimacy is cultivated via the generation of bodily heat and positive energies and that yoga may tacitly facilitate such atmospheres. In this way, yoga can help households meet an American need for self-development and autonomy while still facilitating a far more enduring human need for intimate connection. Ultimately yoga is characterized as a pragmatic bodywork practice that blends self-development and social intimacy through shared energetic encounters.","Bird, Tess",Anthropology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2021.1949960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325584/,218
66166,Rheolytic thrombectomy with local thrombolysis in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and acute pulmonary embolism.,2021-02-11,"OBJECTIVES The most common complication after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is peristomal wound infection (up to 40% without antibiotic prophylaxis). Single-dose parenteral prophylactic antibiotics as advised by current guidelines decrease the infection rate to 9-15%. We assume a prolonged effect of local antibiotic treatment with antibacterial gauzes. This study is the first to describe the effect of antibacterial gauzes in preventing infections in PEG without the use of antibiotics. METHODS A retrospective data analysis was carried out of all patients with PEG insertion between January 2009 and October 2014 in the Catharina Hospital Eindhoven. Data include placement and the period of the first 2 weeks after PEG placement, and long-term follow-up. All patients received a locally applied antibacterial gauze polyhexamethylene biguanide immediately following PEG insertion for 3 days. No other antibiotics were administered. The main outcomes were wound infection, peritonitis, and necrotizing fasciitis; secondary outcomes included other complications. RESULTS A total of 331 patients with only antibacterial gauzes were analyzed. The total number of infections 2 weeks after PEG insertion was 9.4%, including 8.2% minor and 1.2% major infections (peritonitis). No wound infection-related mortality or bacterial resistance was found. Costs are five times lower than antibiotics, and gauzes are more practical and patient friendly for use. CONCLUSION Retrospectively, antibacterial gauzes are at least comparable with literature data on parenteral antibiotics in preventing peristomal wound infection after PEG placement, with an infection rate of 9.4%. Rates of other complications found in this study were comparable with current literature data.","Strijbos, Denise; Schoon, Erik J; Curvers, Wouter; Friederich, Pieter; Flink, Hajo J; Stronkhorst, Arnold; Gilissen, Lennard P L",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/meg.0000000000000561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26735159/,218

METHODS Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSIONS The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","Chang, Jinghui; Yuan, Yuxin; Wang, Dong",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376528/,218

68087,ACGME's Early Adaptation to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Principles and Lessons Learned.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate if the prophylactic application of BiPAP previous to lung resection and 17 hours postoperatively improves respiratory function. In order to do this, we studied the results of arterial blood gases and portable spirometry in the immediate postoperative period and at the first and third postoperative day. Secondary objectives included evaluating whether this same pattern decreases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) and hospital stay. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a prospective, randomized clinical study. Between January 2012 and June 2013, 50 patients who had undergone lung resection with posterolateral thoracotomy were assigned to one of two groups by a random number generator according to whether or not they would receive prophylactic BiPAP pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS The results of the gasometric and spirometric values were similar in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). There was not a decrease in the incidence of PPC in the group that received prophylactic BiPAP. Likewise, postoperative stay was similar in both groups. The BiPAP group was 6.60 ± 4 days and the non BiPAP group was 6.84 ± 3.94 days (p = 0.63). CONCLUSIONS One drawback of this work was the limited number of hours that BiPAP was employed, and when compared to other studies, the application of low-pressure support. We did not find any significant differences between using prophylactic BiPAP or not, suggesting that such treatment should not be performed indiscriminately. More investigations are needed with a larger number of patients in order to better evaluate the possible benefits of using prophylactic BiPAP in thoracic surgery.","Guerra Hernández, E; Rodríguez Pérez, A; Freixinet Gilard, J; Martín Álamo, M N; Escudero Socorro, M; Rodríguez Suárez, P; Esquinas, A M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_201801_14117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29364487/,218

For this purpose, a classification system has been established to categorize studies - and hence therapy options - in respect of associated evidence according to defined criteria. The Eustachian tube connects the nasopharynx with the middle ear cavity. Its key function is to ensure middle ear ventilation. Compromised ventilation results in inflammatory middle ear disorders. Numerous evidence-based therapy options are available for the treatment of impaired middle ear ventilation and otitis media, the main therapeutic approach being antibiotic treatment. More recent procedures such as balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube have also shown initial success but must undergo further evaluation with regard to evidence. There is, as yet, no evidence for some of the other long-established procedures. Owing to the multitude of variables, the classification of evidence levels for various treatment approaches calls for highly diversified assessment. Numerous evidence-based studies are therefore necessary in order to evaluate the evidence pertaining to existing and future therapy solutions for impaired middle ear ventilation and otitis media. If this need is addressed, a wealth of implications can be expected for therapeutic approaches in the years to come.","Teschner, Magnus","GMS current topics in otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery",https://doi.org/10.3205/cto000132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28025605/,218

Chemiluminescent immunoassay, commonly used for cortisol measurement is prone to clinically meaningful inter-assay variability in some analysers.

72962,Validating the Martini Staging System for Rectourethral Fistula: A Meta-Analysis of Postoperative Outcomes.,2020-09-08,"The relationship between right ventricular (RV) function and cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity and cerebral oxygenation was assessed in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Echocardiographic, transcranial Doppler, and hemodynamic data from 37 neonates with moderate-severe HIE + TH were reviewed. Twenty healthy newborns served as controls. Cardiac dysfunction in HIE + TH was characterized by a predominant RV dysfunction, with concomitantly reduced CBF velocity. A significant correlation was found between CBF velocity and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV output (RVO), and stroke volume (SVRV), as well as with left ventricular output and stroke volume. Brain oxygenation (rSO2) correlated significantly with RVO, SVRV, TAPSE, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, whereas cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOEc) correlated with RVO, SVRV, RV myocardial performance index, and superior vena cava flow. CBF velocity and cerebral NIRS correlations were stronger with parameters of right ventricular performance.Conclusion: CBF velocity and brain oxygenation correlate predominantly with RV function in HIE + TH. This suggests a preferential contribution of RV performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.What is Known:• Neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy frequently exhibit alterations of cardiac function and cerebral blood flow.• These are considered organ-specific consequences of perinatal asphyxia.What is New:• We show that cerebral blood flow velocity and brain oxygenation are correlated predominantly with right ventricular function during therapeutic hypothermia.• This suggests a potential direct contribution of right ventricular performance to cerebral hemodynamics in this context.","Rodriguez, Maria Jose; Corredera, Araceli; Martinez-Orgado, Jose; Arruza, Luis",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03657-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367328/,218

74415,Risk mitigation for travelers - managing endemic and emerging threats.,2019,"CONTEXT Millennials have had a profound impact on society, the economy, and the US workforce. This study used generational definitions published by the Pew Research Center. Millennials includes respondents who reported an age between 21 and 36 years (born in 1981-1996) at the time the 2017 Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS) was administered. Generation X includes respondents who reported an age between 37 and 52 years (born in 1965-1980), and the baby boom generation (baby boomers) includes respondents between 53 and 71 years of age (born in 1946-1964). Public sector agencies, including governmental public health, are increasingly interested in figuring out how to attract and retain millennials. As the governmental public health workforce anticipates upcoming retirements, knowledge about the motivations and organizational characteristics that appeal to millennials is crucial to understanding the millennial workforce and workplace dynamics for decades to come. In 2017, millennials made up 22% of the governmental public health workforce, Generation X 40%, and baby boomers 37%. OBJECTIVE This study examined opinions, expectations, and important workplace environment factors of millennials working in governmental public health compared with other generations. DESIGN We performed bivariate analyses and fit a logistic regression model to evaluate the association of generation with responses to a set of satisfaction and engagement PH WINS survey questions. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Data were drawn from the 2017 PH WINS of governmental health department employees, including state health agency and local health department staff. PH WINS excludes local health departments with fewer than 25 staff members or serving fewer than 25 000 people. PH WINS included responses from 47 604 staff members, which reflected a 48% overall response rate. RESULTS The generations that were examined (millennials, Generation X, and baby boomers) were similarly satisfied with their jobs, organizations, and pay security, and millennials intended to leave their jobs for similar reasons as other generations. Millennials reported more strongly than other generations that their supervisors treated them with respect, that they had sufficient training to utilize technology, that their training needs are assessed, and that creativity and innovation were rewarded. They, however, reported less strongly that they were completely involved in their work and determined to give their best every day. CONCLUSIONS Millennials in governmental public health agencies (excluding local health departments with <25 staff members or serving <25 000 people) may not be as different from other generations as previously thought. Governmental public health agencies should focus on highlighting workplace environment factors rated highly by millennials and on showcasing how careers in governmental public health could be attractive career options for millennials.","Locke, Rachel; Gambatese, Melissa; Sellers, Katie; Corcoran, Elizabeth; Castrucci, Brian C",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890255/,218

The breaking point in the dominance is approximately 12 months--rhinovirus dominates in the older children. Predisposition may markedly increase the prevalence of HRV bronchiolitis. Especially, low interferon responses and atopy-related factors have been associated with HRV bronchiolitis. The former has been considered as a sign of poor antiviral defense, and the latter could be associated with atopic airway inflammation in wheezing children. Although recurrent wheezing is common after both RSV and HRV bronchiolitis, HRV bronchiolitis carries a markedly higher risk of persistent wheezing until 6 years of age and for childhood asthma. This association has been independent from atopy at 7.2 (median) years of age. The increased risk of asthma in adulthood after non-RSV bronchiolitis vs. RSV bronchiolitis in infancy (at the time when PCR was not available for HRV diagnosis) offers indirect evidence for the association between HRV bronchiolitis and chronic asthma.","Jartti, Tuomas; Korppi, Matti",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2011.01170.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21535176/,218

Given the important role of CSCs (Cancer Stem Cells) in cancer, which is a trendy hypothesis, it is worth investigating the effects of pristimerin on CSCs as well as on the other malignant cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) of breast cancer. The anti-growth activity of pristimerin against MCF-7 and MCF-7s (cancer stem cell enriched population) cells was investigated by real time viability monitorization (xCELLigence System®) and ATP assay, respectively. Mode of cell death was evaluated using electron and fluorescence microscopies, western blotting (autophagy, apoptosis and ER-stress related markers) and flow cytometry (annexin-V staining, caspase 3/7 activity, BCL-2 and PI3K expressions). Pristimerin showed an anti-growth effect on cancer cells and cancer stem cells with IC50 values ranging at 0.38-1.75μM. It inhibited sphere formation at relatively lower doses (<1.56μM). Apoptosis was induced in MCF-7 and MCF-7s cells. In addition, extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation was observed, implying an incompleted autophagy as evidenced by the increase of autophagy-related proteins (p62 and LC3-II) with an unfolded protein response (UPR). Pristimerin inhibited the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231-originated xenografts in NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice. In mice, apoptosis was further confirmed by cleavage of PARP, activation of caspase 3 and/or 7 and TUNEL staining. Taken together, pristimerin shows cytotoxic activity on breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. It seems to represent a robust promising agent for the treatment of breast cancer. Pristimerin's itself or synthetic novel derivatives should be taken into consideration for novel potent anticancer agent(s).","Cevatemre, Buse; Erkısa, Merve; Aztopal, Nazlihan; Karakas, Didem; Alper, Pınar; Tsimplouli, Chrisiida; Sereti, Evangelia; Dimas, Konstantinos; Armutak, Elif I Ikitimur; Gurevin, Ebru Gurel; Uvez, Ayca; Mori, Mattia; Berardozzi, Simone; Ingallina, Cinzia; D'Acquarica, Ilaria; Botta, Bruno; Ozpolat, Bulent; Ulukaya, Engin",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2017.11.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29197639/,218

A total of 215 frozen archived pediatric respiratory specimens previously characterized as either negative or positive for one or more pathogens by real-time PCR were examined using the FilmArray RP system. Overall agreement between the FilmArray RP and corresponding real-time PCR assays for shared analytes was 98.6% (kappa = 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.89 to 0.94]). The combined positive percent agreement was 89.4% (95% CI, 85.4 to 92.6); the negative percent agreement was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.2 to 99.8). The mean real-time PCR threshold cycle (C(T)) value for specimens with discordant results was 36.46 ± 4.54. Detection of coinfections and correct identification of influenza A virus subtypes were comparable to those of real-time PCR when using the FilmArray RP. The greatest comparative difference in sensitivity was observed for adenovirus; only 11 of 24 (45.8%; 95% CI, 27.9 to 64.9) clinical specimens positive for adenovirus by real-time PCR were also positive by the FilmArray RP. In addition, upon testing 20 characterized adenovirus serotypes prepared at high and low viral loads, the FilmArray RP did not detect serotypes 6 and 41 at either level and failed to detect serotypes 2, 20, 35, and 37 when viral loads were low. The FilmArray RP system is rapid and extremely user-friendly, with results available in just over 1 h with almost no labor involved. Its low throughput is a significant drawback for laboratories receiving large numbers of specimens, as only a single sample can be processed at a time with one instrument.","Pierce, Virginia M; Elkan, Michael; Leet, Marilyn; McGowan, Karin L; Hodinka, Richard L",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.05996-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22116144/,218
76528,Serum zinc levels and efficacy of zinc treatment in acne vulgaris: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-08-29,"RNA binding protein motif 3 (RBM3) is an RNA-binding and cold shock protein that protects myoblasts and promotes skeletal muscle hypertrophy by enhancing mRNA stability and translation. Muscle size is decreased during aging; however, it is typically delayed in models of extended lifespan such as the long-lived Ames Dwarf (df/df) mice and calorie restricted (CR) animals compared to age-match controls. In light of the protective and anabolic effects of RBM3 in muscle, we hypothesized that RBM3 expression is higher in long-lived animal models. Young and old df/df mice, and adult and old UM-HET3 CR mice were used to test this hypothesis. Gastrocnemius muscles were harvested and protein was isolated for RBM3 protein measurements. CR induced a 1.7 and 1.3-fold elevation in RBM3 protein abundance compared to adult and old male mice fed ad libitum (AL) diets, respectively; this effect was shared between males and females. Ames dwarfism induced a 4.6 and 2.7-fold elevation in RBM3 protein abundance in young and old df/df mice compared to normal control littermates, respectively. In contrast, there was an age-associated decrease in cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP), suggesting these effects are specific for RBM3. Lastly, there was an age-associated increase in RNA degradation marker decapping enzyme 2 (DCP2) in UM-HET3 mice that was mitigated by CR. These results show that muscle RBM3 expression is correlated with extended lifespan in both df/df and CR animals. Identifying how RBM3 exerts protective effects in muscle may yield new insights into healthy aging of skeletal muscle.","Hettinger, Zachary R; Confides, Amy L; Vanderklish, Peter W; Sidhom, Silvana; Masternak, Michal M; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E",Experimental gerontology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2020.111214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385482/,218

76616,Meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy: Just another meta-analysis?,2021-03-11,"OBJECTIVES Dyspnea is a common presenting problem that creates a diagnostic challenge for physicians in the emergency department (ED). While the differential diagnosis is broad, acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a frequent cause that can be challenging to differentiate from other etiologies. Recent studies have suggested a potential diagnostic role for emergency lung ultrasound (US). The objective of this systematic review was to assess the accuracy of early bedside lung US in patients presenting to the ED with dyspnea. METHODS A systematic search of EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library was performed in addition to a grey literature search. We selected prospective studies that reported on the sensitivity and specificity of B-lines from early lung ultrasound in dyspneic patients presenting to the ED. Selected studies underwent quality assessment using the Critical Appraisal and Skills Program (CASP) questionnaire. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The search yielded 3674 articles; seven studies met inclusion criteria and fulfilled CASP requirements for a total of 1861 patients. Summary statistics from the meta-analysis showed that as a diagnostic test for ADHF, bedside lung US had a pooled sensitivity of 82.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]=66.4% to 91.8%) and a pooled specificity of 83.6% (95% CI=72.4% to 90.8%). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that in patients presenting to the ED with undifferentiated dyspnea, B-lines from early bedside lung US may be reliably used as an adjunct to current diagnostic methods. The incorporation of lung US may lead to more appropriate and timely diagnosis of patients with undifferentiated ADHF.","McGivery, Kyle; Atkinson, Paul; Lewis, David; Taylor, Luke; Harris, Tim; Gadd, Kathleen; Fraser, Jacqueline; Stoica, George",CJEM,https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2018.27; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29619917/,218

MATERIAL AND METHODS Preoperative data on demography, life-style practices, medication, comorbidity, and previous surgery for rectal prolapse were ascertained from patient charts. Information on operative procedure, and pre- and postoperative complications were recorded. Short- and long-term follow-up were done after a median of 60 days and 2 years after surgery. RESULTS Between 1 February 2009 to 1 June 2012, 81 laparoscopic posterior rectopexies were done. Male-to-female ratio was 4:77, median age 73 [57-80.5] years and median ASA Grade 2. Conversion to open surgery was done in 6.2%, the median operating time was 82 min [66 - 102] and median length of hospital stay was 2 days [2-5.7]. Minor and major complications were seen in 5.3% and 14.8%, respectively. The 30-day mortality rate was 1.2%. Constipation or incontinence improved or disappeared in 65.2% and 74.4%, respectively. The cumulated recurrence rate was 11.1% after a median observation time of 2 years. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic posterior rectopexy is a safe and well-tolerated procedure in older patients and can be done with acceptable complications and recurrence rates and short hospital stays.

79616,Copper Deficiency Myelopathy After Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) provides direct endoscopic access to the rectum and peritoneal cavity. The feasibility of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) rectosigmoid resection using TEM was evaluated in swine. Transgastric endoscopic assistance to extend transanal colon mobilization was also investigated. Full-thickness circumferential rectal dissection was performed and extended proximally. After maximal sigmoid mobilization, the specimen was exteriorized and transected, and the proximal colon was stapled to the distal rectum. In a subset of animals, transgastric endoscopic access was used to mobilize the colon further. RESULTS Rectosigmoid resection using TEM was performed in two non-survival and seven swine cadavers (n = 9). The mean procedure time was 3 h (2.5-4 h), and mean length of resected colon was 16.7 cm (10-25 cm). Transgastric endoscopic assistance was used in three cadavers and two non-survival swine (n = 5) with a mean operative time of 3.5 h (3.5-3.75 h). The mean length of colon mobilized with transgastric and transanal endoscopic access was 24.4 cm (20-27 cm) vs. 16.7 cm which mobilized the transanal approach alone (p = 0.016). A posterior anastomotic defect was noted in two animals. CONCLUSION Transanal rectosigmoid resection with TEM is feasible in swine. Combined transgastric and TEM access is a promising new technique for NOTES colorectal resection.","Sylla, Patricia; Willingham, Field F; Sohn, Dae K; Gee, Denise; Brugge, William R; Rattner, David W",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-008-0637-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18704596/,218

Based on literature research, the classification of genetic mutations continues to be done manually nowadays. Manual classification of genetic mutations is pathologist-dependent, subjective, and time-consuming. To improve the accuracy of clinical interpretation, scientists have proposed computational-based approaches for automatic analysis of mutations with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, some challenges, such as multiple classifications, the complexity of texts, redundant descriptions, and inconsistent interpretation, have limited the development of algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we have adapted a deep learning method named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify genetic mutations based on text evidence from an annotated database. During the training, three challenging features such as the extreme length of texts, biased data presentation, and high repeatability were addressed. Finally, the BERT+abstract demonstrates satisfactory results with 0.80 logarithmic loss, 0.6837 recall, and 0.705 F-measure. It is feasible for BERT to classify the genomic mutation text within literature-based datasets. Consequently, BERT is a practical tool for facilitating and significantly speeding up cancer research towards tumor progression, diagnosis, and the design of more precise and effective treatments.","Su, Yuhan; Xiang, Hongxin; Xie, Haotian; Yu, Yong; Dong, Shiyan; Yang, Zhaogang; Zhao, Na",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/5491963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083472/,218

In this paper, we present an example of a successfully implemented nature-based solution (NBS) in the Dijle valley in the centre of Belgium. The research objective is to retrospectively assess cost and benefit differences between a technical solution (storm basins) and an alternative NBS, here the restoration of the alluvial floodplain. The method is a comparative social cost-benefit analysis. The case study analysis reveals similar flood security, lower costs, more ecosystem services benefits and higher biodiversity values associated with the NBS option in comparison to the technical alternative. However, the business case for working with NBS depends substantially on the spatial and socio-ecological context. Chances for successful NBS implementation increase in conditions of sufficient space to retain flood water, when flood water is of sufficient quality, and when economic activity and housing in the floodplain is limited.","Turkelboom, Francis; Demeyer, Rolinde; Vranken, Liesbet; De Becker, Piet; Raymaekers, Filip; De Smet, Lieven",Ambio,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01548-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974215/,218

To prepare health systems to deal with the pandemic, epidemiological and cost projection models are required to inform budgets and efficient allocation of resources. This study estimates daily inpatient care costs of COVID-19 in South Africa, an important input into cost projection and economic evaluation models. METHODS We adopted a micro-costing approach, which involved the identification, measurement and valuation of resources used in the clinical management of COVID-19. We considered only direct medical costs for an episode of hospitalisation from the South African public health system perspective. Resource quantities and unit costs were obtained from various sources. Inpatient costs per patient day was estimated for consumables, capital equipment and human resources for three levels of inpatient care - general wards, high care wards and intensive care units (ICUs). RESULTS Average daily costs per patient increased with the level of care. The highest average daily cost was estimated for ICU admissions - 271 USD to 306 USD (financial costs) and ~800 USD to 830 USD (economic costs, excluding facility fee) depending on the need for invasive vs. non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Conversely, the lowest cost was estimated for general ward-based care - 62 USD to 79 USD (financial costs) and 119 USD to 278 USD (economic costs, excluding facility fees) depending on the need for supplemental oxygen. In high care wards, total cost was estimated at 156 USD, financial costs and 277 USD, economic costs (excluding facility fees). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggest our costs estimates are robust to uncertainty in cost inputs. CONCLUSION Our estimates of inpatient costs are useful for informing budgeting and planning processes and cost-effectiveness analysis in the South African context. However, these estimates can be adapted to inform policy decisions in other context.","Edoka, Ijeoma; Fraser, Heather; Jamieson, Lise; Meyer-Rath, Gesine; Mdewa, Winfrida",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949817/,218
83970,Axillary vein thrombosis in COVID positive patient with midline and continuous positive airway pressure Helmet.,2020-07-15,"Pediatric intracranial aneurysms are exceedingly rare and account for less than 5% of all intracranial aneurysms. Open surgery to treat such aneurysms has been shown to be more durable than endovascular techniques, and durability of treatment is particularly important in the pediatric population. Over the past 2 decades, however, a marked shift in aneurysm treatment from open surgery toward endovascular procedures has occurred for adults. The authors describe their early experience in treating 3 unruptured pediatric brain aneurysms using the Pipeline embolization device (PED). The first patient, a girl with Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism Type II who was harboring multiple intracranial aneurysms, underwent two flow diversion procedures for a vertebrobasilar aneurysm and a supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm. The second patient underwent PED placement on a previously coiled but enlarging posterior communicating artery aneurysm. All procedures were uneventful, with no postsurgical complications, and led to complete angiographic obliteration of the aneurysms. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first series of flow diversion procedures in children reported in the medical literature. While flow diversion is a new and relatively untested technology in children, outcomes in adults have been promising. For challenging lesions in the pediatric population, flow diversion may have a valuable role as a well-tolerated, safe treatment with durable results. Many issues remain to be addressed, such as the durability of flow diverters over a very long follow-up and vessel response to growth in the presence of an endoluminal device.","Navarro, Ramon; Brown, Benjamin L; Beier, Alexandra; Ranalli, Nathan; Aldana, Philipp; Hanel, Ricardo A",Journal of neurosurgery.

85168,Prophylactic Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Obese Women After Cesarean Delivery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2017,"Compensatory changes in energy expenditure occur in response to positive and negative energy balance, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Under low energy demand, the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS) is particularly sensitive to added energy supply (i.e., reductive stress) which exponentially increases the rate of H2O2 (JH2O2) production. H2O2 is reduced to H2O by electrons supplied by NADPH. NADP+ is reduced back to NADPH by activation of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT). The coupling of reductive stress-induced JH2O2 production to NNT-linked redox buffering circuits provides a potential means of integrating energy balance with energy expenditure. To test this hypothesis, energy supply was manipulated by varying flux rate through β-oxidation in muscle mitochondria minus/plus pharmacological or genetic inhibition of redox buffering circuits. Here we show during both non-ADP and low-ADP stimulated respiration that accelerating flux through β-oxidation generates a corresponding increase in mitochondrial JH2O2 production, that the majority (∼70-80%) of H2O2 produced is reduced to H2O by electrons drawn from redox buffering circuits supplied by NADPH, and that the rate of electron flux through redox buffering circuits is directly linked to changes in oxygen consumption mediated by NNT. These findings provide evidence that redox reactions within β-oxidation and the ETS serve as a barometer of substrate flux relative to demand, continuously adjusting JH2O2 production and, in turn, the rate at which energy is expended via NNT-mediated proton conductance. This variable flux through redox circuits provides a potential compensatory mechanism for fine-tuning energy expenditure to energy balance in real-time.","Smith, Cody D; Schmidt, Cameron A; Lin, Chien-Te; Fisher-Wellman, Kelsey H; Neufer, P Darrell",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.013899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747443/,218

Data is scarce regarding its clinical characteristics and outcomes in Africa. We aim to study the frequency, clinico-radiological characteristics, and treatment outcomes of African CTD-ILD patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study of ILD among 318 CTD patients diagnosed using relevant ACR criteria at the rheumatology unit of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Lagos from 2012 to 2019. Socio-demographics, clinical features, radiological findings, and treatment outcomes were documented. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 21 with p < 0.05. The LASUTH ethics committee approved the study. Interstitial lung disease occurred in 31 (9.7%) of 318 CTD cases. Their mean age was 38.8 ± 13.3 years, range 19-68 years with 28 (90.3%) females. Proportions of CTD-ILD were Sjogren's syndrome (50%), UCTD (50%), systemic sclerosis (46.7%), MCTD (33.3%), PM/DM (25%), SLE (6.5%), and RA (2.6%). Commonest presentations were cough (93.5%) and bibasal inspiratory crackles (83.9%) with a restrictive pattern in 83.9%. Antinuclear antibody occurred in 100% and anti-ENA in 67.7%. Traction bronchiectasis (89.7%) and ground glass opacities (96.6%) were frequent HRCT findings. Treatments included pulse-dose prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, pirfenidone, and rituximab. Outcomes were ambulatory oxygen therapy (12.9%) and mortality (16.1%) with 9.7% lost to follow-up. CTD-ILD is a female predominant disease occurring in 9.7% of CTD patients mostly those with Sjogren's syndrome and systemic sclerosis. Due to significant morbidity and mortality, we advocate routine ILD screening for all CTD patients including those with undifferentiated disease. Key Points: • Interstitial lung disease occurs in 9.7% of patients with underlying connective tissue disease. • Females are predominantly affected especially those with Sjogren's syndrome and systemic sclerosis. • Mortality occurs in roughly 1 in every 6 patients with CTD-ILD.","Olaosebikan, Hakeem; Adeyeye, Olufunke; Akintayo, Richard; Akpabio, Akpabio; Adenitan, Ajibade; Adelowo, Olufemi; Ojo, Olufemi; Abimbola, Fasan-Odunsi",Clinical rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05336-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803569/,218

However, the co-assembly scenario where one of the peptide building blocks simultaneously forms a hydrogel is yet to be studied. Herein, we investigated the co-assembly formation of a minimalistic dipeptide, diphenylalanine (FF), and Fmoc-diphenylalanine (FmocFF) within the 3D fibrous matrix of FmocFF hydrogel. The overlapping peptide sequence between the two building blocks leads to their co-assembly within the gel state modulating the nature of the FF crystals. Consequently, we observe the formation of branched microcrystalline aggregates with an atypical curvature, in contrast to the FF assemblies obtained from aqueous solution. Using optical microscopy, we demonstrate the sigmoidal kinetic growth profile of these aggregates. Microfluidics and ToF-SIMS experiments reveal the presence of co-assembled structures of FF and FmocFF in the crystalline aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulation was further used to decipher the mechanism of co-assembly formation. This study introduces a simple methodology to investigate the kinetics of amyloidogenic structure formation in the hydrogel state and their in vitro modulation using the supramolecular co-assembly paradigm.","Chakraborty, Priyadarshi; Tang, Yiming; Guterman, Tom; Arnon, Zohar A; Yao, Yifei; Wei, Guanghong; Gazit, Ehud",Angewandte Chemie,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202009488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894630/,218

Protein expression of Trx system family members has been assessed in various cancers and linked to various clinicopathological variables, disease progression, treatment response and survival outcomes but information is lacking in brain tumours. Expression of the system was therefore examined, by immunohistochemistry in different brain tumour types, adult and paediatric cases, to determine if expression was of importance to clinical outcome. Trx system proteins were expressed, to variable levels, across all brain tumour types with significant variations in expression between different tumour types/grades/regions. High Trx reductase (TrxR) expression was linked to worse prognosis across all cohorts. High cytoplasmic TrxR expression was significantly associated with adverse overall survival (OS) in adult glioblastoma (P = 0.027) and paediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (P = 0.012). High expression of nuclear TrxR, cytoplasmic and nuclear Trx and Trx-interacting protein (TxNIP) was associated with improved OS in paediatric LGGs (P = 0.031, P < 0.001, P = 0.044 and P = 0.018, respectively). For patients with high-grade gliomas, both high cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx expression were associated with poor OS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively). In medulloblastoma, high expression of cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx and nuclear Trx was associated with worse prognosis (P = 0.013, P = 0.033 and P = 0.007, respectively); with cytoplasmic TrxR and nuclear Trx remaining so in multivariate analysis (P = 0.009 and P = 0.013, respectively). The consistent finding that high levels of cytoplasmic TrxR are associated with a worse prognosis across all cohorts suggests that TrxR is an important therapeutic target in brain cancers.","Yao, Anqi; Storr, Sarah J; Al-Hadyan, Khaled; Rahman, Ruman; Smith, Stuart; Grundy, Richard; Paine, Simon; Martin, Stewart G",Molecular neurobiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-020-01928-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418115/,218

Mobile sensors were used to conduct noise measurements in streets with and without dedicated cycling infrastructures. The method can be summarized in the following procedures: i) characterization of the study area; ii) data collection and validation; iii) calculation of exposure indicators; and iv) comparison and representation of the results on maps. Two strategies were adopted for the analysis, namely, spatial data aggregation and temporal data aggregation. Thus, measurements were initially organized in 1,200 nodes distributed along the paths. The results indicate that bicycle riders in São Carlos may be exposed, in some routes, to a high proportion of high noise-level segments. In the two routes selected for this study, the cyclist was exposed to noise levels above the adopted threshold (> 75dBA) in 33.2% and 18.9% of the nodes. Also, the possibility of simultaneously working with two related indicators has broadened the classification criteria of the route segments regarding noise exposure.","Ramos, Thiago da Cunha; Silva, Antônio Nélson Rodrigues da; Souza, Léa Cristina Lucas de; Dekoninck, Luc; Botteldooren, Dick; Teixeira, Inaian Pignatti",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020257.157522018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667570/,218

However, interventions in recent decades have helped lower the incidence of several diseases despite the country's large, frequently mobile population and socio-economic challenges. Increasing globalization, rapid urbanization and a warming climate now add to the complexity of disease control and prevention and could challenge China's capacity to respond to threats of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses. To investigate this notion, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 30 infectious disease experts in four cities in China. The case study diseases under discussion were malaria, dengue fever and haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, all of which may be influenced by changing meteorological conditions. Data were analysed using standard qualitative techniques. The study participants viewed the current disease prevention and control system favourably and were optimistic about China's capacity to manage climate-sensitive diseases in the future. Several recommendations emerged from the data including the need to improve health literacy in the population regarding the transmission of infectious diseases and raising awareness of the health impacts of climate change amongst policymakers and health professionals. Participants thought that research capacity could be strengthened and human resources issues for front-line staff should be addressed. It was considered important that authorities are well prepared in advance for outbreaks such as dengue fever in populous subtropical areas, and a prompt and coordinated response is required when outbreaks occur. Furthermore, health professionals need to remain skilled in the identification of diseases for which incidence is declining, so that re-emerging or emerging trends can be rapidly identified. Recommendations such as these may be useful in formulating adaptation plans and capacity building for the future control and prevention of climate-sensitive zoonotic diseases in China and neighbouring countries.","Hansen, A; Xiang, J; Liu, Q; Tong, M X; Sun, Y; Liu, X; Chen, K; Cameron, S; Hanson-Easey, S; Han, G-S; Weinstein, P; Williams, C; Bi, P",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28009103/,218

89636,Evidence of altered cardiac autonomic regulation in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"Loneliness and social isolation are common sources of chronic stress in modern society. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that loneliness and social isolation increase mortality risk as much as smoking or alcohol consumption and more than physical inactivity or obesity. Loneliness in human is associated with higher blood pressure whereas enhanced atherosclerosis is observed in animal models of social isolation. Loneliness and social isolation lead to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, enhanced sympathetic nerve activity, impaired parasympathetic function and a proinflammatory immune response. These mechanisms have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease conferred by social isolation although a causal relationship has not been established so far. There is evidence that oxidative stress is likely to be a key molecular mechanism linking chronic psychosocial stress to cardiovascular disease. NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress in the hypothalamus has been shown to be required for social isolation-induced HPA axis activation in socially isolated rats. Oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla is also a key regulator of sympathetic nerve activity. In the vasculature, oxidative stress increases vascular tone and promote atherogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Thus, preventing oxidative stress may represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce the detrimental effects of social stress on health.","Li, Huige; Xia, Ning",Redox biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709420/,218

The ABCD score was compared to the individualized metabolic surgery (IMS) score in terms of prediction of T2DM remission, but which of the two scoring systems is better remains controversial. METHODS Patient data from 463 obese East Asian patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or SG with duodenojejunal bypass (SG-DJB) as a primary operation and were followed for at least 3 years were retrospectively collected from 24 institutions. The correlation between the ABCD and IMS scoring systems and the discrimination power of the models was evaluated. The cut-off point for the IMS stage of T2DM severity was also revised to adjust the scoring system to obese East Asian patients. RESULTS The two scoring systems were significantly well correlated. The IMS scoring system showed significant differences in T2DM remission rates between the procedures in the moderate stage, but the ABCD score showed no significant differences in each category. The discrimination power of the IMS score was comparable to that of the ABCD score at both 3 and 5 years. The revised IMS scoring system showed that SG-DJB had significantly higher T2DM remission rates in the moderate stage at 5 years than RYGB or SG. CONCLUSION IMS score may be comparable to ABCD score to predict T2DM remission in obese East Asian patients. The revised IMS scoring system may also select candidates for SG or SG-DJB.","Ohta, Masayuki; Seki, Yosuke; Ohyama, Tetsuji; Bai, Rixing; Kim, Sang Hyun; Oshiro, Takashi; Jiang, Tao; Sasaki, Akira; Naitoh, Takeshi; Yamaguchi, Tsuyoshi; Inamine, Susumu; Miyazaki, Yasuhiro; Ahn, Soo Min; Heo, Yoonseok; Liang, Hui; Choi, Seung Ho; Yang, Wah; Yao, Qiyuan; Inoue, Kentaro; Yamamoto, Hiroshi; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Park, Young Suk; Ha, Tae Kyung; Ryu, Seung-Wan; Wang, Cunchuan; Park, Sungsoo; Kasama, Kazunori",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-05151-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411317/,218

91290,Association between response rates and survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. A systematic review and meta-regression analysis.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Telemedicine has rapidly expanded in the recent years as technologies have afforded healthcare practitioners the ability to diagnose and treat patients remotely. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, nonessential clinical visits were greatly limited, and much of the outpatient neurosurgical practice at the authors' institution was shifted quickly to telehealth. Although there are prior data suggesting that the use of telemedicine is satisfactory in other surgical fields, data in neurosurgery are limited. This study aimed to investigate both patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine and its strengths and limitations in outpatient neurosurgery visits. METHODS This quality improvement study was designed to analyze provider and patient satisfaction with telemedicine consultations in an outpatient neurosurgery clinic setting at a tertiary care, large-volume, academic center. The authors designed an 11-question survey for neurosurgical providers and a 13-question survey for patients using both closed 5-point Likert scale responses and multiple choice responses. The questionnaires were administered to patients and providers during the period when the clinic restricted in-person visits. At the conclusion of the study, the overall data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. RESULTS During the study period, 607 surveys were sent out to patients seen by telehealth at the authors' academic center, and 122 responses were received. For the provider survey, 85 surveys were sent out to providers at the authors' center and other academic centers, and 40 surveys were received. Ninety-two percent of patients agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with that particular telehealth visit. Eighty-eight percent of patients agreed that their telehealth visit was more convenient for them than an in-person visit, but only 36% of patients stated they would like their future visits to be telehealth. Sixty-three percent of providers agreed that telehealth visits were more convenient for them than in-person visits, and 85% of responding providers stated that they wished to incorporate telehealth into their future practice. CONCLUSIONS Although the authors' transition to telehealth was both rapid and unexpected, most providers and patients reported positive experiences with their telemedicine visits and found telemedicine to be an effective form of ambulatory neurosurgical care. Not all patients preferred telemedicine visits over in-person visits, but the high satisfaction with telemedicine by both providers and patients is promising to the future expansion of telehealth in ambulatory neurosurgery.","Mohanty, Alina; Srinivasan, Visish M; Burkhardt, Jan-Karl; Johnson, Jeremiah; Patel, Akash J; Sheth, Sameer A; Viswanathan, Ashwin; Yoshor, Daniel; Kan, Peter",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260126/,218

Disease spreading occurs by the expulsion of pathogen containing aerosol droplets. Fine droplets can pass through layers of masks and are carried away by the exhaled airflow unlike larger droplets that settle down due to gravity. Hence, it is important to quantitatively assess the maximum distance of travel of typical human coughs with and without different types of masks. Even though near field data are available near the mouth, far field data are scarce. In this study, the schlieren method that is a highly sensitive, non-intrusive flow visualization technique is used. It can directly image weak density gradients produced by coughs. An assessment of different methods of covering the mouth while coughing is arrived at by using observations from high speed schlieren images. The effectiveness of coughing into the elbow is examined. The velocity of propagation of coughs and the distance of propagation with and without masks are quantified. It is also found that normalizing the distance-velocity profiles causes all the data to collapse onto a universal non-dimensional curve irrespective of the usage of different types of masks or test subjects. Visualization of cough flow fields and analysis of experimental data reveal that the flow physics is governed by the propagation of viscous vortex rings.","Prasanna Simha, Padmanabha; Mohan Rao, Prasanna Simha",Physics of fluids,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0021666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904942/,218

94990,Survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients with colon cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-01-09,"Haemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV), an adenovirus associated with acute haemorrhagic gastro-intestinal disease of 6-11-week old turkeys predominantly hampers both humoral and cellular immunity. Affected birds are more prone to secondary complications (e.g. colibacillosis and clostridiosis) and failure to mount an effective vaccine-induced immune response. HEV belongs to the new genus Siadenovirus. Feco-oral transmission is the main route of entry of the virus and it mainly colonizes bursa, intestine and spleen. Both naturally occurring virulent and avirulent strains of HEVs are serologically indistinguishable. Recent findings revealed that ORF1, E3 and fib genes are the key factors affecting virulence. The adoption of suitable diagnostic tools, proper vaccination and biosecurity measures have restrained the occurrence of disease epidemics. For diagnostic purposes, the best source of HEV is either intestinal contents or samples from spleen. For rapid detection highly sensitive and specific tests such as quantitative real-time PCR based on Taq man probe has been designed. Avirulent strains of HEV or MSDV can be effectively used as live vaccines. Novel vaccines include recombinant hexon protein-based subunit vaccines or recombinant virus-vectored vaccines using fowl poxvirus (FPV) expressing the native hexon of HEV. Notably, subunit vaccines and recombinant virus vectored vaccines altogether offer high protection against challenge or field viruses. Herein, we converse a comprehensive analysis of the HEV genetics, disease pathobiology, advancements in diagnosis and vaccination along with appropriate prevention and control strategies.","Dhama, Kuldeep; Gowthaman, Vasudevan; Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Tiwari, Ruchi; Sachan, Swati; Kumar, M Asok; Palanivelu, M; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Singh, Raj Kumar; Munir, Muhammad",The Veterinary quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.2016.1277281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28024457/,218

Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been reported in a variety of formats, but there are no series that directly compare totally minimally invasive thoracolaparoscopic 2 stage esophagectomy (MIE-2) with open Ivor Lewis (IVL). A prospective single-center cohort study of patients undergoing elective MIE-2 or IVL between January 2005 and November 2010 was performed. Short-term clinicopathologic outcomes were recorded using validated systems. One hundred and six patients (median age 66, range 36-85, 88 M : 18 F) underwent two-stage esophagectomy (53 MIE-2 and 53 IVL). Patient demographics (age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, tumor characteristics, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and TNM stage) were comparable between the two groups. Outcomes for MIE-2 and IVL were comparable for anastomotic leak rates (5 [9%] vs. 2 [4%], P= 0.241), resection margin clearance (R0) (43 [81%] vs. 38 [72%], P= 0.253), median lymph node yield (19 vs. 18, P= 0.584), and median length of stay (12 [range 7-91] vs. 12 [range 7-101] days), respectively. Blood loss was significantly less for MIE-2 compared with IVL (median 300 [range 0-1250] mL vs. 400 [range 0-3000] mL, respectively, P= 0.021). MIE-2 in this series of selected patients supports its efficacy, when performed by an experienced minimally invasive surgical team.

However, curfew and quarantine period (increase in food intake and decreased physical activity) increases risks for morbidity and mortality because of obesity and diabetes. When the pandemic decreases and disappears, many obesity patients will seek treatment for obesity and the workload of surgeons will increase. Before bariatric and metabolic surgery operations, which is the most effective treatment of obesity and related comorbidities, necessary precautions must be determined and implemented to protect patients and healthcare workers before and during surgery. In this review, it was aimed to determine the pre-peri and postoperative periods of bariatric surgical requirements.

We evaluated fluconazole prophylaxis and no antifungal prophylaxis, as a natural interrupted time-series study to assess survival and infection complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS We identified patients with AML ≥ 18 years old undergoing induction chemotherapy during 2 time periods: period 1, fluconazole prophylaxis from August 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015, and period 2, no prophylaxis from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The primary outcome was incidence of proven or probable IFI. Secondary outcomes included types of IFIs and 60-day overall survival (OS). IFI was defined by the 2002 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Consensus criteria. RESULTS One hundred forty-four patients received induction chemotherapy over the 2 time periods. In the prophylaxis versus no-prophylaxis groups, the rate of proven or probable IFIs was 4 (5%) of 87 versus 12 (21%) of 57 (P = .01). The total number of proven IFIs was 3 (3%) of 87 versus 4 (7%) of 57 (P = .44), whereas probable IFIs were 1 (1%) of 87 versus 8 (14%) of 57 (P < .01). No difference was observed in fungemia. Incidence of IFIs was too low to detect resistance patterns. OS at 60 days was improved in with fluconazole prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis (hazard ratio, 0.329; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.89; P = .028). CONCLUSION Observed rates of proven or probable IFI were lower in the fluconazole prophylaxis group versus the no-prophylaxis group. Sixty-day OS was higher with fluconazole prophylaxis. Further study is required to evaluate how fluconazole may impart the differences in survival seen in this analysis.","Signorelli, Jessie; Lei, Matthew; Lam, Jenna; Jalbut, Marla; Amrein, Philip C; Fathi, Amir T; Hobbs, Gabriela; Hock, Hanno; McAfee, Steven Lawrence; Letourneau, Alyssa R; Narayan, Rupa; Brunner, Andrew","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2020.06.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917574/,218

We report a comparison of transumbilical single port laparoscopic appendectomy (TUSPLA) and conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) in a Korean military hospital. METHODS This single-center retrospective study of 63 patients who received laparoscopic appendectomy was conducted between May 2011 and October 2011. Nineteen patients received TUSPLA and 44 patients received CLA. Clinical outcomes such as operation time, hospital stay, postoperative pain, diet, and postoperative complication were reviewed. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between TUSPLA and CLA patients, respectively, in operation time (58.9 minutes vs. 52.3 minutes, P = 0.262), duration of hospitalization (10.2 days vs. 10.6 days, P = 0.782), mean visual analogue scale score (2.6 vs. 2.5, P = 0.894), and return to diet (1.6 days vs. 1.7 days, P = 0.776). There were two cases (10.5%) of short-term complications in the TUSPLA group and four cases (9.1%) of short-term complications in the CLA group. All patients were fully recovered at discharge. CONCLUSION TUSPLA is a feasible alternative for CLA. When a glove port is used, no special instruments are needed. Thus, it can be performed in a hospital equipped with basic laparoscopic surgical instruments.","Lee, Jun Suh; Choi, Young Il; Lim, Sung Ho; Hong, Tae Ho",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,https://doi.org/10.4174/jkss.2012.83.4.212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23091793/,218

A narrative synthesis was used to answer the research question; 58 studies were included of which 33 found a positive association between CI and LOS or DD, 8 studies had mixed results, 3 found an inverse relationship, and 14 showed an indirect link between CI-related syndromes and LOS/DD. Thus, cognitive impairment seemed to be frequently associated with increased LOS/DD. Future research should consider CI together with other risks for LOS/DD and also focus on explaining the association between the two.","Plante, Jonathan; Latulippe, Karine; Kröger, Edeltraut; Giroux, Dominique; Marcotte, Martine; Nadeau, Sacha; Doyle, Elizabeth; Rockwood, Kenneth",Canadian journal on aging = La revue canadienne du vieillissement,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0714980820000355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843528/,218

Although there are only a few epidemiological studies that document the seroprevalence of PHEV infection, there are reports of sporadic outbreaks, including recent documentation of an influenza-like respiratory disease associated with PHEV in the United States. To address this issue, we have developed a new indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for use in sero-epidemiological research of PHEV infection. One hundred and fifty porcine serum samples that were determined as antibody-positive or antibody-negative in virus neutralization (VN) tests were used in conjunction with PHEV-specific antigen extracted from virus-infected FS-L3 cells using RBS buffer containing 0.2% NP-40 to develop this assay. The ELISA showed a high sensitivity (95.35%) and specificity (96.88%) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 attesting to its accuracy. Our results revealed a strong correlation between the results of the indirect ELISA and VN test (R = 0.850, P < 0.05), with near-perfect agreement (kappa value = 0.932). These results indicate that this new indirect ELISA might be useful for diagnosis and sero-epidemiological tracking of PHEV infection.","Trang, Chau Thi Huyen; Nakanishi, Makoto; Hayashidani, Hideki; Taniguchi, Takahide",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2020.114016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290788/,218

METHODS Nine men cycled at approximately 55% VO2peak for 75 min and ingested 3.2 mL · kg(-1) aliquots of 37 °C fluid or ICE after 15, 30, and 45 min of exercise. Metabolic heat production (M-W), rectal temperature (Tre), mean skin temperature (Tsk), whole-body sweat loss (WBSL), local sweat rate (LSR), and skin blood flow (SkBF) were measured throughout. Net heat loss (HLnet) and heat storage (S) were estimated using partitional calorimetry. RESULTS Relative to the 37 °C trial, M-W was similar (P = 0.81) with ICE ingestion; however, the 200 ± 20 kJ greater Hfluid (P < 0.001) with ICE ingestion was overcompensated by a 381 ± 199-kJ lower Esk (P < 0.001). Net heat loss (HLnet) was consequently 131 ± 120 kJ lower (P = 0.01) and S was greater (P = 0.05) with ICE ingestion compared with 37 °C fluid ingestion. Concurrently, LSR and WBSL were lower by 0.16 ± 0.14 mg · min(-1) · cm(-2) (P < 0.01) and 191 ± 122 g (P < 0.001), respectively, and SkBF tended to be lower (P = 0.06) by 5.4%maxAU ± 13.4%maxAU in the ICE trial. Changes in Tre and Tsk were similar throughout exercise with ICE compared to 37 °C fluid ingestion. CONCLUSIONS Relative to 37 °C, ICE ingestion caused disproportionately greater reductions in Esk relative to Hfluid, resulting in a lower HLnet and greater S. Mechanistically, LSR and possibly SkBF were suppressed independently of Tre or Tsk, reaffirming the concept of human abdominal thermoreception. From a heat balance perspective, recommendations for ICE ingestion during exercise in warm, dry conditions should be reconsidered.","Morris, Nathan B; Coombs, Geoff; Jay, Ollie",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000000746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258857/,218

The accessibility of primary care facilities is therefore very important. In this study we analysed comparative data on physical accessibility of general practices (GP practices) in 31 (mainly) European countries. METHODS We used data from the QUALICOPC study, conducted in 2011 among GPs in 34 (mainly European) countries and constructed a physical accessibility scale. We applied multilevel analysis to assess the differences between and within countries and to test hypotheses, related to characteristics of the practices and of the countries. RESULTS We found large differences between countries and a strong clustering of physical accessibility within countries. Physical accessibility was negatively related to the age of the GPs, and was less in single-handed and in inner city practices. Of the country variables only the length of the period of social democratic government participation during the previous decades was positively related to physical accessibility. CONCLUSION A large share of the variation in physical accessibility of GP practices was on the level of countries. This means that national policies can be used to increase physical accessibility of GP practices.","Groenewegen, Peter P; Kroneman, Madelon; Spreeuwenberg, Peter",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06120-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33522925/,218

100793,A growing left ventricular aneurysm after myocardial infarction: pathological confirmation of subepicardial aneurysm.,2020-10-20,"Consumption of contaminated meat and poultry products is a major source of foodborne illness in the United States and globally. Meat inspection procedures, established more than a hundred years ago to detect prevailing food safety issues of the time and largely harmonized around the world, do not effectively detect modern hazards and may inadvertently increase food safety risks by spreading contamination across carcasses. Visual-only inspection (VOI) is a modernized meat inspection system that is data-driven and minimizes physical manipulation of the carcass during inspection. It was developed based on scientific evidence and risk assessment and aims to better control current food safety hazards. In 2014, the European Union (EU) became the first supranational government in the world to require VOI for all swine herds slaughtered in Member States that met certain epidemiologic and animal rearing conditions. Here, we review the implementation of this new inspection system with the goal of informing similar modernization efforts in other countries and for other commodities beyond pork. This article reports the results of a literature review and interviews conducted with nine experts in 2018 on the implementation of the EU's 2014 VOI regulation. Challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned about the implementation of the regulation are described for audiences interested in adapting inspection procedures to prevent and detect modern food safety hazards. Overall, implementation of VOI varies within and across Member States, and among slaughterhouses of different sizes. This variation is due to disease risk patterns, supply chain conditions, and trade barriers. Before transitioning to a similar risk-based inspection system, other countries should consider science-based research agendas to identify what information best predicts herd health and foodborne hazards, regulatory system design that reflects local hazards, and development of targeted VOI educational materials.","Riess, Beth; Hoelzer, Karin",Journal of food protection,https://doi.org/10.4315/jfp-20-157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609817/,218

Toner, Leary, Asher, and Jongman-Sereno (2013) found that dogmatism was higher among conservatives than liberals, but both conservatives and liberals with extreme attitudes reported higher perceived superiority of beliefs. In the current study, we conducted a preregistered direct and conceptual replication of this previous research using a large nationally representative sample. Consistent with Toner et al.'s findings, our results showed that conservatives had higher dogmatism scores than liberals, whereas both conservative and liberal extreme attitudes were associated with higher belief superiority compared with more moderate attitudes. As in their study, we also found that whether conservative or liberal attitudes were associated with higher belief superiority was topic dependent. Contrasting Toner et al.'s findings, our results also showed that ideologically extreme individuals had higher dogmatism.

A cohort study and meta-analysis.,2021-01-19,"OBJECTIVES A recent individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis suggested that patients with moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation strategies. However, thresholds for continuous variables (eg, hypoxaemia) are often arbitrary and linearity assumptions in regression approaches may not hold; the multivariable fractional polynomial interaction (MFPI) approach can address both problems. The objective of this study was to apply the MFPI approach to investigate interactions between four continuous patient baseline variables and higher versus lower PEEP on clinical outcomes. SETTING Pooled data from three randomised trials in intensive care identified by a systematic review. PARTICIPANTS 2299 patients with acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS Higher (N=1136) versus lower PEEP (N=1163) ventilation strategy. OUTCOME MEASURES Prespecified outcomes included mortality, time to death and time-to-unassisted breathing. We examined the following continuous baseline characteristics as potential effect modifiers using MFPI: PaO2/FiO2 (arterial partial oxygen pressure/ fraction of inspired oxygen), oxygenation index, respiratory system compliance (tidal volume/(inspiratory plateau pressure-PEEP)) and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS We found that for patients with PaO2/FiO2 below 150 mm Hg, but above 100 mm Hg or an oxygenation index above 12 (moderate ARDS), higher PEEP reduces hospital mortality, but the beneficial effect appears to level off for patients with very severe ARDS. Patients with mild ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 above 200 mm Hg or an oxygenation index below 10) do not seem to benefit from higher PEEP and might even be harmed. For patients with a respiratory system compliance above 40 mL/cm H2O or patients with a BMI above 35 kg/m(2), we found a trend towards reduced mortality with higher PEEP, but there is very weak statistical confidence in these findings. CONCLUSIONS MFPI analyses suggest a nonlinear effect modification of higher PEEP ventilation by PaO2/FiO2 and oxygenation index with reduced mortality for some patients suffering from moderate ARDS.

101576,Initial Oxygen Use for Preterm Newborn Resuscitation: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is the most widely available device for short-term mechanical circulatory support, often used to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass or combined with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support or as a bridge to a left ventricular assist device. Although based on a relatively simple principle, its complex interaction with the cardiovascular system remains challenging and open to debate. The aim of this work was focused on the development of a new numerical model of IABP. METHODS The new model was implemented in CARDIOSIM©, which is a modular software simulator of the cardiovascular system used in research and e-learning environment. The IABP is inserted into the systemic bed divided in aortic, thoracic and two abdominal tracts modelled with resistances, inertances and compliances. The effect induced by the balloon is reproduced in each tract of the aorta by the presence of compliances connected to PIABP generator and resistances. PIABP generator reproduces the balloon pressure with the option to change IABP timing. We have used literature data to validate the potential of this new numerical model. RESULTS The results have shown that our simulations reproduced the typical effects induced during IABP assistance. We have also simulated the effects induced by the device on the hemodynamic variables when the IABP ratio was set to 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8. The outcome of these simulations is in accordance with literature data measured in the clinical environment. CONCLUSIONS The new IABP module is easy to manage and can be used as a training tool in a clinical setting. Although based on literature data, the outcome of the simulations is encouraging. Additional work is ongoing with a view to further validate its features. The configuration of CARDIOSIM© presented in this work allows the simulation of the effects induced by mechanical ventilatory assistance. This facility may have significant importance in the management of patients affected by COVID-19 when they require mechanical circulatory support devices.","De Lazzari, Claudio; De Lazzari, Beatrice; Iacovoni, Attilio; Marconi, Silvia; Papa, Silvia; Capoccia, Massimo; Badagliacca, Roberto; Vizza, Carmine Dario",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32464587/,218
101794,Tocilizumab use in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study.,2020-10-24,"While the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with respect to distress has been widely researched, unemployed individuals, who often suffer from high levels of distress, have largely been neglected in MBI research. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a low-dose MBI on distress in a sample of young unemployed adults. The sample included 239 young unemployed adults enrolled for a six-week long employability-related training camp. Participants were allocated into an intervention group that received weekly one-hour mindfulness training over 4 weeks, and a control group. Dispositional mindfulness, distress and well-being were assessed in the entire sample prior to the start and upon completion of the mindfulness training. A mixed-model ANCOVA showed that distress was inversely and significantly predicted by baseline levels of mindfulness and well-being. After accounting for the baseline levels of mindfulness and well-being, a significant effect of the mindfulness intervention was evident. This result shows that a low-dose MBI can decrease distress in a sample of young unemployed adults and its effectiveness is positively associated with initial levels of dispositional mindfulness and well-being.

Tracking seasonal outbreaks of IAV and other avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes that can infect humans, aquatic and migratory birds, poultry, and pigs is essential for epidemiological surveillance and outbreak alerts. In this study, we performed four real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for identification of the IAV M and hemagglutinin (HA) genes from six known AIVs infecting pigs, birds, and humans. IAV M1 gene-positive samples tested by single-step rRT-PCR and a fluorogenic Sybr green I detection system were further processed for H5 subtype identification by using two-primer-set multiplex and Sybr green I rRT-PCR assays. H5 subtype-negative samples were then tested with either a TaqMan assay for subtypes H1 and H3 or a TaqMan assay for subtypes H2, H7, and H9 and a beacon multiplex rRT-PCR identification assay. The four-tube strategy was able to detect 10 RNA copies of the HA genes of subtypes H1, H2, H3, H5, and H7 and 100 RNA copies of the HA gene of subtype H9. At least six H5 clades of H5N1 viruses isolated in Southeast Asia and China were detected by that test. Using rRT-PCR assays for the M1 and HA genes in 202 nasopharyngeal swab specimens from children with acute respiratory infections, we identified a total of 39 samples positive for the IAV M1 gene and subtypes H1 and H3. When performed with a portable SmartCycler instrument, the assays offer an efficient, flexible, and reliable platform for investigations of IAV and AIV in remote hospitals and in the field.","Wang, Wei; Ren, Peijun; Mardi, Sek; Hou, Lili; Tsai, Cheguo; Chan, Kwok Hung; Cheng, Peter; Sheng, Jun; Buchy, Philippe; Sun, Bing; Toyoda, Tetsuya; Lim, Wilina; Peiris, J S Malik; Zhou, Paul; Deubel, Vincent",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01090-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18971359/,218

Groups of rats (10/sex in low-dose group, 15/sex in other three groups) were given at doses of 0, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs, mortality, body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical biochemistry, macroscopic findings, organ weights, and histopathology were examined. The administration resulted in increased incidence of piloerection in most of the high-dose females and in some of the high-dose males and mid-dose females. Histopathological examinations revealed minor treatment-related change in the stomach of the high-dose animals. A decrease in body-weight gains and an increase in liver weight were observed in the mid- and high-dose groups. These treatment-related effects were reversible at the 2-week recovery period. A number of other clinical and pathological findings were not considered to be treatment related, since these changes occurred only in one sex were among the normal historical ranges, which were not supported by histopathological findings.

However, efficacy and safety in the Asian population has not yet been demonstrated. In this open-label study, efficacy and safety of LCIG were assessed in Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese advanced PD patients with motor complications not adequately controlled by available PD medication. The patients were treated with LCIG monotherapy for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline to week 12 in 'off' time, as reported in the PD Symptom Diary, normalized to a 16 h waking day and analyzed by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (23 Japanese, 4 Taiwanese, 4 Korean) and 28 (90%) completed the study. For those who completed the study, the mean (s.d.) total daily levodopa dose from LCIG was 1,206.3 (493.6) mg/day at final visit (n=28); last observation carried forward (n=30) was 1,227.6 (482.8) mg/day. There was a significant mean change (s.d.) of -4.6 (3.0) hours of 'off' time from baseline (mean (s.d.)=7.4 (2.3)) to week 12 (n=29), P<0.001. All the patients had an AE, with the most frequently reported being incision site pain (42%); 1 (3.2%) discontinued treatment because of an AE and later died because of sepsis, which the investigator considered unrelated to LCIG treatment.

METHODS A retrospective cohort study of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to an integrated health care network in the New York metropolitan region between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. The final analysis included 9407 patients with an overall VTE rate of 2.9% (2.4% in the medical ward and 4.9% in the ICU) and a VTE or mortality rate of 26.1%. Most patients received prophylactic-dose thromboprophylaxis. Multivariable analysis showed significantly reduced VTE or mortality with Black race, history of hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme/angiotensin receptor blockers use, and initial prophylactic anticoagulation. It also showed significantly increased VTE or mortality with age 60 years or greater, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of 3 or greater, patients on Medicare, history of heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, body mass index greater than 35, steroid use, anti-rheumatologic medication use, hydroxychloroquine use, maximum D-dimer 4 times or greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN), ICU level of care, increasing creatinine, and decreasing platelet counts. CONCLUSION In our large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the overall in-hospital VTE rate was 2.9% (4.9% in the ICU) and a VTE or mortality rate of 26.1%. Key predictors of VTE or mortality included advanced age, increasing CCI, history of cardiovascular disease, ICU level of care, and elevated maximum D-dimer with a cutoff at least 4 times the ULN. Use of prophylactic-dose anticoagulation but not treatment-dose anticoagulation was associated with reduced VTE or mortality.","Cohen, Stuart Lance; Gianos, Eugenia; Barish, Matthew A; Chatterjee, Saurav; Kohn, Nina; Lesser, Martin; Giannis, Dimitrios; Coppa, Kevin; Hirsch, Jamie; McGinn, Thomas; Goldin, Mark; Spyropoulos, Alex",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1366-9656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33472255/,218
106387,Posterior Tracheal Laceration Treated with a Stent.,2017,"Background There is limited evidence of shoe impact in younger children, particularly in the context of immature gait patterns. It is unclear if the impact from shoes in younger children is similar to what has been seen in older children. This systematic review aims to identify any impact of shoe features on younger children's gait, and if there are any differences between shoe sole flexibility compared to barefoot. Methods Study inclusion criteria included: typically developing children aged ≤6 years; comparison of barefoot and shod conditions (walking and/or running) with shoe features or style of shoe described; sample size > 1. Novelty types of footwear were excluded, as was any mention of in shoe support or modifications. Studies were located from six databases. Study methodology was assessed using the McMasters critical review form. Sample size weighted standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results Four studies were included. Participant age ranged from 15.2 to 78.7 months, with 262 participants across all studies. All studies had limited methodological bias based on their design type. Compared to barefoot walking, shoes increased velocity, step time and step length. Shod walking decreased cadence. Peak plantar pressure was generally lower in the stiff shoe design and there was a higher peak plantar pressure in the Ultraflex shoes. No studies were found investigating muscle activation. Conclusions Shoes affect younger children's gait in spatiotemporal gait aspects, similar to those seen in older children. There is limited evidence on effects of particular shoe features such as sole hardness, on gait, and no evidence of any changes in muscle activation patterns. Further research is required to evaluate the impact of different types of shoe and shoe features in this population to provide clinical advice on the type of shoe that is appropriate in this age group.","Cranage, Simone; Perraton, Luke; Bowles, Kelly-Ann; Williams, Cylie",Journal of foot and ankle research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-019-0365-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798689/,218
106411,Virtual Optimization of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction: the IMPLEMENT-HF Pilot Study.,2021-03-26,"PURPOSE To investigate the agreement between the intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements in the awake condition and under different stages of general inhalational anesthesia using sevoflurane in both glaucomatous and normal children. METHODS A prospective study was performed on 43 glaucomatous children and 30 age-matched controls. Baseline IOP of one eye was measured immediately before general anesthesia using Perkins tonometer and then re-measured under light, intermediate, and deep anesthesia, and then after intubation. Depth of anesthesia was determined using bispectral index pediatric sensor. The agreement between the IOP measurements before and during different stages of anesthesia was analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. Systematic and proportionate deviations between the IOP measurements were analyzed. RESULTS The mean age was 58.6 ± 41.99 months. The mean IOP was significantly lower at all stages of anesthesia in both groups. The coefficient of variation was over 20% in all measurements under anesthesia. For all IOP measurements during anesthesia, the limits of agreement were > 7 mmHg difference in the control group and > 20 mmHg in the glaucomatous group. The best agreement was with the IOP measurement after intubation (mean limit of agreement of -1.4 mmHg, 1.96 s range, -8.8-6 mm Hg) in the control group and with the IOP measurement under intermediate anesthesia (mean limit of agreement of -4.2 mmHg, 1.96 s range, -15.1-6.8 mm Hg) in the glaucomatous group. CONCLUSIONS Inhalational anesthesia has variable effects on IOP measurement at all stages of anesthesia. Caution should be taken when extrapolating the true IOP from these measurements.","Samy, Engy; El Sayed, Yasmine; Awadein, Ahmed; Gamil, Maha",International ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-021-01800-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759070/,218
106458,The effectiveness of ocriplasmin versus surgery for the treatment of macular holes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND There has been growing interest in the use of hypertonic sodium lactate (HSL) solution following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans. However, little is known about the effects of HSL on functional deficits with respect to the hyperosmotic nature of HSL. METHODS We have compared the effects of HSL solution and isotonic saline solution using sensorimotor and cognitive tests for 14 days post-trauma in animals. Thirty minutes after trauma (impact-acceleration model), anesthetized rats were randomly allocated to receive a 2-h infusion of isotonic saline solution (TBI-saline group) or HSL (TBI-HSL group) (n = 10 rats per group). In another series of experiments using a similar protocol, the effects of equiosmolar doses of HSL and hypertonic saline solution (HSS) were compared in TBI rats (n = 10 rats per group). Blood lactate and ion concentrations were measured during the 2-h infusions. RESULTS Compared to the TBI-saline group, the TBI-HSL group had a reduced latency to complete the adhesive removal test: 6 s (5-9) (median [25-75th centiles]) versus 13 s (8-17) on day 7, and 5 s (5-9) versus 11 s (8-26) on day 14 (P < 0.05), respectively, and a shorter delay to complete the radial arm maze test on day 7: 99 s (73-134) versus 176 s (127-300), respectively (P < 0.05). However, no differences were found between the TBI-HSL and TBI-HSS groups in neurocognitive tests performance. Compared to the TBI-saline group, the HSL and HSS groups had higher serum osmolality: 318 mOsm/Kg (315-321) and 315 mOsm/Kg (313-316) versus 307 mOsm/Kg (305-309), respectively (P < 0.05), and the HSL group had a higher serum lactate concentration: 6.4 mmol/L (5.3-7.2) versus 1.5 mmol/L (1.1-1.9) and 1.6 mmol/L (1.5-1.7), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that improvements in cognitive and sensorimotor tests with HSL infusion post-TBI could be related to elevation of serum osmolality, not to exogenous administration of lactate.","Crespy, Thibaud; Durost, Maxime; Fricault, Pierre; Lemasson, Benjamin; Bouzat, Pierre; Barbier, Emmanuel L; Payen, Jean-François",Neurocritical care,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-01090-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901380/,218
107024,Room Air for Initiating Term Newborn Resuscitation: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.,2019,"Background Over 5.8 million pediatric visits to rural emergency department (EDs) occur each year in the United States. Most rural EDs care for less than five pediatric patients per day and are not well prepared for pediatrics. Simulation has been associated with improvements in pediatric preparedness. The implementation of pediatric simulation in rural settings is challenging due to limited access to equipment and pediatric specialists. Telesimulation involves a remote facilitator interacting with onsite learners. This article aims to describe the implementation experiences and participant feedback of a 1-year remotely facilitated pediatric emergency telesimulation program in three critical-access hospitals. Methods Three hospitals were recruited to participate with a nurse manager serving as the on-site lead. The managers worked with a study investigator to set up the simulation technology during an in-person pilot testing visit with the off-site facilitators. A curriculum consisting of eight pediatric telesimulations and debriefings was conducted over a 12-month period. Participant feedback was collected via a paper survey after each simulation. Implementation metrics were collected after each session including technical and logistic issues. Results Of 147 participant feedback surveys 90% reported that pediatric simulations should be conducted on a regular basis and overall feedback was positive. Forty-seven of 48 simulations were completed on the first attempt with few major technologic issues. The most common issue encountered related to the simulator not working correctly locally and involved the facilitator running the session without the heart and lung sounds. All debriefings occurred without any issues. Conclusions This replicable telesimulation program can be used in the small, rural hospital setting, overcoming time and distance barriers and lending pediatric emergency medicine expertise to the education of critical-access hospital providers.","Auerbach, Marc; Patterson, Mary; Mills, William A; Katznelson, Jessica",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124506/,218
107119,"Magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis animal models: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and white paper.",2020-08-02,"BACKGROUND Endovascular procedures are standard of care for an increasing range of cerebrovascular diseases. Many endovascular devices contain plastic and are coated with a hydrophilic polymer which has been rarely described to embolize, resulting in distal granulomatous inflammatory lesions within the vascular territory. METHODS We reviewed three cases of cerebral granulomatous reactions that occurred after endovascular intervention for internal carotid aneurysms. The patient procedure details, presentation, relevant investigations, and treatment course are described. We also provide a literature review on endovascular granulomatous reactions. RESULTS These three cases represent the largest biopsy proven series of cerebral granulomatosis following endovascular intervention. We highlight the variable clinical presentation, with two of the three cases having an unusually delayed onset of up to 4 years following the intervention. We show the characteristic histological findings of granulomatous lesions with foreign body material consistent with a type IV reaction, radiological abnormalities of enhancing lesions within the vascular territory of the intervention, and the requirement of prolonged immunosuppression for maintenance of clinical remission, with two of the three patients requiring a corticosteroid sparing agent. In comparison with the available literature, in addition to hydrophilic gel polymer, we discuss that plastic from the lining of the envoy catheter may be a source of embolic material. We also discuss the recommendations of the Food and Drug Administration and the implementation of novel biomaterials for the prevention of these reactions in the future. CONCLUSIONS There is a need for increased awareness of this severe complication of cerebral endovascular procedures and further longitudinal studies of its prevalence, optimal management and preventative measures.","Boyle, Therese; Fernando, Suran L; Steinfort, Brendan; Li, Jamma; Krause, Martin; Harrington, Tim; Assaad, Nazih; Faulder, Ken",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722971/,218

METHODS Pre-planned analysis of patients included in the EPO-TBI (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00987454) trial who were randomized to weekly EPO (40 000 units) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) subcutaneously up to three doses or until intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Creatinine levels and urinary output (up to 7 days) were categorized according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification. Severity of TBI was categorized with the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI. RESULTS Of 3348 screened patients, 606 were randomized and 603 were analyzed. Of these, 82 (14%) patients developed AKI according to KDIGO (60 [10%] with KDIGO 1, 11 [2%] patients with KDIGO 2, and 11 [2%] patients with KDIGO 3). Male gender (hazard ratio [HR] 4.0 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-11.2, P = 0.008) and severity of TBI (HR 1.3 95% CI 1.1-1.4, P < 0.001 for each 10% increase in risk of poor 6 month outcome) predicted time to AKI. KDIGO stage 1 (HR 8.8 95% CI 4.5-17, P < 0.001), KDIGO stage 2 (HR 13.2 95% CI 3.9-45.2, P < 0.001) and KDIGO stage 3 (HR 11.7 95% CI 3.5-39.7, P < 0.005) predicted time to mortality. EPO did not influence time to AKI (HR 1.08 95% CI 0.7-1.67, P = 0.73) or creatinine levels during ICU stay (P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS Acute kidney injury is more common in male patients and those with severe compared to moderate TBI and appears associated with worse outcome.

Several commercial kits are available for RNA isolation from human whole blood; their resultant RNA yield and purity have not been reported for canine whole blood, to our knowledge. We assessed the performance of 4 RNA extraction kits (RiboPure, TRIzol, RNeasy Protect animal blood, and QIAamp RNA blood mini). Whole blood from a healthy dog was stored in the manufacturer-recommended RNA stabilizing buffer as directed. RNA isolation, including DNase treatment, was performed using each kit's manufacturer's protocol. Resultant RNA yield and purity were evaluated using spectrophotometric absorbance, capillary electrophoresis and electropherogram analysis, and a reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) assay. The RNeasy Protect animal blood kit extracted the highest, and RiboPure the lowest, concentration of nucleic acid.

109051,A prospective randomized multicenter comparison of balloon angioplasty and infrapopliteal stenting with the sirolimus-eluting stent in patients with ischemic peripheral arterial disease: 1-year results from the ACHILLES trial.,2012,"Oxidative stress - the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutralising antioxidants - has been under debate as the main cause of ageing in aerobial organisms. The level of ROS should increase during infection as part of the activation of an immune response, leading to oxidative damage to proteins, lipids and DNA. Yet, it is unknown how long-lived organisms, especially mammals, cope with oxidative stress. Bats are known to carry a variety of zoonotic pathogens and at the same time are, despite their high mass-specific basal metabolic rate, unusually long lived, which may be partly the result of low oxidative damage of organs. Here, we asked whether an immune challenge causes oxidative stress in free-ranging bats, measuring two oxidative stress markers. We injected 20 short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) with bacterially derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 20 individuals with phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) as a control. Individuals injected with LPS showed an immune reaction by increased white blood cell count after 24 h, whereas there was no significant change in leukocyte count in control animals. The biological antioxidant potential (BAP) remained the same in both groups, but reactive oxygen metabolites (ROMs) increased after treatment with LPS, indicating a significant increase in oxidative stress in animals when mounting an immune reaction toward the inflammatory challenge. Control individuals did not show a change in oxidative stress markers. We conclude that in a long-lived mammal, even high concentrations of antioxidants do not immediately neutralise free radicals produced during a cellular immune response. Thus, fighting an infection may lead to oxidative stress in bats.","Schneeberger, Karin; Czirják, Gábor Á; Voigt, Christian C",The Journal of experimental biology,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.090837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24031067/,218
109839,Effect of Hydrocortisone on 21-Day Mortality or Respiratory Support Among Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2020-09-02,"OBJECTIVES A diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) requires individuals to adopt a strict gluten-free diet (GFD). As children with CD must rely on their caregivers for guidance and support with managing the GFD, CD may challenge the caregiver's emotional and social well-being. The primary objective of this mixed-methods systematic review was to synthesize of research investigating the impact of CD on caregiver's well-being. METHODS Five databases were systematically searched from 1990-2018 to identify all empirical studies that assessed well-being in caregivers of children (0-18 years) with CD. Qualitative and quantitative data were extracted separately before being integrated to explore key themes across the studies. RESULTS 12 studies were identified that explored the well-being of caregivers of children with CD (3 qualitative, 9 quantitative), reporting on 665 caregivers. The quality of evidence was limited across studies. Synthesis of results revealed three themes (Caregiver Responsibility, Caregiver Well-Being and Concern for Child's Health, Implications for the Family) describing the impact of a child with CD on caregiver well-being. CONCLUSIONS Caregivers of children with CD may experience difficulties that impact their well-being; specific difficulties identified included the impact of caregivers' social activities, finances and anxiety. The findings detailed in this review point towards factors that may guide health care personnel to provide support for the caregivers of children with CD.","Satherley, Rose-Marie; Coburn, Shayna Skelley; Germone, Monique",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002572; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31789773/,218

We dosed all bears at 1 mL NalMed-A per estimated 45 kg body mass (1 mL NalMed-A/45 kg), delivered by intramuscular injection using a pole syringe, to facilitate routine examination and ear tagging. Arterial blood gases were measured to assess oxygenation and acid-base status of bears both pre and post oxygen supplementation. The mean (SE) dose calculated post hoc was 0.9 (0.04) mg nalbuphine/kg, 0.2 (0.01) mg azaperone/kg, and 0.2 (0.01) mg medetomidine/kg. The mean induction time was 8 (1) min for six of the bears in October and 6 (1) min for eight bears in May. The NalMed-A combination provided good sedation in captive yearling black bears in autumn and spring and was effectively antagonized with a combination of naltrexone and atipamezole. Mild hypoxemia (PaO2: 53.5-54.4 mmHg) was the most significant side effect and was corrected (PaO2: 68.4-150.1 mmHg) with supplemental oxygen administered at 2-5 L/min for 5 min (point of sampling).","Wolfe, Lisa L; Wood, Mary E; Fisher, Mark C; Sirochman, Michael A",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/2018-03-079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30016210/,218

MATERIALS AND METHODS Five patients presented T1a EL after endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms (EVAR) with radiological evidence of expanding sac size; in particular, three had contained rupture. In one patient, proximal cuff insertion was previously performed, in three patients proximal cuff was urgently inserted but T1a EL persisted; one patient, previously treated with Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System, was directly proposed for endovascular treatment. In all cases, endovascular embolization was successfully performed and the transfemoral approach was always chosen; in one case it failed and translumbar approach by direct puncture of the sac was required. Used embolization agents were glue, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (Onyx) and coils in three cases, n-butyl cyanoacrylate and Onyx in one case, Onyx and coils in the last case. RESULTS Technical success rate was 100% as well as clinical success. No major or minor complication, including non-target embolization, was registered. Clinical success was 100% until today and the sac diameter remained stable in four patients and decreased in one. CONCLUSIONS Onyx may be considered a suitable embolic agent in the treatment of patients with type Ia endoleaks after EVAR, after failure of conventional treatments such as prolonged balloon inflation of the aortic neck or deployment of large bare stent.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Franchin, Marco; Fontana, Federico; Piffaretti, Gabriele; Crippa, Matteo; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Magenta Biasina, Alberto; Piacentino, Filippo; Tozzi, Matteo; Pinto, Antonio; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-018-0885-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29654570/,218

112805,Acute supplementation with whey protein or collagen does not alter appetite in healthy women: A randomized double-blind and crossover pilot study.,2021-08-19,"OBJECT Tobacco smoking is one of the most important risk factors for the formation of intracranial aneurysms and for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages. Smoking has also been suggested to contribute to the recurrence of aneurysms after endovascular coiling. To improve the understanding of the impact of smoking on long-term outcomes after coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, the authors studied a consecutive contemporary series of patients treated at their institution. The aims of this study were to determine whether smoking is an independent risk factor for aneurysm recurrence and retreatment after endovascular coiling. METHODS All patients who had received an intrasaccular coil embolization of an intracranial aneurysm, who had undergone a follow-up imaging exam at least 6 months later, and whose smoking history had been recorded from January 2005 through December 2012 were included in this study. Patients were stratified according to smoking status into 3 groups: 1) never a smoker, 2) current smoker (smoked at the time of treatment), and 3) former smoker (quit smoking before treatment). The 2 primary outcomes studied were aneurysm recurrence and aneurysm retreatment after treatment for endovascular aneurysms. Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests were used to test statistical significance of differences in the rates of aneurysm recurrence, retreatment, or of both among the 3 groups. A multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for smoking status and for several characteristics of the aneurysm was also performed. RESULTS In total, 384 patients with a combined total of 411 aneurysms were included in this study. The aneurysm recurrence rate was not significantly associated with smoking: both former smokers (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.61-1.65; p = 0.99) and current smokers (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-1.09; p = 0.09) had odds of recurrence that were similar to those who were never smokers. Former smokers (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46-1.35; p = 0.38) had odds of retreatment similar to those of never smokers, and current smokers had a lower odds of undergoing retreatment (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91; p = 0.03) than never smokers. Moreover, an analysis adjusting for aneurysm rupture, diameter, and initial occlusion showed that former smokers (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.33-1.28; p = 0.21) and current smokers (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.60-1.81; p = 0.88) had odds of aneurysm recurrence similar to those who were never smokers. Adjusting the analysis for aneurysm rupture, diameter, and occlusion showed that both former smokers (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.23-1.05; p = 0.07) and current smokers (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.46-1.46; p = 0.50) had odds of retreatment similar to those of patients who were never smokers. CONCLUSIONS The results show that smoking was not an independent risk factor for aneurysm recurrence and aneurysm retreatment among patients receiving endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms at the authors' institution. Nonetheless, patients with intracranial aneurysms should continue to be counseled about the risks of tobacco smoking.","Brinjikji, Waleed; Lingineni, Ravi K; Gu, Chris N; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Cloft, Harry J; Ulsh, Lauren; Koeller, Kristen; Kallmes, David F",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.10.jns141035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25380112/,218

Because of their small size, low natural abundance and high sequence homology between family members they are challenging to detect using standard technologies suitable for use at the point-of-care. Herein we report the design, engineering and testing of a novel sensing strategy: electrochemically active molecular probes based on peptide nucleic acid (PNA) scaffolds for the detection of single-stranded oligonucleotides, in particular microRNAs (or miRs). As a proof-of-principle, a wide range of probes were designed and tested to detect miR-141, a known diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Optimal quantitative sensing of miR-141 was achieved via the first example of an electrochemical oligonucleotide-templated reaction (EOTR), whereby two PNA probes - functionalized with an aniline and a 1,4-catechol respectively - preferentially react with each other upon simultaneous hybridization to the same RNA target strand, serving here as a template. Quantitative, electrochemical detection of the product of this bio-orthogonal reaction showed direct correlation between adduct formation and miR-141 concentration. Coupling the specificity of OTR with the speed and sensitivity of electrochemical sensing delivers EOTRs as a promising new technique for fast, low-cost, quantitative and sequence-specific detection of short nucleic acids from liquid biopsies.","Gillespie, Philip; Channon, Robert B; Meng, Xiaotong; Islam, Md Nazmul; Ladame, Sylvain; O'Hare, Danny",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397596/,218
113422,Cardiology integration challenge and opportunity.,2011,"Altered olfactory function is a common symptom of COVID-19, but its etiology is unknown. A key question is whether SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) - the causal agent in COVID-19 - affects olfaction directly, by infecting olfactory sensory neurons or their targets in the olfactory bulb, or indirectly, through perturbation of supporting cells. Here we identify cell types in the olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulb that express SARS-CoV-2 cell entry molecules. Bulk sequencing demonstrated that mouse, non-human primate and human olfactory mucosa expresses two key genes involved in CoV-2 entry, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. However, single cell sequencing revealed that ACE2 is expressed in support cells, stem cells, and perivascular cells, rather than in neurons. Immunostaining confirmed these results and revealed pervasive expression of ACE2 protein in dorsally-located olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells and olfactory bulb pericytes in the mouse. These findings suggest that CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal cell types leads to anosmia and related disturbances in odor perception in COVID-19 patients.","Brann, David H; Tsukahara, Tatsuya; Weinreb, Caleb; Lipovsek, Marcela; Van den Berge, Koen; Gong, Boying; Chance, Rebecca; Macaulay, Iain C; Chou, Hsin-Jung; Fletcher, Russell B; Das, Diya; Street, Kelly; de Bezieux, Hector Roux; Choi, Yoon-Gi; Risso, Davide; Dudoit, Sandrine; Purdom, Elizabeth; Mill, Jonathan; Hachem, Ralph Abi; Matsunami, Hiroaki; Logan, Darren W; Goldstein, Bradley J; Grubb, Matthew S; Ngai, John; Datta, Sandeep Robert",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abc5801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937591/,218

We speculated that the COVID-19 lockdown regulations (travel restriction and alcohol ban) would affect trauma patterns. OBJECTIVES To compare the burden and nature of trauma over the COVID-19 lockdown period with the equivalent period over the past 5 years using routinely collected data from the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service in KwaZulu-Natal Province, SA. METHODS All trauma patients admitted to Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg between 23 March 2015 and 31 May 2020 were identified and reviewed. RESULTS A total of 8 859 trauma patients were admitted over the 6-year period, with a total of 1 676 admitted during the periods 23 March - 31 May. These 1 676 formed the study cohort. Of these patients, 998 had sustained blunt trauma, 665 penetrating trauma, and 13 a combination of blunt and penetrating trauma. A total of 14 categories of blunt trauma were reviewed, of which the three most common were assault, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) and pedestrian vehicle accidents (PVAs). Between 23 March and 31 May 2020, a total of 23 patients were victims of blunt assault. The median number of assault victims over the equivalent period during the previous 5 years was 48. The 5 preceding years had a median of 56 MVAs and 33 PVAs, compared with 23 and 10 during the lockdown. The median number of gunshot wound (GSW) victims for the preceding years was 41, compared with 30 during the lockdown. During the lockdown, 24 stab wound victims were admitted, compared with a median of 73 for the preceding years. The proportion of females who sustained penetrating trauma and blunt assault increased significantly during the lockdown. The proportion of females sustaining a GSW or blunt trauma secondary to an MVA remained constant. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that during the period of lockdown in SA there was a significant decrease in MVAs, PVAs and interpersonal violence. Assaults involving a knife seemed to decrease dramatically, but the rate of GSWs remained constant.","Zsilavecz, A; Wain, H; Bruce, J L; Smith, M T D; Bekker, W; Laing, G L; Lutge, E; Clarke, D L",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2020.v110i11.15124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403988/,218
114488,Retrograde cerebral venous air embolism following difficult intubation.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Oral anticancer drugs (OADs) have rapidly expanded with more than 70 OADs targeting several molecular targets. Many of the OADs exert an exposure-response relationship but still, a 'one-size fits-all' dose is used, ignoring interindividual variability. Several of these OADs share similar mechanisms of actions and thus target the same cancer and has resulted in a substantial research focus on comparing the health benefit of each. However, significantly less is known about the cost-benefit associated with OADs. This paper will provide a protocol to systematically review studies that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OADs and their associated individualised dosing interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published economic evaluation (costs and outcomes/benefits) studies of OADs and their associated individualised dosing interventions. Bibliographic databases (eg, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE) will be used to perform the systematic literature search (between 1 January 2000 and October 2020). Only full economic evaluations will be included, but no restrictions on study outcomes will be applied. The quality of included primary studies will be assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist for reporting economic evaluations. Studies with low-quality evidence will be excluded. A narrative synthesis of the results from the included studies will be undertaken, with a subgroup analysis where appropriate. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review will not require ethics approval as there will not be any collection of primary data. Findings of this review will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at workshops or conferences and sharing through a media release. Findings from this review will provide evidence to direct and inform policy-makers where cost-neutral strategies may be effective or where dose individualising strategies may be economically beneficial. Additionally, gaps will be identified in the current literature to inform future-related research. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER CRD42020218170.

A pooled meta-analysis.,2020-10-15,"PURPOSE To evaluate the utility of ultrasonographic assessment of blood flow to the lower limb below the cannulation site in minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS). METHODS Twenty-two patients who underwent ultrasonographic assessment in MICS were reviewed retrospectively. In all patients, the right femoral artery was used for arterial cannulation. Ultrasonographic assessment was performed using a 15-MHz ultrasonography small probe, and regional oxygen saturation was monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). RESULTS The mean flow velocity at the distal side of the cannulation site was 46.2 ± 25.4 cm/s. In six patients, a >40% decreased from baseline regional oxygen saturation was observed. In five of the six patients, the flow velocity was very slow, and spontaneous echo contrast was also observed in three cases. Their regional oxygen saturation was improved rapidly after distal leg perfusion. In the remaining case, the flow velocity was not decreased. In another one case, the stenosis at the cannulation site was detected after decannulation and repaired immediately. No limb ischemic complications were observed in this series. CONCLUSION Ultrasonographic assessment combined with the NIRS monitoring is useful to prevent lower limb ischemic complications after femoral arterial cannulation in MICS.","Hosono, Mitsuharu; Yasumoto, Hiroshi; Kuwauchi, Shintaro; Mitsunaga, Yoshino; Kanemoto, Shinya; Minato, Naoki; Kawazoe, Kohei",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,https://doi.org/10.5761/atcs.oa.21-00047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092724/,218

Various scaffold material, design, including their combination with several growth- induced substances and cells application have been being investigated and used in the area of nerve tissue engineering. However, the development remains challenges today because they are still far from ideal concerning their stability, reproducibility, including complicated handling related to the poor mechanical strength. In view of the current basis, in this study the introduction of carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) as promising candidate to increase mechanical properties of nerve scaffold is reported. The incorporation of CHA was not only expected to provide better mechanical properties of the scaffold. Under physiological condition, CHA is known to be the most stable phases of calcium phosphate compound. Therefore, CHA was expected to provide controlled release calcium for better axonal environment and promote fasten nerve regeneration. This study shows that CHA incorporated gelatin membrane has ideal microstructure to prevent fibrous tissue ingrowth into the injury site, while retaining its capability to survive nerve tissue by allowing adequate glucose and specific proteins diffusion. The provided Ca2+ release to the environment promoted neuronal growth, without suppressing acetylcholine esterase release activity. Neurite elongation was dramatically higher in the gelatin membrane incorporated with CHA. Introduction of CHA into gelatin membrane represents a new generation medical device for nerve reconstruction, with CHA was considered as a promising factor.","Ardhani, Retno; Ana, Ika Dewi; Tabata, Yasuhiko",Journal of biomedical materials research.

However, primary care practitioners in China use them as antipyretics, potentially exposing hundreds of millions to this risk. METHODS We enrolled all patients with confirmed pandemic influenza A (pH1N1) virus infection aged ≥3 years with available medical records at 4 Shenyang City hospitals from 20 October to 30 November 2009. A critical patient was any confirmed, hospitalized pH1N1 patient who developed ≥1 of the following: death, respiratory failure, septic shock, failure or insufficiency of ≥2 nonpulmonary organs, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission. In a retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the risk of developing critical illness in relation to early (≤72 hours of influenza-like illness [ILI] onset) glucocorticoids treatment. RESULTS Of the 83 hospitalized case-patients, 46% developed critical illness, 17% died, and 37% recovered and were discharged. Critically ill and other patients did not differ by underlying conditions and severity, median temperature at first clinic visit, and other measured risk factors. Of 17 patients who received early glucocorticoid treatment, 71% subsequently developed critical disease compared with 39% of 66 patients who received late (>72 hours) or no glucocorticoid treatment (RR(M-H) = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.8, after adjusting for 2 summary variables; ie, presence of underlying diseases and presence of underlying risk factors). Proportional hazards modeling showed that use of glucocorticoids tripled the hazard of developing critical disease (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.3-6.2, after adjusting for the same summary variables). CONCLUSIONS Early use of parenteral glucocorticoids therapy for fever reduction and pneumonia prevention increases the risk for critical disease or death from pH1N1 infection. We recommend that guidelines on glucocorticoid use be established and enforced.","Han, Ke; Ma, Huilai; An, Xiangdong; Su, Yang; Chen, Jing; Lian, Zhiyong; Zhao, JinHui; Zhu, Bao-Ping; Fontaine, Robert E; Feng, Zijian; Zeng, Guang",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21810744/,218

For decades, these viruses were not categorized using a typing system because they were considered to be antigenically and pathogenically similar. In the 1980s, a second major serotype, serotype 2, was found in turkeys. Classification of IBDV became more complex with the discovery of antigenic variant strains called ""variants"" in the United States and a highly virulent strain known as ""very virulent"" or vvIBDV identified in Europe. To distinguish the IBDV strains identified prior to this time from the antigenic variant viruses, the term ""classic viruses"" was adopted. Studies over the next three decades produced a wealth of information on the antigenicity, pathogenicity and molecular structure of IBDV isolates. These data made it clear that the descriptive nomenclature used for IBDV was inadequate. For example, not all viruses identified as vvIBDV by genotyping are highly pathogenic; some have reassorted genome segments that result in lower virulence. Furthermore, variant viruses are not an antigenically homogeneous group and the term ""classic virus"" has been used interchangeably to describe antigenic and pathogenic types of IBDV. These and other issues make the current naming system for strains of IBDV archaic. The lack of uniform testing and standards for antigenicity and pathogenicity makes it difficult to categorize IBDV strains on a global basis. A new nomenclature that includes a genotyping system that can easily be applied worldwide is proposed and serves as a platform to begin discussions on its value to the scientific community.","Jackwood, Daral J; Schat, Karel A; Michel, Linda O; de Wit, Sjaak",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2018.1506092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086652/,218

Many of these individuals will be facing the need for total hip or knee replacement. Currently, the age of onset of osteoarthritis continues to decrease and the need for total joint replacements continues to increase. In current practice, nearly all patients undergoing joint replacement receive similar preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management strategies. However, wide variability in outcomes and satisfaction with total joint replacement still remain. The key to understanding the cause for such varied outcomes may lie in our understanding of the genetic basis of degenerative joint disease. The future of ""orthogenomic"" research should be centered on clinical application focusing on early preoperative identification of at-risk patients. The goal is to establish twenty-first-century patient-specific strategies for optimizing results and expectations after adult reconstructive surgery.","Elbuluk, Ameer; Deshmukh, Ajit; Inneh, Ifeoma; Iorio, Richard",JBJS reviews,https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.rvw.o.00064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27487430/,218

This review overviews current development in tissue-engineered vascular grafts and discusses recent improvements in scaffolding techniques as well as the efficiency of gene-editing tools and their ability to fill the existing gaps in stem-cell and regenerative therapies. Current advances in 3D-printing approaches for fabrication of engineered tissues are also reviewed together with specific biomaterials for vascular tissues. In addition, the natural and synthetic polymers that hold increasing significance for vascular tissue engineering are highlighted. Both animal models and nanotechnology-based monitoring are proposed for pre-clinical evaluation of engineered grafts in view of their historical significance in tissue engineering.

Reaching them with effective prevention is a programmatic priority. The HIV prevention cascade can be used to track intervention coverage, and identify gaps and opportunities for programme strengthening. The aim of this study was to characterise gaps in condom use and identify reasons underlying these gaps among young women who sell sex (YWSS) in Zimbabwe using data from enrolment into an impact evaluation of the DREAMS programme. DREAMS provided a package of biomedical, social and economic interventions to AGYW aged 10 to 24 with the aim of reducing HIV incidence. METHODS In 2017, we recruited YWSS aged 18 to 24 using respondent-driven sampling in six sites across Zimbabwe. We measured knowledge about efficacy of, access to, and effective (consistent) use of condoms with the most recent three sexual partners, separately by whether YWSS self-identified as female sex workers (FSW) or not. Among YWSS without knowledge about efficacy of, not having access to, and not effectively using condoms, we described the potential reasons underlying the gaps in the condom cascade. To identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with effective condom use, we used logistic regression modelling. All analyses were RDS-II weighted and restricted to YWSS testing HIV-negative at enrolment. RESULTS We enrolled 2431 YWSS. Among 1842 (76%) YWSS testing HIV-negative, 66% (n = 1221) self-identified as FSW. 89% of HIV-negative YWSS demonstrated knowledge about efficacy of condoms, 80% reported access to condoms and 58% reported using condoms consistently with the three most recent sexual partners. Knowledge about efficacy of and effective use of condoms was similar regardless of whether or not YWSS self-identified as FSW, but YWSS self-identifying as FSW reported better access to condoms compared to those who did not (87% vs 68%; age- and site-adjusted (adjOR) = 2.69; 95% CI: 2.01 to 3.60; p < 0.001). Women who reported experiencing sexual violence in the past year and common mental disorder in the past week were less likely to use condoms consistently (43% vs. 60%; adjOR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.68; p < 0.001) and (51% vs. 61%; adjOR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.97; p = 0.029), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Despite high knowledge about efficacy of and access to condoms, there remain large gaps in self-reported consistent condom use among YWSS. Addressing the structural determinants of YWSS' inconsistent condom use, including violence, could reduce this gap. YWSS who do not self-identify as FSW have less access to condoms and may require additional programmatic intervention.","Chabata, Sungai T; Hensen, Bernadette; Chiyaka, Tarisai; Mushati, Phillis; Busza, Joanna; Floyd, Sian; Birdthistle, Isolde; Hargreaves, James R; Cowan, Frances M",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602611/,218

120091,"Nosocomial infections among patients with COVID-19, SARS and MERS: a rapid review and meta-analysis.",2020-05-01,"PURPOSE Severe hemorrhagic cystitis is a major complication in the pediatric population undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage as a treatment for severe hemorrhagic cystitis has rarely been investigated. We examined children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for risk factors associated with severe hemorrhagic cystitis, as well as our experience with percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement as an adjunctive management strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using prospectively collected data from the Blood and Marrow Transplant Database at the University of Minnesota, we reviewed 40 pediatric patients with severe hemorrhagic cystitis from 1996 to 2010. Specific treatment for each patient was administered at the discretion of the attending physician and generally included bladder irrigation before bladder fulguration or percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed in 11 patients due to the intractable nature of the hemorrhagic cystitis. RESULTS Of the 11 patients who underwent percutaneous nephrostomy tube drainage 5 (45%) had improvement of the hemorrhagic cystitis within 30 days and the same number had long-term resolution. Among the patients with long-term resolution hemorrhagic cystitis resolved an average of 12.4 days after percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, and the tubes were removed an average of 8.8 weeks after placement. Through September 2011 mortality among patients with percutaneous nephrostomy tubes was 55% (6 of 11 patients), which was identical to the overall mortality in the severe hemorrhagic cystitis group (22 of 40). No death could be directly attributed to hemorrhagic cystitis or percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. CONCLUSIONS Placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes for treatment of severe hemorrhagic cystitis results in long-term improvement in intractable hemorrhagic cystitis, and is a safe and viable option for the majority of patients.","Lukasewycz, Stephen J; Smith, Angela R; Rambachan, Aksharananda; MacMillan, Margaret L; Lewis, Jane M; Shukla, Aseem R",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2012.03.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22595064/,218

120820,Persistence With Dabigatran Therapy at 2 Years in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,2017,"OBJECTIVE To compare perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for hilar vs nonhilar tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study retrospectively reviewed 364 patients with available computed tomography scans undergoing RAPN. Demographic data and perioperative outcomes results were compared between the hilar (group 1, n = 70) and nonhilar tumors (group 2, n = 294). Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss (EBL), major perioperative complications, and postoperative renal function. RESULTS There were no differences with respect to demographic variables. Hilar tumors had higher RENAL (radius, exophytic/endophytic properties of the tumor, nearness of tumor deepest portion to the collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior descriptor and the location relative to polar lines) scores (P <.001) and were larger (3.9 vs 2.6 cm, P <.001). Surgeries for hilar tumors were associated with greater operative time (210 vs 180 minutes, P <.001), longer WIT (27 vs 17 minutes, P <.001), and increased EBL (250 vs 200 mL, P = .04). No differences were noted in transfusion rate, length of stay, complications (overall and major) and positive margins. Postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate showed no significant difference between hilar vs nonhilar patients on postoperative day 3 (70.12 vs 74.71 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P = .31) or at last follow-up (72.62 vs 75.78 mL/min/1.73 m(2), P = .40), respectively. Multivariate analysis found hilar location was independently associated with increased WIT without significant changes in EBL, major complications, or postoperative renal function. CONCLUSION RAPN represents a safe and effective procedure for hilar tumors. Hilar location for patients undergoing RAPN in a high-volume institution seems not be associated with an increased risk of transfusions, major complications, or decline of early postoperative renal function.","Eyraud, Rémi; Long, Jean-Alexandre; Snow-Lisy, Devon; Autorino, Riccardo; Hillyer, Shahab; Klink, Joseph; Rizkala, Emad; Stein, Robert J; Kaouk, Jihad H; Haber, Georges-Pascal",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2012.10.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23601446/,218

METHODS IntrePED was a retrospective study, while PUFS and ASPIRe were prospective studies. For each patient included in these studies, the authors collected baseline demographic data, aneurysm characteristics, and procedural details. The primary outcomes for this combined analysis were clinical outcomes, including neurological morbidity and mortality and major ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The secondary outcomes were angiographic occlusion rates, which were available for ASPIRe and PUFS only. RESULTS A total of 1092 patients with 1221 aneurysms were included across the 3 studies. The mean aneurysm size was 12.0 ± 7.8 mm and the mean neck size was 6.6 ± 4.8 mm. The major ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate was 3.7% (40/1091). The major ipsilateral intracranial hemorrhage rate was 2.0% (22/1091). The major neurological morbidity rate was 5.7% (62/1091). The neurological mortality rate was 3.3% (36/1091). The combined major morbidity and neurological mortality rate was 7.1% (78/1091). The complete occlusion rates were 75.0% at 180 days (111/148) and 85.5% at 1 year (94/110). The overall aneurysm retreatment rate was 3.0% (33/1091) at a mean follow-up time of 10.2 ± 10.8 months. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the PED is safe and effective. Angiographic occlusion rates progressed with follow-up. Rates of stroke, hemorrhage, morbidity and mortality, and retreatment were low, especially given the fact that the aneurysms treated were generally large and wide necked.","Kallmes, David F; Brinjikji, Waleed; Cekirge, Saruhan; Fiorella, David; Hanel, Ricardo A; Jabbour, Pascal; Lopes, Demetrius; Lylyk, Pedro; McDougall, Cameron G; Siddiqui, Adnan",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.8.jns16467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27791519/,218

However, the disruption also presents an opportunity for local museums to explore new modes of audience engagement that could also help to mitigate the negative health impact of COVID-19 through the imaginative use of technology. This article provides a snapshot of the various digital initiatives that were developed by museums in Singapore during the most challenging time of COVID-19 to exemplify the expanded role of museums as a public health resource. It will also offer a brief reflection on the challenges and benefits of curating wellbeing with digital technologies. STUDY DESIGN A review of creative responses to COVID-19 by museums in Singapore. METHODS Scoping search. RESULTS Several local museums have stepped up efforts to support the wellbeing of people by exploring possibilities with digital virtual platforms. Their swift response to develop online contents following an abrupt closure due to the pandemic exemplifies the caring role of museums in offering people a much-needed respite from social isolation by connecting and interacting with others from a safe distance. Moving forward, it is also important for the museums to be mindful of the barriers that digital virtual platforms might present; since access to technology differs amongst population groups, as do digital competency, and literacy. Museums can benefit from further partnerships with sector experts and organisations to learn about the needs and challenges of different groups in future planning and design. This will help them to gather a holistic overview and help ensure inclusionary strategy and practice.

Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) allows for the quantification of bioenergetic molecules, containing high-energy phosphates, over the whole brain as well as measuring the differences between gray matter and white matter. We recruited 50 subjects with a current diagnosis of MDD, not currently treated with psychotropic medication, between ages of 18 and 65 (mean±SD age: 43.4±13.6; 46% female) and 30 healthy volunteers, matched for age and gender (39.0±12.5 years of age; 36.6% female). All subjects received a T1 MP-FLASH scan for tissue segmentation followed by 31P MRS, chemical shift imaging scan with 84 voxels of data collected over the entire brain utilizing a dual-tuned, proton-phosphorus coil to minimize subject movement. Phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate (Pi) varied in opposite directions across gray matter and white matter when MDD subjects were compared with controls. This finding suggests alterations in high-energy phosphate metabolism and regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in MDD patients. In addition, within the MDD group, gray matter Pi, a regulator of oxidative phosphorylation, correlated positively with severity of depression. These data support a model that includes changes in brain bioenergetic function in subjects with major depression.","Harper, David G; Jensen, J Eric; Ravichandran, Caitlin; Perlis, Roy H; Fava, Maurizio; Renshaw, Perry F; Iosifescu, Dan V",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2016.180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585738/,218

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS During total tonsillectomy exclusively performed with EC, air was sampled with a surgeon-worn portable particle counter. The airborne mean and maximum particle concentrations were compared for tonsillectomy performed with EC at 12 W vs 20 W, with smoke evacuation system (SES) and no smoke evacuation (NS). RESULTS A total of 36 children were included in this analysis: 9 cases with EC at 12 W and SES (12SES), 9 cases with EC at 20 W and SES (20SES), 9 cases with EC at 12 W without SES (12NS), and 9 cases with EC at 20 W without SES (20NS). Mean particle number concentration in the breathing zone during tonsillectomy was 1661 particles/cm3 for 12SES, 5515 particles/cm3 for 20SES, 8208 particles/cm3 for 12NS, and 78,506 particles/cm3 for 20NS. There was a statistically significant difference in the particle number concentrations among the 4 groups. The correlation between the particle number concentration and EC time was either moderate (for 12SES) or negative (for remaining groups). CONCLUSION Airborne particle concentrations during tonsillectomy are over 9.5 times higher when EC is set at 20 W vs 12 W with NS, which is mitigated to 3.3 times with SES. Applying lower EC settings with SES during pediatric tonsillectomy significantly reduces surgical plume exposure for patients, surgeons, and operating room personnel, which is a well-known occupational health hazard.","Carr, Michele M; Patel, Vijay A; Soo, Jhy-Charm; Friend, Sherri; Lee, Eun Gyung",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820914275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228131/,218
128628,The breakthrough balloon for critical limb ischemia?,2011,"Background and purpose - In recent years motorized intramedullary lengthening nails have become increasingly popular. Complications are heterogeneously reported in small case series and therefore we made a systematic review of complications occurring in lower limb lengthening with externally controlled motorized intramedullary bone lengthening nails. Methods - We performed a systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library with medical subject headings: Bone Nails, Bone Lengthening, and PRECICE and FITBONE nails. Complications were graded on severity and origin. Results - The search identified 952 articles; 116 were full text screened, and 41 were included in the final analysis. 983 segments were lengthened in 782 patients (age 8-74 years). The distribution of nails was: 214 FITBONE, 747 PRECICE, 22 either FITBONE or PRECICE. Indications for lengthening were: 208 congenital shortening, 305 acquired limb shortening, 111 short stature, 158 with unidentified etiology. We identified 332 complications (34% of segments): Type I (minimal intervention) in 11% of segments; Type II (substantial change in treatment plan) in 15% of segments; Type IIIA (failure to achieve goal) in 5% of segments; and Type IIIB (new pathology or permanent sequelae) in 3% of segments. Device and bone complications were the most frequent. Interpretation - The overall risk of complications was 1 complication for every 3 segments lengthened. In 1 of every 4 segments, complications had a major impact leading to substantial change in treatment, failure to achieve lengthening goal, introduction of a new pathology, or permanent sequelae. However, as no standardized reporting method for complications exists, the true complication rates might be different.","Frost, Markus W; Rahbek, Ole; Traerup, Jens; Ceccotti, Adriano A; Kold, Søren",Acta orthopaedica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17453674.2020.1835321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106069/,218

We found that small molecule 2-(1H-indole-3-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), an endogenous aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist, can block more than one mode of glioma cell migration, based on cultured cell behavior captured by videos. Data from wound-healing assays and mouse xenograft glioma models corroborated ITE's migration-inhibiting effects while knocking down AHR by siRNA abolished these effects. To identify genes that mediated ITE-AHR's effect, we first collected gene expression changes upon ITE treatment by RNA-seq, then compared them against literature reported migration-related genes in glioma and that were potentially regulated by AHR. MYH9, a component of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), was confirmed to be reduced by ITE treatment. When MYH9 was overexpressed in the glioma cells, a good correlation was observed between the expression level and the cell migration ability, determined by wound-healing assay. Correspondingly, overexpression of MYH9 abrogated ITE's migration-inhibiting effects, indicating that ITE-AHR inhibited cell migration via inhibiting MYH9 expression. MYH9 is essential for cell migration in 3D confined space and not a discovered target of AHR; the fact that ITE affects MYH9 via AHR opens a new research and development avenue.","Zhao, Lijiao; Shu, Qiuting; Sun, Hui; Ma, Yunlong; Kang, Dandan; Zhao, Yating; Lu, Jing; Gong, Pei; Yang, Fan; Wan, Fang",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2616930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083460/,218

These deformations make use of the remarkable material properties of biological membranes inherent in their nature as two-dimensional fluids. The curvature of membranes is controlled by the constituent proteins and lipids, but conversely, curvature itself provides mechanisms for organizing mobile membrane molecules. In this article we survey recent experiments that have uncovered intriguing connections between mechanics and biochemistry at membranes, focusing on the influence of molecular shape on curvature, links between phase separation and curvature, and membrane bending at inter-cellular contacts. We describe the concepts that emerge from these studies, especially the existence of long-range, curvature-mediated mechanisms for spatial organization in membranes, and highlight open areas for future research.","Parthasarathy, Raghuveer; Groves, Jay T",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b608631d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680189/,218

(2) To understand how these interventions can take account of mental health, discussing the relative strengths of a number of different one-to-one and group-based interventions. METHODS Qualitative case study of Age Better in Sheffield (ABiS), an initiative to address loneliness and isolation among older people (aged above 50). 37 beneficiaries of voluntary sector interventions participated in the study: 17 had accessed a one-to-one intervention and 20 had accessed group-based activities. RESULTS One-to-one therapeutic interventions are beneficial when loneliness is associated with low psychological and emotional wellbeing stemming from trauma and other complex pre-existing issues that have left individuals unable to build social relationships and networks. One-to-one peer-to-peer interventions are beneficial for individuals whose loneliness is linked to low psychological and emotional wellbeing but for whom their issues are less complex. Group-based interventions are beneficial when loneliness is linked to social wellbeing and individuals want to build social networks and relationships and contribute to their community. Participants should be supported to access other forms of support if the benefits of the initial intervention are to be sustained. CONCLUSIONS There is an interconnected relationship between loneliness and the emotional, psychological and social components of mental health that should be taken into account in the design of interventions. A range of one-to-one and group-based interventions are necessary to meet the varying needs and circumstances of older people experiencing loneliness. Public health commissioners should invest in an ecosystem of voluntary organisations providing different types of loneliness intervention if the epidemic of loneliness is to be addressed.","Dayson, Chris; Harris, Catherine; Woodward, Abigail",Perspectives in public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/17579139211017580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34120519/,218

This product was made to be used in hospitals and at homes. BACKGROUND Mauritius is among the few countries, which has not had any cases of COVID-19 since for since May 2020 for a period of 150 days. It has opened its borders since October 2020, and since Mauritius being a small country, the spread of any type of virus can be imminent if not controlled properly. In case there is another spread of the COVID-19 in Mauritius, then the isolation pod could be used to keep infected people in quarantine. The aims of the study were to develop a prototype of an isolation cubicle that is collapsible and can be easily erected at homes or in hospitals, whenever the need arises. METHODS A prototype of the pod was made with metal bars welded together and tarpaulin materials were sewn together. A HEPA Fan Extractor was fitted inside the pod to allow the air to circulate. RESULTS the tests carried out the pod could easily be assembled, transported and stored for further usage. From the volunteers' feedback, it was found that the pod was comfortable, spacious, and practical.

We aimed to analyse if laboratory exams, risk assessment scores, comorbidity scores were useful in predicting the VTE in SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted in internal medicine (IM). We evaluated 49 older adults with suspected VTE analysing history and blood chemistry, besides we calculated the Padua Prediction Score, the modified early warning scoring (MEWS) and the modified Elixhauser index (mEI). All patients underwent venous color-doppler ultrasounds of the lower limbs. Out of the 49 patients enrolled (mean age 79.3±14 years), 10 (20.4%) had deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and they were more frequently female (80% vs 20%, p = 0.04). We could not find any association with the Padua Prediction Score, the MEWS, and the mEI. D-dimer plasma levels were also not associated with DVT. In elderly people hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in IM, our data, although limited by the sample size, suggest that prediction and diagnosis of VTE is difficult, due to lack of precise biomarkers and scores.","De Giorgi, Alfredo; Contini, Carlo; Greco, Salvatore; Fabbian, Fabio; Gasbarro, Vincenzo; Zuliani, Giovanni; Passaro, Angelina; Zenunaj, Gladiol; Manfredini, Roberto",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106886/,218

Reports on the association of frailty with poor outcome have been conflicting. OBJECTIVE The aim of the present study was to investigate the independent association between frailty and in-hospital mortality in older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands. METHODS This was a multicentre retrospective cohort study in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, including all patients aged ≥70 years, who were hospitalised with clinically confirmed COVID-19 between February and May 2020. Data were collected on demographics, co-morbidity, disease severity and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS A total of 1,376 patients were included (median age 78 years (interquartile range 74-84), 60% male). In total, 499 (38%) patients died during hospital admission. Parameters indicating presence of frailty (CFS 6-9) were associated with more co-morbidities, shorter symptom duration upon presentation (median 4 versus 7 days), lower oxygen demand and lower levels of C-reactive protein. In multivariable analyses, the CFS was independently associated with in-hospital mortality: compared with patients with CFS 1-3, patients with CFS 4-5 had a two times higher risk (odds ratio (OR) 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-3.0)) and patients with CFS 6-9 had a three times higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.8-4.3)). CONCLUSIONS The in-hospital mortality of older hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands was 38%. Frailty was independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality, even though COVID-19 patients with frailty presented earlier to the hospital with less severe symptoms.","Blomaard, Laura C; van der Linden, Carolien M J; van der Bol, Jessica M; Jansen, Steffy W M; Polinder-Bos, Harmke A; Willems, Hanna C; Festen, Jan; Barten, Dennis G; Borgers, Anke J; Bos, Jeannet C; van den Bos, Frederiek; de Brouwer, Esther J M; van Deudekom, Floor J A; van Dijk, Suzanne C; Emmelot-Vonk, Mariëlle H; Geels, Raya E S; van de Glind, Esther M M; de Groot, Bas; Hempenius, Liesbeth; Kamper, Ad M; Kampschreur, Linda M; de Koning, Marre M M; Labots, Geert; Looman, Roy; Lucke, Jacinta A; Maas, Huub A A M; Mattace-Raso, Francesco U S; El Moussaoui, Rachida; van Munster, Barbara C; van Nieuwkoop, Cees; Oosterwijk, Leanne B L E; Regtuijt, Marlies E M; Robben, Sarah H M; Ruiter, Rikje; Salarbaks, Aisha M; Schouten, Henrike J; Smit, Orla M; Smits, Rosalinde A L; Spies, Petra E; Vreeswijk, Ralph; de Vries, Oscar J; Wijngaarden, Marjolein A; Wyers, Caroline E; Mooijaart, Simon P",Age and ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951156/,218

AIMS To evaluate persistence of biological agents in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and the effects of immunomodulator use and treatment lines. METHODS Retrospective national population-based data on treatment persistence for adalimumab, infliximab vedolizumab and ustekinumab for CD and UC were analysed from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS There were 2499 patients included with 8219 person-years of follow-up. In CD patients ustekinumab had increased persistence compared to anti-TNF agents (HR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.32-2.38, P < 0.01). Twelve-month CD persistence rates were ustekinumab 80.0%, vedolizumab 73.5%, infliximab 68.1% and adalimumab 64.2% (P = 0.01). In moderate-severe UC vedolizumab had increased persistence compared to anti-TNF agents (HR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.27-2.18 P < 0.001). Twelve-month UC persistence rates were vedolizumab 73.4%, infliximab 61.1% and adalimumab 45.5% (P < 0.001). Immunomodulator co-therapy did not significantly increase persistence in non-anti-TNF therapy (P > 0.05). Thiopurines increased persistence of anti-TNF agents in CD (P < 0.001) and UC (P = 0.03). Methotrexate co-therapy increased persistence of anti-TNF agents in CD (P = 0.001) only. First-line therapy was superior to non-first line in persistence (P < 0.001). In fistulising CD, the persistence of infliximab and adalimumab was not significantly different (P = 0.11). CONCLUSION Persistence was highest in ustekinumab in CD and vedolizumab in UC.

Limited understanding of complications in cancer progression, its development system, and their interactions are major restrictions towards the progress of optimal and effective treatment strategies. The system-level approach has been designed to explore genetic complexity of the disease and to identify novel oral cancer related genes to detect genomic alterations at molecular level, through cDNA differential analysis. We analyzed 21 oral cancer-related cDNA datasets and listed 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among 30, we found 6 significant DEGs including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ADCY2, C7, SERPINB5, and ANAPC13 and studied their functional role in OC. Our genomic and interactive analysis showed significant enrichment of xenobiotics metabolism, p53 signaling pathway and microRNA pathways, towards OC progression and development. We used human proteomic data for post-translational modifications to interpret disease mutations and inter-individual genetic variations. The mutational analysis revealed the sequence predicted disordered region of 14%, 12.5%, 10.5% for ADCY2, CYP1B1, and C7 respectively. The MiRNA target prediction showed functional molecular annotation including specific miRNA-targets hsa-miR-4282, hsa-miR-2052, hsa-miR-216a-3p, for CYP1B1, C7, and ADCY2 respectively associated with oral cancer. We constructed the system level network and found important gene signatures. The drug-gene interaction of OC source genes with seven FDA approved OC drugs help to design or identify new drug target or establishing novel biomedical linkages regarding disease pathophysiology. This investigation demonstrates the importance of system genetics for identifying 6 OC genes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, ADCY2, C7, SERPINB5, and ANAPC13) as potential drugs targets. Our integrative network-based system-level approach would help to find the genetic variants of OC that can accelerate drug discovery outcomes to develop a better understanding regarding treatment strategies for many cancer types.","Abbas, Syeda Zahra; Qadir, Muhammad Imran; Muhammad, Syed Aun",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71346-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887903/,218

In the present study, we report the first case of narcolepsy diagnosed at the district, with a complete medical history, objective examinations, and cerebrospinal fluid and hematological tests, but no cataplexy. Mutiple sleep latentcy test (MSLT) showed that the average sleep latency was 3.1 min, and abnormal REM sleep episodes were detected in 4 naps. The average REM latency was 1.3 min. We review the knowledge and researches on this disease in Mainland China in the past 10 years. Data from China in 2014 showed a significant increase in the incidence of narcolepsy in 2011 after the H1N1 epidemic in China in 2009. Despite the low incidence rate, diagnosis of narcolepsy is still confusing and needs clinicians' attention. Whether the incidence of narcolepsy may increase after covid19 remains to be observed.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021,"BACKGROUND Intracranial in-stent hyperplasia is a stroke-associated complication that requires routine surveillance. OBJECTIVE To compare the results of in vivo experiments to determine the accuracy and precision of in-stent hyperplasia measurements obtained with modified C-arm contrast-enhanced, cone-beam CT (CE-CBCT) imaging with those obtained by 'gold standard' histomorphometry. Additionally, to carry out clinical analyses comparing this CE-CBCT protocol with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS A non-binned CE-CBCT protocol (VasoCT) was used that acquires x-ray images with a small field-of-view and applies a full-scale reconstruction algorithm providing high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging with 100 µm isotropic voxels. In an vivo porcine model, VasoCT cross-sectional area measurements were compared with gold standard vessel histology. VasoCT and DSA were used to calculate in-stent stenosis in 23 imaging studies. RESULTS Porcine VasoCT cross-sectional stent, lumen, and in-stent hyperplasia areas strongly correlated with histological measurements (r(2)=0.97, 0.93, 0.90; slope=1.14, 1.07, and 0.76, respectively; p<0.0001). Clinical VasoCT percentage stenosis correlated well with DSA percentage stenosis (r(2)=0.84; slope=0.76), and the two techniques were free of consistent bias (Bland-Altman, bias=3.29%; 95% CI -14.75% to 21.33%). An illustrative clinical case demonstrated the advantages of VasoCT, including 3D capability and non-invasive IV contrast administration, for detection of in-stent hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS C-arm VasoCT is a high-resolution 3D capable imaging technique that has been validated in an animal model for measurement of in-stent tissue growth.

DISCUSSION Several eponyms are used in the literature to denote different antireflux operations: Nissen, Nissen-Rossetti, Toupet, Lind, Guarner, Hill, and Dor. We feel that it is more important to focus on the technical elements which make a fundoplication effective and long lasting. The type of fundoplication (total vs. partial) is tailored to the quality of esophageal peristalsis as documented by the preoperative manometry. In the USA, a partial fundoplication is chosen only for patients with very impaired or absent esophageal peristalsis. CONCLUSION This article describes the technique of laparoscopic total fundoplication for GERD. Partial fundoplication is performed following the same technical elements as the total fundoplication. A 240° to 270° wrap rather than a 360° wrap is performed.","Allaix, Marco E; Herbella, Fernando A; Patti, Marco G",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-2068-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23129120/,218

The aim of this study was to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic-during the Italian lockdown period between 8 March and 4 May 2020-influenced orthopaedic access for traumatic events to the Emergency Department (ER). METHODS A retrospective review of the admission to the emergency room and the discharge of the trauma patients' records was performed during the period between 8 March and 4 May 2020 (block in Italy), compared to the same period of the previous year (2019). Patients accesses, admissions, days of hospitalisation, frequency, fracture site, number and type of surgery, the time between admission and surgery, days of hospitalisation, and treatment cost according to the diagnosis-related group were collected. Chi-Square and ANOVA test were used to compare the groups. RESULTS No significant statistical difference was found for the number of emergency room visits and orthopaedic hospitalisations (p < 0.53) between the year 2019 (9.5%) and 2020 (10.81%). The total number of surgeries in 2019 was 119, while in 2020, this was just 48 (p < 0.48). A significant decrease in the mean cost of orthopaedic hospitalisations was detected in 2020 compared (261.431 euros, equal to - 52.07%) relative to the same period in 2019 (p = 0.005). Although all the surgical performances have suffered a major decline, the most frequent surgery in 2020 was intramedullary femoral nailing. CONCLUSION We detected a decrease in traumatic occasions during the lockdown period, with a decrease in fractures in each district and a consequent decrease in the diagnosis-related group (DRG).","Testa, Gianluca; Sapienza, Marco; Rabuazzo, Fabrizia; Culmone, Annalisa; Valenti, Fabiana; Vescio, Andrea; Pavone, Vito",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02754-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34654447/,218

The necessity of caspase-3 in neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity has been summarized in pathological pain. Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein 1 (LRRTM1) mediates synaptic delivery of AMPA receptor and synaptogenesis. This study evaluated whether caspase-3 and LRRTM1 are required for fracture-associated postoperative allodynia. METHODS A model of tibial fracture with intramedullary pinning in mice was established for the induction of postoperative pain, verified by measurement of mechanical paw withdrawal threshold and cold scores response to acetone. The caspase-3 specific inhibitor, recombinant caspase-3 and LRRTM1 knockdown by shRNA were utilized for the investigation of pathogenesis as well as the prevention of allodynia. Also, the activity of caspase-3 and the expression of LRRTM1 in the spinal dorsal horn were examined by Western blot and RT-qPCR. RESULTS This study reported that tibial fracture and orthopedic surgery produced long-lasting mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia, along with the up-modulation of spinal caspase-3 activity (but not caspase-3 expression) and LRRTM1 expression. Spinal caspase-3 inhibition prevented fracture-associated behavioral allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-3 inhibitor also reduced the spinal increased LRRTM1 level after tibial fracture with pinning. Spinal LRRTM1 deficiency impaired fracture-caused postoperative pain. Intrathecal recombinant caspase-3 facilitated acute pain hypersensitivity and spinal LRRTM1 expression in naïve mice, reversing by LRRTM1 knockdown. CONCLUSION Our current results demonstrate the spinal up-regulation of LRRTM1 by caspase-3 activation in the development of tibial fracture-associated postoperative pain in mice.","Zhang, Linlin; Li, Jing; Li, Yize; Wang, Zhen; Wang, Guolin; Yu, Yonghao; Song, Chengcheng; Cui, Wei",Neuroscience letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069813/,218

Herein, a new strategy for precise separation of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors from the rhizome of Corydalis yanhusuo (RCY) using counter-current chromatography (CCC) guided by molecular docking and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was established. First, representative alkaloids from RCY were docked with LSD1 for screening active skeleton compounds. Simultaneously, the crude extract of RCY was preliminarily separated via pH-zone refining CCC. Subsequently, guided by LC-MS/MS analysis of the fragmentation pathways, three potential active fractions were obtained, followed by further online-storage and recycling CCC separation. Finally, three high-purity target quaternary alkaloids compound 3 (dehydrocorydaline), 7 (coptisine), and 8 (columbamine) were successfully isolated as a new class of potential natural LSD1 inhibitors by only one CCC instrument with multiple modes. Compound 3, with the highest LSD1 inhibition ratio of 2.44 μM, was tested for its ability to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis in U2OS cells. Therefore, the CCC separation guided by virtual screening is a promising method for the targeted isolation of enzyme inhibitors from medicinal herbs.","Lin, Yaolan; Luo, Jianguang; Li, Lingnan; Liu, Xiaoqin; Wang, Wenli; Zhu, Li; Han, Chao; Kong, Lingyi",Journal of chromatography.

Given their broad host-spectrum and disease endemicity in several developing countries, it is imperative to elucidate the viral evolutionary insights for their dynamic pathobiology and differential host-selection. For this purpose, a dataset of all available (n = 37) PPRV sequences originating from wild and unusual hosts was composed and in silico analysed. Compared to domestic small ruminant strains of same geographical region, phylogenomic and residue analysis of PPRV sequences originating from wild and unusual hosts revealed a close relationship between strains. A lack of obvious difference among the studied sequences and deduced residues suggests that these are the host factors that may play a role in their susceptibility to PPRV infection, immune response, pathogenesis, excretion patterns and potential clinical signs or resistance to clinical disease. Summarizing together, the comparative analysis enhances our understanding towards molecular epidemiology of the PPRV in wild and unusual hosts for appropriate intervention strategies particularly at livestock-wildlife interface.","Rahman, Aziz-Ul-; Munir, Muhammad; Shabbir, Muhammad Zubair",Molecular biology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-04973-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317455/,218

The aim of this study was to identify and understand vaccination rates in Canadian patients with RA. METHODS We conducted an observational study to evaluate uptake of herpes zoster (HZ), influenza and pneumonia vaccination in a cross-section of patients with RA in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire in patients attending at an academic rheumatology clinic. If vaccination was not received, the reason was established. RESULTS Ninety-eight out of a total of 103 patients surveyed met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated: 72.4% had received the influenza vaccination in the past year encompassing a period of 2017-2019. Of the 27.6% who did not, the most common chosen reason was personal preference not to get vaccinated (55.6%). Regarding HZ, 18.4% had received vaccination. Of the 2 available types of vaccines, more participants received Zostavax (66.7%) as compared to Shringrix (33.3%). For those not vaccinated (81.6%), ""Other"" was the most chosen option (37.5%) with the reasons subsequently specified as cost, concern over interaction with treatment and waiting until age ≥65 years. In terms of pneumococcal vaccination, 36.7% were vaccinated, with the majority being vaccinated with Pneumovax-23 (63.9%) compared to Prevnar-13 (16.7%) or both (19.4%). Of the 63.3% of the participants who did not receive vaccination, the most cited reason was they did not know they should receive pneumococcal vaccination (48.4%).

The UNESCO World Heritage site ""Venice and its Lagoon"", is one of the top tourist destinations in the world. Mass tourism increases marine litter, water traffic emissions, solid waste, and sewage release. Plastic marine litter is not only a major aesthetic problem diminishing tourists experience of Venice, it also leaches contaminants into the seawater. Since there is a dearth in the literature regarding microplastic leachable compounds and overtourism related pollutants, the project studied the Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) molecular fingerprint of volatile lagoon water pollutants, to gain insight into the extent of this phenomenon in August 2019. The chromatographic analyses enabled the identification of 40 analytes related to the presence of polymers in seawater, water traffic, and tourists habits. In Italy, on the 10th March 2020, the lockdown restrictions were enforced to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection; the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice came to a halt, and the ever-growing presence of tourists suddenly ceased. This situation provided a unique opportunity to analyze the environmental effects of restrictions on VOCs load in the Lagoon. 17 contaminants became not detectable after the lockdown period. The statistical analysis indicated that the amounts of many other contaminants significantly dropped. The presence of 9 analytes was not statistically influenced by the lockdown restrictions, probably because of their stronger persistence or continuous input in the environment from diverse sources. Results signify a sharp and encouraging pollution decrease at the molecular level, concomitant with the anthropogenic stress release, even if it is not possible to attribute quantitatively the VOCs load variations to specific sources (e.g., tourists' habits, urban water traffic, plastic pollution).","Cecchi, Teresa",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146951; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865119/,218

This type I membrane-anchored protein has a catalytically active ectodomain that undergoes shedding. Tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE) has been shown to be involved in ACE2 shedding. Although pathophysiological significance of ACE2 shedding has been suggested, regulation of this process by TACE is not clearly defined. We characterized TACE-mediated constitutive ectodomain shedding of ACE2 using wild-type Chinese Hamster Ovary (WT-CHO), the TACE-mutant M2 (M2-CHO) cells, and EC-4 and EC-2 cells that are fibroblasts from wild-type and TACE-null mice, respectively. ACE2 was constitutively cleaved to release two distinct major soluble forms. The deglycosylated molecular masses of the larger (LSF) and smaller soluble form (SSF) were approximately 80 and 70 kDa, respectively. These forms had equivalent enzyme activities. Reduced shedding for the LSF from M2-CHO and EC-2 cells when compared with WT-CHO and EC-4 cells, respectively, was noted. TACE reconstitution in EC-2 cells expressing ACE2 resulted in increase in LSF but not SSF release, demonstrating a main role of TACE in LSF release and distinct regulations of release of the two soluble forms. Deletions of the juxtamembrane region of ACE2 reduced LSF release in CHO cell lines, whereas it abolished TACE-induced shedding in EC-2 cells. Analysis of TACE structural domains confirmed that the active site in the catalytic domain is essential for ACE2 shedding but that noncatalytic domains also play additional roles. These results demonstrate selective and specific regulation of constitutive shedding of ACE2 by TACE.","Iwata, Michikado; Silva Enciso, Jorge E; Greenberg, Barry H",American journal of physiology.

Efficacy and safety of vaccination, particularly live-attenuated viral vaccines in these patients remain a concern. Areas covered: To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of viral vaccines in children and young people treated with systemic immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune diseases. A systemic literature review was performed using Pubmed including English papers in subjects less than 21 years old. Viral vaccines were generally immunogenic and safe in children receiving immunosuppressive drugs, including biologics. Use of low-dose prednisolone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs did not significantly impact on vaccine immunogenicity, although there was anecdotal evidence of reduced immunogenicity in patients receiving high-dose prednisolone/methylprednisolone and pulse cyclophosphamide. Patients on biologics mounted adequate seroprotective responses, but antibody titers tended to be lower. Both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Autoimmune disease activity was not adversely affected by vaccination. Expert opinion: Current evidence indicates that administration of viral vaccines to children with autoimmune diseases receiving most systemic immunosuppressive drugs is immunogenic and safe. MMR can safely be given to most patients receiving biologics, but patients on high-dose prednisolone and pulse cyclophosphamide should avoid MMR and other live viral vaccines.","Tse, Hiu Nam; Borrow, Ray; Arkwright, Peter D",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1875825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33507119/,218

The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive examination of the relationship between multiple measures corticospinal excitability and clinical disability in MS (expanded disability status scale (EDSS)). Bilateral corticospinal excitability was assessed using motor evoked potential (MEP) input-output (IO) curves, cortical silent period (CSP), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF) and transcallosal inhibition (TCI) in 26 individuals with MS and 11 healthy controls. Measures of corticospinal excitability were compared between individuals with MS and controls. We evaluated the relationship(s) between age and clinical demographics such as age at MS onset (AO), disease duration (DD) and clinical disability (EDSS) with measures of corticospinal excitability. Corticospinal excitability thresholds were higher, MEP latency and CSP onset delayed and MEP durations prolonged in individuals with MS compared to controls. Age, DD and EDSS correlated with corticospinal excitability thresholds. Also, TCI duration and the linear slope of the MEP amplitude IO curve correlated with EDSS. Hierarchical regression modeling demonstrated that combining multiple TMS-based measures of corticospinal excitability accounted for unique variance in clinical disability (EDSS) beyond that of clinical demographics (AO, DD). Our results indicate that multiple TMS-based measures of corticospinal and interhemispheric excitability provide insights into the potential neural mechanisms associated with clinical disability in MS.

METHODS We reviewed consecutive patients with aneurysms undergoing Pipeline embolization for an aneurysm using the biaxial system from April to October 2015 at a major academic institution in the United States. Benchmark performance was measured by the number of 90° turns the catheter could safely cross. Landing and final positions of the Benchmark were recorded. RESULTS A total of 26 procedures were performed in 25 patients (mean age 59.5 ± 10.3 years; male:female = 1:4). In one case (3.8%) the biaxial system had to be substituted for a traditional triaxial system. The Benchmark was able to cross one, two, or three 90° turns in 48%, 40%, and 8% of cases, respectively. There was one (3.8%) thromboembolic event and no arterial dissections. In the period from January 2014 to March 2015 and prior to adopting the biaxial system we encountered three thromboembolic events (6.4%) and one (2.1%) dissection potentially related to the triaxial system in 47 PED procedures. CONCLUSION Preliminary experience shows that a biaxial system using the Benchmark is a safe and efficacious alternative to the traditional triaxial guide catheter system for placement of PED and may reduce the complexity and duration of the procedure.","Patel, Apar S; Griessenauer, Christoph J; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Thomas, Ajith J","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019916632490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26908590/,218
145518,Pulmonary effects of dexmedetomidine infusion in thoracic aortic surgery under hypothermic circulatory arrest: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.,2021-05-26,"INTRODUCTION Streptococcus pneumoniae with a mucoid-type capsule is associated with invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs). Despite the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines, IPDs caused by mucoid-type isolates are still prevalent. The present study aimed to characterize mucoid-type S. pneumoniae isolated from IPD patients throughout Japan in 2017 (post-vaccination era). METHODS A total of 225 mucoid-type isolates were collected. The serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, and multilocus sequence type of these isolates were determined. RESULTS The prevalence of IPDs caused by mucoid-type isolates was high in adults, especially in the elderly (≥65 years of age), and prognosis in these patients was significantly poor. Of the mucoid-type isolates, the predominant serotype was serotype 3 (84.4%), and the remaining were serotypes 37 (15.1%) and 8 (0.4%). Antimicrobial susceptibility showed that most mucoid isolates exhibited the penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae genotype (gPISP). However, the serotype 3 isolate exhibited the penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae genotype (gPRSP). This gPRSP isolate was classified into ST166, which is related to serotypes 9 V and 11 strains. Sequence analysis of the capsule-coding regions and its flanking regions indicated that recombination occurred upstream and downstream of the capsule-coding region, suggesting that gPRSP (serotype 9 V/ST166) obtaining the type-3 capsule gene cluster resulted in the emergence of gPRSP (serotype 3/ST166). CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicated that IPDs caused by mucoid-type S. pneumoniae are still a serious concern and mucoid-type S. pneumoniae with novel phenotype could emerge via capsular switching in response to environmental changes such as introduction of vaccines and improper use of antimicrobial agents.","Ubukata, Kimiko; Wajima, Takeaki; Takata, Misako; Murayama, Somay Y; Morozumi, Miyuki; Mukae, Hiroshi; Ishida, Tadashi; Miyairi, Isao; Kiyota, Hiroshi; Iwata, Satoshi",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004265/,218

Several communications have reported that regardless of body mass index (BMI), complete or partial remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is possible. These results mostly occur before weight loss, positioning metabolic surgery as a good tool for controlling the current T2DM epidemic. Medical treatment is evolving, but is expensive and not risk-free. Surgery aimed mainly at diseases such as diabetes and not weight loss are referred to as ""metabolic surgery.""

Our hypothesis was that recurrent prolapse at 1 year would be more likely after a supracervical robotic hysterectomy (SRH) compared with a total robotic hysterectomy (TRH) at the time of robotic sacrocolpopexy (RSCP) for uterovaginal prolapse. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 83 women who underwent hysterectomy with RSCP over a 24-month period (40 with TRH and 43 with SRH). At 1 year post-procedure, subjects completed validated questionnaires regarding pelvic floor symptoms, sexual function, and global satisfaction, and underwent a pelvic examination to identify mesh exposure and evaluate pelvic floor support. RESULTS Demographics of the two groups were similar, except for a higher mean body mass index in the TRH group (31.9 TRH vs 25.8 SRH kg/m(2), p < 0.001). The rate of recurrent prolapse ≥ stage II was higher for women who underwent SRH compared with TRH (41.9 % vs 20.0 %, p = 0.03; OR 2.8, 95 % CI, 1.07-7.7). However, when this was analyzed as recurrence ≥ hymen, there was no difference between groups (12.5 % TRH vs 18.6 % SRH, p = 0.45). Likewise, there was no difference between groups when a composite measure of success was used (30 out of 40 [75 %] TRH vs 29 out of 43 [67.4 %] SRH, p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS Women who underwent an SRH were 2.8 times more likely to have a recurrent prolapse, ≥ stage II, at 1 year, compared with those who underwent a TRH, but when composite assessment scores were used there was no difference between the groups.","Myers, Erinn M; Siff, Lauren; Osmundsen, Blake; Geller, Elizabeth; Matthews, Catherine A",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-014-2551-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366305/,218

147664,"Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in ADHD: A Systematic Review of Efficacy, Safety, and Protocol-induced Electrical Field Modeling Results.",2020-05-16,"BACKGROUND Discovered in 2019 in the region of Wuhan, China, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly established itself as a major pathogenic agent of morbidity and mortality. France has implemented a strategy to fight this virus which relies essentially on widespread RT-PCR virological testing in order to isolate positive patients. Antigenic tests have recently been made available to help the diagnostics. We have conducted a retrospective study to determine the sensitivity of these antigenic tests, comparing them to the reference RT-PCR method. METHOD Between December 7, 2020 and January 31, 2021, each patient we received in our laboratories for an RT-PCR test was enrolled. Out of 271,649 patients, 4,881 had been submitted to an antigenic test (TDR) in the preceding 24 hours. Comparing the data resulting from both tests, we established the sensitivity and the specificity of the antigenic tests. For our analysis we included the parameter of symptom and/or the value of Cycles threshold (Ct) in our parameters. RESULTS The sensitivity of the TDRs compared to all the positive RT-PCR tests is 56%. We further demonstrate the correlation between the symptom duration and the reduction of the nasopharyngeal viral load. Based on this data, we have established that the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases very rapidly after symptom onset, contrary to the estimated viral load in the RT-PCR. Indeed, less the 24 hours after clinical symptom onset, the sensitivity of the TDRs decreases from 74% to 60%. By including the Ct value in our parameters, we have established that, despite a high viral load and clinical symptoms since 7 days or less, the sensitivity of the TDRs is 66%. Although, a high number of asymptomatic patients among carriers of SARS-CoV-2, we have estimated a specificity of 93% for our test. CONCLUSIONS Performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the TDR, as assessed in practice, are inferior to those given by the manufacturer, which raises several questions. What is the impact of falsely negative results for patients carrying a high viral load? Are the implemented measures sufficient to prevent the epidemic?","Bernard, Mathieu; Cosentino, Gina; Pieri, Laura; Zachary, Pierre; Buser, Michael; Kbaier, Laurent; Giannoli, Jean-Marc",Annales de biologie clinique,https://doi.org/10.1684/abc.2021.1641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985935/,218

METHODS We examined 265 vertigo/dizziness outpatients at the ear, nose, and throat department of the Nara Medical University between March 01, 2020, and May 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We also focused on 478 vertigo/dizziness outpatients between March 01, 2019, and May 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, to compare the number of cancellations between these 2 periods. The reasons for cancellation and noncancellation were investigated using telephone multiple-choice questionnaires (telMCQs), particularly for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Meniere's disease (MD). RESULTS There were many cancellations for medical examinations during the 2020 study period. The total number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients decreased by 44.6% in the 2020 period compared to the same period in 2019. The percent reduction in clinic attendance from 2019 to 2020 (ie, [2019-2020]/2019) for patients with BPPV was higher than that for patients with MD. Compared to the other vertigo-associated conditions, patients with MD exhibited a lower percent reduction in clinic attendance. According to the results of the telMCQs, 75.0% of BPPV cases and 88.2% of MD cases cancelled their appointment and gave up visiting hospitals due to fear of COVID-19 infection, even if they had moderate to severe symptoms. On the contrary, 25.0% and 80.0% patients with BPPV and MD, respectively, did not cancel their appointment; they should not have visited the hospital but stayed at home because they had slight symptoms. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that advanced forms should be prepared for medical care, such as remote medicine. These forms should not only be for the disease itself but also for the mental distress caused by persistent symptoms.","Ueda, Keita; Ota, Ichiro; Yamanaka, Toshiaki; Kitahara, Tadashi","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320980186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33295213/,218

The future course of this pandemic is still an enigma, but health care services are expected to resume soon in a phased manner. This might be a long drawn process and we need to have policies in place, to be able to fight both, the SARS-CoV-2 virus and cancer, simultaneously, and emerge triumphant. An extensive literature search for impact of delay in management of various urological malignancies was carried out. Expert opinions were sought wherever there was paucity of evidence, in order to reach a consensus and come up with recommendations for directing uro-oncology services in the times of COVID-19. The panel recommends deferring treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma by 3 to 6 months, except for those with ongoing hematuria and/or inferior vena cava thrombus, which warrant immediate surgery. Metastatic renal cell cancers should be started on targeted therapy. Low grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancers can be kept on active surveillance while high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancers and muscle invasive bladder cancers should be treated within 3 months. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided. Management of low and intermediate risk prostate cancer can be deferred for 3 to 6months while high risk prostate cancer patients can be initiated on neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy. Patients with testicular tumors should undergo high inguinal orchiectomy and be treated according to stage without delay, with stage I patients being offered surveillance. Penile cancers should undergo penectomy, while clinically negative groins can be kept on surveillance. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be avoided and adjuvant therapy should be deferred.

While patients with COVID-19 most frequently present with pneumonia, respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, increasing cases of immune-mediated disorders such as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia and antiphospholipid syndrome have been reported. In this article we describe a rare case of cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS) in a patient with COVID-19. The patient was a 77-year-old man with a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency who presented with COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory failure. Initially he was started on intravenous steroids, antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine. Laboratory analysis revealed haemolytic anaemia with a positive direct anti-globulin test (DAT) and high titres of cold agglutinins. Hydroxychloroquine was stopped due to suspicion of haemolysis due to G6PD deficiency but the haemolysis persisted. Unfortunately, the respiratory failure progressed and the patient died. In summary, this article describes a rare case of CAS associated with COVID-19. CAS is a heterogenous group of cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemias occurring secondary to infections or malignancies.

The patients were selected according to their primary pathology and their medical history for this preliminary experience. Four of them presented a rectal prolapse associated or not with a vaginal prolapse and the last patient presented a recurrent rectal prolapse 5 years after a laparoscopic repair. The study was approved by our local ethics committee. The robot da Vinci Si (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA) was used with a 4-port setting in all cases.

Evidence from prior epidemics suggests increased alcohol consumption during quarantine and times of high stress are associated with a greater chance of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study examines alcohol sales data to ascertain how individuals are interacting with alcohol during the pandemic.Materials and method: Monthly off premises alcohol sales data for select US alcoholic beverage control states were used to construct monthly sales patterns from 2015 to 2020. An independent samples t-test was used to determine if COVID-19 era alcohol sales were higher than those that occurred from 2015 to 2019.Results: Alcohol sales from March to August 2020 were significantly higher than sales from the same span of months from 2015 to 2019 (t=-2.47, p<.05). The associated monthly percentage increase in sales ranged from 14 to 44% with the overall trend indicating a move toward pre-pandemic sales totals.Conclusion: As COVID-19 continues to disrupt typical ways of being across the globe, the implications of increased sales of alcohol should not be overlooked. Taken together, the evidence on increased use during isolation and later AUD diagnosis coupled with the ABC state sales figures here, point to a potential increase in the development of AUD and an increase in alcohol-related harms.","Morton, Cory M",Substance abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1856293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709878/,218

We examined whether ED crowding was associated with perceptions of interpersonal care in patients evaluated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS Patients presenting to a quaternary academic medical centre ED in New York City for evaluation of suspected ACS were enrolled between November 2013 and December 2016. ED crowding was measured using the ED Work Index (EDWIN), which incorporates patient volume, triage category, physician staffing and bed availability. Patients completed the 18-item Interpersonal Processes of Care (IPC) survey, which assesses communication, patient-centred decision-making and interpersonal style. Regression analyses examined associations between EDWIN and IPC scores, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities and depression. RESULTS Among 933 included patients, 11% experienced ED overcrowding (EDWIN score >2) at admission, 11% experienced ED overcrowding throughout the ED stay and 30% reported suboptimal interpersonal care (defined as per-item IPC score <5). Higher admission EDWIN score was associated with modestly lower IPC score in both unadjusted (β=-1.70, 95% CI -3.15 to -0.24, p=0.02) and adjusted models (β = -1.77, 95% CI -3.31 to -0.24, p=0.02).

We formulated a prevention and control plan for clinical laboratories responsible for detection of the novel coronavirus infection. We analyzed the implementation of this plan and the problems arising from its clinical practice. We found that the layout of most clinical laboratories (including gene amplification laboratories for clinical samples) was inadequate in response to a major outbreak and did not meet the requirements for biosafety protection and etiology and serology testing; and laboratory staff showed insufficiencies in their awareness regarding biosafety protection; the functions and status of the laboratory in the fever clinic need to be enhanced to increase its detection capacity; the high density of military personnel, the low level of automation of clinical laboratory equipment, and the lack of biosafety cabinets and personal protective equipment all limit the performance of diverse military operations and major overseas missions. In view of these problems, we propose the following strategies and recommendations: the clinical laboratory needs to standardize the design and staff management according to the standards of P2 laboratory; the detection capacity and staffing of fever clinic laboratory in hospitals need to be strengthened, and a separate clinical gene amplification laboratory can be optimal; for those clinical gene amplification laboratories that fail to meet these standards, reconstruction and upgrade should be made according to the requirements of biosafety protection; for the clinical laboratory in the military medical system, in addition to enforcement of biological safety protection of the staff, sufficient supply of medical materials and biological safety equipment should be ensured and biological safety cabinets should be routinely equipped if possible.","Hang, Jianfeng; Sun, Zhaohui; Li, Linhai",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.04.25; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895124/,218
153041,Author response: Degree of serotonin reuptake inhibition of antidepressants and ischemic risk: A cohort study.,2020-08-04,"Background: Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is achieved in a health system when all residents of a country are able to obtain access to adequate healthcare and financial protection. Achieving this goal requires adequate healthcare and healthcare financing systems that ensure financial access to adequate care. In Africa, accessibility and coverage of essential health services are very low. Many African countries have therefore initiated reforms of their health systems to achieve universal health coverage and are advanced in this goal. The aim of this paper is to examine the effects of UHC on equitable access to care in Africa. Methods: A systematic review guided by the Cochrane Handbook was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria (PRISMA). Studies were eligible for inclusion if 1- they clearly mention studying the effect of UHC on equitable access to care, and 2- they mention facilitating factors and barriers to access to care for vulnerable populations. To be included, studies had to be in English or French. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, our systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on April 24, 2018 (registration number CRD42018092793). Results: In all 271 citations reviewed, 12 studies were eligible for inclusion. Although universal health coverage seems to increase the use of health services, shortages in human resources and medical supplies, socio-cultural barriers, physical inaccessibility, lack of education and information, decision-making power, and gender-based autonomy, prenatal visits, previous experiences, and fear of cesarean delivery were still found to deter access to, and use of, health services. Discussion: Barriers to greater effectiveness of the UHC correspond to various non-financial barriers. There are no specific recommendations for these kinds of barriers. Generally, it is important for each country to research and identify contextual uncertainties in each of the communities of the territory. Afterwards, it will be necessary to put in place adapted strategies to correct these uncertainties, and thus to work toward a more efficient system of UHC, resulting in positive impacts on health outcomes.","Sanogo, N'doh Ashken; Fantaye, Arone Wondwossen; Yaya, Sanni",Frontiers in public health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080792/,218

Hemorrhoidopexy, an alternative treatment for hemorrhoids introduced in the late nineties, replaced hemorrhoid excision by a reduction of the hemorrhoids to their normal anatomical position, via an excision of a mucosal ring above the internal hemorrhoidal cushions. The latter excision results in minimal or no postoperative pain. In 2010, a new variant of the hemorrhoidopexy set was introduced in the European market. The variations of this set, including a detachable anvil and a lined proctoscope, aid the surgeon in performing an easier and safer hemorrhoidopexy.","Pramateftakis, M G; Pavlidis, L; Koumourtzis, M; Sxisas, N; Rampiadou, C",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-012-0907-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23076287/,218

METHODS The Japan Surgical Society conducted a nationwide survey on pregnancy and childbirth among its members who are women. The questionnaire included items regarding demography, working styles, and pregnancy and childbirth, including adverse events and harassment. RESULTS The response rate was 29.9% (1068 responses, median age, 37 years). Among the responders, 61% were married and 47% had children (average number of children, 1.7). Half of the respondents reported having experienced sexual harassment and 62% reported having received unwelcome comments about pregnancy. About 20% had undergone fertility treatment. In total, 51% had pregnancies, with miscarriages in 33% of these. The top answer for the best timing for pregnancy and childbirth was after becoming board-certified. Nearly one-third of first-time mothers experienced adverse events during pregnancy and delivery, and 28% quit or changed their job because of their pregnancy and the birth of their first child. CONCLUSIONS Japanese women who choose a career as a surgeon face obstacles during pregnancy and childbirth. It is vital to share the findings of this study and understand the issues associated with pregnancy and childbirth regardless of gender. Interventions are essential to ensure that every pregnant surgeon has a safe working environment to allow unobstructed development of her career.","Kawase, Kazumi; Nomura, Kyoko; Nomura, Sachiyo; Akashi-Tanaka, Sadako; Ogawa, Tomoko; Shibasaki, Ikuko; Shimada, Mitsuo; Taguchi, Tomoaki; Takeshita, Emiko; Tomizawa, Yasuko; Hanazaki, Kazuhiro; Hanashi, Tomoko; Yamauchi, Hideko; Yamashita, Hiroko; Nakamura, Seigo",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-020-02129-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901376/,218

While this access technique was first described in 2007 for colorectal resective procedures, large series are lacking. METHODS Between January 2009 and October 2010, all patients undergoing single port colorectal surgery performed by a single surgeon were prospectively entered into an IRB-approved database and studied with regard to perioperative events, morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS One hundred and two consecutive patients underwent a single port colorectal procedure. Mean age was 47 years (9-93 years), and average body mass index was 26 kg/m(2) (15-39 kg/m(2)). Primary diagnoses included ulcerative colitis (51), neoplasia (23), Crohn's disease (14), diverticulitis (11), familial adenomatous polyposis (1), and other (2). Procedures included 23 total colectomies, 40 segmental colectomies, and 19 other procedures. There was 1 conversion to an open operation, and 18 (18%) patients required placement of additional ports (1 port: N = 13; 2 ports: N = 2; 3 ports: N = 3). Average operating room time was 99 min (13-245), mean length of incision was 3.7 cm (1.2-7.8 cm), and average estimated blood loss was 140 ml (0-750 ml). There was one postoperative death, and 39 (38%) patients experienced minor postoperative complications. Mean lymph node harvest for oncologic resections was 44 (14-142). The average length of hospital stay was 5.9 days (2-24 days). CONCLUSIONS With proper patient selection and laparoscopic experience, single port colorectal surgery can be performed for even the most complex colorectal procedures. Further studies are needed to assess the benefits that single port colorectal surgery has over a conventional laparoscopic approach.","Geisler, D; Garrett, T",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-011-0756-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887555/,218

156051,The use of barbed suture for laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2014,"In 2012, the Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Family Planning Law, a landmark legislation billed as a multisectoral and rights-based approach to further sustainable human development. This article is part of the first comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of the law by national-level actors. This evaluation is intended to assess the progress of implementers in the conduct of mandates, roles, and responsibilities described in the law and its implementing guidelines. Interviews with key national government officials and data from official documents and literature revealed 3 major trends in governance and implementation from 2014 to 2020. First, despite being a multisectoral policy, performance was siloed within individual units of implementing agencies, with limited interagency coordination. Second, although the law explicitly called for interventions to invest in human capital and address socioeconomic disparities for sustainable human development, performance focused on biomedical and health interventions, particularly in the area of family planning. Third, national-level governance for reproductive health interventions concentrated on programmatic and operational concerns. Overall, this case in the Philippines illustrates that fragmented implementation has contributed to the slow improvement of reproductive health outcomes. This study highlights the challenges of governance and multisectoral coordination to implement multidimensional interventions in a low- and middle-income country, and it provides potential areas for political and administrative reform in reproductive health governance in the Philippines. By creating a common narrative and onboarding multiple sectors, officials can better identify and address structural determinants with holistic policy solutions to improve reproductive health outcomes.","Van, Vanessa T Siy; Uy, Jhanna; Bagas, Joy; Ulep, Valerie Gilbert T","Global health, science and practice",https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-21-00184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593581/,218

METHODS By retrospective case note, review data were collected for all patients who underwent prosthetic breast reconstruction with the aid of FHD between January 2014 and August 2015 in our institution. Data on basic demographic parameters, risk factors, surgery-related factors, post-operative factors and follow-up information were collected. All complications were recorded and described in detail. RESULTS FHD was used in 42 breast reconstructions in 26 patients. Procedure-related complications were seen in 26% (n = 11) of cases. A major complication requiring return to theatre was seen in 11% (n = 5) of cases. Cellulitis of the reconstructed breast (red breast syndrome) was seen in 16.67% (n = 7) cases. Overall implant loss was 2.4% (n = 1). Of the six possible risk factors for any complication, only current smoking was found to increase the risk of complications (odds ratio = 9.667, 95% confidence interval = 1.429-65.377). CONCLUSION FHD is associated with a relatively high overall complication rate. Use of this optional expensive material has to be carefully selected balancing its perceived advantages against this possible risk. The red breast syndrome merits further studies considering its frequent occurrence with FHD use.","James, Justin; Corrigan, Brigid; Saunders, Christobel",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.13857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727237/,218

157950,Corticosteroids in the Management of Pregnant Patients With Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).,2021-02-01,"In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, China and presented a major threat to public health. Nationwide, there were more than 70,000 confirmed cases, and 2500 deaths. Most patients were elderly, with severe disease. For acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses in respiratory secretions. Coronavirus RNA can be detected from nose and throat swabs, sputum and other lower respiratory tract secretions, blood and feces. Such specimens were examined by RT-PCR. Three targets, RdRP, E and N genes were detected, indicating samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2]. After patient recovery, a chest CT examination, combined with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, confirmed diagnosis. However, some recovery patients with negative RNA tests turned RNA positive. The preliminary data is about 14% of discharged patients in Guangdong reported by the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC). This is an important scientific issue. If samples are positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, patients should be managed according to infection source. Fortunately, there were no close contacts of second-generation cases. We herein report six SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed in our hospital, for the changes of results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA should attract attention. Most patients were elderly, with a low Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). However, the association of the phenomenon with aging and GNRI has not yet been reported in detail. Further investigations are necessary to confirm and improve these findings. Similarly, discharged patient follow-up should be strengthened. This article is protected by copyright.

158179,Administration of benralizumab in a patient with severe asthma admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 pneumonia: case report.,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND We studied the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 905 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex (IKHC), Tehran, Iran. METHODS COVID-19 patients were recruited based on clinical symptoms and patterns of computed tomography (CT) imaging between February 20 and March 19. All patients were tested for the presence of COVID-19 RNA. The Poisson regression model estimated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for different parameters. RESULTS The average age (± standard deviation) was 56.9 (±15.7) years and 61.77% were male. The most common symptoms were fever (93.59%), dry cough (79.78%), and dyspnea (75.69%). Only 43.76% of patients were positive for the RT-PCR COVID-19 test. Prevalence of lymphopenia was 42.9% and more than 90% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or C-reactive protein (CRP). About 11% were severe cases, and 13.7% died in the hospital. The median length of stay (LOS) was 3 days. We found higher risks of mortality in patients who were older than 70 years (IRR = 11.77, 95% CI 3.63-38.18), underwent mechanical ventilation (IRR = 7.36, 95% CI 5.06-10.7), were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (IRR = 5.47, 95% CI 4.00-8.38), tested positive on the COVID-19 test (IRR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.64-3.55), and reported a history of comorbidity (IRR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-2.89) compared to their corresponding reference groups. Hydroxychloroquine therapy was not associated with mortality in our study. CONCLUSION Older age, experiencing a severe form of the disease, and having a comorbidity were the most important prognostic factors for COVID-19 infection. Larger studies are needed to perform further subgroup analyses and verify high-risk groups.","Allameh, Seyed Farshad; Nemati, Saeed; Ghalehtaki, Reza; Mohammadnejad, Esmaeil; Aghili, Seyed Mojtaba; Khajavirad, Nasim; Beigmohammadi, Mohammad-Taghi; Salehi, Mohammadreza; Mirfazaelian, Hadi; Edalatifard, Maryam; Kazemizadeh, Hossein; Dehghan Manshadi, Seyed Ali; Hasannezhad, Maliheh; Amoozadeh, Laya; Radnia, Masoud; Khatami, Seyedeh Rana; Nahvijou, Azin; Seyyedsalehi, Monireh Sadat; Rashidian, Laleh; Ayoobi Yazdi, Niloofar; Nasiri Toosi, Mohsen; Sadeghniiat-Haghighi, Khosro; Jafarian, Ali; Yunesian, Masud; Zendehdel, Kazem",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33220695/,218

159880,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Animal Studies Testing Intra-Arterial Chilled Infusates After Ischemic Stroke.,2020,"BACKGROUND Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a highly prevalent hip disease among children. However, its pathogenesis remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are important regulators of cartilage development. In a previous study, high-throughput miRNA sequencing of tissue samples from an animal model of DDH showed a low level of miR-1-3p in the cartilage of the acetabular roof (ARC), but its role in DDH pathogenesis was not addressed. Therefore, our aim here was to investigate the effects of miR-1-3p in the ARC. METHODS The diagnosis of acetabular dysplasia was confirmed with X-ray examination, while imaging and HE staining were conducted to further evaluate the ARC thickness in each animal model. FISH was employed to verify miR-1-3p expression in the ARC and chondrocytes. The miR-1-3p target genes were predicted by a bioinformatics database. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the targeting relationship between miR-1-3p and SOX9. The gene expression of miR-1-3p, SOX9, RUNX2 and collagen type X was evaluated by qPCR analysis. The protein expression of SOX9, RUNX2 and collagen type X was detected by western blot analysis. The levels of SOX9, RUNX2, and collagen type X in the ARC were further assessed via immunohistochemistry analysis. Finally, Alizarin Red S staining was used to observe the mineralized nodules produced by the chondrocytes. RESULTS We observed low expression of miR-1-3p in the ARC of animals with DDH. SOX9 is a miR-1-3p target gene. Using miR-1-3p silencing technology in vitro, we demonstrated significantly reduced chondrocyte-generated mineralized nodules compared to those of the control. We also confirmed that with miR-1-3p silencing, SOX9 expression was upregulated, whereas the expression of genes associated with endochondral osteogenesis such as RUNX2 and collagen type X was downregulated. To confirm the involvement of miR-1-3p silencing in abnormal ossification through SOX9, we also performed a rescue experiment in which SOX9 silencing restored the low expression of RUNX2 and collagen type X produced by downregulated miR-1-3p expression. Finally, the elevated SOX9 levels and reduced RUNX2 and collagen type X levels in the ARC of rabbits with DDH were also verified using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blots. CONCLUSION The relatively low expression of miR-1-3p in the ARC may be the cause of abnormal endochondral ossification in the acetabular roof of animals with DDH.","Ding, Rui; Liu, Xijuan; Zhang, Jian; Yuan, Jinghong; Zheng, Sikuan; Cheng, Xigao; Jia, Jingyu",Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-021-02666-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407854/,218

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2019,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW In this review, we discuss achievements in immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients published at last 18 months. RECENT FINDINGS Results of recent trials with everolimus in low-risk primary kidney transplant recipients suggest that lowTAC/EVR combination is noninferior and CMV and BKV viral infections are less frequent to standTAC/MPA. Iscalimab monoclonal antibody, which prevents CD40 to CD154 binding, has just recently entered phase II clinical studies in kidney transplantation. Eculizumab, anti-C5 monoclonal antobody was recently shown to improve outcomes in DSA+ living-donor kidney transplant recipients requiring pretransplant desensitization because of crossmatch positivity.

Numerous US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization (EUA) and laboratory-developed test (LDT) serologic assays have become available. The performance characteristics of these assays and their clinical utility continue to be defined in real time during this pandemic. The AACC convened a panel of experts from clinical chemistry, microbiology, and immunology laboratories; the in vitro diagnostics industry; and regulatory agencies to provide practical recommendations for implementation and interpretation of these serologic tests in clinical laboratories. CONTENT The currently available EUA serologic tests and platforms, information on assay design, antibody classes including neutralizing antibodies, and the humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are discussed. Verification and validation of EUA and LDT assays are described, along with a quality management approach. Four indications for serologic testing are outlined. Recommendations for result interpretation, reporting comments, and the role of orthogonal testing are also presented. SUMMARY This document aims to provide a comprehensive reference for laboratory professionals and healthcare workers to appropriately implement SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays in the clinical laboratory and to interpret test results during this pandemic.

160618,Macronutrient Supplements in Preterm and Small-for-Gestational-Age Animals: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2019,"Background Survivors of stroke face movement disability and increased cardiovascular disease and stroke risk. Treatment includes rehabilitation focused on functional movement with less emphasis on aerobic capacity. After rehabilitation, survivors of stroke must self-manage activity with limited appropriate community programs. Lack of structured activity contributes to sedentary behavior. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to review aerobic programs for stroke survivors similar in activity and dosage to cardiac rehabilitation programs to determine their efficacy for improving aerobic and walking capacity. Methods and Results Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to review 5 databases. Group interventions for survivors of stroke with a primary aerobic component and dosage from 18 to 36 visits over 8 to 18 weeks (matching cardiac rehabilitation requirements in the United States) were included. The 6-minute walk test, maximal oxygen consumption (VO2) peak, and walking speed were included as measures of aerobic capacity. Summary effect sizes and outcome measure mean differences were calculated for preintervention to postintervention, and summary effect sizes were calculated for preintervention to follow-up. Activity type and initial 6-minute walk test moderator analyses were performed. Nineteen studies with 23 eligible groups were selected. Survivors of stroke improved their composite aerobic capacity with an effect size of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.27-0.49). Studies including 6-minute walk test demonstrated a pooled difference in means of 53.3 m (95% CI, 36.8-69.8 m). Follow-up data were inconclusive. Conclusions Survivors of stroke benefit from aerobic programs with similar dosing to cardiac rehabilitation in the United States. The potential integration into existing programs could expand the community exercise options.","Regan, Elizabeth W; Handlery, Reed; Beets, Michael W; Fritz, Stacy L",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.012761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409176/,218

160943,Is the Medial Sural Artery Perforator Flap a New Workhorse Flap? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND The laparoscopic approach would be difficult to perform without causing deformation of the stomach in managing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the intraluminal type, especially in those that are located in the posterior gastric wall or around the gastroesophageal junction and the pylorus, because intraluminal GISTs usually require an excessive resection of the gastric wall for cure. We present a novel surgical technique for successful management of intraluminal gastric GISTs that minimizes deformation of the stomach regardless of tumor location. MATERIALS AND METHODS The operating surgeon handles the tumor by holding tissue surrounding the tumor and performs seromyotomy using an ultrasonically activated device along the outer edge of the tumor. The tumor gradually protrudes like an extraluminal tumor as the seromyotomy proceeds. When seromyotomy along the tumor comes up to the point where the tumor sufficiently turns over the gastric serosa, the tumor looks like a pedunculated extraluminal GIST. Two seromuscular sutures are applied to close the exfoliated seromuscular layer. The tips of two seromuscular sutures are held and then pulled up toward the ventral side so that the staple line is aligned in line with the minor axis of the stomach. Finally, complete tumor removal with minimal seromuscular resection is accomplished by applying a linear stapler. RESULTS All patients resumed oral ingestion on the day after surgery and showed no signs of anastomotic constriction or obstruction. CONCLUSIONS Our laparoscopic procedure for gastric GISTs is simple and allows us easy and precise removal of the tumor and closure of the gastric wall with minimum necessary resection, regardless of the location and growth form of the tumors.","Hirahara, Noriyuki; Matsubara, Takeshi; Kidani, Akihiko; Hyakudomi, Ryoji; Fujii, Yusuke; Tajima, Yoshitsugu",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

161919,Reliability and Diagnostic Accuracy of Commonly Used Performance Tests Relative to Fall History in Older Persons: A Systematic Review.,2021,"Purpose: In this paper, a novel design for a leap motion wheelchair navigation system is proposed, and the suggested model is implemented on a prototype. The behaviour of the created prototype is closely observed during the different performance tests carried out, and the results are presented throughout this manuscript.Materials and methods: In the prototype, a Leap Motion sensor is implemented to acquire navigation data through hand gestures of the users. This navigations system design is specifically implemented to facilitate wheelchair use for amputee users and stroke patients as it does not rely on the movement of the fingers. Through this design, wheelchair movement can be controlled through detection of finger, fist, palm or wrist (for amputees) movement by the leap motion sensor. Bluetooth connection is used as the navigation system's communication means, removing the need for constant internet connection and providing freedom of movement outside of internet-covered territory. Additionally, two Dynamixel motors are used as movement force, which yield optimal computational time and minimal delay.Results: The performance of the designed prototype is tested by considering response time and speed resolution as evaluation metrics. Results suggest that the designed wheelchair will give movement independence to users who cannot use their fingers to control the movement of their wheelchairs, while reducing delay, being independent of internet connection, providing high resolution and minimising detection error.Conclusions: The promising results obtained from prototype testing suggest the possibility of real-life application of this wheelchair navigation system, which can greatly assist amputee users and rehabilitation patients.Implications for rehabilitationA novel wheelchair navigations system designed to facilitate amputee users, stroke patients and rehabilitation patients.The proposed system eliminates the reliance on finger movements, is gaze independent, and does not require voice or gesture control, creating much more freedom for users undergoing specific medical conditions or still under rehabilitation or treatment.Results demonstrate very low delay time in wheelchair command to action, allowing improved control for users and reducing the occurrence of control-related accidents.The designed wheelchair navigation system is independent of internet connection, allowing more freedom in range for wheelchair users compared to available cloud based models.","Fereidouni, Shahin; Sheikh Hassani, Mohsen; Talebi, Alireza; Rezaie, Amir Hossein",Disability and rehabilitation.

164358,Combined Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is associated with an improved outcome in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a propensity matched cohort study,2021-07-16,"Introduction: The high number of COVID-19 cases lean much burden on the healthcare system. Physicians report fewer acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients presenting to hospitals in countries severely affected by the pandemic. It is concerning that patients with life-threatening illness can suffer more complications or die due to their myocardial infarction. We have limited information about ACS-care in countries less affected by the pandemic. Being Hungary one of them, we aimed to investigate the changes in myocardial infarction care in the country’s biggest PCI-center. Methods: A total of 512 consecutive patients have been investigated, 396 people have been treated in 2018 and 2019 compared to 116 subjects suffering ACS in 2020 during the pandemic. We compared patients’ demographical and clinical characteristics as well as out-of-hospital death rates before versus during COVID-19 outbreak. Results: A 41% (116/298) decrease in total ACS cases, a 29% (61/87) decline in STEMI and 51% (54/111) in NSTEMI patients could be witnessed during the pandemic. The proportion of STEMI patients admitted late (17.49%, 18/105 vs. 34.48%, 10/29). The number of severe cases – LM intervention, very high risk NSTEMI – decreased. Out-of-hospital mortality increased by 17%. Conclusion: Although the Hungarian healthcare system in the first wave was less burdened by the pandemic we saw a significant decline in ACS cases. The hazards of the delayed or lacking care can have a serious effect on the prognosis of these patients. Seeing the increasing number of COVID-cases in the second wave, it is even more important to raise awareness among patients and healthcare workers that ACS patients need to be treated.","Skoda, R.; Fülöp, G.; Csulak, E.; Danics, K.; Törő, K.; Bokor, L.; Bárczi, G.; Merkely, B.; Becker, D.",Cor et Vasa,https://doi.org/10.33678/cor.2020.101,218
165475,Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-10-01,"Background: High-throughput detection of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 presents a valuable tool for vaccine trials or investigations of population immunity. We evaluate the performance of the first commercial surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT, GenScript Biotech) against SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) in convalescent and vaccinated individuals. We compare it to five other ELISAs, two of which are designed to detect neutralizing antibodies. Results: In 491 pre-vaccination serum samples, sVNT missed 23.6% of PRNT-positive samples when using the manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 30% binding inhibition. Introducing a equivocal area between 15 and 35% maximized sensitivity and specificity against PRNT to 72.8-93.1 % and 73.5-97.6%, respectively. The overall diagnostic performance of the other ELISAs for neutralizing antibodies was below that of sVNT. Vaccinated individuals exhibited higher antibody titers by PRNT (median 119.8, IQR 56.7-160) and binding inhibition by sVNT (median 95.7, IQR 88.1-96.8) than convalescent patients (median 49.1, IQR 20-62; median 52.9, IQR 31.2-76.2). Conclusion: GenScript sVNT is suitable to screen for SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies; however, to obtain accurate results, confirmatory testing by PRNT in a equivocal area is required. This equivocal area may require adaptation for use in vaccinated individuals, due to higher antibody titers.","Hofmann, N.

165769,Impact of covid-19 pandemic on rheumatology patients in northern Ireland -A web based cross-sectional survey,2021,"Objective. To review a literature published over the past 5 years and our own data on the etiology of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), antimicrobial resistance and its relationships between sepsis and choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Materials and methods. National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) criteria were used to diagnose LRTI. A review of the articles regarding LRTI from the Russian and international English language journals published over 6 years was performed. Identification of microorganisms was performed by culture over the period of 2003-2013;since 2014, MALDI-TOF MS method was used for this purpose. Results. Despite the ongoing policy to limit the use of antimicrobial therapy in the ICUs, there is an increase in carbapenemase-producing isolates in the ICUs from 2.2% (2018) to 11.7% (2020, 9 months). Along with the trend to increase in carbapenemase-producing pathogens causing LRTI, their variability is also increasing. In particular, it applies to strains producing carbapenemases OXA-48 or combination of OXA- 48 with KPC;with the trend to combined production of carbapenemase beginning at 2019. Conclusions. Carbapenemase producers are becoming more widespread in the ICU settings, including the lower respiratory tract in mechanically ventilated patients. Practitioners didn’t get used to associate VAP with the Sepsis-3 criteria. The changes in etiology include the increased rate of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, primarily Acinetobacter spp., in Russia. It’s due to improved quality of respiratory support and increased consumption of carbapenems, tigecycline and polymyxins. Significant increase of OXA-48-producing pathogens is likely to be associated with a poor compliance with temporary guidelines on COVID-19 with regard to antibiotic therapy. © 2021, Interregional Association for Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

166155,"Adaptive hearing aid benefit in children with mild/moderate hearing loss: A registered, double-blind, randomized clinical trial",2021-07-20,"A three-dimensional representation of the twenty proteinogenic amino acids in a physicochemical space is presented. Vectors corresponding to amino acid substitutions are classified based on whether they are accessible via a single-nucleotide mutation. It is shown that the standard genetic code establishes a “choice architecture” that permits nearly independent tuning of the properties related with size and those related with hydrophobicity. This work sheds light on the metarules of evolvability that may have shaped the standard genetic code to increase the probability that adaptive point mutations will be generated. Illustrations of the usefulness of visualizing amino acid substitutions in a 3D physicochemical space are shown using recent datasets collected regarding the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. First, the substitutions most responsible for antibody escape are almost always inaccessible via single nucleotide mutation, and also change multiple properties concurrently. Second, it is shown that assays of ACE2 binding by sarbecovirus variants, including the viruses responsible for SARS and COVID-19, are more easily understood when plotted with this method. The results of this research can extend our understanding of certain hereditary disorders caused by point mutations, as well as guide the development of rational protein and vaccine design. “Just as no building lacks an architecture, so no choice lacks a context” Richard H.

We use an untargeted high-throughput approach which combines immunoglobulin disease-specific epitope-enrichment and identification of microbial and human antigens. Increased microbial diversity was observed in dermatomyositis. Viruses were over-represented and species of the Poxviridae family were significantly enriched. The autoantibodies identified recognised a large portion of the human proteome, including interferon regulated proteins; these proteins were clustered in specific biological processes. Apart from TRIM33, autoantibodies against eleven further TRIM proteins, including TRIM21, were identified. Some of these TRIM proteins shared epitope homology with specific viral species including poxviruses. Our data suggest antibody accumulation in dermatomyositis against an expanded diversity of microbial and human proteins and evidence of non-random targeting of specific signalling pathways. Our findings indicate that molecular mimicry and epitope spreading events may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of dermatomyositis.","Megremis, Spyridon; Walker, Thomas D.

166744,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) associated Mucormycosis: An Anaesthesiologist's Perspective,2021-09-12,"Background Relative to the rest of Europe, the UK has relatively poor cancer outcomes, with late diagnosis and a slow referral process being major contributors. General practitioners (GPs) are often faced with patients presenting with a multitude of non-specific symptoms that could be cancer. Safety netting can be used to manage diagnostic uncertainty by ensuring patients with vague symptoms are appropriately monitored, which is now even more crucial due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and its major impact on cancer referrals. The ThinkCancer! Workshop is an educational behaviour change intervention aimed at the whole general practice team, designed to improve primary care approaches to ensure timely diagnosis of cancer. The workshop will consist of teaching and awareness sessions, the appointment of a Safety Netting Champion and the development of a bespoke Safety Netting Plan, and has been adapted so it can be delivered remotely. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the ThinkCancer! Intervention for a future definitive randomised controlled trial. Methods The ThinkCancer! study is a randomised, multisite feasibility trial, with an embedded process evaluation and feasibility economic analysis. Twenty-three to 30 general practices will be recruited across Wales, randomised in a ratio of 2:1 of intervention versus control who will follow usual care. The workshop will be delivered by a GP educator and will be adapted iteratively throughout the trial period. Baseline practice characteristics will be collected via questionnaire. We will also collect Primary Care Intervals (PCI), Two Week Wait (2WW) referral rates, conversion rates and detection rates at baseline and six months post-randomisation. Participant feedback, researcher reflections and economic costings will be collected following each workshop. A process evaluation will assess implementation using an adapted Normalisation Measure Development (NoMAD) questionnaire and qualitative interviews. An economic feasibility analysis will inform a future economic evaluation. Discussion This study will allow us to test and further develop a novel evidenced-based complex intervention aimed at general practice teams to expedite the diagnosis of cancer in primary care.

This paper presents a discussion of the impact of cybersecurity issues that occur during and are attributable to pandemics and other emergency situations. This discussion is facilitated by a simulation tool, the Disaster Vulnerability Threat and Impact Simulator System (DVTISS). DVTISS simulates the network structure, security measures, user characteristics and demographics, data, and devices of an organization or region's computing infrastructure. The system is provided input parameters and performs analysis to identify the combined results of numerous different decisions, which are made in concert, to identify the types of vulnerabilities that may be present and the impact of their exploitation. The impacts of system unavailability are considered. This can aid businesses, governments and others in determining the level of prioritization that should be given to cybersecurity considerations. The simulator can also be used for disaster preparedness and planning, evaluating particular response strategies and the evaluation of laws and policies that impact IT decision making during emergencies. This paper uses the DVTISS tool to consider organizational responses to several example emergency situations. It demonstrates the utility of the tool as well as its efficacy for decision making support. Based on the example emergencies, the paper also discusses key areas of vulnerability during emergency situations and their financial, data and system outage impacts.","Lusardi, M.

TNF stimulation leads to the formation of two distinct signalling complexes, a well-defined membrane bound complex (complex 1), and a less well characterised cytosolic death inducing complex (complex 2). Using mass spectrometry, we identified the ADP-ribosyltransferase, tankyrase-1 (TNKS1/TNKS/ARTD5/PARP5a) as a novel native complex 2 component. Following a TNF-induced death stimulus TNKS1 is recruited to complex 2, resulting in complex 2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). Tankyrase inhibitors sensitise cells to TNF-induced death, which is correlated with increased complex 2 assembly. Tankyrase-mediated PARylation promotes recruitment of the E3 ligase RNF146 and RNF146 deficiency or proteasome inhibition results in increased levels of complex 2, suggesting that RNF146 causes proteasomal degradation of complex 2. Several viruses express ADP-ribose binding macrodomain proteins, and expression of the SARS-CoV-2 or VEEV macrodomain markedly sensitises cells to TNF-induced death. This suggests that ADP-ribosylation serves as yet another mechanism to detect pathogenic interference of TNF signalling and retaliate with an inflammatory cell death.","Liu, Lin; Sandow, Jarrod J.; Leslie Pedrioli, Deena M.; Silke, Natasha; Hu, Zhaoqing; Morrish, Emma; Chau, Diep; Kratina, Tobias; Kueh, Andrew J.; Hottiger, Michael O.; Webb, Andrew I.; Lalaoui, Najoua; Silke, John",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.430424,218

Methods: The Mokotow Helpline (Mokotowska Linia Wsparcia - MLW) operated from March to July 2020, providing ad hoc interventions and short-term regular help by psychologists and a social worker. Results: 599 interventions were delivered to 262 people. Emergency support was given to 70.6% of callers and regular short-term support was provided to 29.4%. The highest number of people contacted the helpline in the first weeks of its operations, while from May 2020 onwards the frequency of calls systematically decreased. Women requested assistance twice as often as men. The most frequent reasons for contacting the line were the need for advice and support in connection with symptoms of mental illness occurring in a loved one (21.4%), request for medical services, e.g. appointment with a psychiatrist, prescription renewal or psychotherapy appointment (16.0%), anxiety (15.6%), reactive (adjustment) (13.0%) and depressive disorders (5.7%) and financial difficulties or loss of a job (5.7%). The most frequent interventions consisted of psychological support (73.8%), information or psychoeducation (16.9%), and also referring people to institutions that could provide the most appropriate form of help (8.1%). Conclusions: The helpline is an easily accessible and practical means of providing assistance to the population in critical situations such as the pandemic. The kind, duration and frequency of this form of help should be varied and adapted to the wide range of problems reported by callers.","Zabrzygraj, A.; Świtaj, P.",Postepy Psychiatrii i Neurologii,https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2021.106815,218

Data were collected through an online research panel provider from 415 customers of department and discount department stores in Australia.FindingsThe findings show social storescape predicts customer citizenship behaviour directly, and that store attachment mediates the effect of both physical and social storescape on this behaviour. Employee citizenship behaviour towards customers was found to moderate the effect of storescape on customer citizenship behaviour. In addition, the effect of both positive physical and social storescape was found to be greater in discount department stores than department stores.Practical implicationsIn addition to highlighting the factors that drive customer citizenship behaviour, the study shows that storescape factors and their effect vary for department stores versus discount department stores.Originality/valueThis study shows the effect of storescape on customer citizenship behaviour. Drawing on resource exchange theory, this study is the first-known to identify storescape as both physical and social resources which can influence retail store attachment and customer citizenship behaviour. The study provides new insights into the differential effect of storescape in department versus discount department stores in motivating customers to engage in citizenship behaviour. Further, the study makes an important contribution by demonstrating the moderating role of employee citizenship behaviour towards customers.","Gorji, Mohammadbagher Grimmer Louise Grimmer Martin Siami Sahar",International Journal of Retail & Distribution Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijrdm-10-2020-0438,218
176899,Novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19): A narrative review based on current status,2021,"Infectious diseases are an important consideration in autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Infective episodes may trigger relapses and significantly deteriorate the course of the disease. Some immunotherapies may cause increased rates of infection-related adverse events. Thus, infection and vaccine-related issues should be included in the individualized patient-specific treatment strategy and counseling before starting therapy and regularly on treatment. Clinical and epidemiological studies as well as pharmacovigilance data repeatedly demonstrated the safety of the great majority of vaccines in multiple sclerosis patients. Moreover, studies have shown that vaccinations with killed/inactivated vaccines do not increase the short-term risk of relapse or deterioration in multiple sclerosis, whereas infections have been shown to provoke relapses. The available evidence indicates reduced humoral vaccination efficacy on treatment with MS drugs acting on the S1P receptor, natalizumab, and B-cell depleting therapies. Recent data for cladribine tablets suggest the potential of effective immunization in the interval of the two treatment courses and after completion of therapy. Regardless of treatment, vaccine efficacy may be optimized with proper timing of application. Multiple sclerosis patients receiving highly effective therapies should be vaccinated according to general recommendations for healthy adults. Immunization against COVID-19 is highly recommended for all multiple sclerosis patients regardless of age and comorbidities. Preliminary data show the potential of adequate responses in patients treated with cladribine tablets.","Gold, R.; Fätkenheuer, G.; Hartung, H.

Vaccines are currently being developed for NiV, and studies funded to evaluate their safety and immunogenicity, so that they could possibly be used to contain outbreaks. An important unanswered question is whether it will be possible to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates in phase III clinical trials in a context where spillovers from the zoonotic reservoir are infrequent and associated with small outbreaks. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a phase III vaccine trial in Bangladesh, the only country reporting regularly NiV cases. Methods: We used simulations based on previously observed NiV cases from Bangladesh, an assumed vaccine efficacy of 90% and other NiV vaccine target characteristics, to compare three vaccination study designs: (i) cluster randomized ring vaccination, (ii) cluster randomized mass vaccination, and (iii) an observational case-control study design. Results: The simulations showed that, assuming a ramp-up period of 10 days and a mean hospitalization delay of 4 days, it would take 516 years and over 163,000 vaccine doses to run a ring vaccination trial under current epidemic conditions. A cluster-randomized trial in the two most affected districts would take 81 years and 2.3 million vaccine doses. An observational case-control design in these two districts would require seven years and 2.5 million vaccine doses. Discussion: Without a change in the epidemiology of NiV, ring vaccination or cluster-randomized trials are unlikely to be completed within a reasonable time window. In this light, the remaining options are: (i) not conducting a phase III trial until the epidemiology of NiV changes, (ii) identifying alternative ways to licensure such as observational studies or controlled studies in animals such as in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule.","Nikolay, B.; Lipsitch, M.; Rahman, M.; Luby, S.

Objectives: We aimed to analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with RMDs living in Italy. Methods: During the first wave (March-May 2020) and during the second wave (October-December 2020) of COVID-19, we conducted a survey to investigate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with RMDs followed at the Rheumatology Unit of the University of Campania, Italy. The demographic data, medication use, the frequency of respiratory symptoms and the incidence of COVID-19 confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab were collected with questionnaires administered by phone. The prevalence of COVID-19 of our cohort was compared to that of the general population (2). Results: During the first wave, we collected data from 900 patients with RMDs (Table 1): 320 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 295 patients with spondyloarthropathies (SpA), 283 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 2 patients with vasculitis. 546 (60%) were treated with bDMARD/tsDMARDs. Overall, a total of 11/900 (1%) cases were tested for COVID-19 due to compatible symptoms. 2 (0.2%) adult patients treated with bDMARDs were registered as swab test positive by PCR for COVID-19. 2 patients without confirmed COVID-19 developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital. No deaths occurred among the patients with confirmed COVID-19. During the second wave, data were collected from 470 patients who accepted to take part of the study (Table 1). 49 presented with symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19. 139 patients were tested whereas 30 patients (6%) had a swab confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, 16 (53%) were treated with bDMARDs and a patient was treated with tofacitinib. we found no increase in COVID-19 prevalence in patients treated with bDMARD/tsDMARDs (p≥0.05). A patient with SLE developed pneumonia that required admission to hospital and died. Lacking distinct prevalence data between first and second waves, we found no differences in total COVID-19 prevalence between general population living in Campania (215.752/5.802.000;3.7%) and patients with RMDs (32/900;3.5%). However, we had a significant increase in COVID-19 prevalence in our cohort during the second wave compared to the first. Nevertheless, no increase in mortality or hospitalization was recorded, confirming the safety of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with RMDs. Conclusion: In this cohort of patients with RMDs in a geographical region with a high prevalence of COVID-19, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not appear different from that observed in the general population.","Fasano, S.; Pantano, I.; Mauro, D.; Capocotta, D.; Iacono, D.; Gaggiano, E.; Pasquale, M.

We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation in this understudied region. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, two percent (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97% oil palm; 3% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a ~4,000 km national investment project, increased by 1,554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads grew rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90% oil palm 10% pulpwood) of which 74% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo. We highlight the opportunities for policy reform and the importance of working with indigenous communities, local leaders, and provincial government to protect the biological and cultural richness still embodied in this remarkable region.","Gaveau, David L.A.; Santos, Lucas; Locatelli, Bruno; Salim, Mohammad A.; Husnayaen, Husnayaen; Meijaard, Erik; Heatubun, Charlie; Sheil, Douglas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.13.431006,218
180316,Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: A single-center experience in Nigeria,2021,"Background Machine learning (ML) methodology development for classification of immune states in adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRR) has seen a recent surge of interest. However, so far, there does not exist a systematic evaluation of scenarios where classical ML methods (such as penalized logistic regression) already perform adequately for AIRR classification. This hinders investigative reorientation to those scenarios where further method development of more sophisticated ML approaches may be required. Results To identify those scenarios where a baseline method is able to perform well for AIRR classification, we generated a collection of synthetic benchmark datasets encompassing a wide range of dataset architecture-associated and immune state-associated sequence pattern (signal) complexity. We trained ≈1300 ML models with varying assumptions regarding immune signal on≈850 datasets with a total of ≈210’000 repertoires containing ≈42 billion TCRβ CDR3 amino acid sequences, thereby surpassing the sample sizes of current state-of-the-art AIRR ML setups by two orders of magnitude. We found that L1-penalized logistic regression achieved high prediction accuracy even when the immune signal occurs only in 1 out of 50’000 AIR sequences. Conclusions We provide a reference benchmark to guide new AIRR ML classification methodology by: (i) identifying those scenarios characterised by immune signal and dataset complexity, where baseline methods already achieve high prediction accuracy and (ii) facilitating realistic expectations of the performance of AIRR ML models given training dataset properties and assumptions. Our study serves as a template for defining specialized AIRR benchmark datasets for comprehensive benchmarking of AIRR ML methods.","Kanduri, Chakravarthi; Pavlović, Milena; Scheffer, Lonneke; Motwani, Keshav; Chernigovskaya, Maria; Greiff, Victor; Sandve, Geir K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.445346,218

The Italian novelist Giovanni Boccaccio, one of the exponents of the cultural movement of Humanism, in the introduction (proem) of his “Decameron” described the devastating effects of the ‘black plague’ on the inhabitants of the city of Florence. The pestilence returned to Western Europe in several waves, between the 16th and 17th centuries. William Shakespeare in “Romeo and Juliet” and other tragedies, and Ben Jonson in “The Alchemist” made several references to the plague, but they did not offer any realistic description of that infective disease. Some decennials later Daniel Defoe, in his “A Journal of the Plague Year” (1719), gave a detailed report about the ‘Great Plague’ which hit England in 1660, based on documents of the epoch. In more recent times, Thomas S. Eliot, composing his poem “The Waste Land” was undoubtedly influenced by the spreading of another infective disease, the so-called “Spanish flu”, which affected him and his wife in December 1918. Some decennials later, the French writer and philosopher Albert Camus, in his novel “The Plague”, symbolized with a plague epidemic the war which devastated Europe, North Africa and the Far East from 1937 to 1945, extolling a death toll of over 50 million victims. Those literary works offered a sort of solace to the lovers of literature. To recall them is the purpose of the present paper, in these years afflicted by the spreading of the Covid-19 Pandemic.","Ha, Sha",International Journal of Comparative Literature & Translation Studies,https://doi.org/10.7575/aiac.ijclts.v.9n.3p.1,218

Animal models of MS have shown that CNS-specific T cells are present in the peripheral T cell repertoire of healthy mice and cause autoimmune disease only when they are activated by immunization. T cell entry into the CNS is thought to require some form of peripheral activation because the blood–brain barrier prohibits trafficking of this tissue by naive cells. We report here that naive T cells can traffic to the CNS without prior activation. Comparable numbers of T cells are found in the CNS of both healthy recombinase activating gene (Rag)(−/)− T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice even when the transgenic TCR is specific for a CNS antigen. Transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for non-CNS antigens are phenotypically naive and proliferate robustly to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Strikingly, transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) are also primarily phenotypically naive but are unresponsive to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Mononuclear cells from the CNS of MBP TCR transgenic but not nontransgenic mice can suppress the response of peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. These results indicate that naive MBP-specific T cells can traffic to the CNS but do not trigger autoimmunity because they undergo tolerance induction in situ.","Brabb, Thea; von Dassow, Peter; Ordonez, Nadia; Schnabel, Bryan; Duke, Blythe; Goverman, Joan",J Exp Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2193284/,218

These drugs showed positive results in preliminary scientific research for treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Since the studies with CQ and HCQ are initial with small patient populations, it is not yet known whether there are adverse effects from the use of CQ and HCQ for patients infected with the coronavirus. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ used against viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN This is a narrative review of the traditional prescriptions of CQ and HCQ efficacy and adverse effects as well as their employment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SETTING In vitro and clinical studies comparing the antiviral efficacy and adverse effect profile of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 in adult patients were evaluated. METHODS A systemic search of reviews, including in vitro and clinical trial studies in English focusing on CQ and HCQ effects and adverse effects against COVID-19 in the adult patient population from PubMed was performed. It included studies reporting chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine effects and adverse effects against COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 42 articles published between 2004 and April 2020 were reviewed for therapeutic use of CQ and HCQ. Both these drugs showed a significant in vitro potential against coronavirus. Many studies for clinical use of CQ and HCQ showed that patients presented adverse reactions on high doses. LIMITATIONS Clinical studies have some methodology shortcomings, such as lack of information about the treatment and small number of experimental patients, leading to a misinterpretation of the data. Besides, there are few clinical studies with a limited sample size. Moreover, most of them did not present control groups, and some patients had died during these protocols. DISCUSSION Despite both CQ and HCQ in vitro antiviral evidence, clinically, both drugs, either alone or combined with other medications, may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, leading to cardiac arrest and sudden death. Besides, a lot of uncertainty still remains, such as starting administration period, dose prescribed, length of treatment, patients' condition, concomitant drug use, among others.

One proposed strategy to increase hospital surge capacity is to restrict elective hospitalizations, yet the degree to which this measure would meet the anticipated is unknown. OBJECTIVES To compare the reduction in hospitalizations resulting from widespread nonurgent hospital admission restrictions during the Toronto severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak with the expected increase in admissions resulting from an influenza pandemic in Toronto. METHODS The authors compared the expected influenza-related hospitalizations in the first eight weeks of a mild, moderate, or severe pandemic with the actual reduction in the number of hospital admissions in Toronto, Ontario, during the first eight weeks of the SARS-related restrictions. RESULTS Influenza modeling for Toronto predicts that there will be 4,819, 8,032, or 11,245 influenza-related admissions in the first eight weeks of a mild, moderate, or severe pandemic, respectively. In the first eight weeks of SARS-related hospital admission restrictions, there were 3,654 fewer hospitalizations than expected in Toronto, representing a modest 12% decrease in the overall admission rate (a reduction of 1.40 admissions per 1,000 population). Therefore, influenza-related admissions could exceed the reduction in admissions resulting from restricted hospital utilization by 1,165 to 7,591 patient admissions, depending on pandemic severity, which corresponds to an excess of 0.44 to 2.91 influenza-related admissions per 1,000 population per eight weeks, and an increase of 4% to 25% in the overall number of admissions, when compared with nonpandemic conditions. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic modeling for Toronto suggests that influenza-related admissions would exceed the reduction in hospitalizations seen during SARS-related nonurgent hospital admission restrictions, even in a mild pandemic. Sufficient surge capacity in a pandemic will likely require the implementation of other measures, including possibly stricter implementation of hospital utilization restrictions.","Schull, Michael J; Stukel, Therese A; Vermeulen, Marian J; Guttmann, Astrid; Zwarenstein, Merrick",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16807399/,218

First described in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan, KD has come to be widely diagnosed in every region of the world. The disease has a high prevalence in children ages 6 months to 5 years, particularly in those of Japanese descent. Patients often present with a high fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and conjunctival injections, but there is no diagnostic test for KD. This paper presents data from our Kawasaki registry including 99 patients with emphasis on Kawasaki cardiopathy. Three patients died from complications of KD, and 1 patient underwent heart transplant for massive aneurysmal dilatation. The 4 explanted hearts showed a spectrum of pathological findings (acute thrombosis, vasculitis, and myocarditis), and 1 patient showed the long-term sequelae of vasculitis in the form of massive aneurysmal dilatation. Among the survivors, 30% showed aneurysmal dilatation.

For many patients, causes of the disease remain unexplained, despite usage of advanced genetic testing. Although major and common transcription factors were identified two decades ago, we still struggle with identification of rare inborn factors contributing to pituitary function. In this report, we follow up genomic screening of CPHD patient cohort that were previously tested for changes in a coding sequences of genes with the use of the whole exome. We aimed to find contribution of rare copy number variations (CNVs). As a result, we identified genomic imbalances in 7 regions among 12 CPHD patients. Five out of seven regions showed copy gains whereas two presented losses of genomic fragment. Three regions with detected gains encompassed known CPHD genes namely LHX4, HESX1, and OTX2. Among new CPHD loci, the most interesting seem to be the region covering SIX3 gene, that is abundantly expressed in developing brain, and together with HESX1 contributes to pituitary organogenesis as it was evidenced before in functional studies. In conclusion, with the use of broadened genomic approach we identified copy number imbalances for 12 CPHD patients. Although further functional studies are required in order to estimate its true impact on expression pattern during pituitary organogenesis and CPHD etiology.","Budny, Bartlomiej; Karmelita-Katulska, Katarzyna; Stajgis, Marek; Zemojtel, Tomasz; Ruchala, Marek; Ziemnicka, Katarzyna",,,218
204952,[A network meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of baloxavir marboxil versus neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza in otherwise healthy patients],2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced policy makers to decree urgent confinements to stop a rapid and massive contagion. However, after that stage, societies are being forced to find an equilibrium between the need to reduce contagion rates and the need to reopen their economies. The experience hitherto lived has provided data on the evolution of the pandemic, in particular the population dynamics as a result of the public health measures enacted. This allows the formulation of forecasting mathematical models to anticipate the consequences of political decisions. Here we propose a model to do so and apply it to the case of Portugal. With a mathematical deterministic model, described by a system of ordinary differential equations, we fit the real evolution of COVID-19 in this country. After identification of the population readiness to follow social restrictions, by analyzing the social media, we incorporate this effect in a version of the model that allow us to check different scenarios. This is realized by considering a Monte Carlo discrete version of the previous model coupled via a complex network. Then, we apply optimal control theory to maximize the number of people returning to ""normal life"" and minimizing the number of active infected individuals with minimal economical costs while warranting a low level of hospitalizations. This work allows testing various scenarios of pandemic management (closure of sectors of the economy, partial/total compliance with protection measures by citizens, number of beds in intensive care units, etc.), ensuring the responsiveness of the health system, thus being a public health decision support tool.","Silva, Cristiana J; Cruz, Carla; Torres, Delfim F M; Muñuzuri, Alberto P; Carballosa, Alejandro; Area, Iván; Nieto, Juan J; Fonseca-Pinto, Rui; Passadouro, Rui; Santos, Estevão Soares Dos; Abreu, Wilson; Mira, Jorge",Sci Rep,,218
205284,Acute Right Ventricular Dysfunction in a Critically Ill Patient with COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: Using 2020 match applicants, the purpose of this study was to identify baseline applicant perspectives on the match process surveying (1) away rotations, (2) interview/postinterview communications, and (3) factors influencing applicant rank order lists. Methods and Materials: Applicants in the 2020 match cycle at a large radiation oncology (RO) residency program received a questionnaire covering demographics and the match process: away rotations, interview/postinterview communications, and ranking. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with completing fewer away rotations. Results: Of 141 surveys sent, 76 were completed, for a response rate of 54%. Most applicants were White, male, and matched into RO. One in 3 applicants did not have a home RO program. Most applicants completed 2 RO rotations (ie, a home rotation and an additional away rotation;range, 0-4 total rotations);RO rotations influenced the applicant rank order lists and the ultimate match result for 94% and 79% of applicants, respectively. Forty-seven percent of applicants reported being asked inappropriate questions during the interview (eg, parental or marital status). Applicants did not perceive a consistent message regarding postinterview communications from program directors. Most applicants were contacted postinterview. Interviews cost most applicants more than $5000. Thirty-seven percent of respondents reported submitting a letter of interest after the interview, hoping to improve their rank. When applying to programs, general reputation and location were the most common influential factors mentioned. When ranking programs, informal conversations with residents and program culture observations were the most common influential factors mentioned. Based on multivariable analysis, applicants who completed fewer RO rotations (including away rotations) had greater odds of matching to their home program (odds ratio [OR], 12.05;95% CI, 1.27-206.69), lower odds of program location influencing where to apply (OR, 0.04;95% CI, 0.003-0.37), and lower odds of the program's general reputation affecting their rank list (OR, 0.04;95% CI, 0.001-0.47). Conclusions: The results suggest that medical students perceive away rotations as an important influencer of their match process. Although applicants and program directors both participate in postinterview communications, interactions with residents influence rank order lists. These data may serve as an up-to-date baseline to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the RO match process. © 2021 The Authors","Taparra, K.; Ebner, D. K.; De La Cruz, D.; Holliday, E.

205850,Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study Shows Early Interferon Therapy Is Associated with Favorable Clinical Responses in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading worldwide. Italy emerged early on as the country with the largest outbreak outside Asia. The outbreak in Northern Italy demonstrates that it is fundamental to contain the virus' spread at a very early stage of diffusion. At later stages, no containment measure, even if strict, can prevent the saturation of the hospitals and of the intensive care units in any country. Here we show that it is possible to predict when the intensive care units will saturate, within a few days from the beginning of the exponential growth of COVID-19 intensive care patients. Using early counts of intensive care patients, we predict the saturation for Lombardy, Italy. We also assess short-term and long-term lockdown effects on intensive care units and number of deaths. Governments should use the Italian outbreak as a precedent and implement appropriate containment measures to prevent the saturation of their intensive care units and protect their population, also, and above all, in anticipation of a possible second exponential spread of infections.","Supino, M; d039,; Onofrio, A; Luongo, F; Occhipinti, G; Dal Co, A",BMC Public Health,,218

As different countries and regions go through phases of the pandemic, the questions and data availability also change. Especially of interest is aligning model development and data collection to support response efforts at each stage of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented in terms of real-time collection and dissemination of a number of diverse datasets, ranging from disease outcomes, to mobility, behaviors, and socio-economic factors. The data sets have been critical from the perspective of disease modeling and analytics to support policymakers in real time. In this overview article, we survey the data landscape around COVID-19, with a focus on how such datasets have aided modeling and response through different stages so far in the pandemic. We also discuss some of the current challenges and the needs that will arise as we plan our way out of the pandemic.","Adiga, Aniruddha; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Marathe, Madhav; Mortveit, Henning; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Vullikanti, Anil",J Indian Inst Sci,,218

The growth modes include equiaxed crystal, columnar crystal and coexistence of both crystals. In the ZnO:Al film, equiaxed crystals improve the carrier mobility and reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Thus, the carrier mobility and thermal conductivity are tuned by the ratio of equiaxed crystals to columnar crystals. The carrier mobility is dependent on the growth-mode-related defects of oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials and the substitutional dopant of Al. Improved thermoelectric properties with a power factor of 198.45â µWâ m-1â K-2 at 510â K were achieved.

OBJECTIVE: To objectively evaluate the effects of RPEincluding medical masks and respiratorson the skin barrier by measuring various physiological properties of the skin. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Twenty healthy health care workerswere included in this study. Skin parameters including skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, sebum secretion, pH, and skin temperature were measured in the RPE-covered and uncovered areas of the face 4 and 8 h after wearing RPE and 14 hafter not wearing RPE. RESULTS: Skin hydration, TEWL, erythema, pH, and skin temperature increased in the RPE-covered areasafter wearing RPE for 4 and 8h. On the other hand, in the RPE-uncovered areas, skin hydration decreased and TEWL, erythema, and pH showed minimal changes over time. Based on the repeated-measure analysis, the changes in skin physiological properties over time were significantly different between RPE-covered and RPE-uncovered areas. CONCLUSION: We observed that skin physiological characteristics change with the prolonged use ofRPEsuch as medical masks and respirators.These changes may lead to various adverse skin reactions after long term use.

214769,Broad-Spectrum Anti-coronavirus Vaccines and Therapeutics to Combat the Current COVID-19 Pandemic and Future Coronavirus Disease Outbreaks,2021,"Suppressing infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will probably require the rapid identification and isolation of individuals infected with the virus on an ongoing basis. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Mutesa, Leon; Ndishimye, Pacifique; Butera, Yvan; Souopgui, Jacob; Uwineza, Annette; Rutayisire, Robert; Ndoricimpaye, Ella Larissa; Musoni, Emile; Rujeni, Nadine; Nyatanyi, Thierry; Ntagwabira, Edouard; Semakula, Muhammed; Musanabaganwa, Clarisse; Nyamwasa, Daniel; Ndashimye, Maurice; Ujeneza, Eva; Mwikarago, Ivan Emile; Muvunyi, Claude Mambo; Mazarati, Jean Baptiste; Nsanzimana, Sabin; Turok, Neil; Ndifon, Wilfred",Nature (Lond.),,218

However, all the published clinical trials involve oral administration of the drug, although the disease is primarily a respiratory one. Direct inhaled delivery could reduce the side effects associated with oral use and ensure a high concentration of the drug in the lungs. In this study, inhalable HCQ powders were prepared and characterized for potential COVID-19 therapy. Methods: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ-sul) was jet milled (JM) followed by conditioning by storage at different relative humidities (43%, 53%, 58%, and 75% RHs) for 7 days. The solid-state properties, including particle morphology and size distribution, crystallinity, and vapor moisture profiles of HCQ-sul samples, were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic water vapor sorption. The aerosol performance of the HCQ-sul powders was assessed using a medium-high resistance Osmohaler coupling to a next-generation impactor (NGI) at a flow rate of 60 L/min. Results: The jet-milled powder showed a volume median diameter of 1.7 µm (span 1.5) and retained the same crystalline form as the raw HCQ-sul. A small amount of amorphous materials was present in the jet-milled HCQ-sul, which was convertible to the stable, crystalline state after conditioning at 53%, 58%, and 75% RH. The recovered fine particle fraction (FPF)recovered and the emitted fine particle fraction (FPFemitted) of the HCQ-sul sample immediately after jet milling and the samples after conditioning at 43%, 53%, and 58% RH were similar at â¼43% and 61%, respectively. In contrast, the sample having conditioned at 75%RH showed lower corresponding values at 33% and 26% respectively, due to the formation of solid bridges caused by excessive moisture. Conclusion: Inhalable crystalline powders of HCQ-sul were successfully prepared, which can be used for clinical testing as a potential inhaled COVID-19 treatment.","Albariqi, Ahmed H; Chang, Rachel Yoon Kyung; Tai, Waiting; Ke, Wei-Ren; Chow, Michael Y T; Tang, Patricia; Kwok, Philip Chi Lip; Chan, Hak-Kim",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,,218

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in throat swab samples with RT-PCR test kits from Sansure Biotech Inc (Hunan, China) and Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd.(Shanghai, China). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and kappa value were analyzed, and three parallel tests were performed with three weakly positive samples. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and kappa value of the Sansure PCR kit were 0.833, 1.000, 1.000, 0.971, and 0.894, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and kappa value of the BioGerm PCR kit were 0.944, 1.000, 1.000, 0.990, and 0.966, respectively. For the three parallel tests, the coefficient of variation value of the BioGerm PCR kit in all three samples was the smallest for both the ORF1ab and N gene. CONCLUSION: The detection efficacy of the BioGerm PCR kit for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was relatively higher than that of the Sansure PCR kit.","Lu, Yu; Li, Limin; Ren, Shan; Liu, Xin; Zhang, Lanzuo; Li, Wei; Yu, Hongli",J Clin Lab Anal,,218
218864,Oxygen Therapy and Risk of Infection for Health Care Workers Caring for Patients With Viral Severe Acute Respiratory Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction results in reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability leading to inflammation and thrombus formation Infectious agents like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza can infect ECs in multiple vascular beds from different organs in infected patients, especially in the lung The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and its metabolites can preserve EC function and reduce inflammation These effects of EPA likely contribute to reduced cardiovascular events as reported in REDUCE-IT Currently, EPA is being tested in patients at risk for COVID-19 This study tested the effects of EPA on NO bioavailability in pulmonary ECs under conditions of inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) METHODS: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) were pretreated with vehicle or EPA (40 μM) in 2% FBS for 2 h, then challenged with LPS at 200 ng/ml for 24 h Cells (including untreated controls) were stimulated with calcium ionophore to measure maximum production of NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) using tandem porphyrinic nanosensors RESULTS: HMVEC-L challenged with LPS showed a pronounced loss of NO bioavailability Cells treated with EPA increased NO release (20%, p&lt;0 05) and decreased ONOO- release (14%, p&lt;0 01) compared with LPS treatment The [NO]/[ONOO-] ratio, a marker of eNOS coupling efficiency, decreased by 39% (p&lt;0 001) following exposure to LPS However, EPA increased the ratio by 39% (p&lt;0 01) compared with LPS alone CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that EPA preserves NO bioavailability and reduces nitroxidative stress in pulmonary ECs following LPS treatment These studies indicate a protective effect of EPA on pulmonary ECs that may reduce the inflammatory changes caused by infectious agents such as influenza or SARS-CoV-2 among other stimuli","Mason, R.

While some healthcare systems are returning to a more normal routine, many countries and healthcare systems have been, or still are, overwhelmed by the pandemic, which is significantly impacting on the care of these patients. In addition, many studies have been published focusing on how COVID-19 may affect the liver and how pre-existing liver diseases might influence the clinical course of COVID-19. While many aspects remain poorly understood, it has become increasingly evident that pre-existing liver diseases and liver injury during the disease course must be kept in mind when caring for patients with COVID-19. This review should serve as an update on the previous position paper, summarising the evidence for liver disease involvement during COVID-19 and providing recommendations on how to return to routine care wherever possible.","Boettler, Tobias; Marjot, Thomas; Newsome, Philip N.; Mondelli, Mario U.; Maticic, Mojca; Cordero, Elisa; Jalan, Rajiv; Moreau, Richard; Cornberg, Markus; Berg, Thomas",JHEP Rep.,,218

The existing research on the classification for COVID-19 cases faces the challenges of data imbalance, insufficient generalisability, the lack of comparative study, etc. To address these problems, this paper proposes a type of modified MobileNet to classify COVID-19 CXR images and a modified ResNet architecture for CT image classification. In particular, a modification method of convolutional neural networks (CNN) is designed to solve the gradient vanishing problem and improve the classification performance through dynamically combining features in different layers of a CNN. The modified MobileNet is applied to the classification of COVID-19, Tuberculosis, viral pneumonia (with the exception of COVID-19), bacterial pneumonia and normal controls using CXR images. Also, the proposed modified ResNet is used for the classification of COVID-19, non-COVID-19 infections and normal controls using CT images. The results show that the proposed methods achieve 99.6% test accuracy on the five-category CXR image dataset and 99.3% test accuracy on the CT image dataset. Six advanced CNN architectures and two specific COVID-19 detection models, i.e., COVID-Net and COVIDNet-CT are used in comparative studies. Two benchmark datasets and a CXR image dataset which combines eight different CXR image sources are employed to evaluate the performance of the above models. The results show that the proposed methods outperform the comparative models in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision, which demonstrate their potential in computer-aided diagnosis for healthcare applications.","Jia, Guangyu; Lam, Hak-Keung; Xu, Yujia",Comput Biol Med,,218

Heightened fears of viral contamination and fears of the negative consequences of social distancing (e.g., fears related to home confinement, fears of loneliness and isolation) might contribute to the distress caused by the pandemic. Cross-sectional data were collected from undergraduates (N = 608) residing in a U.S. pandemic ""hotspot"" at the time of data collection (between 7 April to 9 May, 2020). Outcome variables included viral contamination fears and social distancing fears. Predictor variables included biological sex, underlying medical vulnerability, number of recent viral symptoms, presence of positive COVID-19 test in social network, anxiety, depression, stress, emotion dysregulation, intolerance of uncertainty, body vigilance, and health anxiety. Female sex, anxiety severity, intolerance of uncertainty, and health anxiety uniquely predicted fears of viral contamination. Female sex and depression severity uniquely predicted fears of social distancing. Multiple anxiety-related vulnerabilities are potential intervention targets for reducing viral contamination fears. Depression is a potential intervention target for social distancing fears. Females might be at greater risk for both types of fears.","Fedorenko, Erick J; Kibbey, Mindy M; Contrada, Richard J; Farris, Samantha G",Cogn Behav Ther,,218

In this research, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), which integrates determinants across eight models, was utilised to analyse students' intentions to use and their actual usage of Moodle, an e-learning system at Hashemite University, a public university in Jordan, one of developing countries. Four principal determinants of intention and usage were explored: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Data were collected from 370 undergraduate students and analysed using structural equation modelling techniques. The results indicated that performance expectancy and effort expectancy affected behavioural intentions to use Moodle whereas social influence did not. In addition, the results confirmed the direct impact of behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions on students' use of Moodle. UTAUT thus provides a valuable tool that enables university decision makers, faculty members, and designers to understand the factors driving e-learning system acceptance and thus facilitate the adoption of the system by students. The study will help educational institutions prepare e-learning systems, which is especially important during a state of emergency such as that caused by COVID-19.","Abbad, Muneer M M",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,218

This assembly can result in the production of constructs that are targeted to a specific site or cell type in order to enhance the response to, or activity of, the conjugated moiety. In the case of cancer treatments, selectively targeting chemotherapies to the cells of interest limit harmful side effects and enhance efficacy. Targeting through conjugation is also advantageous in delivering treatments to difficult-to-reach tissues, such as the brain or infections deep in the lung. Bacterial infections can be more selectively treated by conjugating antibiotics to microbe-specific entities; helping to avoid antibiotic resistance across commensal bacterial species. In the case of vaccine development, conjugation is used to enhance efficacy without compromising safety. In this work, we will review the previously mentioned areas in which bioconjugation has created new possibilities and advanced treatments.","Tummillo, Kristen M; Hazlett, Karsten R O",Molecules (Basel),,218

METHODS: An online survey was conducted from May 10, 2020 to June 10, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7). Categorical data were reported as number and percentage, while continuous data were reported as mean ± SD. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between different factors and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 89,588 college students participated in the current study, among which 36,865 students (41.1%) reported anxiety symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk factors for anxiety symptoms included the age of 26-30 (OR=1.456), sophomore (OR=1.038), junior (OR=1.087) and senior grades (OR=1.161), a higher paternal education level (OR=1.055), low economic status (OR=1.520), and low social support (OR=1.542). CONCLUSIONS: About two-fifths of Chinese college students experienced anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Timely and appropriate psychological interventions for college students should be implemented to reduce the psychological harm caused by COVID-19 epidemic.","Fu, Wenning; Yan, Shijiao; Zong, Qiao; Anderson-Luxford, Dan; Song, Xingyue; Lv, Zhiyue; Lv, Chuanzhu",J Affect Disord,,218

It is caused by a novel coronavirus that produces an outbreak in Wuhan, China and spread all over the world to become a pandemic. From the appearance of the first case of the new coronavirus in Morocco. Moroccan authorities has spared no effort to promote the health of Moroccans, ahead of that of the country's economy. On 22 January 2021, 2 million doses, of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine were delivered to Morocco, with a view to vaccinating 1 million Moroccans in a first phase. On 28 January, the campaign started and the King of Morocco was the 1st Moroccan to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. On 27 February 2021, Morocco has received 1 million doses from the Chinese laboratory Sinopharm and 6 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine allowing Morocco to vaccinate several audiences and the general public over the age of 60, and the most vulnerable. Thereafter, the COVID-19 vaccine doses administered per 100 people in 31 March 2021 were 115.89 in Israel, 84.01 in the United Arab Emirates, 52.53 in the United Kingdom, 44.93 in the United States, 45.04 in Bahrain, 21.66 in Morocco, 16.44 in Germany, 8.32 in China, 4.72 in India, and 0.44 in South Africa. Also, the population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in 01 April 2021 were 55.51% in Israel, 22.12% in the United Arab Emirates, 20.08% in Chile, 16.77% in USA, 15.25% in Serbia, 15.14% in Bahrain, 10.21% in Morocco, 8.94% in Hungary, 8.23% in Turkey, 7.29% in UK, 3.07% in Russia, 2 39% in Brazil, 1.70% in Uruguay, 0.70% in India. and 0.45% in South Africa. This allows Morocco to figure in the top 10 countries fully vaccinated against COVID-19 despite the lack of resources and belonging to developing countries. Finally. our study gives an example to other countries to benefit from the Moroccan experience. Nevertheless, vaccination is only one element of a comprehensive COVID-19 strategy, it must be accompanied by measures to reduce circulating infection and keep them low.","Addi, R.

Similar newborn protection would be expected after maternal vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a significant and urgent need for research regarding safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: A vigorous, healthy, full-term female was born to a COVID-19 naïve mother who had received a single dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 3 weeks prior to delivery. IgG cord blood antibodies were detected to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of birth.

METHODS: We report on a family of 3 adults who experienced photophobia, intense eye pain, epiphora, blurred vision, and a burning sensation over the face and neck area after a short period of unprotected exposure to the UV germicidal lamps. RESULTS: An initial examination revealed erythema and tenderness over the face and neck area, reduced visual acuity of 6/12, and conjunctival injections bilaterally in all 3 patients. Further assessment at the ophthalmology department 3 days later revealed gradual improvement of visual acuity to 6/6 bilaterally. Slit-lamp examinations revealed few punctate epithelial erosions. Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy. The patients were diagnosed with germicidal range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity. Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection. CONCLUSIONS: Although SARS-CoV-2 is structurally akin to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and previous studies demonstrated high levels of inactivation of beta-coronavirus with germicidal-range UV, evidence for its efficacy to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. This case report serves to emphasize the potential consequences of phototoxicity from the improper use of UV germicidal lamps for household disinfection and to highlight the fact that UV germicidal lamps currently have no established role in household disinfection of SARS-CoV-2.","Leung, Kai Ching Peter; Ko, Tak Chuen Simon",Cornea,,218

We review some of the well-established benefits of outdoor leisure in relation to physical and mental health, well-being and personal development. However, these benefits are not equally accessible to all, with many groups and individuals reporting feeling excluded from leisure in the outdoors. Drawing on the context of the UK, we argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating these divisions, as outdoor leisure takes on added significance during times of lockdown. Nevertheless, we suggest that the pandemic may also offer an opportunity to rethink outdoor leisure and ‘the outdoors’ as a leisure space in more inclusive and accessible ways. © 2021 Australia and New Zealand Association of Leisure Studies.","Dashper, K.; King, J.",Annals of Leisure Research,,218

We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale. Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST. SP duration did not differ between groups PRE, increased in controls but decreased in patients POST. Patients' change of SP duration from PRE to POST was negatively correlated to FSS. Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABAB-ergic dysfunction. This impairment might be related to the neuropsychological alterations. COVID-19-associated inflammation might lead to GABAergic impairment, possibly representing the basis of fatigue and explaining apathy and executive deficits.","Ortelli, Paola; Ferrazzoli, Davide; Sebastianelli, Luca; Engl, Michael; Romanello, Roberto; Nardone, Raffaele; Bonini, Ilenia; Koch, Giacomo; Saltuari, Leopold; Quartarone, Angelo; Oliviero, Antonio; Kofler, Markus; Versace, Viviana",J Neurol Sci,,218

245343,Severe bradycardia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 – A cases report,2021,"In low and middle-income countries (LMICs), strict social distancing measures (e.g., nationwide lockdown) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are unsustainable in the long-term due to knock-on socioeconomic and psychological effects. However, an optimal epidemiology-focused strategy for 'safe-reopening' (i.e., balancing between the economic and health consequences) remain unclear, particularly given the suboptimal disease surveillance and diagnostic infrastructure in these settings. As the lockdown is now being relaxed in many LMICs, in this paper, we have (1) conducted an epidemiology-based ""options appraisal"" of various available non-pharmacological intervention options that can be employed to safely lift the lockdowns (namely, sustained mitigation, zonal lockdown and rolling lockdown strategies), and (2) propose suitable application, pre-requisites, and inherent limitations for each measure. Among these, a sustained mitigation-only approach (adopted in many high-income countries) may not be feasible in most LMIC settings given the absence of nationwide population surveillance, generalised testing, contact tracing and critical care infrastructure needed to tackle the likely resurgence of infections. By contrast, zonal or local lockdowns may be suitable for some countries where systematic identification of new outbreak clusters in real-time would be feasible. This requires a generalised testing and surveillance structure, and a well-thought out (and executed) zone management plan. Finally, an intermittent, rolling lockdown strategy has recently been suggested by the World Health Organization as a potential strategy to get the epidemic under control in some LMI settings, where generalised mitigation and zonal containment is unfeasible. This strategy, however, needs to be carefully considered for economic costs and necessary supply chain reforms. In conclusion, while we propose three community-based, non-pharmacological options for LMICs, a suitable measure should be context-specific and based on: (1) epidemiological considerations, (2) social and economic costs, (3) existing health systems capabilities and (4) future-proof plans to implement and sustain the strategy.","Chowdhury, Rajiv; Luhar, Shammi; Khan, Nusrat; Choudhury, Sohel Reza; Matin, Imran; Franco, Oscar H",Eur J Epidemiol,,218

Here, we report that Wnt-induced macropinocytosis is regulated through glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and the ß-catenin destruction complex. We find that mutation of Axin1, a tumor suppressor and component of the destruction complex, results in the activation of macropinocytosis. Surprisingly, inhibition of GSK3 by lithium chloride (LiCl), CHIR99021, or dominant-negative GSK3 triggers macropinocytosis. GSK3 inhibition causes a rapid increase in acidic endolysosomes that is independent of new protein synthesis. GSK3 inhibition or Axin1 mutation increases lysosomal activity, which can be followed with tracers of active cathepsin D, ß-glucosidase, and ovalbumin degradation. Microinjection of LiCl into the blastula cavity of Xenopus embryos causes a striking increase in dextran macropinocytosis. The effects of GSK3 inhibition on protein degradation in endolysosomes are blocked by the macropinocytosis inhibitors EIPA or IPA-3, suggesting that increases in membrane trafficking drive lysosomal activity.","Albrecht, Lauren V; Tejeda-Muñoz, Nydia; Bui, Maggie H; Cicchetto, Andrew C; Di Biagio, Daniele; Colozza, Gabriele; Schmid, Ernst; Piccolo, Stefano; Christofk, Heather R; De Robertis, Edward M",Cell Rep,,218

This study aimed to detect by RT-PCR the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from inert surface samples in public health settings with a literature review about surface contamination and its burden on spread virus. Samples were collected from health settings in Curitiba, Brazil, between July and December 2020. A literature review was conducted using PRISMA. A total of 711 environmental surface samples were collected from outpatient areas, dental units, doctors' offices, COVID-19 evaluation areas, and hospital units, of which 35 (4.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The frequency of environmental contamination was higher in primary care units than in hospital settings. The virus was detected on doctors' personal items. Remarkably, the previously disinfected dental chair samples tested positive. These findings agree with those of other studies in which SARS-CoV-2 was found on inanimate surfaces. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces in public health settings, including those not meant to treat COVID-19, indicates widespread environmental contamination.

249804,Meta-analysis of Cardiovascular Events and Related Biomarkers Comparing Survivors Versus Non-survivors in Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) products is common among older adults. Although OTC self-medication is a convenient way to manage some health issues, older persons may be at higher risk of experiencing medication-related problems. This study examines the prevalence, practices, and preferences associated with OTC medication use in older adult residents of senior living communities. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to examine the characteristics of OTC medication users and to quantify the prevalence, attitudes, perceptions, preferences, and practices regarding OTC medication use and decision-making in 2 senior living communities in central Virginia. METHODS: The study used survey methodology. A 51-item semistructured questionnaire was designed by the research team of geriatrics specialists, and mixed-methods and evaluation researchers. The questionnaire was administered in-person to participants (N = 88). Descriptive analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4. Characteristics of those using OTC medications as directed by a health professional were compared with those of whom were self-medicating with OTC medications. RESULTS: Most of the sample were women (55%), black (61%) and had less than or equal to a high school education (55%). Analgesics were the most (76%) prevalent OTC therapeutic category used, and aspirin was the most (65%) prevalent OTC medication. A greater (82%) proportion of respondents reported self-recommended OTC medication use (self-medication with OTC medications) rather than physician recommended use (18%). A high (41%) prevalence of inappropriate use of OTC medications was observed in this sample of older adults. Most (80%) considered OTC medications safe and effective. The pharmacy was the most (93%) commonly reported purchase location to buy an OTC medication. Physicians were the most (90%) commonly reported information source for OTC medications. CONCLUSION: Considering the high percentage of self-reported self-medication, inappropriate use, and experiences of adverse effects, steps should be taken to develop consumer education and relationships with pharmacists to encourage the responsible use of OTC medications in this population.","Paliwal, Yoshita; Jones, Resa M; Moczygemba, Leticia R; Gendron, Tracey L; Nadpara, Pramit A; Parab, Purva; Slattum, Patricia W",,,218

Commonly segmented thoracic OARs include the heart, esophagus, spinal cord, and lungs. This study evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic segmentation of these OARs. METHODS: The dataset was created retrospectively from consecutive radiotherapy plans containing all five OARs of interest, including 22,411 CT slices from 168 patients. Patients were divided into training, validation, and test datasets according to a 66%/17%/17% split. We trained a modified U-Net, applying transfer learning from a VGG16 image classification model trained on ImageNet. The Dice coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance on the test set for each organ was compared to a commercial atlas-based segmentation model using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: On the test dataset, the median Dice coefficients for the CNN model vs. the multi-atlas model were 71% vs. 67% for the spinal cord, 96% vs. 94% for the right lung, 96%vs. 94% for the left lung, 91% vs. 85% for the heart, and 63% vs. 37% for the esophagus. The median 95% Hausdorff distances were 9.5 mm vs. 25.3 mm, 5.1 mm vs. 8.1 mm, 4.0 mm vs. 8.0 mm, 9.8 mm vs. 15.8 mm, and 9.2 mm vs. 20.0 mm for the respective organs. The results all favored the CNN model (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A 2D CNN can achieve superior results to commercial atlas-based software for OAR segmentation utilizing non-domain transfer learning, which has potential utility for quality assurance and expediting patient care.","Vu, Charles C; Siddiqui, Zaid A; Zamdborg, Leonid; Thompson, Andrew B; Quinn, Thomas J; Castillo, Edward; Guerrero, Thomas M",J Appl Clin Med Phys,,218

Using a case study from Canada, this paper examines how the political dynamics of industry-Indigenous relations have changed and speculates about how these dynamics might continue to change in the future. The economic crisis has already intensified political conflicts and struggles between Indigenous peoples and mining, oil, and gas companies. We identify and discuss four points of conflict between Indigenous communities and extractive industries that have become more acute as a result of the current economic crisis. It is important for researchers to pay close attention to how these conflicts are affected by the pandemic, in order to help Indigenous communities develop strategies to cope with changes in industry-Indigenous relations.","Bernauer, Warren; Slowey, Gabrielle",Extr Ind Soc,,218

The control of COVID-19 was divided into 2 stages, with the lifting of lockdown in Hubei province (March 25, 2020) as a dividing line. RESULTS We identified 32 patients through different means in the first stage. All the imported patients entered this area before the lockdown. In 93.1% of patients, the last exposure occurred before the implementation of the stay-at-home order and centralized isolation. Tracing of high-risk people and RT-PCR screening identified 56.3% of cases. In the second stage, all the high-risk people were under centralized isolation. Nine asymptomatic patients were identified. City lockdown and stay-at-home orders were not issued again, and no second-generation patients were found.

To date, quantifying seasonality of the disease has been limited by scarce data and the difficulty of isolating climatological variables from other drivers of transmission in observational studies. We combine a spatially resolved dataset of confirmed COVID-19 cases, composed of 3,235 regions across 173 countries, with local environmental conditions and a statistical approach developed to quantify causal effects of environmental conditions in observational data settings. We find that ultraviolet (UV) radiation has a statistically significant effect on daily COVID-19 growth rates: a SD increase in UV lowers the daily growth rate of COVID-19 cases by â¼1 percentage point over the subsequent 2.5 wk, relative to an average in-sample growth rate of 13.2%. The time pattern of lagged effects peaks 9 to 11 d after UV exposure, consistent with the combined timescale of incubation, testing, and reporting. Cumulative effects of temperature and humidity are not statistically significant. Simulations illustrate how seasonal changes in UV have influenced regional patterns of COVID-19 growth rates from January to June, indicating that UV has a substantially smaller effect on the spread of the disease than social distancing policies. Furthermore, total COVID-19 seasonality has indeterminate sign for most regions during this period due to uncertain effects of other environmental variables. Our findings indicate UV exposure influences COVID-19 cases, but a comprehensive understanding of seasonality awaits further analysis.","Carleton, Tamma; Cornetet, Jules; Huybers, Peter; Meng, Kyle C; Proctor, Jonathan",Proc.

256993,Postoperative outcomes in surgical COVID-19 patients: a multicenter cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation pathways are crucial to reduce stroke-related disability. Motivational Interviewing (MI), as a person-centered complex intervention, aimed to empower and motivate, and could be a resource to improve rehabilitation outcomes for older stroke survivors. The IMAGINE project aims to assess the impact of MI, as a complement to standard geriatric rehabilitation, on functional improvement at 30 days after admission, compared to standard geriatric rehabilitation alone, in persons admitted to geriatric rehabilitation after a stroke. Secondary objectives include assessing the impact of MI on physical activity and performance, self-efficacy, safety, cost-utility, participants' experiences and functional status at 3 months. METHODS: We will conduct a multicenter randomized clinical trial in three geriatric rehabilitation hospitals in Spain. Older adults after mild-moderate stroke without previous severe cognitive impairment or disability will be randomized into the control or intervention group (136 per group, total N = 272). The intervention group will receive 4 sessions of MI by trained nurses, including the design of a personalized rehabilitation plan agreed between stroke survivors and nurses based on stroke survivors´ goals, needs, preferences and capabilities. Main outcome will be the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). In-hospital physical activity will be measured through accelerometers and secondary outcomes using validated scales. The study includes a process evaluation and cost-utility analysis. DISCUSSION: Final results are expected by end of 2020. This study will provide relevant information on the implementation of MI as a rehabilitation reinforcement tool in older stroke survivors. A potential reduction in post-stroke disability and dependence would increase person's health-related quality of life and well-being and reduce health and social care costs. IMAGINE has the potential to inform practice and policymakers on how to move forward towards shared decision-making and shared responsibilities in the vulnerable population of older stroke survivors.

262094,Association of suicide with short-term exposure to air pollution at different lag times: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The biological abilities of interleukin­6 (IL­6) have been under investigation for nearly 40 years. IL­6 works through an interaction with the complex peptide IL­6 receptor (IL­6R). IL­6 is built with four &#945;­chain nanostructures, while two different chains, IL­6R&#945; (gp80) and gp130/IL6ß (gp130), are included in IL­6R. The three­dimensional shapes of the six chains composing the IL­6/IL­6R complex are the basis for the nanomolecular roles of IL­6 signalling. Genes, pseudogenes and competitive endogenous RNAs of IL­6 have been identified. In the present review, the roles played by miRNA in the post­transcriptional regulation of IL­6 expression are evaluated. mRNAs are absorbed via the 'sponge' effect to dynamically balance mRNA levels and this has been assessed with regard to IL­6 transcription efficiency. According to current knowledge on molecular and nanomolecular structures involved in active IL­6 signalling, two different IL­6 models have been proposed. IL­6 mainly has functions in inflammatory processes, as well as in cognitive activities. Furthermore, the abnormal production of IL­6 has been found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV­2; also known as COVID­19). In the present review, both inflammatory and cognitive IL­6 models were analysed by evaluating the cytological and histological locations of IL­6 signalling. The goal of this review was to illustrate the roles of the classic and trans­signalling IL­6 pathways in endocrine glands such as the thyroid and in the central nervous system.

262999,Lifting Coronavirus Disease-19 Shelter-in-Place Restrictions: Impact on Heart Failure Hospitalizations in Northeast Georgia,2020,"We present a low-cost electrochemical DNA biosensor based on printed circuit board (PCB) electrodes for wastewater monitoring using portable PCR instruments, such as miniPCR®, without the requirement for qPCR reagents. PCB electrodes are attractive candidates for low-cost and sensitive DNA biosensors of relevance in a pandemic such as COVID-19, and facilitate the opportunity to map disease spread in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) through monitoring of environmental samples such as wastewater. The biosensor reported in this work is capable of detecting PCR amplicons through the intercalation of methylene blue (MB) with DNA, which increases the voltammogram peak current at the redox potential of MB. We describe how these changes are likely to result from the adsorption of MB-DNA complex on the electrode surface. The electrodes are reusable, easy to clean, do not undergo any surface modification and represent a cost-effective solution with long shelf-life. We also explore the impact that MB concentration and DNA length have upon our biosensor performance and provide insights useful to other investigators in the field. The sensor reported here is capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene amplicons at concentrations as low as 10pg/μ l (approximately 1.7fM) and can detect nucleotides amplified after 10 PCR cycles. Furthermore, using the PCB electrode and approaches described here, SARS-CoV-2 amplicons were detected in simulated wastewater sample, by spiking wastewater collected from a sewage treatment plant in Mumbai, India with SARS-CoV-2 RNA.","Kumar, M.

However, only a few drugs have been approved in certain areas and for use in conditional patients, and the vaccine candidates were only recently approved or authorized for emergency use without being fully implemented worldwide, suggesting that we are yet to reach effective control of the current outbreak as its uninhibited transmission continues precariously. Over the past few months, several therapeutic candidates have been proven ineffective in large clinical trials, while some other agents exhibited promising preliminary results. Meanwhile, the investigation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antivirals is underway. Despite still being preclinical, these agents could be beneficial for the long-term control of COVID-19 and deserve more research focus. In this article, we update the current status of therapeutic candidates that have been examined for COVID-19 management, including the virus-targeting inhibitors and host-targeting agents, with their antiviral efficacy in vitro, in vivo, and in clinical studies.

With no antiviral drugs nor vaccines, and the presence of carriers without obvious symptoms, traditional public health intervention measures are significantly less effective. Here, we report the epidemiological and virological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Originated in bats, 2019-nCoV/ severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 likely experienced adaptive evolution in intermediate hosts before transfer to humans at a concentrated source of transmission. Similarities of receptor sequence binding to 2019-nCoV between humans and animals suggest a low species barrier for transmission of the virus to farm animals.

Therefore, this study examined the psychological reactions of aging OHS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A convenience sample (N = 297, mean age = 66.85) of North American Jews rated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for their parents and for themselves. They further rated their psychological distress, COVID-19-related worries, loneliness, and social support. Respondents were divided into four groups: OHS with two parents with probable PTSD, with one such parent, with no such parent, and comparisons whose parents did not undergo the Holocaust. RESULTS: OHS with two parents with PTSD reported the highest levels of PTSD symptoms. Controlling for respondents' own PTSD, OHS with two parents with PTSD reported higher psychological distress relative to comparisons. Moreover, OHS with parental PTSD reported higher loneliness relative to OHS without parental PTSD or comparisons. The groups did not differ in COVID-19-related worries or social support. CONCLUSIONS: The distress experienced by OHS with parental PTSD seems more general, and is possibly related to the multiple coalescing crises that occurred since the pandemic began, rather than to the health risk associated directly with COVID-19. Moreover, while OHS acknowledge having good social support, some of them nevertheless feel lonely. This possibly reflects unique interpersonal difficulties characteristic in Holocaust survivor families. These findings suggest that OHS with parental PTSD (especially when both parents had symptoms) represent a group of older adults who are relatively susceptible to negative psychological effects of the current pandemic.

A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 844 pregnant women or those who gave birth in the last 6 months before the study. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to identify the presence of significant associations, and an adjusted odds ratio with 95%CI was employed for the strength and directions of association between the independent and outcome variables.

271260,Addendum: Early triage of critically ill COVID-19 patients using deep learning,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid switch from undergraduate classroom teaching to online-teaching; a challenging process for teachers and students. Based on a recent online survey among German pediatric university hospitals the ""AG Lehre der DGKJ"" (teaching working group of the German Society of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine) summarizes latest experiences with e­learning during the summer term of 2020. The survey participants from 17 pediatric university hospitals report that the large spectrum of e­learning formats could sufficiently replace classical lectures and seminars but could not fully replace teaching involving direct contact to patients. The introduction of new digital teaching formats is time-consuming, needs high-quality IT infrastructure, should be embedded in a continuous curriculum and provide the possibility of regular exchange between students and teachers. Teachers should be provided with the opportunity for training in didactic methods and IT skills. These results correspond to the literature on e­learning in general and undergraduate medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. The experiences summarized here should not only facilitate the development of e­learning tools during the ongoing pandemic but also stimulate to establish e­learning as a valuable component of future pediatric medical education. New digital substitutes for teaching involving pediatric patients need to be developed.The statement was drafted by consensus by the German Society of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Working Group on Teaching and approved by the DGKJ board.","Häusler, Martin; Bosse, Hans Martin; Fischbach, Thomas; Graf, Norbert; von Kleist-Retzow, Jürgen-Christoph; Kreuder, Joachim",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,218

A deep, 2.0-mm depth Class V preparation was made using a high-speed diamond bur under air-water spray. Three restorative techniques were performed (n=7): Filtek Z250 placed in two increments (10-second exposure, shade:A2, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), Filtek Z350 XT (40-second exposure, shade:A3D, 3M ESPE) and Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill (10-second exposure, shade:IVA, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), both placed in a single layer. Bonding layer and resin composite were exposed to light from the same Polywave LCU (Bluephase 20i, Ivoclar Vivadent). The peak PT and the difference between peak PT and baseline (&#916;T) values were subjected to two-way, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test (&#945;=0.05). RESULTS: Cavity preparation and etch & rinse procedures decreased the PT values (p<0.001). The 40-second exposure of Filtek Z350 caused the highest peak PT values (38.7±0.8°C) and the highest &#916;T values (3.4±0.8°C), while Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill showed the lowest values (-1.6±1.3°C; p=0.009).

The number of patients operated on was 86% of that in the previous 3 years. Patients: operated on during lockdown had a mean age of 7.6 years (median, 7.5 years) compared to 9.3 years (9.4 years). The rate of domestic accidents (59% versus 23%) and trampoline accidents (16% versus 5%) increased, while those of sport and locomotion-related accidents decreased.Wounds were more frequent, at 35% of procedures, versus 13% previously.The rate of surgery for upper-limb fracture deceased, while that of lower-limb fracture was unchanged.Distal forearm fracture was less frequent, as was distal tibial fracture. Discussion: The present study found a 50% decrease in pediatric traumatology emergency activity during lockdown, without decrease in surgery. In case of renewed lockdown, we recommend reorganizing emergency admission to free teams for management of Covid-19 patients, while maintaining operative rooms for emergency surgery. A general public information campaign could help prevent domestic accidents and risk related to use of trampolines.

Understanding what proportion of these patients require testing and who can be safely screened in community-based models of care is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a COVID-19 screening clinic in a tertiary ED. We assessed the proportion of patients who met testing criteria; self-reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening and views on community-based care. RESULTS: We include findings from 1846 patients. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet contemporaneous criteria for testing and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their general practitioner but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialised for their general practitioner to manage. CONCLUSIONS: While capacity building in acute care facilities is an important part of pandemic planning, it is also important that patients not needing hospital level of care can be assessed and treated elsewhere. We have identified a significant proportion of people at this early stage in the pandemic who have sought healthcare at hospital but who might have been assisted in the community had services been available and public health messaging structured to guide them there.","Rojek, Amanda; Dutch, Martin; Peyton, Daniel; Pelly, Rachel; Putland, Mark; Hiscock, Harriet; Knott, Jonathan",Emerg. med Australas,,218

We performed this study to explore the association between smoking and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients utilizing a quantitative meta-analysis on the basis of adjusted effect estimates. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the online databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase. Only articles reporting adjusted effect estimates on the association between smoking and the risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients in English were included. Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was fitted to assess the risk of bias. A random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled effect with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 73 articles with 863,313 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated that smoking was significantly associated with an increased risk for death in patients with COVID-19 (pooled relative risk = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.12-1.27). Sensitivity analysis indicated that our results were stable and robust. CONCLUSION: Smoking was independently associated with an increased risk for mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Hou, Hongjie; Li, Yang; Zhang, Peihua; Wu, Jian; Shi, Li; Xu, Jie; Diao, Jie; Wang, Yadong; Yang, Haiyan",Nicotine tob. res,,218

We measured the prevalence of burnout and assessed wellbeing and quality of life (QoL) in HCWs at a single UK neuroscience center after the first pandemic surge. METHODS: A 38-item electronic questionnaire was disseminated through local team email lists between May 22 and June 7, 2020, to HCWs in a university neurosciences center. Burnout was measured using the single-item Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization scales, and wellbeing and QoL assessed using the Linear Analogue Self-Assessment Scale and the EuroQol-5 Dimension instrument. RESULTS: The response rate was 57.4% (n=234); 58.2% of respondents were nurses, 69.4% were women and 40.1% were aged 25 to 34 years. Overall, 21.4% of respondents reported burnout assessed by the Emotional Exhaustion scale; burnout was higher for nurses (23.5%) and allied health care professionals (22.5%) compared with doctors (16.4%).

Recognizing viral PTMs is very important for a better understanding of the mechanism of viral infections and finding potential drug targets. However, few studies have investigated the roles of viral PTMs in virus-human interactions using comprehensive viral PTM datasets. To fill this gap, we developed the first comprehensive viral posttranslational modification database (VPTMdb) for collecting systematic information of PTMs in human viruses and infected host cells. The VPTMdb contains 1240 unique viral PTM sites with 8 modification types from 43 viruses (818 experimentally verified PTM sites manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from SwissProt) as well as 13 650 infected cells' PTMs extracted from seven global proteomics experiments in six human viruses. The investigation of viral PTM sequences motifs showed that most viral PTMs have the consensus motifs with human proteins in phosphorylation and five cellular kinase families phosphorylate more than 10 viral species. The analysis of protein disordered regions presented that more than 50% glycosylation sites of double-strand DNA viruses are in the disordered regions, whereas single-strand RNA and retroviruses prefer ordered regions. Domain-domain interaction analysis indicating potential roles of viral PTMs play in infections. The findings should make an important contribution to the field of virus-human interaction. Moreover, we created a novel sequence-based classifier named VPTMpre to help users predict viral protein phosphorylation sites. VPTMdb online web server (http://vptmdb.com:8787/VPTMdb/) was implemented for users to download viral PTM data and predict phosphorylation sites of interest.","Xiang, Yujia; Zou, Quan; Zhao, Lilin",Brief. bioinform,,218
283951,The Resurgence of Medical Ethics During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 Outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic required rapid public compliance with advice from health authorities. Here, we ask who was most likely to do so during the first wave of the pandemic. DESIGN: Quota-sampled cross-sectional and panel data from eight Western democracies (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). METHODS: We fielded online public opinion surveys to 26,508 citizens between 19 March and 16 May. The surveys included questions about protective behaviour, perceptions of the pandemic (threat and self-efficacy), as well as broader attitudes towards society (institutional and interpersonal trust). We employ multilevel and fixed-effects regression models to analyse the relationship between these variables. RESULTS: Consistent with prior research on epidemics, perceptions of threat turn out as culturally uniform determinants of both avoidant and preventive forms of protective behaviour. On this basis, authorities could foster compliance by appealing to fear of COVID-19, but there may be normative and practical limits to such a strategy. Instead, we find that another major source of compliance is a sense of self-efficacy. Using individual-level panel data, we find evidence that self-efficacy is amendable to change and exerts an effect on protective behaviour. Furthermore, the effects of fear are small among those who feel efficacious, creating a path to compliance without fear. In contrast, two other major candidates for facilitating compliance from the social sciences, interpersonal trust and institutional trust, have surprisingly little motivational power during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: To address future waves of the pandemic, health authorities should thus focus on facilitating self-efficacy in the public.","Jørgensen, Frederik; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang",Br J Health Psychol,,218

286336,Analysis of clinical features and early warning signs in patients with severe COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes severe infections, particularly in healthcare settings and immunocompromised patients in whom MDR and XDR isolates are more prevalent. The aim of this study is to validate a method based on MALDI-TOF spectra analysis for early detection of the ST175 high-risk clone (HRC). METHODS: The MALDI-TOF spectra of the first 10 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from each of the 51 participating Spanish hospitals were analyzed (n=506). Resistance profiles were determined by broth microdilution, and clonal epidemiology was assessed by PFGE analysis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) in a previous study. RESULTS: Among all the isolates, 14.2% were XDR and 26.9% were non-susceptible to meropenem, while rates of resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam (3.6%) and colistin (5.7%) were low. Up to 41.7% of all XDR isolates belonged to the ST175 clone, and most of them were only susceptible to ceftolozane/tazobactam and colistin. However, most of the resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam among isolates belonging to this HRC was observed in carbapenemase-producing isolates. A model based on the presence of two MALDI-TOF biomarker peaks at m/z 6911 and 7359 yielded a negative predictive value (NPV) and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 99.8% and 91.9%, respectively, and sensitivity and specificity values of 97.1% and 99.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MALDI-TOF spectra analysis using a model based on the presence of two biomarker peaks proved to maintain high sensitivity and specificity for early detection of the ST175 HRC in a large collection of isolates from all Spanish regions. These data support the use of this model in a clinical setting; however, the consequences of detection of the ST175 HRC, such as choice of empirical antibiotic therapy, must be consistent with local epidemiology and the prevalence of certain resistance patterns of this HRC, such as carbapenemase production, in a given geographical area.","Mulet, Xavier; Fernández-Esgueva, Marta; Norte, Cristina; Zamorano, Laura; Del Barrio-Tofiño, Ester; Oliver, Antonio",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

METHODS: Primary literature review included topics: ""COVID-19,"" ""SARS,"" ""MERS,"" ""gut micro-biota,"" ""probiotics,"" ""immune system,"" ""ACE2,"" and ""metformin."" RESULTS: Diabetes was prevalent (~11%) among COVID-19 patients and associated with increased mortality (about 3-fold) compared to patients without diabetes. COVID-19 could be associated with worsening diabetes control and new diabetes diagnosis that could be linked to high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (coronavirus point of entry into the host) in the endocrine pancreas. A pre-existing gut microbiota imbalance (dysbiosis) could contribute to COVID-19-related complications in patients with diabetes. The COVID-19 virus was found in fecal samples (~55%), persisted for about 5 weeks, and could be associated with diarrhea, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis. ACE2 expressed on enterocytes and colonocytes could serve as an alternative route for acquiring COVID-19. Experimental models proposed some probiotics, including Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, and L. salivarius, as vectors for delivering or enhancing efficacy of anti-coronavirus vaccines. These Lactobacillus probiotics were also beneficial for diabetes. The potential mechanisms for interconnections between coronavirus, diabetes, and gut microbiota could be related to the immune system, ACE2 pathway, and metformin treatment. There were suggestions but no proof supporting probiotics benefits for COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that the host environment including the gut microbiota could play a role for COVID-19 in patients with diabetes. It is a challenge to the scientific community to investigate the beneficial potential of the gut microbiota for strengthening host defense against coronavirus in patients with diabetes.","Barengolts, Elena; Smith, Emily Daviau",Endocr Pract,,218

Patients with heart failure may be at greater risk of infection with COVID-19 and the consequences might also be more serious, but they are also at risk of adverse outcomes if their clinical care is compromised. As physicians and clinical trialists, it is our responsibility to ensure safe and effective care is delivered to trial participants without affecting the integrity of the trial. The social contract with our patients demands no less. Many regulatory authorities from different world regions have issued guidance statements regarding the conduct of clinical trials during this COVID-19 crisis. However, international trials may benefit from expert guidance from a global panel of experts to supplement local advice and regulations, thereby enhancing the safety of participants and the integrity of the trial. Accordingly, the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology on 21 and 22 March 2020 conducted web-based meetings with expert clinical trialists in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia. The main objectives of this Expert Position Paper are to highlight the challenges that this pandemic poses for the conduct of clinical trials in heart failure and to offer advice on how they might be overcome, with some practical examples. While this panel of experts are focused on heart failure clinical trials, these discussions and recommendations may apply to clinical trials in other therapeutic areas.","Anker, Stefan D; Butler, Javed; Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Abraham, William T; Bauersachs, Johann; Bocchi, Edimar; Bozkurt, Biykem; Braunwald, Eugene; Chopra, Vijay K; Cleland, John G; Ezekowitz, Justin; Filippatos, Gerasimos; Friede, Tim; Hernandez, Adrian F; Lam, Carolyn S P; Lindenfeld, JoAnn; McMurray, John J V; Mehra, Mandeep; Metra, Marco; Packer, Milton; Pieske, Burkert; Pocock, Stuart J; Ponikowski, Piotr; Rosano, Giuseppe M C; Teerlink, John R; Tsutsui, Hiroyuki; Van Veldhuisen, Dirk J; Verma, Subodh; Voors, Adriaan A; Wittes, Janet; Zannad, Faiez; Zhang, Jian; Seferovic, Petar; Coats, Andrew J S",Eur Heart J,,218

Accurate and timely multiplex diagnosis is required to prevent future pandemics. Here, we developed an innovative microfluidic chip that enables a snapshot multiplex immunoassay for timely on-site response and offers unprecedented multiplexing capability with an operating procedure similar to that of lateral flow assays. An open microchannel assembly of individually engineered microbeads was developed to construct nine high-density test lines, which can be imaged in a 1 mm2 field-of-view. Thus, simultaneous detection of multiple antibodies would be achievable in a single high-resolution snapshot. Next, we developed a novel pixel intensity-based imaging process to distinguish effective and non-specific fluorescence signals, thereby improving the reliability of this fluorescence-based immunoassay. Finally, the chip specifically identified and classified random combinations of arbovirus (Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies within 30 min. Therefore, we believe that this snapshot multiplex immunoassay chip is a powerful diagnostic tool to control current and future pandemics.","Lee, Wonhyung; Kim, Hojin; Bae, Pan Kee; Lee, Sanghyun; Yang, Sung; Kim, Joonwon",Biosens Bioelectron,,218

The aim of this umbrella review of meta-analyses is to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using relevant keywords, data resources including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Embase were searched to obtain systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning of January to the end of October 2020. The random effects model was used for meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess heterogeneity among studies. Data was analyzed using STATA 14 software. RESULTS: In the primary search, 103 studies were identified, and ultimately 7 studies were included in the umbrella review. The results showed that the overall prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 24.94% (95% CI: 21.83-28.05, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.804) and 24.83% (95% CI: 21.41-28.25, I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.897), respectively. CONCLUSION: This umbrella review shows that the prevalence of anxiety and depression is relatively high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare workers should be provided with resources to minimize this risk.","Sahebi, Ali; Nejati-Zarnaqi, Bayram; Moayedi, Siamak; Yousefi, Kosar; Torres, Mercedes; Golitaleb, Mohamad",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,218

A cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from 11 January 2020 to 3 March 2020 was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with hematologic malignancy were excluded. The NLR was calculated by dividing the neutrophil count by the lymphocyte count. NLR values were measured at the time of admission. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. A multivariate logistic analysis was performed. A total of 1004 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The mortality rate was 4.0% (40 cases). The median age of nonsurvivors (68 years) was significantly older than survivors (62 years). Male sex was more predominant in nonsurvival group (27; 67.5%) than in the survival group (466; 48.3%). NLR value of nonsurvival group (median: 49.06; interquartile range [IQR]: 25.71-69.70) was higher than that of survival group (median: 4.11; IQR: 2.44-8.12; P < .001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for confounding factors, NLR more than 11.75 was significantly correlated with all-cause in-hospital mortality (odds ratio = 44.351; 95% confidence interval = 4.627-425.088). These results suggest that the NLR at hospital admission is associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the NLR appears to be a significant prognostic biomarker of outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, further investigation is needed to validate this relationship with data collected prospectively.","Yan, Xisheng; Li, Fen; Wang, Xiao; Yan, Jie; Zhu, Fen; Tang, Shifan; Deng, Yingzhong; Wang, Hua; Chen, Rui; Yu, Zhili; Li, Yaping; Shang, Jingzhou; Zeng, Lingjun; Zhao, Jie; Guan, Chaokun; Liu, Qiaomei; Chen, Haifeng; Gong, Wei; Huang, Xin; Zhang, Yu-Jiao; Liu, Jianguang; Dong, Xiaoyan; Zheng, Wen; Nie, Shaoping; Li, Dongsheng",J. med. virol,,218

In a separate literature, researchers have used a stochastic group splitting approach to efficiently sample from the intractable number of minimal defective sets of outages in electrical power systems that trigger large cascading failures, a problem in which positive tests can be much more computationally costly than negative tests. In this work, we generate test problems with variable numbers of defective sets and a tunable positive:negative test cost ratio to compare the efficiency of deterministic and stochastic adaptive group splitting algorithms for identifying defective edges in hypergraphs. For both algorithms, we show that the optimal initial group size is a function of both the prevalence of defective sets and the positive:negative test cost ratio. We find that deterministic splitting requires fewer total tests but stochastic splitting requires fewer positive tests, such that the relative efficiency of these two approaches depends on the positive:negative test cost ratio. We discuss some real-world applications where each of these algorithms is expected to outperform the other.","Clarfeld, Laurence A.; Eppstein, Margaret J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09205v1.pdf,218

In this observational study, we aimed at assessing the presence of a malnutrition condition in SARS-Cov2 patients after the acute phase and the effects of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on nutritional and functional status. METHODS: We recruited 48 patients (26 males/22 females) admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit after discharge from acute Covid Hospitals in northern Italy with negative swab for SARS-Cov2. We used the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria to identify patients with different degrees of malnutrition. Patients underwent a 3 to 4-week individual multidisciplinary rehabilitation program consisting of nutritional intervention (energy intake 27to30 kcal/die/kg and protein intake 1-1.3 g/die/kg), exercise for total body conditioning and progressive aerobic exercise with cycle- and arm-ergometer (45 min, 5 days/week). At admission and discharge from our Rehabilitation Unit, body composition and phase angle (PhA) (BIA101 Akern), muscle strength (handgrip, HG) and physical performance (Timed-Up-and-Go, TUG) were assessed. RESULTS: At admission in all patients the mean weight loss, as compared to the habitual weight, was -12.1 (7.6)%, mean BMI was 25.9 (7.9) kg/m2, mean Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Index (ASMI) was 6.6 (1.7) kg/m2 for males and 5.4 (1.4) kg/m2 for females, mean phase angle was 2.9 (0.9)°, mean muscle strength (HG) was 21.1 (7.8) kg for males and 16.4 (5.9) kg for females, mean TUG value was 23.7 (19.2) s. Based on GLIM criteria 29 patients (60% of the total) showed a malnutrition condition. 7 out of those 29 patients (24%) presented a mild/moderate grade and 22 patients (76%) a severe grade. After a rehabilitation program of an average duration of 25 days (range 13-46) ASMI increased, with statistically significant differences only in females (p = 0.001) and HG improved only in males (p = 0.0014). In all of the patients, body weight did not change, CRP/albumin (p < 0.05) and TUG (p < 0.001) were reduced and PhA increased (p < 0.01).

304711,Use of proton pump inhibitors and risk of adverse clinical outcomes from COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019-nCov), a novel coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by World Health Organization by March 11th, 2020. Severe manifestations of COVID-19 are caused by a combination of direct tissue injury by viral replication and associated cytokine storm resulting in progressive organ damage. DISCUSSION: We reviewed published literature between January 1st, 2000 and June 30th, 2020, excluding articles focusing on pediatric or obstetric population, with a focus on virus-host interactions and immunological mechanisms responsible for virus associated cytokine release syndrome (CRS). COVID-19 illness encompasses three main phases. In phase 1, SARS-CoV-2 binds with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor on alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells, triggering toll like receptor (TLR) mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÆB) signaling. It effectively blunts an early (IFN) response allowing unchecked viral replication. Phase 2 is characterized by hypoxia and innate immunity mediated pneumocyte damage as well as capillary leak. Some patients further progress to phase 3 characterized by cytokine storm with worsening respiratory symptoms, persistent fever, and hemodynamic instability. Important cytokines involved in this phase are interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1ß, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. This is typically followed by a recovery phase with production of antibodies against the virus. We summarize published data regarding virus-host interactions, key immunological mechanisms responsible for virus-associated CRS, and potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSION: Evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and pathogenesis is rapidly evolving. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and immune system dysregulation associated with CRS and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 is imperative to identify novel drug targets and other therapeutic interventions.","Khadke, Sumanth; Ahmed, Nayla; Ahmed, Nausheen; Ratts, Ryan; Raju, Shine; Gallogly, Molly; de Lima, Marcos; Sohail, Muhammad Rizwan",Virol J,,218
305377,Patient-Reported Experiences in Outpatient Telehealth Heart Failure Management,2021,"Power-law (PL) time-dependent infection growth has been reported in many COVID-19 statistics. In simple susceptible infected recovered (SIR) models, the number of infections grows at the outbreak as I(t)ât^{d-1} on d-dimensional Euclidean lattices in the endemic phase, or it follows a slower universal PL at the critical point, until finite sizes cause immunity and a crossover to an exponential decay. Heterogeneity may alter the dynamics of spreading models, and spatially inhomogeneous infection rates can cause slower decays, posing a threat of a long recovery from a pandemic. COVID-19 statistics have also provided epidemic size distributions with PL tails in several countries. Here I investigate SIR-like models on hierarchical modular networks, embedded in 2d lattices with the addition of long-range links. I show that if the topological dimension of the network is finite, average degree-dependent PL growth of prevalence emerges. Supercritically, the same exponents as those of regular graphs occur, but the topological disorder alters the critical behavior. This is also true for the epidemic size distributions. Mobility of individuals does not affect the form of the scaling behavior, except for the d=2 lattice, but it increases the magnitude of the epidemic. The addition of a superspreader hot spot also does not change the growth exponent and the exponential decay in the herd immunity regime.","Ódor, Géza",Phys Rev E,,218

The COVID-19 pandemic has acutely stimulated expansion of telemedicine across the country. This study aimed to determine characteristics of telehealth visit and short term HbA1c outcome in patients with diabetes mellitus in endocrinology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A single center retrospective chart review was conducted in all patients seen in endocrinology clinic for diabetes mellitus between 5/27/2020–7/20/2020. Data were extracted from electronic medical record. The primary research question is percentage of patients who achieved HbA1C ≤ 8% at 3 month follow up. Secondary research questions are characteristic of patients and clinic visits, diabetic technology usage, 3 month follow up mean HbA1c and HbA1c change. This project was approved by the institutional review boards. Results: Two hundred and six diabetic patients were seen: 72 (35%) in person, 49 (24%) phone visit, and 85 (41%) VDO visit. Mean age for patients adopted in person visit was 57 (SD 15) years, phone visit was 68 (SD 13) years and VDO visit was 54 (SD 18) years, p &amp;lt;0.001. Male percentage for in person, phone and VDO visit was 44%, 59% and 61% respectively, p 0.09. New consult visit percentage for in person, phone and VDO visit was 7%, 2% and 5% respectively, p 0.46. Percentage of patients using insulin pump or continuous glucose monitoring for in person, phone and VDO visit was 33%, 43% and 54%, respectively, p 0.03. Baseline HbA1c was done in 89% (64/72) in person, 45% (22/49) phone and 52% (44/85) VDO visit. Among patients who had baseline HbA1c, average HbA1c was 8.6% (SD 1.8) for in person visit, 8.0% (SD 1.1) for phone visit and 8.1% (SD 1.8) for VDO visit, p 0.25. At 3 months, HbA1c was done in 38% of patients who had in person visit, 36% phone visit, and 43% VDO visit. Among patients who had 3 month follow up HbA1c, HbA1c ≤ 8% was achieved in 50%, 61% and 69% for in person, phone and VDO respectively, p 0.56. Mean 3 month follow up HbA1c was 8.1% (SD 1.3), 7.7% (SD 0.9) and 7.8% (SD 1.6) for in-person, phone and VDO visit respectively, p 0.47. Comparing mean HbA1c in patients who had both baseline and 3 month follow up HbA1c, changes were significant for in person visit 9.1% to 8.1% (p 0.01) and VDO visit 8.7% to 7.6% (p 0.01). No significant change in 3 month follow up HbA1c was observed in phone visit, 7.7% to 7.6% (p 0.88). Conclusions: This retrospective study showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, no differences in short term HbA1c outcome (3 month follow up mean HbA1c and percentage of patients who achieved HbA1c ≤ 8%) were observed among patients who adopted in-person and telehealth visit. Patients who adopted phone visit appeared to be older;and there was more diabetic technology usage (insulin pump or continuous glucose monitoring) among patients who adopted telehealth (phone and VDO) compared to in person visit.","Krahmer, Robert Thongprayoon Charat Ruanpeng Darin",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,218
307720,"Clinical characteristics of 2,459 severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients: A meta-analysis",2021,"Social support seems to enhance wellbeing and health in many populations. Conversely, poor social support and loneliness are a social determinant of poor health outcomes and can adversely affect physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Social support is especially important in traumatic grief. However, the ways in which grieving individuals interpret and define social support is not well understood, and little is known about what specific behaviours are perceived as helpful. Using qualitative description and content analysis, this study assessed bereaved individuals' satisfaction of social support in traumatic grief, using four categories of social support as a framework. Findings suggest inadequate satisfaction from professional, familial, and community support. Pets emerged with the most satisfactory ratings. Further, findings suggest that emotional support is the most desired type of support following traumatic loss. Implications for supporting bereaved individuals within and beyond the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Cacciatore, Joanne; Thieleman, Kara; Fretts, Ruth; Jackson, Lori Barnes",PLoS One,,218
308289,Angiotensin II infusion in COVID-19-associated vasodilatory shock: a case series,2020,"The LIGO/Virgo collaboration have by now detected the mergers of ten black hole binaries via the emission of gravitational radiation. The hypothesis that these black holes have formed during the cosmic QCD epoch and make up all of the cosmic dark matter, has been rejected by many authors reasoning that, among other constraints, primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter would lead to orders of magnitude larger merger rates than observed. We revisit the calculation of the present PBH merger rate. Solar mass PBHs form clusters at fairly high redshifts, which evaporate at lower redshifts. We consider in detail the evolution of binary properties in such clusters due to three-body interactions between the two PBH binary members and a third by-passing PBH, for the first time, by full numerical integration. A Monte-Carlo analysis shows that formerly predicted merger rates are reduced by orders of magnitude due to such interactions. The natural prediction of PBH dark matter formed during the QCD epoch yields a pronounced peak around $1M_{\odot}$ with a small mass fraction of PBHs on a shoulder around $30M_{\odot}$, dictated by the well-determined equation of state during the QCD epoch. We employ this fact to make a tentative prediction of the merger rate of $\sim 30M_{\odot}$ PBH binaries, and find it very close to that determined by LIGO/Virgo. Furthermore we show that current LIGO/Virgo limits on the existence of $\sim M_{\odot}$ binaries do not exclude QCD PBHs to make up all of the cosmic dark matter. Neither do constraints on QCD PBHs from the stochastic gravitational background, pre-recombination accretion, or dwarf galaxies pose a problem. Microlensing constraints on QCD PBHs should be re-investigated. We caution, however, in this numerically challenging problem some possibly relevant effects could not be treated.","Jedamzik, Karsten",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11172v2.pdf,218

Thus, our goal was to analyze tissue expression of interleukins 4, 13, (IL-4, IL-13), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-ß), and the number of M2 macrophages (Sphingosine-1) in patients who died by COVID-19, comparing with cases of severe pneumopathy caused by H1N1pdm09, and a control group without lung injury. Six lung biopsy samples of patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 group) were used and compared with ten lung samples of adults who died from a severe infection of H1N1pdm09 (H1N1 group) and eleven samples of patients who died from different causes without lung injury (CONTROL group). The expression of IL-4, IL-13, TGF-ß, and M2 macrophages score (Sphingosine-1) were identified through immunohistochemistry (IHC). Significantly higher IL-4 tissue expression and Sphingosine-1 in M2 macrophages were observed in the COVID-19 group compared to both the H1N1 and the CONTROL groups. A different mechanism of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) in SARS-CoV-2 compared to H1N1pdm09 infections were observed. IL-4 expression and lung remodeling are phenomena observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1pdm09. However, SARS-CoV-2 seems to promote lung damage through different mechanisms, such as the scarce participation Th1/Th17 response and the higher participation of the Th2.

In this study, we want to investigate the association between body composition and pulmonary function. And, as much as possible, answer the question of why bodyweight is not predictive of lung function. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed among 2967 employees of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) who participated in the TUMS Employees Cohort (TEC) study. The body composition of the participants was measured using the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) method. Anthropometric variables were also measured as a confounder. The pulmonary function of participants was assessed by a forced spirometry test. Results: The correlation of BIA values including fat-free mass and total body water with a pulmonary function such as FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 is higher than most anthropometric values such as weight, wrist circumference, and the waist to hip ratio. Also, in regression analysis, age and sex had an association with pulmonary function, but the weight did not show a significant relationship. On the other hand, fat-free mass and visceral fat were significantly associated with pulmonary function. One is direct and the other is inverse. Conclusion: We observed a negative association between visceral fat and pulmonary function tests and a direct association between Fat-free mass pulmonary function tests (FEV1 and FVC) adjusted for age, sex, and anthropometric indices. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.","Pouragha, H.; Kazemi, H.; Pouryaghoub, G.; Mehrdad, R.",Current Respiratory Medicine Reviews,,218

There is a need to identify empirically supported strategies to increase uptake, especially among young adults as this subpopulation has shown relatively poor adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Social norms - estimates of peers' behavior and attitudes - are robust predictors of health behaviors and norms-based intervention strategies may increase COVID vaccine uptake, once available. This study examined the extent that vaccination intentions and attitudes were associated with estimated social norms as an initial proof-of-concept test. METHOD: In November of 2020, 647 undergraduate students (46.21% response rate) completed online surveys in which they reported intentions to get COVID and influenza vaccines, perceived importance of these vaccines for young adults, and estimated social norms regarding peers' vaccination behaviors and attitudes. RESULTS: Students reported significantly greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine (91.64%) than an influenza vaccine (76.04%), and perceived COVID vaccination as significantly more important than influenza vaccination. The sample generally held strong intentions to receive a COVID vaccine and thought that doing so was of high importance, but participants, on average, perceived that other young adults would be less likely to be vaccinated and would not think vaccination was as important. Multiple regression models indicated that estimated social norms were positively associated with participants' own intentions and perceived importance of getting a COVID vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These significant associations highlight the potential value in developing and testing norms-based intervention strategies, such as personalized normative feedback, to improve uptake of forthcoming COVID vaccines among young adults.","Graupensperger, Scott; Abdallah, Devon A; Lee, Christine M",Vaccine,,218

To assure proper sample collection, sample adequacy controls (SACs) are needed that detect substances indicative of samples collected within the oral cavity. This study evaluated two candidate SACs for this purpose. One detected representative oral microbiota (Streptococcus species DNA) and the other, human cells (human mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for the two target cell types were applied to buccal swabs (representing samples collected within the oral cavity) and hand swabs (representing improperly collected samples) obtained from 51 healthy U.S. volunteers. Quantification cycle (Cq) cutoffs that maximized Youden's index were established for each assay. The streptococcal target at a Cq cutoff of &#8804;34.9 had 99.0% sensitivity and specificity for oral swab samples, whereas human mtDNA perfectly distinguished between hand and mouth swabs with a Cq cutoff of 31.3. The human mtDNA test was then applied to buccal, tongue, and gum swabs that had previously been collected from TB patients and controls in South Africa, along with ""air swabs"" collected as negative controls (total N = 292 swabs from 71 subjects). Of these swabs, 287/292 (98%) exhibited the expected Cq values. In a paired analysis the three oral sites yielded indistinguishable amounts of human mtDNA, however PurFlockTM swabs collected slightly more human mtDNA than did OmniSwabsTM (p = 0.012). The results indicate that quantification of human mtDNA cannot distinguish swabs collected from different sites within the mouth. However, it can reliably distinguish oral swabs from swabs that were not used orally, which makes it a useful SAC for oral swab-based diagnosis.","Deviaene, Meagan; Weigel, Kris M; Wood, Rachel C; Luabeya, Angelique K K; Jones-Engel, Lisa; Hatherill, Mark; Cangelosi, Gerard A",PLoS One,,218

During September 28-October 9, a total of 1,098 paired nasal swabs were tested using the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA and real-time RT-PCR. Virus culture was attempted on all antigen-positive or real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens. Among 871 (79%) paired swabs from asymptomatic participants, the antigen test sensitivity was 41.2%, specificity was 98.4%, and in this population the estimated positive predictive value (PPV) was 33.3%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 98.8%. Antigen test performance was improved among 227 (21%) paired swabs from participants who reported one or more symptoms at specimen collection (sensitivity = 80.0%; specificity = 98.9%; PPV = 94.1%; NPV = 95.9%). Virus was isolated from 34 (46.6%) of 73 antigen-positive or real-time RT-PCR-positive nasal swab specimens, including two of 18 that were antigen-negative and real-time RT-PCR-positive (false-negatives). The advantages of antigen tests such as low cost and rapid turnaround might allow for rapid identification of infectious persons. However, these advantages need to be balanced against lower sensitivity and lower PPV, especially among asymptomatic persons. Confirmatory testing with an FDA-authorized nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), such as RT-PCR, should be considered after negative antigen test results in symptomatic persons, and after positive antigen test results in asymptomatic persons (1).","Pray, Ian W; Ford, Laura; Cole, Devlin; Lee, Christine; Bigouette, John Paul; Abedi, Glen R; Bushman, Dena; Delahoy, Miranda J; Currie, Dustin; Cherney, Blake; Kirby, Marie; Fajardo, Geroncio; Caudill, Motria; Langolf, Kimberly; Kahrs, Juliana; Kelly, Patrick; Pitts, Collin; Lim, Ailam; Aulik, Nicole; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Whitaker, Brett; Browne, Hannah; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Shewmaker, Patricia; Folster, Jennifer; Bankamp, Bettina; Bowen, Michael D; Thornburg, Natalie J; Goffard, Kimberly; Limbago, Brandi; Bateman, Allen; Tate, Jacqueline E; Gieryn, Douglas; Kirking, Hannah L; Westergaard, Ryan; Killerby, Marie",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,218
317662,Awareness of mental health problems in patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19): A lesson from an adult man attempting suicide,2020,"Smartphone-based contact-tracing applications are at the epicenter of the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. While governments and healthcare agencies are eager to mandate the deployment of such applications en-masse, they face increasing scrutiny from the popular press, security companies, and human rights watch agencies that fear the exploitation of these technologies as surveillance tools. Finding the optimal balance between community safety and privacy has been a challenge, and strategies to address these concerns have varied among countries. This paper describes two important attacks that affect a broad swath of contact-tracing applications. The first, referred to as contact-isolation attack, is a user-privacy attack that can be used to identify potentially infected patients in your neighborhood. The second is a contact-pollution attack that affects the integrity of contact tracing applications by causing them to produce a high volume of false-positive alerts. We developed prototype implementations and evaluated both attacks in the context of the DP-3T application framework, but these vulnerabilities affect a much broader class of applications. We found that both attacks are feasible and realizable with a minimal attacker work factor. We further conducted an impact assessment of these attacks by using a simulation study and measurements from the SafeGraph database. Our results indicate that attacks launched from a modest number (on the order of 10,000) of monitoring points can effectively decloak between 5-40\% of infected users in a major metropolis, such as Houston.","Huang, Jianwei; Yegneswaran, Vinod; Porras, Phillip; Gu, Guofei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03283v2.pdf,218

However, radioresistance eventually occurs, resulting in poor outcomes in patients with cancer. Radioresistance is associated with multiple signaling pathways, particularly pro-survival signaling pathways. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade is an important signaling pathway that initiates several cellular processes and is regulated by various stimuli, including IR. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the pro-survival effects of active ERK, activation of ERK has also been associated with cell death, indicating that radiosensitization may occur by ERK stimulation. In this context, the present review describes the associations between ERK signaling, cancer and IR, and discusses the association between ERK and its pro-survival function in cancer cells, including stimuli, molecular mechanisms, clinical use of inhibitors and underlying limitations. Additionally, the present review introduces the view that active ERK may induce cell death, and describes the potential factors associated with this process. This review describes the various outcomes induced by active ERK to prompt future studies to aim to enhance radiosensitivity in the treatment of cancer.","Lu, Yinliang; Liu, Baocai; Liu, Ying; Yu, Xinyue; Cheng, Guanghui",Oncol Lett,,218

319088,Heart failure-related hospitalisation and management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a reflection,2020,"The spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, in the period March-May 2020, quickly triggered a deep crisis, causing an immediate economic slowdown and consequently a strong contraction in domestic demand and trade. The food supply chain faced severe difficulties, although its anti-cyclical nature allowed for greater resilience compared to other economic sectors. In this framework of ongoing uncertainty, it is important to understand the response of farms to the crisis, and their role in the sustainability of the post-pandemic food supply chain, even for future policy interventions in the short and medium term. The purpose of the paper is to investigate how diversification affected the response of farms to the Covid-19 crisis, and explore whether the changes required by the post-crisis scenario can produce opportunities for their activities. The study investigates a sample of fifteen farms in central Italy through semi-structured interviews, performing a lexicon-based text and sentiment analysis. The results highlight the importance of farm diversification in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis, and emphasise the role of diversified farms for the sustainability of the agri-food system. These results have interesting policy implications, particularly regarding support for the competitiveness of farms by improving sustainable logistics, electronic commerce and exchanges of knowledge and innovations among farmers;these measures should be taken into account to target the future agricultural, rural and food policies, at both national and local level.","Mastronardi, Luigi Cavallo Aurora Romagnoli Luca",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,218

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 401 adult patients attending a clinic following an index hospital admission or emergency department attendance with COVID-19. Regression models were used to assess the association between characteristics and persistent abnormal chest radiographs or breathlessness. RESULTS: 75.1% of patients were symptomatic at a median of 53 days post discharge and 72 days after symptom onset and chest radiographs were abnormal in 47.4%. Symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were similar in PCR-positive and PCR-negative patients. Severity of COVID-19 was significantly associated with persistent radiographic abnormalities and breathlessness. 18.5% of patients had unscheduled healthcare visits in the 30 days post discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 experience persistent symptoms and abnormal blood biomarkers with a gradual resolution of radiological abnormalities over time. These findings can inform patients and clinicians about expected recovery times and plan services for follow-up of patients with COVID-19.","Mallia, Patrick; Meghji, Jamilah; Wong, Brandon; Kumar, Kartik; Pilkington, Victoria; Chhabra, Shaan; Russell, Ben; Chen, Jian; Srikanthan, Karthikan; Park, Mirae; Owles, Harriet; Liew, Felicity; Alcada, Joana; Martin, Laura; Coleman, Meg; Elkin, Sarah; Ross, Clare; Agrawal, Shweta; Gardiner, Thomas; Bell, Aaron; White, Alice; Hampson, Dominic; Vithlani, Gauri; Manalan, Kavina; Bramer, Solange; Martin Segura, Alejandra; Kucheria, Anushree; Ratnakumar, Prashanthi; Sheeka, Alexander; Anandan, Lavanya; Copley, Susan; Russell, Georgina; Bloom, Chloe I; Kon, Onn Min",,,218
319970,Considerations When Managing Heart Failure during the COVID-19 Pandemic-Consensus from the Taiwan Society of Cardiology,2021,"The social distancing measure imposed worldwide to combat the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has seen rapid adoption of technologies to support online education. Compared to traditional lecture-based courses, online teaching is particularly more challenging for laboratory courses where hands-on activities are essential to achieve the learning outcomes. To deal with this issue, the study presented in this paper was aimed to: (1) to develop a virtual reality (VR) application to aid a civil engineering laboratory course, and (2) to measure the potential of the VR-aided learning (VRAL) application in civil engineering education by assessing the learners' preferences toward VRAL compared to instructor-aided learning (IAL) and video-aided learning (VAL). Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, a comparison was conducted with 21 civil engineering students from both undergraduate and graduate levels. The results indicated that VRAL was more preferable than VAL by the participants based on the aspects of “interactivity” (the ability to provide theoretical and practical learning environments to the learners), “cognitive interest” (the ability to drive learners to engage in learning activity), “ease of understanding the content” (the ability to provide a clear lecture interpretation, i.e., easy to understand), and “support for learning” (the ability to help learners to achieve the learning goal). Although VRAL was comparatively less preferable than IAL by the participants overall, it was viewed as better in terms of cognitive interest and “accessibility” (the ability to provide learners with better access to the learning approach in terms of time and location). Complementing previous research, the findings supported the benefits of VR applications to aid civil engineering education. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Try, S.; Panuwatwanich, K.; Tanapornraweekit, G.; Kaewmoracharoen, M.",Computer Applications in Engineering Education,,218
321329,Cancer associates with risk and severe events of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the first COVID-19 pandemic 'lockdown' in Aotearoa/New Zealand (March-May 2020, in which strict 'stay at home' measures were introduced), general practices were advised to use telephone and video consultations (telehealth) wherever possible instead of the usual in-person visits. This was a sudden change for most practices and patients. This research aimed to explore how patients accessed general practice during lockdown and evaluate their experiences with telehealth, to inform how telehealth could be most effectively used in the future. METHODS: Using a mixed-method approach, we undertook an online survey and in-depth interviews with adults (> 18 years) who had contact with practices during lockdown, recruited through social media and email lists. We present descriptive statistics from the survey data (n = 1010) and qualitative analysis of interview data (n = 38) and open-ended survey questions, using a framework of access to health care, from the patient's perspective. RESULTS: In general, patients reported high satisfaction with telehealth in general practice during lockdown. Telehealth was convenient and allowed patients to safely access health care without having to weigh-up the fear of COVID-19 infection against the need to be seen. Telehealth worked best for routine and familiar health issues and when rapport was established between patients and clinicians. This was easier with a pre-existing clinical relationship, but not impossible without one. Telehealth was less suitable when a physical examination was needed, when the diagnosis was unknown or for patients who had a strong preference to be seen in-person. CONCLUSIONS: Even in this disruptive lockdown period, that prompted an unexpected and rapid implementation of telehealth services in general practices, most patients had positive experiences with telehealth. In the future, patients want the choice of consultation type to match their needs, circumstances, and preferences. Technological issues and funding barriers may need to be addressed, and clear communication for both patients and clinicians is needed about key aspects of telehealth (e.g. cost, appropriateness, privacy). Maintaining telehealth as an option post-lockdown has the potential to increase timely and safe access to primary health care for many patients.","Imlach, Fiona; McKinlay, Eileen; Middleton, Lesley; Kennedy, Jonathan; Pledger, Megan; Russell, Lynne; Churchward, Marianna; Cumming, Jacqueline; McBride-Henry, Karen",BMC Fam Pract,,218
321500,"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of diabetics hospitalized for COVID-19 infection: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed multiple public health, socio-economic, and institutional crises. Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the ""COVID-19 Disorder Tracker"" initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation. Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually exclusive.","Campedelli, Gian Maria; D039,; Orsogna, Maria R",PLoS One,,218

We report on a 63-year-old man who ingested a double dose (900 mg) of encorafenib for 16 days. He developed overall minor chronic overdose symptoms such as nausea and vomiting grade 1 and muscle pain. Based on the most occurring adverse events of encorafenib, liver values, kidney function parameters and QTc interval were measured. Kidney function parameters were normal, whereas liver values were slightly increased (grade 1) and QTc slightly prolonged. The plasma concentration 3 h after the last dose was 2110 ng/mL.

Such measures are currently either implemented or at least discussed in numerous countries worldwide to ward off a potential new wave of COVID-19 across Europe. They come in the form of Health Passes (HP), which grant full access to public life only to individuals with a certificate that proves that they have either been fully vaccinated, have recovered from a previous infection or have recently tested negative to SARS-Cov-19 . We develop both a compartmental model as well as an epidemic Renormalisation Group approach, which is capable of describing the dynamics over a longer period of time, notably an entire epidemiological wave. Introducing different versions of HPs in this model, we are capable of providing quantitative estimates on the effectiveness of the underlying measures as a function of the fraction of the population that is vaccinated and the vaccination rate.

RESULTS: We observed a two-month mortality of 40%, compared to 6.4% in the previous year. This increase was seen in both COVID-19 positive (43%) and negative (24%) residents, but 8 patients among those testing negative on the swab, tested positive on serological tests.

CONCLUSION: Our data confirms a higher geriatric mortality due to COVID-19. Negative residents also had higher mortality, which we suspect is secondary to preanalytical error and a low sensitivity of the swab test in poorly compliant subjects.

327285,The clinical characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with cerebral strokeï¼a retrospective study of 113 cases from one single center,2020,"BACKGROUND: Innovative laboratory testing approaches for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response are needed to conduct research to establish estimates of prevalence and incidence. Self-specimen collection methods have been successfully used in HIV and sexually transmitted infection research and can provide a feasible opportunity to scale up SARS-CoV-2 testing for research purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of adults to use different specimen collection modalities for themselves and children as part of a COVID-19 research study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 1, 2020, we recruited 1435 adults aged 18 years or older though social media advertisements. Participants completed a survey that included 5-point Likert scale items stating how willing they were to use the following specimen collection testing modalities as part of a research study: home collection of a saliva sample, home collection of a throat swab, home finger-prick blood collection, drive-through site throat swab, clinic throat swab, and clinic blood collection. Additionally, participants indicated how the availability of home-based collection methods would impact their willingness to participate compared to drive-through and clinic-based specimen collection. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations to assess if willingness to use each testing modality differed by demographic variables and characteristics of interest. We compared the overall willingness to use each testing modality and estimated effect sizes with Cohen d. RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 1435 participants with a median age of 40.0 (SD=18.2) years and over half of which were female (761/1435, 53.0%). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to use specimens self-collected at home to participate in research, including willingness to collect a saliva sample (1259/1435, 87.7%) or a throat swab (1191/1435, 83.1%). Willingness to collect a throat swab sample was lower in both a drive-through setting (64%) and clinic setting (53%). Overall, 69.0% (990/1435) of participants said they would be more likely to participate in a research study if they could provide a saliva sample or throat swab at home compared to going to a drive-through site; only 4.4% (63/1435) of participants said they would be less likely to participate using self-collected samples. For each specimen collection modality, willingness to collect specimens from children for research was lower than willingness to use on oneself, but the ranked order of modalities was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants were willing to participate in a COVID-19 research study that involves laboratory testing; however, there was a strong preference for home specimen collection procedures over drive-through or clinic-based testing. To increase participation and minimize bias, epidemiologic research studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response should consider home specimen collection methods.","Hall, Eric William; Luisi, Nicole; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Wilde, Gretchen; Sullivan, Patrick; Sanchez, Travis; Bradley, Heather; Siegler, Aaron J",J Med Internet Res,,218

The findings showed that eight (8) novel molecules violated none of the druglikeness rules of which three (3) novel molecules (C33, C35 and C54) showed the utmost binding affinity of −8.3 kcal/mol against Mpro;C33 showed a good in silico pharmacokinetic features with acceptable level of stability and reactively better than our controls based on the quantum chemical descriptors analysis. However, there is an urgent need to carry out more research on these novel molecules for the fight against the disease.

There have been abundant research data and findings in this field. The interference of drugs on gene expression in cell lines, drug-target, protein-virus receptor networks, and immune cell infiltration of the host may provide useful information for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug research. To simplify the complex bioinformatics analysis and facilitate the evaluation of the latest research data, we developed OmiczViz ( http://medcode.link/omicsviz ), a web tool that has integrated drug-cell line interference data, virus-host protein-protein interactions, and drug-target interactions. To demonstrate the usages of OmiczViz, we analyzed the gene expression data from cell lines treated with chloroquine and ruxolitinib, the drug-target protein networks of 48 anti-coronavirus drugs and drugs bound with ACE2, and the profiles of immune cell infiltration between different COVID-19 patient groups. Our research shows that chloroquine had a regulatory role of the immune response in renal cell line but not in lung cell line. The anti-coronavirus drug-target network analysis suggested that antihistamine of promethaziney and dietary supplement of Zinc might be beneficial when used jointly with antiviral drugs. The immune infiltration analysis indicated that both the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU and the elderly with infection showed immune exhaustion status, yet with different molecular mechanisms. The interactive graphic interface of OmiczViz also makes it easier to analyze newly discovered and user-uploaded data, leading to an in-depth understanding of existing findings and an expansion of existing knowledge of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, OmicsViz is web program that promotes the research on medical agents against SARS-CoV-2 and supports the evaluation of the latest research findings.","Wang, ZhiGang; He, YongQun; Huang, Jing; Yang, XiaoLin",Sci Rep,,218

Using gradient information, we accelerated the convergence of the algorithm that enables us to solve well-known complex benchmark functions optimally for the first time in this field. We also used the Gaussian walk and Lévy flight to improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the GGWO to avoid trapping in local optima. We apply the suggested method to several benchmark functions to show its efficiency. The outcomes reveal that our algorithm performs superior to most existing algorithms in the literature in most benchmarks. Moreover, we apply our algorithm for predicting the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Since the prediction of the epidemic is a complicated task due to its stochastic nature, presenting efficient methods to solve the problem is vital. Since the healthcare system has a limited capacity, it is essential to predict the pandemic's future trend to avoid overload. Our results predict that the US will have almost 16 million cases by the end of November. The upcoming peak in the number of infected, ICU admitted cases would be mid-to-end November. In the end, we proposed several managerial insights that will help the policymakers have a clearer vision about the growth of COVID-19 and avoid equipment shortages in healthcare systems.","Khalilpourazari, Soheyl; Hashemi Doulabi, Hossein; Özyüksel Çiftçioglu, Aybike; Weber, Gerhard-Wilhelm",Expert Syst Appl,,218

We present five consecutive cases of fetal death (≥12 weeks) without other putative causes in women with laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR) COVID-19 managed in a single Brazilian institution. Case series: All five women were outpatients with mild or moderate forms of COVID-19 and were not taking any medication. Four were nulliparous, all were overweight or obese, and none had any comorbidities or pregnancy complications that could contribute to fetal demise. Fetal death occurred at 21–38 weeks of gestation, on COVID-days 1–22. SARS-Cov-2 was detected by RT-PCR in amniotic fluid in one case and in placental specimens in two cases. All five women had acute chorioamnionitis on placental histology, massive deposition of fibrin, mixed intervillitis/villitis, and intense neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration. One fetus had neutrophils inside alveolar spaces, suggestive of fetal infection. Conclusions: These five cases of fetal demise in women with confirmed COVID-19 without any other significant clinical or obstetric disorders suggest that fetal death can be an outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. The intense placental inflammatory reaction in all five cases raises the possibility of a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the placenta.","Richtmann, Rosana; Torloni, Maria Regina; Oyamada Otani, Andre Ricardo; Levi, Jose Eduardo; Crema Tobara, Mariana; de Almeida Silva, Camila; Dias, Lívio; Miglioli-Galvão, Lisia; Martins Silva, Pollyanna; Macoto Kondo, Mario",Case Rep.

We examined their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine and implemented an intervention to increase vaccination uptake. DESIGN: Before-and-after trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Healthcare personnel at a 790-bed tertiary-care center in Tokyo, Japan. INTERVENTIONS: A prevaccination questionnaire was administered to HCP to examine their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine. A multifaceted intervention was then implemented involving (1) distribution of informational leaflets to all HCP, (2) hospital-wide announcements encouraging vaccination, (3) a mandatory lecture, (4) an educational session about the vaccine for pregnant or breastfeeding HCP, and (5) allergy testing for HCP at risk of allergic reactions to the vaccine. A postvaccination survey was also performed. RESULTS: Of 1,575 HCP eligible for enrollment, 1,224 (77.7%) responded to the questionnaire, 533 (43.5%) expressed willingness to be vaccinated, 593 (48.4%) were uncertain, and 98 (8.0%) expressed unwillingness to be vaccinated. The latter 2 groups were concerned about the vaccine's safety rather than its efficacy. After the intervention, the overall vaccination rate reached 89.7% (1,413 of 1,575), and 88.9% (614 of 691) of the prevaccination survey respondents answered ""unwilling"" to or ""unsure"" about eventually receiving a vaccination. In the postvaccination questionnaire, factors contributing to increased COVID-19 vaccination included information and endorsement of vaccination at the medical center (274 of 1,037, 26.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This multifaceted intervention increased COVID-19 vaccinations among HCP at a Japanese hospital. Frequent support and provision of information were crucial for increasing the vaccination rate and may be applicable to the general population as well.","Takamatsu, Akane; Honda, Hitoshi; Kojima, Tomoya; Murata, Kengo; Babcock, Hilary M",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,218

However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional support is the basis of treatment. It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically. Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.","Li, X Y; Du, B; Wang, Y S; Kang, H Y J; Wang, F; Sun, B; Qiu, H B; Tong, Z H",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,218

348571,Joint Pains and a Racing Heart- Ventricular Tachycardia as an Initial Presentation of Underlying Scleroderma Related Autoimmune Myocarditis,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses one of this century's greatest public health challenges, with impacts on the health and living conditions of populations worldwide. The literature has reported that the pandemic affects the hegemonic food system in various ways. In Brazil, the pandemic amplifies existing social, racial, and gender inequalities, further jeopardizing the Human Right to Adequate Food (HRAF) and the attainment of food and nutritional security, especially among more vulnerable groups. In this context, the article aims to analyze the first measures by the Brazilian Federal Government to mitigate the pandemic's effects and that may have repercussions on food and nutritional security, considering the recent institutional changes in policies and programs. A narrative literature review was performed, and the information sources were the bulletins of the Center for Coordination of Operations by the Crisis Committee for Supervising and Monitoring the Impacts of COVID-19 and homepages of various government ministries, from March to May 2020. The actions were systematized according to the guidelines of the National Policy for Food and Nutritional Security. The analysis identified the creation of institutional crisis management arrangements. The proposed actions feature those involving access to income, emergency aid, and food, such as authorization for food distribution outside schools with federal funds from the National School Feeding Program. However, the setbacks and dismantlement in food and nutritional security may undermine the Federal Government's capacity to respond to COVID-19.","Alpino, Tais de Moura Ariza; Santos, Cláudia Roberta Bocca; Barros, Denise Cavalcante de; Freitas, Carlos Machado de",Cad Saude Publica,,218

METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed and Scopus (April 2020). Studies reporting data on sensitivity or specificity of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 using any human biological sample were included. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were evaluated. Meta-analysis showed that computed tomography has high sensitivity (91.9% [89.8%-93.7%]), but low specificity (25.1% [21.0%-29.5%]). The combination of IgM and IgG antibodies demonstrated promising results for both parameters (84.5% [82.2%-86.6%]; 91.6% [86.0%-95.4%], respectively). For RT-PCR tests, rectal stools/swab, urine, and plasma were less sensitive while sputum (97.2% [90.3%-99.7%]) presented higher sensitivity for detecting the virus. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in sputum samples. However, the combination of different diagnostic tests is highly recommended to achieve adequate sensitivity and specificity.","Böger, Beatriz; Fachi, Mariana M; Vilhena, Raquel O; Cobre, Alexandre F; Tonin, Fernanda S; Pontarolo, Roberto",Am. j. infect. control,,218

Prevalence of these underlying conditions among workers differs by industry and occupation. Many essential workers, who hold jobs critical to the continued function of infrastructure operations (2), have high potential for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, because their jobs require close contact with patients, the general public, or coworkers. To assess the baseline prevalence of underlying conditions among workers in six essential occupations and seven essential industries, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 and 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys, the most recent data available.* This report presents unadjusted prevalences and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for selected underlying conditions. Among workers in the home health aide occupation and the nursing home/rehabilitation industry, aPRs were significantly elevated for the largest number of conditions. Extra efforts to minimize exposure risk and prevent and treat underlying conditions are warranted to protect workers whose jobs increase their risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Silver, Sharon R; Li, Jia; Boal, Winifred L; Shockey, Taylor L; Groenewold, Matthew R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,218

355945,Risk Factors for Mortality in Adult COVID-19 Patients Who Develop Bloodstream Infections Mostly Caused by Antimicrobial-Resistant Organisms: Analysis at a Large Teaching Hospital in Italy,2021,"COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, accompanies an unprecedented spike in cytokines levels termed cytokines release syndrome (CRS), in critically ill patients. Clinicians claim that the surge demonstrates a deregulated immune defence in host, as infected cell expression analysis depicts a delay in type-I (interferon-I) and type-III IFNs expression, along with a limited Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) response, which later resume and culminates in elicitation of several cytokines including- IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF&#945;, IL-17, MCP-1, IP-10 and IL-10 etc. Although cytokines are messenger molecules of the immune system, but their increased concentration results in inflammation, infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils and lung injury in patients. This inflammatory response results in the precarious pathogenesis of COVID-19; thus, a complete estimation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is vital in designing a harmless and effective vaccine. In pathogenesis analysis, it emerges that a timely forceful type-I IFN production (18-24hrs post infection) promotes innate and acquired immune responses, while a delay in IFNs production (3-4 days post infection) actually renders both innate and acquired responses ineffective in fighting infection. Further, underlying conditions including hypertension, obesity, cardio-vascular disease etc may increase the chances of putting people in risk groups, which end up having critical form of infection. This review summarizes the events starting from viral entry, its struggle with the immune system and failure of host immunological parameters to obliterate the infections, which finally culminate into massive release of CRS and inflammation in gravely ill patients.","Pasrija, Ritu; Naime, Mohammad",Int Immunopharmacol,,218

Na primeira parte, são discutidos os sentidos de comunidade definidos por critérios geográficos, de agregação de interesses ou epidemiológicos. No contexto da pandemia, reflete-se que nenhuma das três perspectivas podem ser consideradas isoladamente. Foi discutida a necessidade de articulação das diferentes abordagens a fim de se prover intervenções sanitárias socialmente contextualizadas. Em seguida, são apresentados os quatro principais modelos teóricos presentes na literatura internacional que fundamentam as práticas de participação comunitária em diversos países. Para a análise da participação comunitária no contexto da COVID-19 foi utilizada a sistematização conceitual fundamentada em duas metanarrativas: a utilitarista e a da justiça social. A perspectiva utilitarista envolve ações direcionadas às medidas de restrição do contato social. Nesse sentido, a participação é entendida como colaboração na execução de ações que contribuam para o controle do agravo. A perspectiva da justiça social aborda sobretudo os determinantes sociais da saúde e a redução das desigualdades sociais. Trata-se de abordagem voltada ao empoderamento comunitário e à busca de soluções para os problemas sociais e econômicos determinantes da disseminação da COVID-19 e de outras doenças. Conclui-se sobre as peculiaridades e a importância de cada uma das abordagens. A participação comunitária no enfrentamento da COVID-19 deve considerar os contextos emergencial, de fortalecimento do sistema de saúde e de defesa do sistema de proteção social e da democracia.","Bispo Júnior, José Patrício; Morais, Marciglei Brito",Cad.

METHODS: Participants enrolled in the PRogrEssion of DIabetic ComplicaTions (PREDICT) cohort study in Melbourne, Australia (n = 489 with a baseline assessment pre-2020) were invited to complete a phone/online follow-up assessment in mid-2020 (i.e., amidst COVID-19 lockdown restrictions). Repeated assessments that were compared with pre-COVID-19 baseline levels included anxiety symptoms (7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale [GAD-7]), depressive symptoms (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8]), diabetes distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes scale [PAID]), physical activity/sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption and diabetes self-management behaviours. Additional once-off measures at follow-up included COVID-19-specific worry, quality of life (QoL), and healthcare appointment changes (telehealth engagement and appointment cancellations/avoidance). RESULTS: Among 470 respondents (96%; aged 66 ± 9 years, 69% men), at least 'moderate' worry about COVID-19 infection was reported by 31%, and 29%-73% reported negative impacts on QoL dimensions (greatest for: leisure activities, feelings about the future, emotional well-being). Younger participants reported more negative impacts (p < 0.05). Overall, anxiety/depressive symptoms were similar at follow-up compared with pre-COVID-19, but diabetes distress reduced (p < 0.001). Worse trajectories of anxiety/depressive symptoms were observed among those who reported COVID-19-specific worry or negative QoL impacts (p < 0.05). Physical activity trended lower (~10%), but sitting time, alcohol consumption and glucose-monitoring frequency remained unchanged. 73% of participants used telehealth, but 43% cancelled a healthcare appointment and 39% avoided new appointments despite perceived need. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions negatively impacted QoL, some behavioural risk factors and healthcare utilisation in adults with type 2 diabetes.

361723,The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic on Access to Endoscopy Procedures in the VA Healthcare System,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective in curbing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. All US states have adopted NPI policies, but the compliance to these measures and influence of sociopolitical factors on NPI adherence is unknown. NPI adherence may be approximated by personal mobility in a population that is tracked by anonymous mobile phone data. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study of state-level mobility changes across the US. METHODS: State-level mobility was based on anonymous mobile phone data from multiple participating carriers collected by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (http://www.healthdata.org). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine the strength and direction of the relationship between political affiliations and mobility restriction across states. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess other factors that may impact personal travel. RESULTS: All states experienced a decline in personal mobility but had varying nadirs ranging from a 34% to a 69% reduction in mobility, which was not temporally related to the timing of state-level NPI measures. There was a statistically significant linear and negative correlation (r = -0.79) between the proportion of Republicans/leaning Republicans and NPI adherence across US states. The negative association between Republicans and NPI adherence was significant even when adjusting for urbanization, proportion of essential workers, population, Gini index, and poverty rates. CONCLUSIONS: Political orientation affects risk perception, which may contribute to the unwillingness of some individuals to perceive the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic as a risk and to comply with NPIs. Our results highlight the importance of sociopolitical factors in disease control and emphasize the importance of bipartisan efforts in fighting the pandemic. These results may have implications for the development, dissemination, and communication of public health policies.","Hsiehchen, D; Espinoza, M; Slovic, P",Public Health,,218

We ask two fundamental epistemological questions regarding each hypothesis: First, how much confirmation does a positive test lend to each hypothesis? Second, how much evidence does a positive test provide for each hypothesis against its negation? We respond to each question within a formal Bayesian framework. We construe degree of confirmation as the difference between the posterior probability of the hypothesis and its prior, and the strength of evidence for a hypothesis against its alternative in terms of their likelihood ratio. We find that test specificity-and coinfection probabilities when making inferences about C-were key determinants of confirmation and evidence. Tests with < 87% specificity could not provide strong evidence (likelihood ratio > 8) for V against ¬V regardless of sensitivity. Accordingly, low specificity tests could not provide strong evidence in favor of C in all plausible scenarios modeled. We also show how a positive influenza A test disconfirms C and provides weak evidence against C in dependence on the probability that the patient is influenza A infected given that his/her symptoms are not caused by SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis points out some caveats that should be considered when attributing symptoms or death of a positively tested patient to SARS-CoV-2.","Klement, Rainer Johannes; Bandyopadhyay, Prasanta S",Acta biotheor,,218

Students were placed into transdisciplinary teams and assigned to one of two community-based early childhood programs to administer a universal screening tool that assessed young children in several domains. The project was in its sixth year when the country stood still because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project was re-envisioned, mid-course, to provide an equitable and rigorous assignment for students who were unable to complete the original assignment due to the lockdown. Student perceptions were compared, pre and post COVID;subsequent results are discussed in alignment with the original four goals of the project. Additionally, suggestions are posed to position this service-learning assignment for remote delivery should the pandemic persist to disrupt higher education.","Doody, Kathy R.; Fulcher-Rood, Katrina Schueltze Pamela",Excelsior: Leadership in Teaching and Learning,,218
369243,Markers of liver injury and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"In order to control highly-contagious and prolonged outbreaks, public health authorities intervene to institute social distancing, lock-down policies, and other Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Given the high social, educational, psychological, and economic costs of NPIs, authorities tune them, alternatively tightening up or relaxing rules, with the result that, in effect, a relatively flat infection rate results. For example, during the summer in parts of the United States, daily COVID-19 infection numbers dropped to a plateau. This paper approaches NPI tuning as a control-theoretic problem, starting from a simple dynamic model for social distancing based on the classical SIR epidemics model. Using a singular-perturbation approach, the plateau becomes a Quasi-Steady-State (QSS) of a reduced two-dimensional SIR model regulated by adaptive dynamic feedback. It is shown that the QSS can be assigned and it is globally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, the dynamic model for social distancing can be interpreted as a nonlinear integral controller. Problems of data fitting and parameter identifiability are also studied for this model. The paper also discusses how this simple model allows for a meaningful study of the effect of population size, vaccinations, and the emergence of second waves. IEEE","Al-Radhawi, M.

371408,Remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19; an updated systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The potential protective or pathogenic role of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been vigorously debated. While COVID-19 patients consistently generate a T lymphocyte response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, evidence of significant immune dysregulation in these patients continues to accumulate. In this study, next generation sequencing of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) repertoire was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients to determine if immunogenetic differences of the TRB repertoire contribute to disease course severity. Clustering of highly similar TRB CDR3 amino acid sequences across COVID-19 patients yielded 781 shared TRB sequences. The TRB sequences were then filtered for known associations with common diseases such as EBV and CMV. The remaining sequences were cross-referenced to a publicly accessible dataset that mapped COVID-19 specific TCRs to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identified 158 SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences belonging to 134 clusters in our COVID-19 patients. Next, we investigated 113 SARS-CoV-2 specific clusters binding only one peptide target in relation to disease course. Distinct skewing of SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences toward the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) encoded within ORF1a/b of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was observed in clusters associated with critical disease course when compared to COVID-19 clusters associated with a severe disease course. These data imply that T-lymphocyte reactivity towards peptides from NSPs of SARS-CoV-2 may not constitute an effective adaptive immune response and thus may negatively affect disease severity.","Assmann, Jorn L J C; Kolijn, P Martijn; Schrijver, Benjamin; van Gammeren, Adriaan J; Loth, Daan W; Ermens, Ton A A M; Dik, Willem A; van der Velden, Vincent H J; Langerak, Anton W",J. leukoc. biol,,218

372055,Cardiac Arrest and Clinical Outcomes in Covid 19 Patients : a Single Center Experience,2021,"Emerging and re-emerging viral diseases can create devastating effects on human lives and may also lead to economic crises. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic due to the novel coronavirus (nCoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Wuhan, China, has caused a global public health emergency. To date, the molecular mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, its clinical manifestations and pathogenesis is not completely understood. The global scientific community has intensified its efforts in understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 for development of vaccines and therapeutic interventions to prevent the rapid spread of the virus and to control mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19. To understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, appropriate animal models that mimic the biology of human SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. In this review, we outline animal models that have been used to study previous human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Importantly, we discuss models that are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various available methods.","Pandey, Kabita; Acharya, Arpan; Mohan, Mahesh; Ng, Caroline L; Reid, St Patrick; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Transbound. emerg. dis.

However, the potential contribution of foods to consumers' health has so far only been partially exploited. The rapidly evolving scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is stimulating profound reflection on the relationships between food and the etiological agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, the status of knowledge regarding food as a possible defense/co-therapeutic strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is considered through the discussion of two main current lines of research. One line of research relates to the role of micronutrients, food components, and diets in the strengthening of the immune system through clinical trials; formulations could be developed as immune system enhancers or as co-adjuvants in therapies. The other line of research relates to investigation of the chemical interactions that specific food compounds can have with host or virus targets so as to interfere with the viral infective cycle of SARS-CoV-2. This line requires, as a first step, an in silico evaluation to discover lead compounds, which may be further developed through drug-design studies, in vitro and in vivo tests, and, finally, clinical trials to obtain therapeutic molecules. All of these promising strategies promote the role of food in preventive/co-therapeutic strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.","Matteo, Giacomo Di; Spano, Mattia; Grosso, Michela; Salvo, Andrea; Ingallina, Cinzia; Russo, Mariateresa; Ritieni, Alberto; Mannina, Luisa",Foods,,218

372728,Transition of a Large Tertiary Heart Failure Program in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Changes That Will Endure,2020,"In this article we use global and regional data from the SARS epidemic in conjunction with a model of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, and recovered classes of people (``SEIJR'') to extract average properties and rate constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\it significant} slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza \cite{CC2}. Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than ten per cent in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS.","Chowell, Gerardo; Fenimore, Paul W.; Castillo-Garsow, Melissa A.; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0503002v1.pdf,218
372877,External validation and update of prediction models for unfavorable outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Japan,2021,"Lockdown curbs the COVID-19 epidemics but at huge costs. Public debates question its impact compared to reliance on individual responsibility. We study how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics and interacts with policies. We first assess the value of lockdown in terms of mortality compared to a counterfactual scenario that incorporates self-protection efforts; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when public regulations change. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Physical distancing effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions of the epidemics and average distancing effort in the population. Rational distancing effort is computed as a Nash Equilibrium. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to daily incidence of hospitalization in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that a business-as-usual benchmark yields an overestimation of the number of deaths by a factor of 10 compared to benchmarks with equilibrium efforts. However, lockdown saves nearly twice as many lives as individual efforts alone. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Communication that increases risk salience is more effective.","Aubert, Cécile; Augeraud-Véron, Emmanuelle",PLoS One,,218

METHODS: In this study, 590 COVID-19 patients during hospitalization were enrolled (Training set: n = 285; Internal validation set: n = 127; Prospective set: n = 178). After filtered by two machine learning methods in the training set, 5 out of 31 clinical features were selected into the model building to predict the risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to build the prediction nomogram and validated in two different sets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate its performance. RESULTS: From 31 potential predictors in the training set, 5 independent predictive factors were identified and included in the risk score: C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Age, Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score (CDCS), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Subsequently, we generated the nomogram based on the above features for predicting severe COVID-19. In the training cohort, the area under curves (AUCs) were 0.822 (95% CI, 0.765-0.875) and the internal validation cohort was 0.762 (95% CI, 0.768-0.844). Further, we validated it in a prospective cohort with the AUCs of 0.705 (95% CI, 0.627-0.778). The internally bootstrapped calibration curve showed favorable consistency between prediction by nomogram and the actual situation. And DCA analysis also conferred high clinical net benefit. CONCLUSION: In this study, our predicting model based on five clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients will enable clinicians to predict the potential risk of developing critical illness and thus optimize medical management.","Yao, Zhixian; Zheng, Xinyi; Zheng, Zhong; Wu, Ke; Zheng, Junhua",Immun Inflamm Dis,,218

In this observational study we recorded objective data on sleep macro- and microarchitecture repeatedly over several nights before and during the Covid-19 government-imposed lockdown. The main objective was to evaluate changes in patterns of sleep duration and architecture during home confinement using the pre-confinement period as a control. METHODS: Participants were regular users of a sleep-monitoring headband that records, stores, and automatically analyses physiological data in real time, equivalent to polysomnography. We measured: sleep onset duration (SOD), total sleep time (TST), duration of sleep stages (N2, N3 and REM), and sleep continuity. Via the user's smartphone application participants filled-in questionnaires on how lockdown changed working hours, eating behaviour, and daily-life at home. They also filled-in the Insomnia Severity Index, reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires allowing us to create selected sub-groups. RESULTS: The 599 participants were mainly men (71%) of median age 47 [IQR: 36;59]. Compared to before lockdown, during lockdown individuals slept more overall (mean +3·83 min; SD: ±1.3), had less deep sleep (N3), more light sleep (N2) and longer REM sleep (mean +3·74 min; SD: ±0.8). They exhibited less week-end specific changes, suggesting less sleep restriction during the week.

This systematic review synthesised all available English-language guidelines and research regarding mass-vaccination for COVID-19 until 1 March 2021-the first three months of the global mass-vaccination effort. Data were extracted from national websites, PubMed, Embase, Medline and medRxiv, including peer and non-peer review research findings. A total of 15 national policy documents were included. Policies were summarised according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) framework for mass vaccination. All included policies prioritised front-line health care workers and the elderly. Limited information was available regarding staffing, cold chain, communication strategies and infrastructure requirements for effective vaccine delivery. A total of 26 research studies were identified, reporting roll-out strategies, vaccine uptake and reasons for refusal, adverse effects, and real-life estimates of efficacy. Early data showed a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 cases, hospitalisation and deaths in settings with good coverage. Very low rates of vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed. These findings provide an overview of current practice and early outcomes of COVID-19 mass-vaccination, guiding countries where roll-out is yet to commence.","Hasan, T.; Beardsley, J.; Marais, B.

Many of the medications identified to treat COVID-19 could be connected with QTc prolongation and its consequences. Methods: non-ICU hospitalized patients of the three centres involved in the study from the 19th of March to the 1st of May were included in this retrospective multicentre study. Relevant clinical data were digitally collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of QTc prolongation &#8805; 500 ms, the main secondary outcomes were the Tisdale score ability to predict QTc prolongation and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden deaths. Results: 196 patients were analysed. 20 patients (10.2%) reached a QTc&#8805;500 ms. Patients with QTc&#8805;500 ms were significantly older (66.7±14.65 vs 76.6±8.77 years p: 0.004), with higher Tisdale score (low 56 (31.8%) vs 0; intermediate 95 (54.0%) vs 14 (70.0%); high 25 (14.2%) vs 6 (30.0%); p: 0.007) and with higher prognostic lab values (d-dimer 1819±2815 vs 11486±38554 ng/ml p: 0.010; BNP 212.5±288.4 vs 951.3±816.7 pg/ml p<0.001; procalcitonin 0.27±0.74 vs 1.33±4.04 ng/ml p: 0.003).

381375,Editorial: Dental practitioners' role in the assessment and containment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Evolving recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control,2020,"The outbreak of the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) in December 2019 has led to global crisis around the world. The disease was declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th of March 2020. Currently, the outbreak has affected more than 200 countries with more than 37 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million death tolls as of 10 October 2020. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method for detection of COVID-19 disease, but it has many challenges such as false positives, low sensitivity, expensive, and requires experts to conduct the test. As the number of cases continue to grow, there is a high need for developing a rapid screening method that is accurate, fast, and cheap. Chest X-ray (CXR) scan images can be considered as an alternative or a confirmatory approach as they are fast to obtain and easily accessible. Though the literature reports a number of approaches to classify CXR images and detect the COVID-19 infections, the majority of these approaches can only recognize two classes (e.g., COVID-19 vs. normal). However, there is a need for well-developed models that can classify a wider range of CXR images belonging to the COVID-19 class itself such as the bacterial pneumonia, the non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and the normal CXR scans. The current work proposes the use of a deep learning approach based on pretrained AlexNet model for the classification of COVID-19, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and normal CXR scans obtained from different public databases. The model was trained to perform two-way classification (i.e., COVID-19 vs. normal, bacterial pneumonia vs. normal, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia vs. normal, and COVID-19 vs. bacterial pneumonia), three-way classification (i.e., COVID-19 vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. normal), and four-way classification (i.e., COVID-19 vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia vs. normal). For non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia and normal (healthy) CXR images, the proposed model achieved 94.43% accuracy, 98.19% sensitivity, and 95.78% specificity. For bacterial pneumonia and normal CXR images, the model achieved 91.43% accuracy, 91.94% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. For COVID-19 pneumonia and normal CXR images, the model achieved 99.16% accuracy, 97.44% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. For classification CXR images of COVID-19 pneumonia and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, the model achieved 99.62% accuracy, 90.63% sensitivity, and 99.89% specificity. For the three-way classification, the model achieved 94.00% accuracy, 91.30% sensitivity, and 84.78%. Finally, for the four-way classification, the model achieved an accuracy of 93.42%, sensitivity of 89.18%, and specificity of 98.92%.","Ibrahim, Abdullahi Umar; Ozsoz, Mehmet; Serte, Sertan; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Yakoi, Polycarp Shizawaliyi",Cognit Comput,,218

381620,"Deep Vein Thrombosis in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Outcome",2020,"Abstract One of the main reasons for the widespread dissemination of COVID-19 is that many infected people are asymptomatic. Consequently, they likely spread the virus to other people as they continue their everyday life. This emphasizes the importance for targeting high-risk groups for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (with real-time PCR techniques). However, the availability of the necessary technology and resources may be limited in certain towns, cities or countries. Thus, the challenge is to determine a criterion in order to prioritize the suspected cases most in need of testing. The aim of the present study was to develop a method for evaluating the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection based on geolocation data. The risk is expressed as a score that will be instrumental in optimally applying the COVID-19 test to suspected cases representing the highest probability of exposure. It can be easily and quickly implemented with easily accessible open source tools. A simulation was herein conducted with data from four people, assigning infection to one of them. The results show the feasibility of assessing the risk of exposure with the new methodology. Additionally, the data obtained might provide insights into the sometimes complicated patterns of virus propagation.","Mendizabal-Ruiz, Gerardo",Rev. mex. ing. bioméd,,218
381757,Relationship between chest computed tomography findings and clinical conditions of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): A multicentre experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV in the world and to date has recorded the highest number of cases of COVID-19 in Africa. There is uncertainty as to what the significance of this dual infection is, and whether people living with HIV (PLWH) have worse outcomes compared to HIV-negative patients with COVID-19. This study compared the outcomes of COVID-19 in a group of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients admitted to a tertiary referral centre in Johannesburg, South Africa. METHODS: Data was collected on all adult patients with known HIV status and COVID-19, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), admitted to the medical wards and intensive care unit (ICU) between 6 March and 11 September 2020. The data included demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory results, severity of illness scores, complications and mortality and comparisons were made between the HIV-positive and HIV negative groups. RESULTS: Three-hundred and eighty-four patients, 108 HIV-positive and 276 HIV-negative, were included in the study. Median 4C score was significantly higher in the HIV-positive patients compared to the HIV-negative patients but there was no significant difference in mortality between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (15% vs 20%, pâ¯=â¯0.31). In addition, HIV-positive patients who died were younger than their HIV-negative counterparts, but this was not statistically significant (47.5 vs 57 years, pâ¯=â¯0.06). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that HIV is not a risk factor for moderate or severe COVID-19 disease neither is it a risk factor for mortality. However, HIV-positive patients with COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital are more likely to be younger than their HIV-negative counterparts. These findings need to be confirmed in future, prospective, studies.","Venturas, Jacqui; Zamparini, Jarrod; Shaddock, Erica; Stacey, Sarah; Murray, Lyle; Richards, Guy A; Kalla, Ismail; Mahomed, Adam; Mohamed, Farzahna; Mer, Mervyn; Maposa, Innocent; Feldman, Charles",J. infect,,218

This estimation is performed using a vector autoregressive model (VAR) and dynamically applying the Granger causality test. The conditional volatility of the stock market has been obtained through various univariate GARCH models. This methodology allows us to study the information transmissions, both unidirectional and bidirectional, that occur between CDS spreads and stock volatility between 2004 and 2020. We conclude that CDS spread returns cause (in the Granger sense) conditional stock volatility, mainly in Europe and during the sovereign debt crisis. This transmission dynamic breaks down during the COVID-19 period, where there are high bidirectional relationships between the two markets.","Ballester, Laura Ana Mónica Escrivá González-Urteaga Ana",Mathematics,,218

Less information about COVID-19 in pregnancy has been reported so far in the literature. METHODS: Case series on pregnancies complicated by COVID-19. All cases were diagnosed at Bolognini Hospital, Seriate, Italy. These cases are presented to clarify the features of COVID-19 occurring in pregnancy. RESULTS: Four women had symptoms of COVID-19 during pregnancy or immediately after delivery. All cases were confirmed by oropharyngeal swab. All patients presented with fever and low saturation levels at the diagnosis. One case was transferred after diagnosis to a tertiary referral center and delivered the day after for worsening clinical conditions. In the other three cases, bilateral pneumonia was documented at the admission. Antithrombotic therapy was used in most cases. No cases of the infected neonate was reported. At 2 month follow-up, all patients were alive, three were asymptomatic while one presented neurological complication. One more case was described because suspicious for COVID-19, however, it was not confirmed by oropharyngeal swab. CONCLUSIONS: In pregnant women, the peripheral nervous system could be affected. No case of trans-placental passage was reported. The swab could be helpful in diagnosis. The antithrombotic therapy could play a role in the positive course of COVID-19 also in pregnant women.","Algeri, Paola; Stagnati, Valentina; Spazzini, Maria Donata; Bellan, Cristina; Montanelli, Alessandro; Patelli, Gianluigi; Ciammella, Massimo",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,218

Observed daily concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and O3 during a ""pre-lockdown"" period (15 February-14 March 2020) and a ""lockdown"" period (22 March-2 May 2020), when lockdown measures were in full force everywhere in Canada, were compared to the same periods in the previous decade (2010-2019). Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO2 were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM2.5, Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O3 all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO2 surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM2.5. O3 surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but Ox (odd oxygen), like NO2 and PM2.5, decreased as expected over these cities.

The present meta-analysis was conducted to provide precise effect estimates regarding the efficacy and safety of HCQ in patients with T2DM. Methods: PubMed/Cochrane Library and grey literature were systematically searched till August 25, 2020, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with duration =12 weeks, evaluating the efficacy and safety of HCQ (400 mg/day) in patients with T2DM and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) =7.0%-7.5% already on a combination of metformin/sulfonylurea compared to either placebo or another OAD. Results: We identified eight eligible RCTs, pooling data retrieved from 1763 patients with T2DM. HCQ resulted in significant decrease in HbA1c by 0.88% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.01 to - 0.75) compared to placebo and by 0.32% (95% CI: -0.37 to -0.26) compared to an OAD. Besides, there were significant reductions in fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, body weight, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein. A small but significant increase in high-density lipoprotein was also noted. An increase in the risk of any episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia (whether documented or not) was observed (risk ratio = 1.34 [95% CI: 1.10-1.63]). No other safety issues were identified. Conclusions: The meta-analysis suggests that HCQ, used as an add-on drug in patients with T2DM exerts significant beneficial effects on glycemic control, body weight, and lipid profile, however, increasing the risk for symptomatic hypoglycemia. HCQ might be useful amid the ongoing pandemic, as the drug has also been found to be beneficial in COVID-19.","Pal, R.; Banerjee, M.; Kumar, A.; Bhadada, S.

It is a generalization of hyperbolic and spherical geometries where the nondegenerate metric tensor is not positive definite. We provide the necessary learning tools in this geometry and extend gradient method optimization techniques. More specifically, we provide closed-form expressions for distances via geodesics and define a descent direction that guarantees the minimization of the objective problem.

387898,Does rheumatoid arthritis affect the infection and complications rates of spinal surgery? a systematic review and meta analysis,2020,"The traditional formulation of ibuprofen is poorly soluble in water, so the administered dose must be 10 times higher than the dose required for a therapeutic effect. The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x106 bacteria, from 4 h (in its absence) to only three minutes (in its presence). That was observed using Pseudomona aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. Also, ""in vitro'' ibuprofen demonstrated virucidal activity against the so-called enveloped virus, a family that includes coronavirus strain (2019-nCoV). We observed too, the markedly reduced local inflammation in the airways after administering NIH lays on its ability to inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase and to markedly diminish reactive oxygen species (ROS). Other investigators also showed the importance of actin in the rapid spread of virus infection. Furthermore, reorganization of the actin filaments is a key step in lung inflammation induced by systemic inflammatory responses caused by SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest that the interaction between actin proteins and S1 is involved in the 2019-nCoV infection and pathogenesis. Consequently, the possibility of interfering in this interaction could represent a valid hypothesis for the development of promising therapeutic and prevention strategies. In conclusion, we consider that treating people with COVID-19 with NIH may be beneficial and an opportunity to contribute for the current global health emergency.","García, Néstor H; Porta, Daniela J; Alasino, Roxana V; Muñoz, Sonia E; Beltramo, Dante M",Med Hypotheses,,218

While disease severity can vary widely, reports of severe infection leading to multiple fatalities within a family are limited. Case Report: Four family members each presented to the emergency department with fever and upper respiratory symptoms. Each individual tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection via nasopharyngeal swab. All individuals developed acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to conventional medical therapy and subsequently died from their disease. Conclusion: This report describes a familial cluster of fatal COVID-19 infections and suggests a potential genetic predisposition for severe disease, emphasizing the importance of investigating family clusters of severe COVID-19 infection to determine host and viral factors that may predispose to a severe disease course. Such investigations could improve our understanding of the disease and guide preventive measures for at-risk populations.","Lowe, Adam; Chang, Donald D.; Creek, Grady",Ochsner J.,,218
391239,Clotting abnormalities in critically ill COVID-19 patients are inconsistent with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation,2020,"In systemic amyloidosis, serum amyloid A (SAA) fibril deposits cause widespread damages to tissues and organs that eventually may lead to death. A therapeutically intervention therefore has either to dissolve these fibrils or inhibit their formation. However, only recently has the human SAA fibril structure been resolved at a resolution that is sufficient for development of drug candidates. Here, we use molecular dynamic simulations to probe the factors that modulate the stability of this fibril model. Our simulations suggest that fibril formation starts with the stacking of two misfolded monomers into metastable dimers, with the stacking depending on the N-terminal amyloidogenic regions of different chains forming anchors. The resulting dimers pack in a second step into a 2-fold two-layer tetramer that is stable enough to nucleate fibril formation. The stability of the initial dimers is enhanced under acidic conditions by a strong salt bridge and side-chain hydrogen bond network in the C-terminal cavity (residues 23-51) but is not affected by the presence of the disordered C-terminal tail.","Wang, Wenhua; Hansmann, Ulrich H E",J. phys. chem.

Emerging predictors for poor outcomes include advanced age, male sex, preexisting cardiovascular disease, and risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and, more recently, obesity. This article posits new obesity-driven predictors of poor COVID-19 outcomes, over and above the more obvious extant risks associated with obesity, including cardiometabolic disease and hypoventilation syndrome in intensive care patients. This article also outlines a theoretical mechanistic framework whereby adipose tissue in individuals with obesity may act as a reservoir for more extensive viral spread, with increased shedding, immune activation, and cytokine amplification. This paper proposes studies to test this reservoir concept with a focus on specific cytokine pathways that might be amplified in individuals with obesity and COVID-19. Finally, this paper underscores emerging therapeutic strategies that might benefit subsets of patients in which cytokine amplification is excessive and potentially fatal.","Ryan, Paul MacDaragh; Caplice, Noel M",Obesity (Silver Spring),,218

A reduction in the quality of life and the presence of prolonged fatigue are some of the most imminent problems that emerge among these professionals. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a holistic intervention (workshop) for health science students aimed at developing skills that will enable them to obtain a better self-assessment of their quality of life, and prolonged fatigue. Methods: Pre- and post-measures of quality of life, and prolonged fatigue were obtained from 130 health science students, including a group of 96 attendees (cases) of a 4-h wellness workshop and 34 students who did not attend (controls). Results: Paired t tests indicated a significant improvement in nearly all dimensions related to quality of life, and prolonged fatigue in the case group who attended the workshop. Conclusions: A comprehensive wellness strategy that utilizes a holistic approach can play an important role in improving and promoting essential skills to improve healthcare provider's self-assessment about the quality of life and reduce their prolonged fatigue. The critical importance of these needs has long been recognized, and this will also be crucial for addressing new challenges and emerging realities.","Gómez, Claudia; Lamas, Aura; Ramirez-Martinez, Flor Rocio; Blunk, Dan; Leiner, Marie",Med Sci Educ,,218

395268,Why Automated E-Counseling for Chronic Heart Failure Matters in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,2021,"Introduction: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is crucial for the management of hepatobiliary disease. Use of fluoroscopy during ERCP results in radiation exposure to the interventional endoscopy care providers. Prevention of radiation induced injuries such as cataracts, cancer, skin injuries and vascular aging from long term exposure is of vital importance. Current guidelines recommend monitored radiation exposure to be “as low as reasonably achievable” (ALARA) with institution dependent numerical limits. Prompted by a pregnancy among one of our providers who chose to continue performing ERCP, we initated a radiation safety initiative and evaluated the impact of this initiative on mean fluoroscopy times and radiation dose exposure to our staff. Methods: All ERCP cases performed from June 2018 to February 2020 were reviewed (data collection halted in March 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic). Cases performed from June 2018 to June 2019 were categorized as “pre initiative”. Cases from July 2019 to February 2020 were categorized as “post initiative”. The safety initiative included use of a new fluoroscopy bed with a lead skirt, c-arm receiver unit lead shield, mindful fluoroscopy use by the attending physician only, appropriate usage of dosimeter badges and evaluation of personal protective equipment (PPE) (lead aprons, thyroid shield, lead glasses) to ensure quality. The following data was collected: mean fluoroscopy time per procedure, individual provider (physicians, nurses and technicians), the monthly deep dose equivalent (DDE) representing body, gonads and blood making organs, the monthly shallow dose equivalent (SDE) representing skin and extremities and monthly lens of eye dose equivalent (LDE) were collected. Results: A total of 198 ERCPs were performed in the pre-initiative group (14 cases per month). Mean fluoroscopy time per case was 12.1 minutes. A total of 110 ERCPs were performed in the post-initiation group (also 14 cases per month) with a mean fluoroscopy time per case of 6.3 minutes (48% reduction). For all providers, the average monthly DDE went from 47.6 mrem to 9.23 (81% reduction), the average monthly SDE went from 102.49 mrem to 31.35 (69.5% reduction) and the average monthly LDE went from 100.25 mrem to 30.18 (70% reduction). The fetal dosimeter badge worn by the pregnant provider detected an ""undetectable"" reading every month. Discussion: Quality initiatives coupled with adequate personal protective equipment to improve the radiation dose exposure of advanced endoscopy staff performing ERCP can result in significant improvement. Performing ERCP during pregnancy is a feasible option if proper techniques and policy are implanted to protect the fetus. Improvement of the safety profile of ERCP for women of child-bearing age is an important step in increasing the number of women in the field of advanced endoscopy.","Latour, R.

With the recent implementation of first-level public health emergency response (FLPHER) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in China (a total of 77â¯041 confirmed cases by February 22, 2020), human activities were extremely decreased nationwide and almost all economic activities were suspended. Here, we show that this scenario represents an unprecedented ""base period"" to probe the short-term emission control effect of air pollution at a city level. We quantify the FLPHER-induced changes of NO2, SO2, PM2.5, and PM10 levels in 174 cities in China. A machine learning prediction model for air pollution is established by coupling a generalized additive model, random effects meta-analysis, and weather research and forecasting model with chemistry analysis. The short-term control effect under the current energy structure in each city is estimated by comparing the predicted and observed results during the FLPHER period. We found that the short-term emission control effect ranges within 53.0%-98.3% for all cities, and southern cities show a significantly stronger effect than northern cities (P < 0.01). Compared with megacities, small-medium cities show a similar control effect on NO2 and SO2 but a larger effect on PM2.5 and PM10.","Lu, Dawei; Zhang, Jingwei; Xue, Chaoyang; Zuo, Peijie; Chen, Zigu; Zhang, Luyao; Ling, Weibo; Liu, Qian; Jiang, Guibin",Environ Sci Technol,,218

Aim at achieving a realistic haptic interaction, this paper proposes a haptic-based virtual reality simulator for the LVP operation. In this simulator, we first reconstruct the three-dimension (3D) model of human brains for tissue/instrument interaction. Then a preoperative planning method based on geometry analysis is introduced to find the feasible entry point of LVP operation. A hierarchical bounding-box collision detection approach is proposed to render haptic feedback that is transferred to humans. Finally, a set of experiments on the proposed simulator and 3D printed models of human brains is carried out. We demonstrated that the proposed haptic-based VR simulator can improve the performance of the LVP operation effectively. This article is protected by copyright.

We conducted a systematic review and included manuscripts describing patients with positive RT-PCR coronavirus testing from nasopharyngeal swabs who also developed cutaneous manifestations. A total of 655 patients were selected, with different types of skin rashes: Erythematous maculopapular (n = 250), vascular (n = 146), vesicular (n = 99), urticarial (n = 98), erythema multiforme/generalized pustular figurate erythema/Stevens-Johnson syndrome (n = 22), ocular/periocular (n = 14), polymorphic pattern (n = 9), generalized pruritus (n = 8), Kawasaki disease (n = 5), atypical erythema nodosum (n = 3), and atypical Sweet syndrome (n = 1). Chilblain-like lesions were more frequent in the younger population and were linked to a milder disease course, while fixed livedo racemosa and retiform purpura appeared in older patients and seemed to predict a more severe prognosis. For vesicular rashes, PCR determined the presence of herpesviruses in the vesicle fluid, which raised the possibility of herpesvirus co-infections. The erythema-multiforme-like pattern, generalized pustular figurate erythema and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were most frequently linked to hydroxychloroquine intake. A positive PCR determination of SARS-COV-2 from conjunctival swabs suggest that eye discharge can also be contagious. These cutaneous manifestations may aid in identifying otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers in some cases or predict a more severe evolution in others.","Conforti, Claudio; Dianzani, Caterina; Agozzino, Marina; Giuffrida, Roberta; Marangi, Giovanni Francesco; Meo, Nicola di; Morariu, Silviu-Horia; Persichetti, Paolo; Segreto, Francesco; Zalaudek, Iris; Neagu, Nicoleta",,,218

Our objective was to evaluate mental health symptoms and determinants of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Methods: We used nationally-representative data of 10,760 U.S. adults from the COVID-19 Impact Survey. We defined cancer survivors as a self-reported diagnosis of cancer (n 854, 7.6%). We estimated the association of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors using multinomial logistic regression and calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We estimated determinants of experiencing at least one mental health symptom 3-7 times in the last seven days among cancer survivors using Poisson regression models to estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% CI. Results: Most cancer survivors were over the age of 60 (65%), NH-White (74%), female (52%), and married or living with a partner (57%). Among cancer survivors who spoke to their neighbors basically every day prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% continued this behavior, and 34% reported to speak to their neighbors only a few times a week in the last month. Among cancer survivors, 16% felt depressed, 14% felt lonely, and 13% felt hopeless about the future in the last seven days. Cancer survivors were more likely to report feeling nervous, anxious or on edge (aOR:1.42, 95% CI: 1,07-1.90), depressed (aOR:1.69, 95% CI: 1.28-2.24), lonely (aOR:1.47, 95% CI: 1.09-1.98), and hopeless (aOR:1.55, 95% CI: 1.14-2.10) 3-7 days per week in the last seven days when compared to adults without cancer. Among cancer survivors, adults aged 30-44 years (aPR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.18-2.95), females (aPR:1.55, 95% CI: 1.12-2.13), without a high school degree (aOR: 1.79, 95% CI;1.05-3.04), and adults with limited social interaction (aPR:1.40, 95% CI: 1.01-1.95) were more likely to experience mental health symptoms 3-7 days/week in the last week. Conclusions: Cancer survivors are experiencing mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly young adults, adults without a high school degree, females, and survivors with limited social support.","Islam, J.

Identifying possible sources of novel coronaviruses therefore requires identifying hosts of multiple coronaviruses; however, most coronavirus-host interactions remain unknown. Here, by deploying a meta-ensemble of similarity learners from three complementary perspectives (viral, mammalian and network), we predict which mammals are hosts of multiple coronaviruses. We predict that there are 11.5-fold more coronavirus-host associations, over 30-fold more potential SARS-CoV-2 recombination hosts, and over 40-fold more host species with four or more different subgenera of coronaviruses than have been observed to date at >0.5 mean probability cut-off (2.4-, 4.25- and 9-fold, respectively, at >0.9821).

Interleukin (IL-6) inhibitors can be used in severe COVID-19 patients due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-immune effects. We aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of tocilizumab (Actemra) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Overall, 1382 patients were admitted to a temporary hospital during July outbreak of COVID-19. Of these, 282 patients were hospitalized. Baseline clinical, radiological and laboratory data were collected from patient records. Laboratory markers prior to discharge were also collected. Wilcoxon rank sum test was conducted to show the significance of change of laboratory markers. Results: Eleven of the 282(3.9%) hospitalized patients who had severe pneumonia confirmed by either chest radiography (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) received tocilizumab (Actemra). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral markers of COVID-19 were positive in three cases.

404054,Pediatric lung imaging features of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly halted the Anthropocene's ever-expanding reign for the time being. The resulting global human confinement, dubbed as the Anthropause, has created an unprecedented opportunity for us to evaluate the environmental consequences of large-scale changes in anthropogenic activities. Based on a methodical and in-depth review of related literature, this study critically evaluates the positive and negative externalities of COVID-19 induced lockdown on environmental components including air, water, noise, waste, forest, wildlife, and biodiversity. Among adverse impacts of the lockdown, increased amount of healthcare waste (300-400%), increased level of atmospheric ozone (30-300%), elevated levels of illicit felling in forests and wildlife poaching were prominent. Compared to the negative impacts, significant positive changes in various quality parameters related to key environmental components were evident. Positive impacts on air quality, water quality, noise level, waste generation, and wildlife were apparent in varying degrees as evaluated in this study. By presenting a critical overview of the recommendations given in the major literature in light of these documented impacts, this paper alludes to potential policy reforms as a guideline for future sustainable environmental management planning. Some of the key recommendations are e.g., enhance remote working facilities, cleaner design, use of internet of things, automation, systematic lockdown, and inclusion of hazardous waste management in disaster planning. The summarized lessons of this review, pertinent to the dynamic relationship between anthropogenic activities and environmental degradation, amply bring home the need for policy reforms and prioritization of Sustainable Development Goals in the context of the planetary boundaries to the environmental sustainability for a new post-pandemic world.","Chowdhury, Rubel Biswas; Khan, Ayushi; Mahiat, Tashfia; Dutta, Hillol; Tasmeea, Tahana; Binth Arman, Afra Bashira; Fardu, Farzin; Roy, Bidhan Bhuson; Hossain, Mohammad Mosharraf; Khan, Niaz Ahmed; Amin, A T M Nurul; Sujauddin, Mohammad",Sci Total Environ,,218
404096,Neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes after human parechovirus CNS infection in neonates and young children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"Abstract Communication is a key factor in containing a pandemic. Fragmented information may affect people's perceptions and behaviors, especially in times of governmental miscommunication, potentially jeopardizing efforts aimed at containing the spread of the disease. To test whether and how people have been sensitive to broken information during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, we performed a randomized survey experiment on a sample of 571 respondents. We found that more pessimistic or more optimistic fragmented messages about the pandemic have no overall significant average effect on perceptions and planned behavior of the respondents. The exploratory analyses showed that particular sociodemographic groups are more sensitive to these fragmented messages. While less educated people react to more pessimistic messages with an increased likelihood to intensify prevention measures, people aged 60 or older - the high-risk group for COVID-19 complications - react to more optimistic messages with a reduced probability to intensify prevention measures. Besides providing insights to the public administration literature on disaster management, the results reinforce the need for governments to consistently centralize communication efforts to guarantee that people are equipped with complete and accurate information to form their perceptions and adequate their behaviors towards a health crisis.","Melo, Carolina; Cabral, Sandro",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,218

407687,Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis: a multicentre cohort study,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was caused by SARS-CoV-2, has become a global public health concern. A great proportion of the world needs to be vaccinated in order to stop the rapid spread of the disease. In addition to prioritising vulnerable sections of the population to receive the vaccine, an ideal degree-based vaccination strategy uses fine-grained contact networks to prioritise vaccine recipients. This strategy is costly and impractical due to the enormous amount of specific contact information needed. It also does not capture indirect famine or aerosol-based transmission. We recently proposed a new vaccination strategy called Individual's Movement-based Vaccination (IMV), which takes into account both direct and indirect transmission and is based on the types of places people visit. IMV was shown to be cost-efficient in the case of influenza-like diseases. This paper studies the application of IMV to COVID-19 using its documented transmission parameters. We conduct large scale computer simulations based on a city-wide empirical mobility dataset to evaluate the performance and practicability of the strategy. Results show that the proposed strategy achieves nearly five times the efficiency of random vaccination and performs comparably to the degree-based strategy, while significantly reducing the data collection requirements.","Nguyen, Quoc Huy; Liebig, Jessica; Shahzamal, Md; Mans, Bernard; Jurdak, Raja",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.01957v1.pdf,218

However, gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively expensive. Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with possibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data collection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot at test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms conventional hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.","Kang, Katie; Kahn, Gregory; Levine, Sergey",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13280v1.pdf,218

410434,Global meta-analysis of tree decline impacts on fauna,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread across the globe, resulting in significant changes in virtually every aspect of life. Mitigation efforts, like shelter-in-place orders, have taken a particular toll on parents who have had to navigate disruptions in work and/or school schedules. Research from high-income countries demonstrates increased parental anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout resulting from the pandemic. It is unclear if these outcomes are the same for parents in high-risk communities in low-income countries where pre-pandemic conditions were deleterious. This study addresses this gap and examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on parents in high-risk communities in Guatemala. METHODS: A total of 330 individuals from 11 districts in Guatemala participated in the study and were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health impairment. Chi-squares were conducted for bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis revealed differences between groups on burnout, with parents more often reporting feelings of burnout than nonparents (p < .001). Binary regression demonstrated that non-parents were 70% less likely to endorse feelings of stress as compared to parents (OR = .285; p = .014). CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the unique mental health impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on parents in high-risk communities. In high-risk communities, parental stress is a pressing problem that, if unaddressed, has the potential to result in even greater psychological distress and child maltreatment. Training community healthcare providers to assess and address parental stress can lead to increased community capacity and the development of a community-based network to serve as a first line of support for parents and their children.","Alonzo, Dana; Popescu, Marciana; Zubaroglu Ioannides, Pinar",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,218

The aim of this study is to propose a tracking posture system with complete information about the back posture. The existing posture monitoring systems in literature are limited to trunk flexion monitoring. In this proposal we introduce the shoulder bent monitoring in addition to the trunk flexion monitoring in order to provide complete information about the back posture. The proposed posture monitoring system is a smart belt equipped by inertial sensors to detect the trunk flexion and a shoulder bent to monitor the posture over time.

413537,WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was first identified in December, 2020, in England. We aimed to investigate whether increases in the proportion of infections with this variant are associated with differences in symptoms or disease course, reinfection rates, or transmissibility. METHODS: We did an ecological study to examine the association between the regional proportion of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility. Data on types and duration of symptoms were obtained from longitudinal reports from users of the COVID Symptom Study app who reported a positive test for COVID-19 between Sept 28 and Dec 27, 2020 (during which the prevalence of B.1.1.7 increased most notably in parts of the UK). From this dataset, we also estimated the frequency of possible reinfection, defined as the presence of two reported positive tests separated by more than 90 days with a period of reporting no symptoms for more than 7 days before the second positive test. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the B.1.1.7 variant across the UK was estimated with use of genomic data from the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium and data from Public Health England on spike-gene target failure (a non-specific indicator of the B.1.1.7 variant) in community cases in England. We used linear regression to examine the association between reported symptoms and proportion of B.1.1.7. We assessed the Spearman correlation between the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases and number of reinfections over time, and between the number of positive tests and reinfections. We estimated incidence for B.1.1.7 and previous variants, and compared the effective reproduction number, Rt, for the two incidence estimates. FINDINGS: From Sept 28 to Dec 27, 2020, positive COVID-19 tests were reported by 36 920 COVID Symptom Study app users whose region was known and who reported as healthy on app sign-up. We found no changes in reported symptoms or disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. For the same period, possible reinfections were identified in 249 (0·7% [95% CI 0·6-0·8]) of 36 509 app users who reported a positive swab test before Oct 1, 2020, but there was no evidence that the frequency of reinfections was higher for the B.1.1.7 variant than for pre-existing variants. Reinfection occurrences were more positively correlated with the overall regional rise in cases (Spearman correlation 0·56-0·69 for South East, London, and East of England) than with the regional increase in the proportion of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant (Spearman correlation 0·38-0·56 in the same regions), suggesting B.1.1.7 does not substantially alter the risk of reinfection. We found a multiplicative increase in the Rt of B.1.1.7 by a factor of 1·35 (95% CI 1·02-1·69) relative to pre-existing variants. However, Rt fell below 1 during regional and national lockdowns, even in regions with high proportions of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant. INTERPRETATION: The lack of change in symptoms identified in this study indicates that existing testing and surveillance infrastructure do not need to change specifically for the B.1.1.7 variant. In addition, given that there was no apparent increase in the reinfection rate, vaccines are likely to remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant.

TRIAL DESIGN: The study is designed as a multi-center, interventional, parallel-group, randomized (1:1 ratio), investigator sponsored, two-arm study. PARTICIPANTS: Six thousand participants will be recruited from healthy hospital workers in 7 Japanese University Hospitals. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Age from 20 to 75 years old at the time of registration 2. Asymptomatic and body temperature below 37°C at the time of registration 3. Capable of eating orally Exclusion criteria: 1. Previous upper respiratory inflammation due to viral infection (including suspected COVID-19) 2. Taking immunosuppressants 3. Allergic to the Kampo medicines used in this study 4. History of hypokalaemia, severe hypertension, severe liver dysfunction, and interstitial pneumonia 5. Regularly taking other Kampo medicines 6. Pregnant or possibly pregnant 7. Participating in other research 8. Judged to be unsuitable for this study by the doctor in charge INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Kampo group: participants receive HET in 9 tablets 2 times per day for 8 weeks. CONTROL GROUP: participants receive placebo in the same dosage as the Intervention group - 9 tablets 2 times per day for 8 weeks. Placebo tablets are identical in appearance and package to HET. Taste of placebo is different from that of HET. The Ohsugi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan manufactured the placebo and HET. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Number of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ploymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive result with at least one symptom (fever, cough, sputum, malaise, shortness of breath) during the 12-week study period (including the 4-week observation period after oral administration). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: 1. Period from infection to onset 2. Period from the appearance of symptoms to the disappearance of PCR positive 3. Number of days until the appearance or improvement of symptoms 4. Severe stage: presence of hospitalization 5. Shock stage: ICU management required for mechanical ventilation, shock vitals or failure of organ(s) other than lungs Safety endpoints include numbness in the hands and/or feet, edema, skin rash or other allergic symptoms, and gastric discomfort. RANDOMISATION: Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group using minimization implemented with the Electric data capture system (DATATRAK Enterprise Cloud), with balancing of the arms with age range (under 50 years of age or not) and having a history of risk factors for COVID-19 (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory diseases). BLINDING (MASKING): Only participants will be randomized. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The main research hypothesis of this study is that Kampo medicines significantly prevent the onset of COVID-19. It is assumed that the infection rate before the administration of the drug under consideration will be 0% and that the incidence of COVID-19 thereafter will be 2- 3%, of which 70%-80% will show symptoms of COVID-19. Assuming that the pharmaceutical effect of the drug will be effective in 50% of patients and that the incidence rates in the placebo and drug groups will be 1.4%-2.4% and 0.7%-1.2%, respectively, the placebo is calculated at 2%, and the study drug at 1%. Since the frequency of verification is low and the number of cases will be large, we set a total of 10 analyses (9 interim analyses and a final analysis). Since the number of cases at the time of the final analysis will be 4,986 under the conditions of &#945; = 0.05 and a power of 80% by the Peto method. We set at 600 cases in each interim analysis with an estimated dropout rate of 16.9%. Finally, the total number of cases is set to 6,000 with 3,000 in the placebo group and 3,000 in the HET group.

Thirteen healthcare workers from Italian and Austrian hospitals specifically dealing with COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic were interviewed. Data was analysed using grounded theory methodology. Psychosocial effects on stress experience, stressors and resilience factors were identified. We generated three hypotheses. Hypothesis one is that moral distress and moral injury are main stressors experienced by healthcare workers. Hypothesis two states that organisational resilience plays an important part in how healthcare workers experience the crisis. Organisational justice and decentralized decision making are essential elements of staff wellbeing. Hypothesis three refers to effective psychosocial support: Basic on scene psychosocial support based on the Hobfoll principles given by trusted and well-known mental health professionals and peers in an integrated approach works best during the pandemic.","Kreh, Alexander; Brancaleoni, Rachele; Magalini, Sabina Chiara; Chieffo, Daniela Pia Rosaria; Flad, Barbara; Ellebrecht, Nils; Juen, Barbara",PLoS One,,218
418122,Airway pressure release ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19: a multicenter observational study,2021,"BackgroundInformation is needed to monitor progress toward a level of population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 sufficient to disrupt viral transmission. We estimated the percentage of the United States (US) population with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2 due to vaccination, natural infection, or both as of August 26, 2021. MethodsPublicly available data as of August 26, 2021, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used to calculate presumed population immunity by state. Seroprevalence data were used to estimate the percentage of the population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with adjustments for underreporting. Vaccination coverage data for both fully and partially vaccinated persons were used to calculate presumed immunity from vaccination. Finally, we estimated the percentage of the total population in each state with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2, with a sensitivity analysis to account for waning immunity, and compared these estimates to a range of population immunity thresholds. ResultsPresumed population immunity varied among states (43.1% to 70.6%), with 19 states with 60% or less of their population having been infected or vaccinated. Four states have presumed immunity greater than thresholds estimated to be sufficient to disrupt transmission of less infectious variants (67%), and none were greater than the threshold estimated for more infectious variants (78% or higher). ConclusionsThe US remains a distance below the threshold sufficient to disrupt viral transmission, with some states remarkably low. As more infectious variants emerge, it is critical that vaccination efforts intensify across all states and ages for which the vaccines are approved. SummaryAs of August 26, 2021, no state has reached a population level of immunity thought to be sufficient to disrupt transmission. (78% or higher), with some states having remarkably low presumed immunity.","Stoner, Marie C.D.; Angulo, Frederick J.; Rhea, Sarah; Brown, Linda Morris; Atwell, Jessica E.; Nguyen, Jennifer L.; McLaughlin, John; Swerdlow, David L.; MacDonald, Pia D.M.",,,218

418335,Intravenous immunoglobulin-based adjuvant therapy for severe COVID-19: a single-center retrospective cohort study,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess disease severity, based on clinical presentation and laboratory investigations. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: COVID-19 Isolation Unit of Mayo Hospital, Lahore from 15th March to 31st May, 2020. METHODOLOGY: Four hundred and forty-five COVID-19 RT-PCR positive patients of either gender in age group of 18-80 years, admitted in isolation wards, high dependency units (HDUs) and intensive care units (ICUs) of the Hospital, were selected for the study via simple random sampling. Clinical presentations and laboratory investigations were recorded for all patients. Kruskal-Wallis test, Pearson Chi-square test, boxplots and ROC curve were used to analyse the data. A p-value &#8804;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of the 445 cases, a male predominance 286 (64.3%) was observed with majority of patients 324 (72.8%) having mild disease, 73 (16.4%) moderate, 25 (5.6%) severe and 23 (5.2%) having critical disease. D-dimer was considered to be the best discriminatory marker to assess disease severity with an overall accuracy of 92.1%. CONCLUSION: Fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, body aches, abdominal pain, anosmia and aguesia were the predominant symptoms in majority of patients belonging to different categories based on disease severity. Inflammatory markers like D-dimers and ferritin levels determined the overall disease severity with a high accuracy.

419427,A Nomogram Prediction of Length of Hospital Stay in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"Boredom is an emotion that often arises in an educational context. Past research suggests that boredom depends on specific cognitive appraisals, such as how people can control the task and how much they value it. Research further suggests that boredom is related to negative academic outcomes such as lower grades and a higher risk of dropping out. Here, we tested a mediation model on 324 pre-service teachers during the first lockdown of 2020 in Switzerland to assess (1) how control and value predicted boredom, and (2) how boredom was related to the intention to persist at university. We hypothesized that (1) the more participants felt lacking in control and low in value, the higher their boredom and (2) the more intense their boredom, the lower their intention to persist. We further hypothesized that both control and value would be positively related to the intention to persist, and this link may be mediated by boredom. Our results provide partial support for our mediation model as we found a significant indirect link between control and intention to persist through boredom. More specifically, the more participants lost control over their studies, the more they felt bored, which in turn was negatively related to their intention to persist.","Audrin, Catherine; Hascoët, Marine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,218

423037,Efficacy and safety of herbal medicine (Lianhuaqingwen) for treating COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"RATIONALE: Fibrosing interstitial pneumonitis can be the common end result to many different lung diseases, including chronic viral inflammations, as COVID-19. Some SARS-CoV-2 infected patients develop the acute respiratory distress syndrome. This condition is histopathologically known as diffuse alveolar damage which may be followed by a proliferative phase. Whereas COVID-19 has showed a longer disease outcome until clinical cure or death compared to other chronic infections, our hypothesis is that COVID-19 patients tend to develop a more prominently proliferative phase, even those who progress to death, with an exacerbated fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation. METHODS: Minimally invasive autopsy(MIA) was performed on 47 confirmed COVID- 19 patients for lung samples. Clinical, demographic, mechanical ventilation parameters and radiological data were collected by electronic medical record. A detailed histomorphological analysis by two pulmonary pathologists was performed by H&E staining. Verhoeff, picrosirius red and SMA staining were performed for histomorphometric analysis of interstitial fibrosis according to ATS/ERS morphometric guidelines. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2, targeting the E and N2 genes, in lung tissue collected from all patients at MIA. RESULTS: Patients were equally distributed in men and women and the mean age was 67 years old. The average time of death after the onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms was approximately 18 days. Regarding the most common comorbidities, 55% of the patients had systemic arterial hypertension, 40% were obese, 25% were smokers and 22% had chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In the radiological exams, ground glass was the most prevalent finding. The clinical and histomorphological correlation revealed two phenotypes: 1) Poor lung outcome - a progressive decline in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and high complacency levels, closely related to fibrosing interstitial pneumonitis (P&lt;0.05) together with an increased collagen fibers deposition (P&lt;0.05), SMA+ stained cells (P&lt;0.05), elastic rarefaction (P&lt;0.05) and higher viral load;2) Better lung outcome - a progressive increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and low complacency levels, usual pattern of elastic and collagen fibers and SMA+ cells, but sudden death due to acute pulmonary thromboembolism. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viral genome was detected in all lung tissue collected(47), with a mean of 3,403,775 and 90,683,263 copies/mg for N2 and E genes respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The fibrotic septal thickening is related to poor lung outcome by progressive decline in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and late death. This pathophysiological process may be an important sequel in pos- COVID19 patients to trigger a fibrosing interstitial pneumonitis. Further investigations with larger studies are warranted. .","Batah, S.

423423,Efficacy and Safety of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate new-onset neurologic impairments associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between January 18 and March 20, 2020, including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in 3 Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions. Noncritical events were seen in fewer than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic, and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in 9. Findings from lumbar puncture in 3 with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache, or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and with neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness. Evidence of direct acute insult of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to the CNS is lacking.","Xiong, Weixi; Mu, Jie; Guo, Jian; Lu, Lu; Liu, Dan; Luo, Jianfei; Li, Nian; Liu, Jing; Yang, Dan; Gao, Hui; Zhang, Yingying; Lin, Mintao; Shen, Sisi; Zhang, Hesheng; Chen, Lei; Wang, Gang; Luo, Fengming; Li, Weimin; Chen, Shengli; He, Li; Sander, Josemir W; Zhou, Dong",Neurology,,218
423570,"Association of acute kidney injury and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study",2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a public health crisis. Prior studies demonstrated successful use of convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of other viral illnesses. Our primary objective was to evaluate treatment efficacy of convalescent plasma in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective matched cohort study, we enrolled recipients of convalescent plasma collected from donors recovered from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection under the single patient eIND process. We individually matched 35 cases with 61 controls based on age, gender, supplemental oxygen requirements, and C-reactive protein level at the time of hospital admission. We compared the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and hospital length of stay between the groups. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 20% among the cases and 24.6% among the controls (P = .61). A multivariable logistic regression model that included age, gender, duration of symptoms, need for mechanical ventilation, and pharmacologic interventions revealed no significant difference in mortality by study group (P = .71). The median length of stay was significantly greater among convalescent plasma recipients compared with controls, 10 (IQR, 6-17) vs 7 (IQR, 4-11) days, P < .01. The difference was not significant after controlling for covariates (P > .1). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find convalescent plasma reduced in-hospital mortality in our sample, nor did it reduce length of stay. Further investigation is warranted to determine the efficacy of this treatment in patients with COVID-19, particularly early in the disease process.","Sostin, Oleg V; Rajapakse, Pramuditha; Cruser, Brigid; Wakefield, Dorothy; Cruser, Daniel; Petrini, Joann",,,218

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a surge in critical care capacity and prone positioning practices which may increase the risk of ocular complications. This article aims to review all ocular complications associated with prone positioning, with a focus on challenges posed by COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review using keywords of ""intensive care"", ""critical care"", ""eye care"", ""ocular disorders"", ""ophthalmic complications,"" ""coronavirus"", ""COVID-19,"" ""prone"" and ""proning"" was performed using the electronic databases of PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL. RESULTS: The effects of prone positioning on improving respiratory outcomes in critically unwell patients are well established; however, there is a lack of literature regarding the effects of prone positioning on ocular complications in the critical care setting. Sight-threatening ophthalmic disorders potentiated by proning include ocular surface disease, acute angle closure, ischemic optic neuropathy, orbital compartment syndrome and vascular occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients may be more susceptible to ocular complications with increased proning practices and increasing demand on critical care staff. This review outlines these ocular complications with a focus on preventative and treatment measures to avoid devastating visual outcomes for the patient.","Sanghi, Priyanka; Malik, Mohsan; Hossain, Ibtesham T; Manzouri, Bita",J Intensive Care Med,,218

Based on the clustering abilities of self-organizing maps we are able to spatially group together countries that are similar according to their coronavirus cases, in this way being able to analyze which countries are behaving similarly and thus can benefit by using similar strategies in dealing with the spread of the virus. Publicly available datasets of coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months have been used in the analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained, that could be helpful in deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus. Most of the previous papers dealing with data of the Coronavirus have viewed the problem on temporal aspect, which is also important, but this is mainly concerned with the forecast of the numeric information. However, we believe that the spatial aspect is also important, so in this view the main contribution of this paper is the use of unsupervised self-organizing maps for grouping together similar countries in their fight against the Coronavirus pandemic, and thus proposing that strategies for similar countries could be established accordingly.","Melin, Patricia; Monica, Julio Cesar; Sanchez, Daniela; Castillo, Oscar",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,218

431472,Lymphopenia and neutrophilia at admission predicts severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2020,"Pneumonia caused by coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, has been spread around the world already becoming a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is not yet a specific vaccine or effective antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. Many of these patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and are mechanically ventilated, which is causing the collapse of the health system in many countries due to lack of ventilators and intensive care beds. In this document we review two simple adjuvant therapies to administer, without side effects, and low cost that could be useful for the treatment of acute severe coronavirus infection associated with acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). VitaminC, a potent antioxidant, has emerged as a relevant therapy due to its potential benefits when administered intravenous. The potential effect of vitaminC in reducing inflammation in the lungs could play a key role in lung injury caused by coronavirus infection. Another potential effective therapy is ozone: it has been extensively studied and used for many years and its effectiveness has been demonstrated so far in multiples studies. Nevertheless, our goal is not to make an exhaustive review of these therapies but spread the beneficial effects themselves. Obviously clinical trials are necessaries, but due to the potential benefit of these two therapies we highly recommended to add to the therapeutic arsenal.","Hernández, A; Papadakos, P J; Torres, A; González, D A; Vives, M; Ferrando, C; Baeza, J",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,,218

432426,Factors associated with COVID-19 in people with Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus pneumonia (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) has spread around the world. We aimed to recapitulate the clinical and CT imaging features of COVID-19 and their differences in three age groups. METHODS: The clinical and CT data of patients with COVID-19 (n = 307) that had been divided into three groups (Group 1: < 40 years old; Group 2: 40 &#8804; age < 60 years old; Group 3: &#8805; 60 years old) according to age were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of all patients, 114 (37.1%) had histories of epidemiological exposure, 48 (15.6%) were severe/critical cases, 31 had hypertension (10.1%), 15 had diabetes mellitus (4.9%), 3 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1%). Among the three groups, severe/critical type, hypertension and diabetes occurred more commonly in the elderly group compared with Group 1&2 (P < 0.05, respectively). Cough and chest tightness/pain were more commonly appeared in Group 2&3 compared with Group 1 (P < 0.05, respectively). Compared with Group 1 and 2, there were more abnormal laboratory examination indexes (including CRP increase, abnormal percentage of lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes) in Group 3 (P < 0.05, respectively). CT images revealed that more lobes were affected and more subpleural lesions were involved in the elderly group, besides, crazy paving sign, bronchodilatation and pleural thickening were more commonly seen in the elderly group, with significant difference between Group 1&2, Group 2&3 (P < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 presented representative clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations and CT findings, but three age groups possessed their own specific characteristics. Grasping the clinical and CT features stratified by age will be helpful for early definite diagnosis of COVID-19.","Wang, Jian; Zhu, Xiandi; Xu, Zhihua; Yang, Guangzhao; Mao, Guoqun; Jia, Yuzhu; Xie, Zongyu; Wang, Jing; Ao, Weiqun",BMC Infect Dis,,218
433635,Elevation of blood glucose level predicts worse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Bedside chest ultrasonography, when integrated with clinical data, is an accurate tool for improving the diagnostic process of many respiratory diseases. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a chest ultrasonographic screening program in nursing homes for detecting coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related pneumonia and improving the appropriateness of hospital referral of residents. DESIGN: Pragmatic, descriptive, feasibility study from April 2 to April 9, 2020. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 83 older residents (age 85 ± 8) presenting mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and not previously tested for COVID-19, residing in 5 nursing homes in Northern Italy. METHODS: Chest ultrasonography was performed at the bedside by a team of hospital specialists with certified expertise in thoracic ultrasonography, following a systematic approach exploring 4 different areas for each hemithorax, from the anterior and posterior side. Presence of ultrasonographic signs of interstitial pneumonia, including comet-tail artifacts (B-lines) with focal or diffuse distribution, subpleural consolidations, and pleural line indentation, was detected. The specialist team integrated ultrasonography data with clinical and anamnestic information, and gave personalized therapeutic advice for each patient, including hospital referral when needed. RESULTS: The most frequent reasons for ultrasonographic evaluation were fever (63% of participants) and mild dyspnea (40%). Fifty-six patients (67%) had abnormal ultrasonographic findings. The most common patterns were presence of multiple subpleural consolidations (32 patients) and diffuse B-lines (24 patients), with bilateral involvement. A diagnosis of suspect COVID-19 pneumonia was made in 44 patients, and 6 of them required hospitalization. Twelve patients had ultrasonographic patterns suggesting other respiratory diseases, and 2 patients with normal ultrasonographic findings were diagnosed with COPD exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In nursing home residents, screening of COVID-19 pneumonia with bedside chest ultrasonography is feasible and may represent a valid diagnostic aid for an early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks and adequate patient management.","Nouvenne, Antonio; Ticinesi, Andrea; Parise, Alberto; Prati, Beatrice; Esposito, Marcello; Cocchi, Valentina; Crisafulli, Emanuele; Volpi, Annalisa; Rossi, Sandra; Bignami, Elena Giovanna; Baciarello, Marco; Brianti, Ettore; Fabi, Massimo; Meschi, Tiziana",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,218

With SARS-CoV-2?s genomic sequence and protein structures deciphered and updated rapidly, clinical treatments and vaccine developments have proceeded simultaneously as researchers attempt to learn more about the infecting mechanisms of this virus. Among these attempts, computational drug screening for SARS-CoV-2 has potential for: (1) narrowing down billions of chemical compounds into a list of possible high-affinity ligands for SARS-CoV-2 protein targets, (2) providing information about the activities of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, (3) offering possible treatments, and (4) assisting in scientific knowledge to fight against future coronavirus infections. In this work, computational ligand screening for SARS-CoV-2 is a combination of site prediction using machine learning technology Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL) and molecular docking. Among the techniques deployed, the machine learning technology POOL was developed by us and assists in the drug screening process for SARS-CoV-2 by predicting targeted protein sites, including those that are not the obvious catalytic sites, such as exosites, allosteric sites, and other interaction sites. Results will be presented for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1), non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), and non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15). Compounds are taken from a variety of libraries, including the ZINC and Enamine databases. Protein structures are downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org). Molecular dynamic structure simulations are used to generate structures for ensemble docking.","Vu, Hoang Iyengar Suhasini Barnsley Kelton Ondrechen Mary Beuning Penny",The FASEB Journal,,218

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 starts with the bonding of the virus to ACE2 receptors expressed in many tissues, and the triggered excessive immune response plays a critical role in the course of the disease. The cytokine storm that occurs upon excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered responsible for the severe progression of the disease and the organ damage. However, the accurate pathophysiological mechanism of the disease, which progresses with various clinical presentations, is still substantially unknown. While various studies have been conducted on the effect of genetic polymorphism on the course and severity of the disease, the presence of a significant effect has not been proven yet. The clinical course of the disease is variable, with clinical representation ranging from 81% mild course to 14% severe course along with 5% critical course in patients. Asymptomatic course is considered to be higher than expected, although its frequency is not known exactly. Older adults and those with comorbidities are exposed to a more severe disease course. The disease progress with various symptoms, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise, myalgia, taste and smell dysfunctions, diarrhea, and headache. A range of complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic conditions, arrhythmia and cardiac events, secondary infections) could be seen during the course of the disease. Varied laboratory tests are vital to determine these verity and prognosis of the disease, along with the condition and exposure of the affected systems during thecourse of COVID-19.","Öztürk, Recep; Tasova, Yesim; Ayaz, Akif",Turk J Med Sci,,218

Recent studies on retrosynthesis focus on proposing more sophisticated prediction models, but the dataset to feed the models also plays an essential role in achieving the best generalizing models. Generally, a dataset that is best suited for a specific task tends to be small. In such a case, it is the standard solution to transfer knowledge from a large or clean dataset in the same domain. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and intensive examination of data transfer approaches on end-to-end generative models, in application to retrosynthesis. Experimental results show that typical data transfer methods can improve test prediction scores of an off-the-shelf Transformer baseline model. Especially, the pre-training plus fine-tuning approach boosts the accuracy scores of the baseline, achieving the new state-of-the-art. In addition, we conduct a manual inspection for the erroneous prediction results. The inspection shows that the pre-training plus fine-tuning models can generate chemically appropriate or sensible proposals in almost all cases.","Ishiguro, Katsuhiko; Ujihara, Kazuya; Sawada, Ryohto; Akita, Hirotaka; Kotera, Masaaki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00792v1.pdf,218

Throughout the organization, stroke coordinators and support group leaders recognized the importance of community and continued support for the stroke population. The objective was to develop a creative survivor & caregiver support offering following social distancing guidelines given the Covid-19 restrictions, while collaborating & expanding opportunities for stroke support across the Centura system. Purpose: We hypothesized that we could successfully support stroke survivors & caregivers through a virtual platform during the pandemic & improve accessibility regardless of participant location or transportation. Methods: Group leaders assessed stroke survivors & caregivers ongoing needs through weekly outreach identifying the importance of the support group and a need for continued group access during the Covid-19 pandemic. Attendee's indicated an interest in virtual support & a willingness to learn the required virtual platform. Leaders collaborated across the system to organize efforts in reaching survivors & caregivers at each hospital while sharing group curriculum & education systemwide;thus, allowing groups to meet at different times and increasing overall accessibility. Facilitators worked with individuals to problem solve potential issues navigating a virtual format. Results: The virtual format successfully provided support from the comfort & safety of home. Attendance increased in comparison to an in-person format. When asked about preference for an in-person setting only vs. a combination of in-person & virtual format, 80% selected a combination format. Working together across the system, stroke coordinators & group facilitators benefitted from a broader range of resources and connected the greater stroke community across Colorado. Conclusion: Regardless of future restrictions, hospitals should consider virtual support groups to increase accessibility for survivors & caregivers. There are benefits of the virtual platform which expand access to support by reducing barriers such as community availability and transportation.","Rossi, C.

A report of six cases with excellent outcome,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to determine the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and to describe the patient characteristics associated with IPA occurrence and to evaluate its impact on prognosis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all successive COVID-19 patients, hospitalized in four ICUs, with secondary deterioration and one or more respiratory samples sent to the mycology department. We used a strengthened IPA testing strategy including seven mycological criteria. Patients were classified as probable IPA according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) classification if immunocompromised, and according to the recent COVID-19-associated IPA classification otherwise. RESULTS: Probable IPA was diagnosed in 21 out of the 366 COVID-19 patients (5.7%) admitted to the ICU and in the 108 patients (19.4%) who underwent respiratory sampling for deterioration. No significant differences were observed between patients with and without IPA regarding age, gender, medical history and severity on admission and during hospitalization. Treatment with azithromycin for &gt;=3 days was associated with the diagnosis of probable IPA (odds ratio 3.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-8.5, p = 0.02). A trend was observed with high-dose dexamethasone and the occurrence of IPA. Overall mortality was higher in the IPA patients (15/21, 71.4% versus 32/87, 36.8%, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: IPA is a relatively frequent complication in severe COVID-19 patients and is responsible for increased mortality. Azithromycin, known to have immunomodulatory properties, may contribute to increase COVID-19 patient's susceptibility to IPA.","Delliere, S.; Dudoignon, E.; Fodil, S.; Voicu, S.; Collet, M.; Oillic, P.

Strained healthcare providers make difficult decisions on patient triage, treatment and care management on a daily basis. Policy makers have imposed social distancing measures to slow the disease, at a steep economic price. We design analytical tools to support these decisions and combat the pandemic. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, predict its mortality, forecast its evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to re-allocate ventilators and alleviate shortages. Our results have been used at the clinical level by several hospitals to triage patients, guide care management, plan ICU capacity, and re-distribute ventilators. At the policy level, they are currently supporting safe back-to-work policies at a major institution and equitable vaccine distribution planning at a major pharmaceutical company, and have been integrated into the US Center for Disease Control's pandemic forecast.","Bertsimas, Dimitris; Boussioux, L'eonard; Wright, Ryan Cory; Delarue, Arthur; Digalakis, Vassilis; Jacquillat, Alexandre; Kitane, Driss Lahlou; Lukin, Galit; Li, Michael Lingzhi; Mingardi, Luca; Nohadani, Omid; Orfanoudaki, Agni; Papalexopoulos, Theodore; Paskov, Ivan; Pauphilet, Jean; Lami, Omar Skali; Stellato, Bartolomeo; Bouardi, Hamza Tazi; Carballo, Kimberly Villalobos; Wiberg, Holly; Zeng, Cynthia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16509v1.pdf,218

452333,Potential benefit of angiotensin II in COVID-19 patients: beyond reasonable doubt?,2020,"Due to COVID 19 outbreak many studies are being conducted for therapeutic strategies and vaccines but detection methods play an important role in the containment of the disease. Hence, this systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the molecular detection techniques in COVID-19. For framing the systematic review 6 literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies and articles were screened for relevant content till 25th April 2020. Observations from this systematic review reveal the utility of RT-PCR with serological testing as one such method cannot correlate with accurate results. Availability of point of care devices do not conform to sensitivity and specificity in comparison to the conventional methods due to lack of clinical investigations. Pivotal aim of molecular and serological research is the development of detection methods that can support the clinical decision making of patients suspected with SARS-CoV-2. However, none of the methods were 100% sensitive and specific; hence additional studies are required to overcome the challenges addressed here. We hope that the present article with its observations and suggestions will assist the researchers to realize this vision in future.","Mahendiratta, Saniya; Batra, Gitika; Sarma, Phulen; Kumar, Harish; Bansal, Seema; Kumar, Subodh; Prakash, Ajay; Sehgal, Rakesh; Medhi, Bikash",Life Sci,,218

While the crisis is still playing out in the United States and around the world, it is nevertheless appropriate to begin to assess its impact. This paper asks: What documentable public failures provide a deeper understanding of the U.S. government COVID-19 responses’ impact on supply chains? Case examples show that markets were adversely affected in ways that caused avoidable shortages of critical goods and supplies. Moreover, public procurement effectiveness was likely reduced by short-run efforts to obtain political advantage. The article begins with a brief review of disaster procurement, highlighting how public procurement professionals tried to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next section delineates three politically led phenomena that adversely impacted procurement’s ability to acquire the needed goods and services, including a lack of cohesive strategy in acquiring essential personal protective equipment; preference for unproven drugs and magical thinking; and cozy relationships between the public and private sectors. The article concludes by discussing the centrality of public sector procurement professionals as a critical link for effective provision of government services, especially in times of crisis.","Atkinson, Christopher L.; McCue, Clifford; Prier, Eric; Atkinson, Allison M.",Am.

453903,Challenges in the Production of Convalescent Hyperimmune Plasma in the Age of COVID-19,2020,"Lockdown measures have been introduced worldwide to contain the transmission of COVID-19. However, the term 'lockdown' is not well-defined. Indeed, WHO's reference to 'so-called lockdown measures' indicates the absence of a clear and universally accepted definition of the term 'lockdown'. We propose a definition of 'lockdown' based on a two-by-two matrix that categorises different communicable disease measures based on whether they are compulsory or voluntary; and whether they are targeted at identifiable individuals or facilities, or whether they are applied indiscriminately to a general population or area. Using this definition, we describe the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. While there were some commonalities in the implementation of lockdown across these countries, a more notable finding was the variation in the design, timing and implementation of lockdown measures. We also found that the number of reported cases is heavily dependent on the number of tests carried out, and that testing rates ranged from 2031 to 63 928 per million population up until 7 September 2020. The reported number of COVID-19 deaths per million population also varies (0.4 to 250 up until 7 September 2020), but is generally low when compared with countries in Europe and North America. While lockdown measures may have helped inhibit community transmission, the pattern and nature of the epidemic remains unclear. However, there are signs of lockdown harming health by affecting the functioning of the health system and causing social and economic disruption.","Haider, Najmul; Osman, Abdinasir Yusuf; Gadzekpo, Audrey; Akipede, George O; Asogun, Danny; Ansumana, Rashid; Lessells, Richard John; Khan, Palwasha; Hamid, Muzamil Mahdi Abdel; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Mboera, Leonard; Shayo, Elizabeth Henry; Mmbaga, Blandina T; Urassa, Mark; Musoke, David; Kapata, Nathan; Ferrand, Rashida Abbas; Kapata, Pascalina-Chanda; Stigler, Florian; Czypionka, Thomas; Zumla, Alimuddin; Kock, Richard; McCoy, David",,,218
454819,Concomitant acute limb ischemia and multiple acute ischemic strokes complicating COVID-19: a case report,2021,"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection represents a global health challenge. Excavating antiviral active components from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a promising anti-IAV strategy. Our previous studies have demonstrated that 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (DAP), a major ingredient of a TCM herb called Andrographis paniculata, shows anti-IAV activity that is mainly effective against A/chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1), A/duck/Hubei/XN/2007 (H5N1), and A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in vitro and in vivo. However, the underlying anti-IAV molecular mechanism of DAP needs further investigation. In the present work, we found that DAP can significantly inhibit the apoptosis of human lung epithelial (A549) cells infected with A/chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1). After DAP treatment, the protein expression levels of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9, and the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 in H5N1-infected A549 cells were all obviously downregulated. However, DAP had no inhibitory effect on caspase-8 activity and cleaved caspase-8 production. Meanwhile, the efficacy of DAP in reducing the apoptotic cells was lost after using the inhibitor of caspase-3 or caspase-9 but remained intact after the caspase-8 inhibitor treatment. Moreover, DAP efficiently attenuated the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, suppressed cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and decreased the protein expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in the mitochondrial fraction. Furthermore, the silencing of caspase-9 reduced the yield of nucleoprotein (NP) and disabled the inhibitory ability of DAP in NP production in A549 cells. Overall results suggest that DAP exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting H5N1-induced apoptosis on the caspase-9-dependent intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway, which may be one of the anti-H5N1 mechanisms of DAP.","Cai, Wentao; Wen, Haimei; Zhou, Qinyang; Wu, Lei; Chen, Yong; Zhou, Hongbo; Jin, Meilin",Antiviral Res,,218
454945,How Should the World Pay for a Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Vaccine?,2021,"Vitamin D is a potent steroid hormone that induces widespread changes in gene expression and controls key biological pathways. Here we review pathophysiology of vitamin D with particular reference to COVID-19 and pancreatic cancer. Utility as a therapeutic agent is limited by hypercalcemic effects and attempts to circumvent this problem have used vitamin D superagonists, with increased efficacy and reduced calcemic effect. A further caveat is that vitamin D mediates multiple diverse effects. Some of these (anti-fibrosis) are likely beneficial in patients with COVID-19 and pancreatic cancer, whereas others (reduced immunity), may be beneficial through attenuation of the cytokine storm in patients with advanced COVID-19, but detrimental in pancreatic cancer. Vitamin D superagonists represent an untapped resource for development of effective therapeutic agents. However, to be successful this approach will require agonists with high cell-tissue specificity.","Easty, David J; Farr, Christine J; Hennessy, Bryan T",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,218

Here we describe a course on stochastic processes in biology, delivered between September and December 2020 to a mixed audience of mathematicians and biologists. In addition to traditional lectures and homeworks, we incorporated a series of weekly computational challenges into the course. These challenges served to familiarize students with the main modeling concepts, and provide them with an introduction on how to implement them in a research-like setting. In order to account for the different academic backgrounds of the students, they worked on the challenges in small groups, and presented their results and code in a dedicated discussion class each week. We discuss our experience designing and implementing an element of problem-based learning in an applied mathematics course through computational challenges. We also discuss feedback from students, and describe the content of the challenges presented in the course.

458748,Beyond the stethoscope: managing ambulatory heart failure during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a pervasive global health threat. A significant proportion of the world's population that is affected by latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is at risk for reactivation and subsequent transmission to close contacts. Despite sustained efforts in eradication, the rise of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacteriumtuberculosis (M. tb) has rendered traditional antibiotic therapy less effective at mitigating the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Management of TB is further complicated by medications with various off-target effects and poor compliance. Immunocompromised patients are the most at-risk in reactivation of a LTBI, due to impairment in effector immune responses. Our laboratory has previously reported that individuals suffering from Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and HIV exhibited compromised levels of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Restoring the levels of GSH resulted in improved control of M. tb infection. The goal of this review is to provide insights on the diverse roles of TGF- ß and vitamin D in altering the levels of GSH, granuloma formation, and clearance of M. tb infection. We propose that these pathways represent a potential avenue for future investigation and development of new TB treatment modalities.","Singh, Mohkam; Vaughn, Charles; Sasaninia, Kayvan; Yeh, Christopher; Mehta, Devanshi; Khieran, Ibrahim; Venketaraman, Vishwanath",,,218

However, there is insufficient knowledge on the presence of autoimmune serological markers in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed the presence and role of autoantibodies in patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia. We prospectively studied 33 consecutive patients with COVID-19, 31 (94%) of whom had interstitial pneumonia, and 25 age- and sex-matched patients with fever and/or pneumonia with etiologies other than COVID-19 as the pathological control group. All patients were tested for the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-antiphospholipid antibodies (APLs), and anti-cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies (ANCAs). Clinical, biochemical, and radiological parameters were also collected. Fifteen of 33 (45%) patients tested positive for at least one autoantibody, including 11 who tested positive for ANAs (33%), 8 who tested positive for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) (24%), and 3 who tested positive for anti-ß2-glycoprotein antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) (9%). ANCA reactivity was not detected in any patient. Patients that tested positive for autoantibodies had a significantly more severe prognosis than other patients did: 6 of 15 (40%) patients with autoantibodies died due to COVID-19 complications during hospitalization, whereas only 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients who did not have autoantibodies died (p = 0.03). Patients with poor prognosis (death due to COVID-19 complications) had a significantly higher respiratory rate at admission (23 breaths per minute vs. 17 breaths per minute; p = 0.03) and a higher frequency of autoantibodies (86% vs. 27%; p = 0.008). In conclusion, autoantibodies are frequently detected in patients with COVID-19 possibly reflecting a pathogenetic role of immune dysregulation. However, given the small number of patients, the association of autoantibodies with an unfavorable prognosis requires further multicenter studies.","Pascolini, Simona; Vannini, Antonio; Deleonardi, Gaia; Ciordinik, Michele; Sensoli, Annamaria; Carletti, Ilaria; Veronesi, Lorenza; Ricci, Chiara; Pronesti, Alessia; Mazzanti, Laura; Grondona, Ana; Silvestri, Tania; Zanuso, Stefano; Mazzolini, Marcello; Lalanne, Claudine; Quarneti, Chiara; Fusconi, Marco; Giostra, Fabrizio; Granito, Alessandro; Muratori, Luigi; Lenzi, Marco; Muratori, Paolo",Clinical and translational science (Online),,218

Uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) may participate in the regulation of glucose metabolism, thus measurement of ucOC could be useful in evaluating interactions between bone and glucose metabolism. We developed recombinant antibodies and immunoassay to specifically detect ucOC in human blood samples. ucOC-specific recombinant antibodies were selected from an antibody library by phage display. Four candidates were characterized, and one (Fab-AP13) was used to set up an immunoassay with a pre-existing MAb. Plasma ucOC levels were measured in subjects with normal fasting blood glucose (&#8804; 6 mmol/l, N = 46) or with hyperglycemia (&#8805; 7 mmol/l, N = 29). Further, we analyzed ucOC in age- and gender-matched patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D, N = 49). Antibodies recognized ucOC without cross-reaction to carboxylated osteocalcin. Antibodies had unique binding sites at the carboxylation region, with Glu17 included in all epitopes. Immunoassay was set up and characterized. Immunoassay detected ucOC in serum and plasma, with on average 1.6-fold higher levels in plasma. ucOC concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with hyperglycemia (median 0.58 ng/ml, p = 0.008) or with T2D diagnosis (0.68 ng/ml, p = 0.015) than in subjects with normal blood glucose (1.01 ng/ml). ucOC negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose in subjects without T2D (r = - 0.24, p = 0.035) but not in T2D patients (p = 0.41). Our immunoassay, based on the novel recombinant antibody, allows for specific and sensitive detection of ucOC in human circulation. Correlation between ucOC and plasma glucose suggests interactions between osteocalcin and glucose metabolism in humans.","Arponen, Milja; Brockmann, Eeva-Christine; Kiviranta, Riku; Lamminmäki, Urpo; Ivaska, Kaisa K",Calcif. tissue int,,218

Human convalescent plasma containing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently being used to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 where clinical efficacy trials are ongoing. Here, we assess therapeutic passive transfer in groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected African green monkeys with convalescent sera containing either high or low anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Differences in viral load and pathology are minimal between monkeys that receive the lower titer convalescent sera and untreated controls. However, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced severity of virus-associated lung pathology, and reductions in coagulopathy and inflammatory processes are observed in monkeys that receive high titer sera versus untreated controls. Our data indicate that convalescent plasma therapy in humans may be an effective strategy provided that donor sera contain high anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers given in early stages of the disease.","Cross, Robert W; Prasad, Abhishek N; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Woolsey, Courtney; Agans, Krystle N; Deer, Daniel J; Dobias, Natalie S; Geisbert, Joan B; Fenton, Karla A; Geisbert, Thomas W",Cell Rep,,218

Social distancing and lockdown measures modified people's habits, while the Internet gained a major role in supporting remote working, e-teaching, online collaboration, gaming, video streaming, etc. All these sudden changes put unprecedented stress on the network. In this paper, we analyze the impact of the lockdown enforcement on the Politecnico di Torino campus network. Right after the school shutdown on the 25 thof February, PoliTO deployed its own in-house solution for virtual teaching. Ever since, the university provides about 600 virtual classes daily, serving more than 16 000 students per day. Here, we report a picture of how the pandemic changed PoliTO's network traffic. We first focus on the usage of remote working and collaboration platforms. Given the peculiarity of PoliTO online teaching solution that is hosted in-house, we drill down on the traffic, characterizing both the audience and the network footprint. Overall, we present a snapshot of the abrupt changes seen on campus traffic due to COVID-19, and testify how the Internet has proved robust to successfully cope with challenges while maintaining the university operations.","Favale, Thomas; Soro, Francesca; Trevisan, Martino; Drago, Idilio; Mellia, Marco",Comput.

470952,Impact of Prophylactic Hydroxychloroquine on People at High Risk of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2021,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems, in which dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin levels are depleted and lead to the development of motor and non-motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia, weight changes, fatigue, depression, and visual hallucinations. Therapeutic strategies place much focus on dopamine replacement and the inhibition of dopamine metabolism. The present study was based on the known abilities of chalcones to act as molecular scaffolds that selectively inhibit MAO-B with the added advantage of binding reversibly. Recently, we synthesized a series of 26 chalcone compounds, amongst which (2E)-1-(2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (O10) and (2E)-1-(2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-6-yl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (O23) most inhibited MAO-B. Hence, the present study was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective effect of O10 and O23 at varying doses such as 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg each in a haloperidol-induced murine model of PD. Both compounds were effective (though O23 was the more effective) at ameliorating extrapyramidal and non-motor symptoms in the model and improved locomotory and exploratory behaviors, reduced oxidative stress markers, and enhanced antioxidant marker and neurotransmitter levels. Furthermore, histopathological studies showed O10 and O23 both reduced neurofibrillary tangles and plaques to almost normal control levels.","Parambi, Della Grace Thomas; Saleem, Uzma; Shah, Muhammad Ajmal; Anwar, Fareeha; Ahmad, Bashir; Manzar, Amna; Itzaz, Aqsa; Harilal, Seetha; Uddin, Md Sahab; Kim, Hoon; Mathew, Bijo",Neurochem Res,,218

Most of the patients suffered of a respiratory disease that will progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severely ill patients, develop a systemic inflammatory response with a Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), that is characterized by a sudden increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alfa by activated macrophages (M1 phenotype). Blocking IL-6 with tocilizumab and using respirator equipment seems to be a very important issue in this (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, but not all patients are referred to such treatments. Low dose radiotherapy (0,5 Gy), is an evidence-based anti-inflammatory treatment, that could modify the immune landscape in the lung affected of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, through macrophages polarization to alternatively activated Macrophages (M2 phenotype). Radiation-induced cancer risk could be assumed due to the very low dose used, the advanced age of the patients and the life-threatening condition of SARS-Cov2 pneumonia. LDRT is a cost-effective non-toxic treatment already available in most general hospitals. This fact allows that it would be used for the large number of patients that will suffer this disease, and that would not receive specific anti-IL-6 treatments in ICUs in low and middle income countries.","Lara, Pedro C.; Burgos, Javier; Macias, David",Clin.

This lockdown interrupted citizens' professional and educational activities, in addition to closing shops, offices and educational institutions. The resulting changes in people's daily routines and activities induced unexpected changes in their thoughts, feelings and attitudes, in addition to altering their life perceptions. Consequently, the present study explores how young adults perceived their lives under lockdown during the final week of March 2020, when the reported number of daily coronavirus infections reached its peak in Italy. The research was carried out among 293 university students (234 women and 59 men) with an average age of 20.85 years old (SD = 3.23). The researchers asked participants to describe the emotions, thoughts and experiences that characterized their time under lockdown. The study analyzed specific narratives related to time and space using grounded theory methodology, which was applied using Atlas 8 software, leading to the creation of 68 codes. The study organized these codes into three specific categories: confined in the present, confined in the past, and striving toward one's goals. Finally, the researchers also created a core-category labeled ""continuity of being."" The results showed that the closure of open spaces caused a division in participants' perceptions of time continuity, with many viewing themselves as feeling fragmented and as living the present in a static and fixed way. Additionally, participants also saw the present as being discontinuous from the past, while, simultaneously, projecting toward the future and the changes it might bring. Finally, this study examined further implications surrounding individual projecting among young people in greater depth.","Procentese, F.; Esposito, C.; Gonzalez Leone, F.; Agueli, B.; Arcidiacono, C.; Freda, M.

Our aim is to make model for the growth of COVID-19 cases in South Sulawesi in the top 5 provinces with the largest COVID-19 cases in Indonesia and predict when this pandemic reaches the peak of spread and when it ends. This paper used the Richards model, which is an extension of a simple logistic growth model with additional scaling parameters. Data used in the paper as of June 24, 2020 were taken from the official website of the Indonesian government. Our results are that the maximum cumulative number of COVID-19 cases has reached 10,000 to 12,000 cases. The peak of the pandemic is estimated to occur from June to July 2020 while continuing to impose social restrictions. The condition in South Sulawesi shows a sloping curve around October 2020, which means that there are still additional cases but not significant. When entering November, the curve starts to flat which indicates the addition of very small cases until the pandemic ends. The results of the pandemic peak prediction are the same as the Indonesian data;what is different is the prediction of when the pandemic will end. In the best-case scenario, the current data will tend to slow down, with the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sulawesi expected to end in November 2020. Our modeling procedure can provide information about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in South Sulawesi that may facilitate real-time public health responses about future disease outbreaks.","Zuhairoh, Faihatuz; Rosadi, Dedi",Indonesian Journal Of Science And Technology,,218

The exact incidence of disease re-infection or recurrence remains unknown. One particular at-risk population includes individuals with solid organ transplantation on immunosuppression. We present a case of COVID-19 re-infection in a chronically immunocompromised liver transplant patient. A 53-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias. She was found to test positive for COVID-19. Her relevant medical history included liver transplantation on chronic immunosuppression. More recently, she had tested positive for COVID-19 approximately three months prior to this and was hospitalized at that time for encephalopathy and treated with remdesivir and convalescent plasma. She had subsequently recovered with negative COVID-19 testing in the interim. On the ED presentation with presumed re-infection, her disease was deemed to be mild with lack of severe symptoms or pulmonary involvement, and she was discharged with outpatient follow-up for monoclonal antibody infusion therapy. We describe a scenario of presumed COVID-19 re-infection in a liver transplant patient. To our knowledge, this is a rare event and has been reported internationally in only a handful of individuals. We surmise that immunosuppression could offer some protection from the inflammatory cascade of the initial disease process in COVID-19 given the relatively mild disease observed in our patient. On the other hand, a less robust immune response may decrease humoral immunity and leave patients at greater risk of re-infection. Further investigation is necessary to delineate COVID-19 disease re-infection versus relapse, especially in the setting of an immunocompromised state.","Mohseni, M.; Albus, M.; Kaminski, A.; Harrison, M.

The purpose of this study is to examine which socioeconomic status groups are most at risk of treatment interruption among Japanese workers. METHODS: This cross-sectional internet monitor study was conducted among Japanese workers on December 22-26, 2020. Out of a total of 33 302 participants in the survey, 9510 (5392 males and 4118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment or hospital visits were included in the analysis. A multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for treatment disruption. We examined separate multivariate models for socioeconomic factors, health factors, and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: During a period of rapid COVID-19 infection, about 11% of Japanese workers who required regular treatment experienced interruptions to their treatment. The OR of treatment interruption associated with not being married compared with being married was 1.44 (95%CI: 1.17-1.76); manual labor work compared with desk work was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.11-1.52); loss of employment when the COVID-19 pandemic started and continued unemployment compared with being employed over the entire pandemic period was 1.62 (95%CI: 1.13-2.31) and 2.57 (95%CI: 1.63-4.07), respectively; and feeling financially unstable was 2.92 (95%CI: 2.25-3.80). CONCLUSION: Treatment interruption is a new health inequality brought about by COVID-19 with possible medium- and long-term effects, including excess mortality, morbidity, and productivity loss due to increased presenteeism. Efforts are needed to reduce treatment interruptions among workers who require regular treatment.","Fujimoto, Kenji; Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Nagata, Tomohisa; Tsuji, Mayumi; Eguchi, Hisashi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",J Occup Health,,218

We investigate whether these funds were distributed in a way that responded fairly to COVID-19-related medical and financial need. The U.S. health care system is bifurcated into the ""haves"" and ""have nots."" The health care safety net hospitals, which were already financially weak, cared for the bulk of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, the ""have"" hospitals suffered financially because their most profitable procedures are elective and were postponed during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: To obtain relief fund data for each hospital in the U.S., we start with data from HHS posted on the CDC website. We use RAND Hospital Data to analyze how fund distributions are associated with hospital characteristics. FINDINGS: Our analysis reveals that the ""have"" hospitals with the most days of cash on hand received more funding per bed than hospitals with fewer than 50 days of cash on hand (the ""have nots""). CONCLUSIONS: Despite extreme racial inequities, which COVID-19 exposed early on in the pandemic, the federal government rewards those hospitals that cater to the most privileged in the U.S., leaving hospitals that predominantly serve low-income people of color with less.","Grogan, Colleen M; Gusmano, Michael K; Lin, Yu-An",J. health polit. policy law,,218

487508,Cancer is associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality: A pooled analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the magnitude of under-reporting the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Brazil in 2020, previously shown to occur due to low rate of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2, reporting delay, inadequate access to medical care, and its poor quality, leading to the low sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance and poor outcomes, often without laboratory confirmation of the cause of death. METHODS: Excess mortality due to COVID-19 was estimated directly based on various data sources, and indirectly, based on the difference between the observed and expected number of deaths from serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) and all-natural causes in 2020 had there been no COVID-19. The absence of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was adjusted based on the proportion of those who tested positive among the tested individuals whose death was attributed to COVID-19. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) were used to improve prediction of likely mortality without COVID-19 in 2020. RESULTS: Under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths was 22.62%, with a corresponding mortality rate per 100 000 inhabitants of 115 by the direct method, 71-76 by the indirect methods based on the excess SARI mortality and 95-104 by excess mortality due to natural causes. COVID-19 was the third cause of mortality that contributed directly with 18%, and indirectly with additional 10-11% to all deaths in Brazil in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Underestimation of COVID-19 mortality between 1:5 and 1:4 is likely its lower bound. Timely and accurate surveillance of death causes is of the essence to evaluate the COVID-19 burden.","Kupek, Emil",Trop. med. int. health,,218

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre national audit over 12 weeks from 6th April 2020. SETTING: UK secondary care ENT departments. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with acute epistaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Re-presentation within 10 days for patients discharged from the ED. RESULTS: Eighty three centres from all four UK nations submitted 2631 valid cases. The majority of cases were ED referrals (89.7%, n = 2358/2631). 54.6% were discharged from the ED following ENT review (n = 1267/2322), of whom 19.5% re-presented within 10 days (n = 245/1259) and 6.8% were ultimately admitted (n = 86/1259). 46.7% of patients had a non-dissolvable pack inserted by ED prior to referral to ENT (n = 1099/2355). The discharge rates for ED patients and their subsequent re-presentation rates were as follows: non-dissolvable packs, 29.5% discharged (n = 332/1125), 18.2% re-presented (n = 60/330); dissolvable products, 71.1% discharged (n = 488/686), 21.8% re-presented (n = 106/486); cautery only, 89.2% discharged (n = 247/277), 20.0% re-presented (n = 49/245); and no intranasal intervention, 85.5% discharged (n = 200/234), 15.2% re-presented (n = 30/198).

METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020, including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% (95% confidence interval 83.7-100) 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% (88.7-97.8) and 100% (96.1-100). Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% (79.8-89.0) and 81.1% (76.6-85.7), p < 0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the three IgG anti-N assays (Abbott, Mikrogen, Euroimmun) than for the two IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin, Euroimmun) (&#8805;50% seroconversion day 9-10 vs. day 11-12 and p < 0.05 for percent seropositive patients day 9-10 to 17-18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients. DISCUSSION: Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population.","Van Elslande, Jan; Decru, Bram; Jonckheere, Stijn; Van Wijngaerden, Eric; Houben, Els; Vandecandelaere, Patricia; Indevuyst, Christophe; Depypere, Melissa; Desmet, Stefanie; André, Emmanuel; Van Ranst, Marc; Lagrou, Katrien; Vermeersch, Pieter",Clin. microbiol. infect,,218

In this study, the frequency of HLA alleles among Saudi patients infected with COVID-19 was examined. The association with infection susceptibility and mortality was evaluated. This study included 135 Saudi COVID-19-infected patients (106 recovered and 29 died) who were admitted to hospitals because of their symptoms, and 135 healthy controls. HLA class I (A, B, C) and class II (DRB1, DQB1) genotyping was performed using the molecular method (PCR-rSSO). In this study, there was a significant increase in the frequency of HLA-A*01, B*56 and C*01 among infected patients compared to the control group (12.1% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.004, 3.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.006, 4.4% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.042, respectively). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the frequency of HLA-A*03 and C*06 among fatal patients compared to infected patients (13.8% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.036, 32.8% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.011, respectively). In terms of HLA class II, HLA-DRB1*04 was significantly higher in the control group compared to infected patients (27.4% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.002), while HLA-DRB1*08 was significantly higher in the infected group compared to the control (4.8% vs. 0.7%, p = 0.004). After statistical correction of the p value, A*01, B*56, DRB1*04 and DRB1*08 remained statistically significant (pc = 0.04, pc = 0.03, pc = 0.014 and pc = 0.028). This initial data suggested that individual HLA genotypes might play a role in determining susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and infection outcome. However, examining a larger sample size from different populations is required to determine a powerful association for clinical application.","Naemi, Fatmah M A; Al-Adwani, Shurooq; Al-Khatabi, Heba; Al-Nazawi, Ashwaq",Virology,,218
495610,"Characteristics and Outcomes of Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19 in Sakarya, Turkey: A Single Center Cohort Study",2020,"Purpose: The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic has placed an increased importance on physical distancing to minimize the risk of transmission in radiation oncology departments. The pandemic has also increased the use of hypofractionated treatment schedules where magnetic resonance-guided online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) can aid in dose escalation. This specialized technique requires increased staffing in close proximity, and thus the need for novel coverage practices to increase physical distancing while still providing specialty care. Methods and Materials: A remote-physician ART coverage practice was developed and described using commercially available software products. Our remote-physician coverage practice provided control to the physician to contour and review of the images and plans. The time from completion of image registration to the beginning of treatment was recorded for 20 fractions before remote-physician ART coverage and 14 fractions after implementation of remote-physician ART coverage. Visual quality was calculated using cross-correlation between the treatment delivery and remote-physician computer screens. Results: For the 14 fractions after implementation, the average time from image registration to the beginning of treatment was 24.9 ± 6.1 minutes. In comparison, the 20 fractions analyzed without remote coverage had an average time of 29.2 ± 9.8 minutes. The correlation between the console and remote-physician screens was R =.95. Conclusions: Our novel remote-physician ART coverage practice is secure, interactive, timely, and of high visual quality. When using remote physicians for ART, our department was able to increase physical distancing to lower the risk of virus transmission while providing specialty care to patients in need.","Price, Alex; Kim, Hyun; Henke, Lauren E.; Knutson, Nels C.; Spraker, Matthew B.; Michalski, Jeff; Hugo, Geoffrey D.; Robinson, Clifford G.; Green, Olga",Adv.

Innate immunity-as the first line of defense of our immune system-plays a central role in combating this novel virus. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for the interaction of the human innate immune system with SARS-CoV-2 to link the clinical observations with experimental findings that have been made during the first year of the pandemic. We review evidence that variability in innate immune system components among humans is a main contributor to the heterogeneous disease courses observed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease spectrum induced by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms observed for cells and soluble mediators involved in innate immunity is a prerequisite for the development of diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies targeting COVID-19.

The objectives of our study were to describe patterns of COVID-19 testing among LGBTQ+ people and to differentiate rates of COVID-19 testing and test results by sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS: Participants residing in the United States and US territories (N = 1090) aged &#8805;18 completed an internet-based survey from May through July 2020 that assessed COVID-19 testing and test results and sociodemographic characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). We analyzed data on receipt and results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 and symptoms of COVID-19 in relation to sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 1090 participants, 182 (16.7%) received a PCR test; of these, 16 (8.8%) had a positive test result. Of the 124 (11.4%) who received an antibody test, 45 (36.3%) had antibodies. Rates of PCR testing were higher among participants who were non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born (16.3%) and employed full-time or part-time (18.5%) versus unemployed (10.8%). Antibody testing rates were higher among gay cisgender men (17.2%) versus other SOGI groups, non-US-born (25.4%) versus US-born participants, employed (12.6%) versus unemployed participants, and participants residing in the Northeast (20.0%) versus other regions. Among SOGI groups with sufficient cell sizes (n > 10), positive PCR results were highest among cisgender gay men (16.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The differential patterns of testing and positivity, particularly among gay men in our sample, confirm the need to create COVID-19 public health messaging and programming that attend to the LGBTQ+ population.","Martino, Richard J; Krause, Kristen D; Griffin, Marybec; LoSchiavo, Caleb; Comer-Carruthers, Camilla; Karr, Anita G; Bullock, Allie F; Halkitis, Perry N",Public Health Rep,,218

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified all veterans receiving Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare with &#8805;1 positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 (28 February-31 July 2020; n=35 879). We assessed associations of diabetes (with and without insulin use) with hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death at 30 days, and with hazard of death until the censoring date. Among participants with diabetes (n=13 863), we examined associations of hemoglobin A1c and antihyperglycemic medication use with COVID-19 outcomes. We estimated mediation between diabetes and outcomes by comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease), statin or ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use, and cardiac biomarkers (brain natriuretic peptide and troponin). RESULTS: Diabetes with and without insulin use was associated with greater odds of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death at 30 days, and with greater hazard of death compared with no diabetes (OR 1.73, 1.76 and 1.63, and HR 1.61; and OR 1.39, 1.49 and 1.33, and HR 1.37, respectively, all p<0.0001). Prior sulfonylurea use was associated with greater odds of hospitalization and prior insulin use with hospitalization and death among patients with diabetes; among all participants, statin use was associated with lower mortality and ARB use with lower odds of hospitalization. Cardiovascular disease-related factors mediated <20% of associations between diabetes and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is independently associated with adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Associations are only partially mediated by common comorbidities.","Wander, Pandora L; Lowy, Elliott; Beste, Lauren A; Tulloch-Palomino, Luis; Korpak, Anna; Peterson, Alexander C; Young, Bessie A; Boyko, Edward J",,,218

This paper provides evidence that information frictions and the “first-come, first-served” design of the PPP program skewed its resources towards larger firms and may have permanently reduced its effectiveness. Using new daily survey data on small businesses in the U.S., we show that the smallest businesses were less aware of the PPP and less likely to apply. If they did apply, the smallest businesses applied later, faced longer processing times, and were less likely to have their application approved. These frictions may have mattered, as businesses that received aid report fewer layoffs, higher employment, and improved expectations about the future.","Humphries, John Eric; Neilson, Christopher A.; Ulyssea, Gabriel",J.

505632,Unusual cause of hypoxia due to incomplete removal of the closed suction catheter system during COVID-19 ventilation,2021,"Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading non-communicable disease worldwide and is associated with several microvascular and macrovascular complications. Individuals with T2D are more prone to acquiring selected types of infections and are more susceptible to complications due to these infections. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between T2D and COVID-19 in the community setting. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective analysis that included 147 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a community hospital. Demographics, medical history, symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, complications during the hospital course, and treatments were collected and analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to describe the probability of intubation in patients with T2D as compared with patients without T2D. The hazard ratio for intubation in the survival analysis was estimated using a bivariable Cox proportional-hazards model. Results: Of 147 patients, 73 (49.7%) had a history of T2D. Patients with T2D had higher requirement of ICU admission (31.5% vs 12.2%; p=.004), higher incidence of ARDS (35.6% vs 16.2%, p=.007), higher rates of intubation (32.9% vs 12.2%, p=0.003), and higher use neuromuscular blocking agents (23.3% vs 9.5%, p=.02). In the survival analysis at 28 days of follow-up, patients with T2D showed an increased hazard for intubation (HR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.39 to 6.46). Conclusion: In our patient population, patients with COVID-19 and T2D showed significantly higher ARDS incidence and intubation rates. The survival analysis also showed that after 28 days of follow-up, patients with T2D presented an increased risk for shorter time to intubation.","Shrestha, Ekta; Charkhviani, Mariam; Musurakis, Clio; Kansakar, Aswin Ratna; Devkota, Amrit; Banjade, Rabin; Pudasainee, Prasun; Chitrakar, Solab; Sharma, Alisha; Sous, Mina; Padhamanbhan, Shanmugha; Friedman, Harvey J; Nava, Guillermo Rodriguez",Obes Med,,218
505781,Research and Statistics: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2021,"More than 3.5 million people have died globally from COVID-19, yet an effective therapy is not available. It is, therefore, important to understand the signaling pathways that mediate disease progression in order to identify new molecular targets for therapeutic development. Here, we report that the blood serum levels of ephrin-A1 and the sheddase ADAM12 were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients treated at SUNY Downstate Hospital of Brooklyn, New York. Both ephrin-A1 and ADAM12 are known to be involved in inflammation and regulate endothelial cell permeability, thus providing a gateway to lung injury. The clinical outcome correlated with the ephrin-A1 and ADAM12 serum levels during the first week of hospitalization. In contrast, the serum levels of TNF&#945; were elevated in only a small subset of the patients, and these same patients also had highly elevated levels of the sheddase ADAM17. These data indicate that ephrin-A1-mediated inflammatory signaling may contribute to COVID-19 disease progression more so than TNF&#945;-mediated inflammatory signaling. They also support the notion that, in COVID-19 inflammation, ADAM12 sheds ephrin-A1, while ADAM17 sheds TNF&#945;. Furthermore, the results suggest that elevated serum levels and activity of cytokines, such as TNF&#945;, and other secreted inflammatory molecules, such as ephrin-A1, are not simply due to overexpression, but also to upregulation of sheddases that release them into the blood circulation. Our results identify ephrin-A1, ADAM12, and other molecules in the ephrin-A1 signaling pathway as potential pharmacological targets for treating COVID-19 inflammation.","Mendoza, Rachelle; Saha, Nayanendu; Momeni, Amir; Gabutan, Elmer; Alawad, Mouyed; Dehghani, Amir; Diks, John; Lin, Bo; Wang, Donghai; Alshal, Mohamed; Fyke, William; Wang, Bingcheng; Himanen, Juha P; Premsrirut, Prem; Nikolov, Dimitar B",Heliyon,,218

Clinical experience of pregnancies complicated with infection by other coronaviruses e.g., Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, has led to pregnant woman being considered potentially vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Physiological changes during pregnancy have a significant impact on the immune system, respiratory system, cardiovascular function, and coagulation. These may have positive or negative effects on COVID-19 disease progression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy remains to be determined, and a concerted, global effort is required to determine the effects on implantation, fetal growth and development, labor, and neonatal health. Asymptomatic infection presents a further challenge regarding service provision, prevention, and management. Besides the direct impacts of the disease, a plethora of indirect consequences of the pandemic adversely affect maternal health, including reduced access to reproductive health services, increased mental health strain, and increased socioeconomic deprivation.

The evolution of citizens' concerns and behaviours over time is a central piece to support public policies. OBJECTIVE: To unveil perceptions and behaviours of the Portuguese population regarding social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for more informed public policies. METHODS: Online panel survey distributed in three waves between March 13th and May 6th 2020. Data collected from a non-representative sample of 7,448 respondents includes socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported measures on levels of concern and behaviours related to COVID-19. We performed descriptive analysis and probit regressions to understand relationships between the different variables. RESULTS: Most participants (85%) report being at least very concerned with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation reached a high level of adherence during the state of emergency. Around 36% of the sample anticipated consumption decisions, stockpiling ahead of the state of emergency declaration. Medical appointments suffered severe consequences, being re-rescheduled or cancelled. We find important variation in concerns with the economic impact across activity sectors. CONCLUSION: We show that high level of concern and behaviour adaptation in our sample preceded the implementation of lockdown measures in Portugal around mid-March. One month later, a large share of individuals had suffered disruption in their routine health care and negative impacts in their financial status.","Valente de Almeida, Sara; Costa, Eduardo; Lopes, Francisca Vargas; Santos, João Vasco; Pita Barros, Pedro",PLoS One,,218

AIM: To determine prevalence of CPE in hospital drains exposed to in-patients with CPE, relatedness of drain and patient CPE, and risk factors for drain contamination. METHODS: We cultured sink and shower drains in patient rooms and communal shower rooms exposed to 310 in-patients with CPE colonization/infection at 10 hospitals. Using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing, in-patient and corresponding drain CPE were compared. Risk factors for drain contamination were assessed using multi-level modelling. FINDINGS: Of 1,209 exposed patient room and communal shower room drains, 53 (4%) yielded 62 CPE isolates in 7 (70%) hospitals. Of 49 CPE isolates in patient room drains, 4 (8%) were linked to prior room occupants. Linked drain/room occupant pairs included Citrobacter freundii ST18 isolates separated by 8 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), related blaKPC-containing IncN3-type plasmids (different species), related blaKPC-3-containing IncN-type plasmids (different species), and related blaOXA-48-containing IncL/M-type plasmids (different species). In one hospital, drain isolates from 8 rooms on 2 units were Enterobacter hormaechei separated by 0-6 SNVs. Shower drains were more likely to be CPE-contaminated than hand hygiene (OR 3.45, 95%CI 1.66-7.16) or patient use (OR 13.0, 95%CI 4.29-39.1) sink drains. Hand hygiene sink drains were more likely to be CPE-contaminated than patient use sink drains (OR 3.75, 95%CI 1.17-12.0). CONCLUSION: Drain contamination was uncommon but widely dispersed. Drain CPE unrelated to patient exposure suggests contamination by undetected colonized patients or retrograde (drain-to-drain) contamination. Drain types had different contamination risks.","Jamal, Alainna J; Mataseje, Laura; Brown, Kevin A; Katz, Kevin; Johnstone, Jennie; Muller, Matthew P; Allen, Vanessa G; Borgia, Sergio; Boyd, David A; Ciccotelli, William; Delibasic, Kornelija; Fisman, David N; Khan, Nadeem; Li, Angel X; Mehta, Mamta; Ng, Wil; Pantelidis, Rajni; Paterson, Aimee; Pikula, Gordana; Sawicki, Rachel; Schmidt, Shelley; Souto, Renata; Tang, Lin; Thomas, Cameron; McGeer, Allison J; Mulvey, Michael R",J. hosp. infect,,218

METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study of pregnant and nonpregnant women of reproductive age hospitalized between March and October 2020 in Tehran, Iran. Medical records were reviewed and women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR were included. Extracted data were compared and logistic regression performed. RESULTS: A total of 110 pregnant and 234 nonpregnant COVID-19-positive women were included. Frequency of severe disease was higher in nonpregnant women than pregnant women (29% vs 11.8%; P < 0.001). Symptoms including cough, dyspnea, chill, fatigue, and headache were more frequent in nonpregnant women (P < 0.05). Pregnant women had higher oxygen saturation levels and lower lymphocyte count (P = 0.001). Six (5.5%) pregnant and 12 (5.1%) nonpregnant women died (P = 0.80). No significant differences between the groups were found for ICU admission and end organ failure. Significantly more nonpregnant women had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 9.4% vs 0%; P = 0.001). Univariate regression indicated association between hypertension and death; oxygen saturation and ARDS; and body mass index and ICU admission. No association was found between pregnancy and death, ICU admission, or ARDS.

510315,The Multiple Casualty Scenario: Role of the Anesthesiologist,2020,"To respond to the urgent need for COVID-19 testing, countries perform nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in centralized laboratories. Real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction), used to amplify and detect the viral RNA., is considered, as the current gold standard for diagnostics. It is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings [1]. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in isothermal amplification and paper microfluidics, we created a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT-LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load in the tested samples, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using a set of 16 pools of naso-pharyngal swab eluates, we estimated a limit of detection comparable to real-time RT-PCR (i.e. 1 genome copies per microliter of clinical sample) and no cross-reaction with eight major respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called ""COVIDISC"" to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment will expedite the widespread dissemination of this device.

510378,COVID-19-induced vascular angiopathy: CTPA signs in critically ill patients other than acute pulmonary embolism and high-lung opacity scores,2021,"Bacteriolyses of bacterial cell walls by Zn2+-induced peptidoglycan autolysins, and virucides by zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), zinc binding domain (ZBD), zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) against human coronavirus and 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 infection are discussed respectively. Bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) autolysin AmiA for S. aureus amidase is acted on PGN binding and cleavage. The AmiA distinguishes PGN mostly by the peptide, and the cleavage is facilitated by a zinc-activated water molecule, in order to develop new therapeutics against MRSA. Lytic amidase autolysin LytA associates with the cell wall via its zinc-binding motif. Autolysin LytF is endopeptidase in B. subtilis that plays a role in cell separation and hydrolase of the peptide. Thus, Zn2+ ions induced PGN autolysins for S. aureus is amidase LytA and endopeptidase LytM that are anticipated to be used as antibacterial potential of endogenous PGN-degrading enzymes against S. aureus. Zinc-dependent endopeptidases (Eps) are predicted to hydrolyze PGN to facilitate cell growth that zinc availability affects strong activity of cell wall hydrolases, and zur-regulated endopeptidases are present in divergent Gram-negative bacteria. AmiB catalyzes the degradation of PGN in Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in a marked increases of sensitivity to oxidative stress and organic acids. Eps at outer membrane lipoprotein and amidase, peptidase, and carboxy-peptidase in PGN layer against E. coli are anticipated to be employed as E. coli cell wall-hydrolyzing enzymes of anti-bacterial potential. Zinc-dependent PGN autolysin of amidases are enhanced the anti-bacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The autolysin-mediated bacteriolysis induced bacterial cell death can contribute to the bactericidal activities. On the other hand, enveloped viruses enter cells and initiate disease-causing cycles of replication in virus-cell interaction. ZNF ZCCHC3 binds RNA and facilitates viral RNA that is critical for RIG-1 like receptor (RLR)-mediated innate immune response to RNA virus. ZAP inhibits entry, replication, and spread of certain viruses, and promotes viral RNA degradation. ZAP also may regulate DNA and RNA virus replication that ZAP controls Retroviral RNA production and HIV-1 infection by promoting the degradation of specific viral mRNAs. ZBD inhibits Nidovirus RNA synthesis and replication, hence the 2019-nCoV may be regulated by ZBD. ZnONPs recently are used in various applications of veterinary science due to their antibacterial and antiviral agents, tissue repair that the ZnONPs are anticipated to be employed in prevention of human coronavirus infection. 2019-nCoV is RNA virus that has high mutation rate, and these high rates are correlated with enhanced virulence and evolvability, traits considered beneficial for viruses. 2019-nCoV (beta-CoV) structure has a spike glycoprotein (S) that the coronavirus protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells which the evolution of these two critical functions of coronavirus spike proteins, receptor recognition and membrane fusion must be considered to be able to degrade or suppress for the spikes and the membrane by Zn2+-centered tetrahed-rally coordinated binding. Zinc ions could inhibit virus entry and membrane fusion of S1 and S2 domains of spike protein with zinc ion-binding interaction. Zn2+ ions can prevent in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infected patient with antiviral zinc homeostatic immunity and have important roles for respiratory and pulmonary process of COVID-19 disease. The antiviral compounds including zinc N-ethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamate (EPDTC) inhibit the viral protease, preventing humancoxsackie virus strain B3 (CVB3) genome replication. The interactions had been found on the binding specificity by Zn2+ ions-centered tetrahedral geometric coordination of the inhibitors against 3C and 3C-like proteases.

Different methodologies and recommendations on contact tracing for Primary Health Care (PHC) and Public Health Services (PHS), like articles in Pubmed about COVID-19 and contact tracing, official contact definitions, the classic contact tracing model in tuberculosis (TB), information about apps for contact tracing and the role of the diagnostic tests, were reviewed. To establish efficient prevention and control measures, it is always necessary to implement contact tracing based on clinical suspicion, early diagnosis and isolation of cases and contacts and their follow-up. The classic contact tracing model in TB can be applied to this new infection, but accelerating the process given its acute nature and its potential severity.

517591,The detrimental effect of COVID-19 nationwide quarantine on accelerometer-assessed physical activity of heart failure patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) continues to be a major health problem worldwide and is one of the main reasons for prescribing antibiotics. However, the causative agent is often not identified, resulting in antibiotic overtreatment, which is a key driver of antimicrobial resistance and adverse events. We aim to test the hypothesis that comprehensive molecular testing, compared with routine microbiological testing, would be effective in reducing antibiotic use in patients with CAP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will perform a randomised, controlled, open-label clinical trial with two parallel groups (1:1) at two tertiary hospitals between 2020 and 2022. Non-severely immunosuppressed adults hospitalised for CAP will be considered eligible. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental diagnosis (comprehensive molecular testing plus routine microbiological testing) or standard diagnosis (only microbiological routine testing). The primary endpoint will be antibiotic consumption measured as days of antibiotic therapy per 1000 patient-days. Secondary endpoints will be de-escalation to narrower antibiotic treatment, time to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics, days to reaching an aetiological diagnosis, antibiotic-related side effects, length of stay, days to clinical stability, intensive care unit admission, days of mechanical ventilation, hospital readmission up to 30 days after randomisation and death from any cause by 48 hours and 30 days after randomisation. We will need to include 440 subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that both groups have equal days of antibiotic therapy per 1000 patient-days with a probability >0.8. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of Bellvitge Hospital (AC028/19) and from the Spanish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency, and it is valid for all participating centres under existing Spanish legislation.

In this study, an iron-rich substrate (IRS) was developed based on iron­carbon micro-electrolysis and applied for simultaneous sediments and overlying water remediation. IRS obtained high ammonia and phosphate adsorption capacities (Langmuir isotherm) of 13.02 and 18.12 mg·kg-1, respectively. In the 90-day long-term remediation, IRS reduced NH4+-N, PO43--P, organic-N, organic-P, TN and TP in overlying water by 48.6%, 97.9%, 34.2%, 67.1%, 53.2% and 90.4%, respectively. In sediments, IRS reduced NO3--N, NH4+-N and organic-N by 98.5%, 26.5% and 6.3%, respectively. The unstable P-compounds (i.e., organic-P, Ca-bounded-P and labile-P) were effectively transferred (20.1%, 54.3% and 98.2%, respectively) into inert P-compounds (i.e., Fe-bounded-P and residual-P). Meanwhile, flux rates of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments to overlying water were reduced from 7.02 to 4.92 mg·m-2·d-1 (by 29.9%) and from 7.42 to 2.21 mg·m-2·d-1 (by 70.2%), respectively. Due to micro-electrolysis, Fe2+/Fe3+/[H] were in-situ generated from IRS and NO3--N was effectively reduced. Additionally, the generation of O2· was promoted by Fe2+/[H] and strengthened the NH4+-N, organic-N/P oxidation. Fe3+ enhanced the immobilization of PO43- (e.g., as FePO4·H2O and FenPO4(OH)3n-3). The released Fe2+/Fe3+ from IRS were finally stabilized as poorly reactive sheet silicate (PRS)-Fe and magnetite-Fe in the sediments and hardly showed side effect to sediments and water body. The developed IRS obtained advantages of high efficiency, ecologically safe and cost-effective in contaminated sediments and overlying water remediation.","Hu, Zhifeng; Deng, Shihai; Li, Desheng; Guan, Detian; Xie, Binghan; Zhang, Chao; Li, Pengyang; Yao, Hong",Sci Total Environ,,218
521751,A review of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19),2020,"OBJECTIVES: Because the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols but failure to isolate viable (infectious) virus are commonly reported, there is substantial controversy whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be transmitted through aerosols. This conundrum occurs because common air samplers can inactivate virions through their harsh collection processes. We sought to resolve the question whether viable SARS-CoV-2 can occur in aerosols using VIVAS air samplers that operate on a gentle water vapor condensation principle. METHODS: Air samples collected in the hospital room of two coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, one ready for discharge and the other newly admitted, were subjected to RT-qPCR and virus culture. The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 collected from the air and isolated in cell culture were sequenced. RESULTS: Viable SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from air samples collected 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from the material collected by the air samplers was identical to that isolated from the newly admitted patient. Estimates of viable viral concentrations ranged from 6 to 74 TCID50 units/L of air. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 produce aerosols in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures that contain viable SARS-CoV-2, and these aerosols may serve as a source of transmission of the virus.","Lednicky, John A; Lauzardo, Michael; Fan, Z Hugh; Jutla, Antarpreet; Tilly, Trevor B; Gangwar, Mayank; Usmani, Moiz; Shankar, Sripriya Nannu; Mohamed, Karim; Eiguren-Fernandez, Arantza; Stephenson, Caroline J; Alam, Md Mahbubul; Elbadry, Maha A; Loeb, Julia C; Subramaniam, Kuttichantran; Waltzek, Thomas B; Cherabuddi, Kartikeya; Morris, J Glenn; Wu, Chang-Yu",Int J Infect Dis,,218

The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students' awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps. METHODS: A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants' awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status. CONCLUSIONS: Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them. Improving the digital health literacy of university students in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental health care apps and the treatment methods and benefits of the apps, as well as involving students in the app creation process, may encourage students to use these tools for mental health care.","Drissi, Nidal; Alhmoudi, Ayat; Al Nuaimi, Hana; Alkhyeli, Mahra; Alsalami, Shaikha; Ouhbi, Sofia",JMIR Form Res,,218

Furthermore, widespread depression, anxiety, and panic related to SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2) infection affected treatment compliance and recovery. Here we report the successful treatment of a 57-year-old male with severe COVID-19, schizophrenia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's negative emotions (such as tension, panic, and anxiety), particularly his aggression and paranoia, seriously hindered treatment, leading to a deteriorating condition. Psychological counseling and supportive psychotherapy were given but the effect was weak. To improve adherence, risperidone and quetiapine fumarate were replaced by olanzapine for anti-schizophrenic treatment to reduce insomnia and anxiety side effects, associated with sedative-hypnotic drugs as well as psychological counseling. The treatment compliance of the patient improved significantly. The patient's serum alanine aminotransferase increased abnormally in the late stage of hospitalization, suggesting potential liver damage after complex medication strategies. We also monitored the changes of lymphocyte subsets and retrospectively analyzed the virus-specific antibody response. The results suggested that dynamic monitoring of lymphocyte subsets and virus-specific antibody response could facilitate disease progression evaluation and timely treatment plan adjustments. An effective psychotropic drug intervention associated with psychological counselling and psychotherapy are essential for the successful adherence, treatment, and rehabilitation of psychiatric disorders in COVID-19 patients.","Zeng, Lizhu; Zhang, Huagen; He, Yongjun; Lai, Bifa; Huang, Zhen; Lin, Li; Zhong, Zhixiong; Guo, Xuemin",Braz J Med Biol Res,,218

METHODS: In this retrospective study, an AI system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19-infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. Five hundred thirty-one CT scans from 204 COVID-19 patients were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital. The automatically segmented lung abnormalities were compared with manual segmentation of two experienced radiologists using the Dice coefficient on a randomly selected subset (30 CT scans). Two imaging biomarkers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU), to assess disease severity and disease progression. The assessments were compared with patient status of diagnosis reports and key phrases extracted from radiology reports using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Cohen’s kappa, respectively. RESULTS: The dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19-infected lung abnormalities was 0.74 ± 0.28 and 0.76 ± 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement (0.79 ± 0.25). The computed two imaging biomarkers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.97 (p value < 0.001). Very good agreement (κ = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists was achieved on evaluating the changes in infection volumes. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning–based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19-associated lung abnormalities and assess the disease severity and its progressions. KEY POINTS: • A deep learning–based AI system was able to accurately segment the infected lung regions by COVID-19 using the thick-section CT scans (Dice coefficient ≥ 0.74). • The computed imaging biomarkers were able to distinguish between the non-severe and severe COVID-19 stages (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.97). • The infection volume changes computed by the AI system were able to assess the COVID-19 progression (Cohen’s kappa 0.8220).

591507,Null and Void? Errors in Meta-analysis on Perceptual Disfluency and Recommendations to Improve Meta-analytical Reproducibility,2021-02-03,"The spike (S) protein is a trimeric, membrane-anchored fusion protein that enables coronaviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, to recognize and fuse with their hosts’ cells. While the prefusion and postfusion structures of the ectomembrane domain of the spike protein are available, the corresponding organization of its transmembrane domain is obscure. Since the transmembrane and ectomembrane domains of fusion proteins are conformationally linked, an understanding of trimerization and transmembrane conformations in the viral envelope is a prerequisite to completely understand viral fusion by the spike protein. To address this, we computationally explored the self-assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 spike transmembrane domain, starting first by determining the membrane boundaries of the spike transmembrane helix. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we found the spike protein transmembrane domain to be plastic, and the transmembrane helix to be very dynamic. The observed movements of the helix changed the membrane embedded sequence, and thereby affected the conformational ensemble of the transmembrane assembly in Martini coarse grained simulations, even flipping the super-helical handedness. Analysis of the transmembrane organization of the spike transmembrane helix provided rich insights into the interfaces utilized to self-associate. Moreover, we identified two distinct cholesterol binding regions on the transmembrane helix with different affinities for the sterol. The cholesterol binding pockets overlapped with regions involved in the initiation of transmembrane protein-protein interaction. Together, the results from our multiscale simulations not only provide insight into understudied trimeric helical interfaces in biomembranes, but also enhance our understanding of the elusive transmembrane conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spike and more generally of viral fusion proteins. These insights should enable the inclusion of the conformations of the spike protein transmembrane domain into the prevalent models of virus fusion. Significance Enveloped viruses rely on fusion proteins, called spike proteins in coronaviruses, to infect cells by fusing the virus envelope with the host cell membrane. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of the coronavirus spike protein is critically involved in successful viral fusion and other aspects of the virus lifecycle, but is poorly studied. Using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike TMD, we explore its conformational dynamics and self-assembly in different lipid environments. The results provided here improve our understanding of transmembrane stabilization of spike trimers, which are indispensable for viral infection. Exploiting this knowledge to destabilize spike trimers should facilitate design of transmembrane domain targeted viral fusion inhibitors.","Lall, Sahil; Balaram, Padmanabhan; Gosavi, Shachi; Mathew, M.K.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.07.447334,218

In this work, PPy NPs were used for the spray-coating of textiles with antimicrobial properties. The functional properties of the materials were verified, and their safety was evaluated. Two main exposure scenarios for humans were identified: inhalation of PPy NPs during spray (manufacturing) and direct skin contact with NPs-coated fabrics (use). Thus, the toxicity properties of PPy NPs and PPy-coated textiles were assessed by using in vitro models representative of the lung and the skin. The results from the materials’ characterization showed the stability of both the PPy NP suspension and the textile coating, even after washing cycles and extraction in artificial sweat. Data from an in vitro model of the air–blood barrier showed the low toxicity of these NPs, with no alteration of cell viability and functionality observed. The skin toxicity of PPy NPs and the coated textiles was assessed on a reconstructed human epidermis model following OECD 431 and 439 guidelines. PPy NPs proved to be non-corrosive at the tested conditions, as well as non-irritant after extraction in artificial sweat at two different pH conditions. The obtained data suggest that PPy NPs are safe NMs in applications for textile coating.","Bengalli, Rossella; Fiandra, Luisa; Vineis, Claudia; Sanchez-Ramirez, Diego Omar; Azoia, Nuno G.; Varesano, Alessio; Mantecca, Paride",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443822/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11081991,218
592071,Chest computed tomography (CT) scan findings in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-04-25,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop ventilator-dependent acute hypoxic respiratory failure (VDAHRF), which is associated with a higher mortality rate. We evaluated the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared them with the patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation. Characteristics of intubated patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were compared with the patients who failed to be extubated or died in the hospital. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical course of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and assess the possible predictors of the disease severity leading to VDAHRF. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study. The first 129 patients (18 years or older) with COVID-19 admitted to Monmouth Medical Center from March 1st to April 25th, 2020 were included. RESULTS: Out of 129 patients, 23.25% (n = 30) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and of those, six patients were successfully weaned from the ventilator. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed increased odds of intubation associated with hypoxemia (odds ratio 17.23, 95% CI 5.206–57.088; p < 0.0001), elevated d-dimer by one unit mg/L of FEU (odds ratio 1.515, 95% CI 5.206–57.088; p = 0.0430) and elevated ferritin by one unit ng/ml (odds ratio 1.001, 95% CI 1.000–1.001, p = 0.0051) on admission, adjusted for other covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have older age, male gender, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and obesity. The patients who were successfully weaned from the ventilator were more likely to be younger in age, and none of them had heart failure or CAD.","Mughal, Mohsin Sheraz; Kaur, Ikwinder Preet; Jaffery, Ali R.; Dalmacion, Denise L.; Wang, Chang; Koyoda, Sai; Kramer, Violet E.; Patton, Chandler D.; Weiner, Sharon; Eng, Margaret H.; Granet, Kenneth M.",Respir Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611120302705; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611120302705?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2020.106130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32896798/,218
592118,Challenging ST elevation during night shift,2021-04-03,"Sustainable use of the ocean for food and energy production is an emerging area of research in different countries around the world. This goal is pursued by the Australian aquaculture, offshore engineering and renewable energy industries, research organisations and the government through the “Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre”. To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.","Aryai, Vahid; Abbassi, Rouzbeh; Abdussamie, Nagi; Salehi, Fatemeh; Garaniya, Vikram; Asadnia, Mohsen; Baksh, Al-Amin; Penesis, Irene; Karampour, Hassan; Draper, Scott; Magee, Allan; Keng, Ang Kok; Shearer, Chris; Sivandran, Suba; Yew, Lim Kian; Cook, Denham; Underwood, Mark; Martini, Andrew; Heasman, Kevin; Abrahams, Jonathan; Wang, Chien-Ming",Process Saf Environ Prot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071474/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2020.10.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582020318103?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582020318103,218

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the COVID‐19 pandemic on suicidal ingestions reported to the California Poison Control System (CPCS). METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional comparison of suicidal ingestions reported to the CPCS during the 2020 COVID‐19 pandemic compared to suicidal ingestions reported during the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The CPCS received 19,607 call for suicidal ingestions during the study periods, of which 13,800 were in the pre‐COVID era (2018 and 2019) and 5,807 were in the COVID era. The median (IQR) number of suicidal ingestions per month decreased from 2,286 (2,240–2,364) to 1,940 (1,855–2,045; p = 0.02). This decrease was consistent and significant across all age groups except those age 70 or older. Ingestions without adverse events decreased by 101 cases/month (95% confidence interval [CI] = 136.8 to 65; p = 0.0003), minor outcomes decreased by 156.6 cases/month (95% CI = 226.2 to 87.1; p = 0.001), and moderate outcomes decreased by 96 cases/month (95% CI = 143.9 to 48.1; p = 0.00021). Major outcomes decreased from 793 (4.99%) cases in the pre‐COVID era to 315 (4.60%) cases in the COVID era (risk ratio = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.05). The number of deaths decreased by 3.7 cases/month (95% CI = –8.3 to 0.92, p = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Despite concern for worsening suicidality, calls regarding suicidal ingestions to the nation's largest poison control center decreased during the COVID era compared to the pre‐COVID era.

Efficient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as rapid and large-scale testing plays a pivotal role in patient management and decelerating disease spread. This paper reviews current technologies used to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as well as advances made for molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care testing, including recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance of the timing and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as disease prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of the various methodologies are presented, along with their application span and known performance characteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers are also covered, with an emphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or monitoring disease severity or complications. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is rapidly evolving, this review highlights topics of interest that have occurred during the pandemic and the lessons learned throughout.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from licorice on macrophage polarization. Both phenotypic and functional activities of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated by GA were assessed. Our results showed that GA obviously increased the cell surface expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCII molecules. Meanwhile, GA upregulated the expression of CCR7 and the production of TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, and NO (the markers of classically activated (M1) macrophages), whereas it downregulated the expression of MR, Ym1, and Arg1 (the markers of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage). The functional tests showed that GA dramatically enhanced the uptake of FITC-dextran and E. coli K88 by BMDMs and decreased the intracellular survival of E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium. Moreover, we demonstrated that JNK and NF-κB activation are required for GA-induced NO and M1-related cytokines production, while ERK1/2 pathway exhibits a regulatory effect via induction of IL-10. Together, these findings indicated that GA promoted polarization of M1 macrophages and enhanced its phagocytosis and bactericidal capacity. The results expanded our knowledge about the role of GA in macrophage polarization.","Mao, Yulong; Wang, Baikui; Xu, Xin; Du, Wei; Li, Weifen; Wang, Youming",Mediators Inflamm,https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/372931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26664149/,218

Antibodies to APMV have been found in patients with pneumonia suggesting a potential role as a respiratory pathogen. In addition, positive serology for APMV was associated with an increased duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay in patients with ventilator‐associated pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to assess the presence of APMV in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of critically ill patients suspected of ventilator‐associated pneumonia. The study was conducted in the intensive care unit of the Maastricht University Medical Centre. All consecutive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained between January 2005 and October 2009 from patients suspected of ventilator‐associated pneumonia were eligible for inclusion. All samples were analyzed by real‐time PCR targeting the APMV. A total of 260 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 214 patients (139 male, 75 female) were included. Bacterial ventilator‐associated pneumonia was confirmed microbiologically in 105 out of 260 (40%) suspected episodes of ventilator‐associated pneumonia (86 patients). The presence of APMV DNA could not be demonstrated in the bacterial ventilator‐associated pneumonia positive or in the bacterial ventilator‐associated pneumonia negative bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Although suspected, APMV appeared not to be present in critically ill patients suspected of ventilator‐associated pneumonia, and APMV does not seem to be a frequent cause of ventilator‐associated pneumonia.

595861,ROLE OF TELEMEDICINE NETWORK PROVIDED BY PHARMACIES TO DETECT ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION IN PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIA,2021-05-11,"Background: Pre-symptomatic transmission can be a key determinant of the effectiveness of containment and mitigation strategies for infectious diseases, particularly if interventions rely on syndromic case finding. For COVID-19, infections in the absence of apparent symptoms have been reported frequently alongside circumstantial evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. We estimated the potential contribution of pre-symptomatic cases to COVID-19 transmission. Methods: Using the probability for symptom onset on a given day inferred from the incubation period, we attributed the serial interval reported from Shenzen, China, into likely pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. We used the serial interval derived for cases isolated more than 6 days after symptom onset as the no active case finding scenario and the unrestricted serial interval as the active case finding scenario. We reported the estimate assuming no correlation between the incubation period and the serial interval alongside a range indicating alternative assumptions of positive and negative correlation. Results: We estimated that 23% (range accounting for correlation: 12 – 28%) of transmissions in Shenzen may have originated from pre-symptomatic infections. Through accelerated case isolation following symptom onset, this percentage increased to 46% (21 – 46%), implying that about 35% of secondary infections among symptomatic cases have been prevented. These results were robust to using reported incubation periods and serial intervals from other settings. Conclusions: Pre-symptomatic transmission may be essential to consider for containment and mitigation strategies for COVID-19.","Liu, Yang; Funk, Sebastian; Flasche, Stefan",Wellcome Open Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15788.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32685697/,218

However, methods that can balance sensitivity, high throughput, detection speed and automation simultaneously are still scarce. Here, we report an automatic label-free chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) for rapid SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) detection with high sensitivity and throughput. N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-ethylisoluminol and Co(2+) dual-functionalized chemiluminescent magnetic beads (dfCL-MB) were first applied to the detection of protein by a novel and simple strategy. Sulphydryl polyethylene glycol was coated on the surface of dfCL-MB so as to assemble dfCL-MB and antibody conjugated gold nanoparticles through Au-S bond. Considering the high-risk application scenarios, the immunosensor was integrated with an automatic chemiluminescence analyzer so that the whole testing procedure could be carried out automatically without manual operation. A linear correlation between CL intensities and the logarithm of NP concentration was obtained in the range of 0.1–10,000 pg/mL with a detection limit of 21 fg/mL. The whole process cost 25 min and the sample compartment can bear 24 samples simultaneously.

Many viruses dampen host protein expression and attempt to evade the host anti-viral defense machinery. Host gene expression is suppressed at several stages of host messenger RNA (mRNA) formation including selective degradation of translationally competent messenger RNAs. Besides mRNAs, host cells also express a variety of noncoding RNAs, including small RNAs, that may also be subject to inhibition upon viral infection. In this review we focused on different ways viruses antagonize coding and noncoding RNAs in the host cell to its advantage.","Herbert, Kristina M.; Nag, Anita",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v8060154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27271653/,218
599845,Risk factors of critical & mortal COVID-19 cases: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis,2020-04-23,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 may pose an occupational health risk to health care workers, but the prevalence of infections in this population is unknown. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among health care workers at a large acute care hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. We determined correlations between seroprevalence, self-reported symptoms and occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods and findings: All employees at Danderyd Hospital (n=4375) were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. 2149 employees from all hospital departments were enrolled in the study between April 14th and May 8th 2020. Study participants completed a questionnaire consisting of symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection since January 2020 and occupational exposure to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using a multiplex assay evaluated to have 99.4% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. The over-all seroprevalence among 2149 participants was 19.1% (n=410). There was no difference in age or sex between seropositive and seronegative participants. The symptoms with the strongest correlation to seroprevalence were anosmia and ageusia, with odds ratios of 28.4 (p=2.02*10^-120) and 19.2 (p=1.67*10^-99) respectively. Seroprevalence was strongly associated with patient-related work (OR 2.9, p=4.24*10^-8), covid-19 patient contact (OR 1.43, p=0.003), and occupation as assisting nurse (OR 3.67, p=2.16*10^-9). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that anosmia and ageusia should be included in screening guidance and in the recommendations of self-isolation to reduce further spread of SARS-CoV-2. The results furthermore imply an occupational health risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare worker safety and reduce transmission from health care settings to the community during the covid-19 outbreak.","Rudberg, A.-S.; Havervall, S.; Manberg, A.; Jernbom Falk, A.; Aguilera, K.; Ng, H.; Gabrielsson, L.; Salomonsson, A.-C.; Hanke, L.; Murell, B.; McInerney, G.; Olofsson, J.; Andersson, E.; Hellstrom, C.; Bayati, S.; Bergstrom, S.; Pin, E.; Sjoberg, R.; Tegel, H.; Hedhammar, M.; Phillipson, M.; Nilsson, P.; Hober, S.; Thalin, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.20137646; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.22.20137646v1?rss=1,218

The two pollutants’ emissions were decomposed into output effects, structural effects, clean production effects, and pollution abatement effects. The results showed that China’s industrial SO(2) discharge increased by 1.14 Mt during 2003–2014, and the contributions from the four effects were 23.17, − 1.88, − 3.80, and − 16.36 Mt, respectively. Likewise, NO(x) discharge changed by − 3.44 Mt over 2011–2014, and the corresponding contributions from the four effects were 2.97, − 0.62, − 1.84, and − 3.95 Mt. Thus, the output effect was mainly responsible for the growth of the two discharges. The average annual contribution rates of SO(2) and NO(x) from output were 14.33 and 5.97%, respectively, but pollution abatement technology presented the most obvious mitigating effects (− 10.11 and − 7.92%), followed by the mitigating effects of clean production technology (− 2.35 and − 3.7%), and the mitigation from the structural effect was the weakest (− 1.16 and − 1.25%, respectively), which meant pollutant reduction policies related to industrial structure adjustment should be a long-term measure for the two discharges. In addition, the sub-sectors of I20 (manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical products), I24 (manufacture of non-metallic mineral products), and I26 (smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals) were the major contributors to both discharges. Thus, these sub-sectors should be given priority consideration when designing mitigation-related measures. Last, some particular policy implications were recommended for reducing the two discharges, including that the government should seek a technological discharge reduction route.

601734,Low Albumin Levels Are Associated with Poorer Outcomes in a Case Series of COVID-19 Patients in Spain: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2020-07-24,"Telemedicine has historically been underutilized in medicine broadly, and specifically in oncology, despite the general availability of the needed infrastructure to offer it as a platform for remote care. The COVID-19 pandemic posed new risks of infection exposure and potentially life-threatening complications, particularly in patients with cancer, created a new setting for cancer care ideally suited for the rapid roll-out of telemedicine for patients with cancer who need regular follow up but in whom live visits may not be critical. In the months since the upheaval of our health care system and wider society in the United States, as well as other countries, our early experience with telemedicine has demonstrated the feasibility of telemedicine for a subset of patients with cancer, facilitated by a removal of regulatory hurdles and payment parity, at least temporarily. At the same time, however, many patients still need to return to the clinic for routine infusions of anti-cancer therapy that obviate much of the value of remote clinic visits, and many patients remain limited by access to hardware, fast and reliable internet, and technical expertise. While we need to address these shortcomings and ensure training of health care professionals in “webside manner” with patients, as well as to work to develop ways to incorporate remote care in the conduct of clinical trials, telemedicine is poised to emerge not merely as an interim solution to a transient challenge but as a valuable tool ideally suited to deliver cancer care efficiently for a subset of patients well suited to adopt this platform.","West, Howard (Jack)",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.578888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33102236/,218

603941,Prognostic value of fasting hyperglycemia in patients with COVID-19 – Diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis,2021-04-04,"During the 16th century, Mexico suffered a demographic catastrophe with few parallels in world's history. In 1519, the year of the arrival of the Spaniards, the population in Mexico was estimated to be between 15 and 30 million inhabitants. Eighty-one years later, in 1600, only two million remained. Epidemics (smallpox, measles, mumps), together with war, and famine have been considered to be the main causes of this enormous population loss. However, re-evaluation of historical data suggests that approximately 60–70% of the death toll was caused by a series of epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers of unknown origin. In order to estimate the impact of the 1576 epidemic of hemorrhagic fevers on the population we analyzed the historical record and data from the 1570 and 1580 censuses of 157 districts. The results identified several remarkable aspects of this epidemic: First, overall, the population loss for these 157 districts was 51.36%. Second, there was a clear ethnic preference of the disease, the Spanish population was minimally affected whereas native population had high mortality rate. Third, the outbreak originated in the valleys of central Mexico whence it evolved as an expansive wave. Fourth, a positive correlation between altitude and mortality in central Mexico was found. Fifth, a specific climatic sequence of events was associated with the initiation and dissemination of the hemorrhagic fevers. Although the last epidemic of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico ended in 1815, many questions remain to be answered. Perhaps the most relevant ones are whether there is a possible reemergence of the hemorrhagic fevers and how vulnerable we are to the disease.","Acuna-Soto, Rodofo; Stahle, David W.; Therrell, Matthew D.; Griffin, Richard D.; Cleaveland, Malcolm K.",FEMS Microbiol Lett,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378109704006743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15500972/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109704006743,218

The ongoing global vaccination strategy to curtail the COVID-19 juggernaut, is threatened by the rapidly spreading Variants of Concern (VOC) and other regional mutants, which are less responsive to neutralization by infection or vaccine derived antibodies. We have previously developed the hiVNT system which detects SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in sera in less than three hours. In this study, we modify the hiVNT for rapid qualitative screening of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) to multiple VOC of SARS-CoV-2, and assess the neutralizing efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on seven epidemiologically relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we show that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine can activate humoral immunity against the major SARS-CoV-2 mutants that are currently in circulation. Albeit a small sample size, we observed that one dose of vaccine was sufficient to elicit a protective humoral response in previously infected people. Using a panel of seven SARS-CoV-2 variants and a single prototype virus, our modified hiVNT would be useful for large-scale community wide testing to detect protective immunity that may confer vaccine/immune passport in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Miyakawa, Kei; Stanleyraj, Jeremiah Sundararaj; Kato, Hideaki; Yamaoka, Yutaro; Go, Hirofumi; Yajima, Satoshi; Shimada, Tomoko; Mihara, Takahiro; Goto, Atsushi; Yamanaka, Takeharu; Ryo, Akihide",J. mol. cell biol.

608569,MASSIVE STROKE IN A CRITICALLY ILL COVID-19 POSITIVE PATIENT DESPITE DUAL ANTI-PLATELET THERAPY AND VTE PROPHYLAXIS,2020-10-31,"ABSTRACT: Due to their potent immune stimulation, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) variants with tumor-homing activity are attractive as novel antitumor drugs. The promising antitumor effect of NGR-TNFα in clinical trials triggered extensive interest in developing novel tumor-homing TNFα variants in recent years. Owing to its promising antitumor effect, NGR-TNFα is usually used as a control for newly developed tumor-homing TNFα variants. In our previous works, we produced a pericyte-targeting Z-TNFα at high levels using the Escherichia coli (E. coli) M15-pQE30 system. To further compare Z-TNFα and NGR-TNFα, we attempted to express NGR-TNFα using the same system. Surprisingly, native NGR-TNFα was expressed at a low (~ 0.2 mg/L) level in E. coli M15 containing the pQE30 plasmid. However, a single nucleotide mutation of C to G, resulting in a substitution of leucine (L) with valine (V) at the start of TNFα, increased the expression of NGR-TNFα by ~ 100 times through improving transcription. In addition, the amino acid substitution showed a little impact on the receptor binding, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo antitumor effect of NGR-TNFα. As fusing NGR to the N-terminus of TNFα with a valine substitution did not reduce the protein yield, the TNFα gene with a C > G mutation might be used to prepare novel tumor-homing TNFα when the native TNFα-based variant is expressed at an extremely low level in E. coli. Notably, in addition to the mutated valine, the impact of N-terminal additional amino acids provided by pQE30 vector on the function of TNFα variant must be carefully evaluated. KEY POINTS: • A single nucleotide mutation increased the expression of NGR-TNFα by two orders. • Nucleotide mutation-induced amino acid substitution did not reduce NGR-TNFα activity.

For JEV and some other flaviviruses, oronasal transmission is described, but the mode of infection is unknown. Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells (NEC) at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs. Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines, indicating infection and replication in macrophages. Moreover, macrophages stimulated by alarmins, including interleukin-25, interleukin-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, were more permissive to the JEV infection. Altogether, our data are important to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs. IMPORTANCE JEV, a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans, has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito-waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs, which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes, leading to increased human cases. JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors. Moreover, virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium. Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three-dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus. Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages, which is favored by epithelial-cell-derived cytokines. The results are relevant to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of JEV.","García-Nicolás, Obdulio; Braun, Roman O.; Milona, Panagiota; Lewandowska, Marta; Dijkman, Ronald; Alves, Marco P.; Summerfield, Artur",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282716/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01091-18,218

Abelacimab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to factor XI and locks it in the zymogen (inactive precursor) conformation. METHODS: In this open-label, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned 412 patients who were undergoing total knee arthroplasty to receive one of three regimens of abelacimab (30 mg, 75 mg, or 150 mg) administered postoperatively in a single intravenous dose or to receive 40 mg of enoxaparin administered subcutaneously once daily. The primary efficacy outcome was venous thromboembolism, detected by mandatory venography of the leg involved in the operation or objective confirmation of symptomatic events. The principal safety outcome was a composite of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding up to 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: Venous thromboembolism occurred in 13 of 102 patients (13%) in the 30-mg abelacimab group, 5 of 99 patients (5%) in the 75-mg abelacimab group, and 4 of 98 patients (4%) in the 150-mg abelacimab group, as compared with 22 of 101 patients (22%) in the enoxaparin group. The 30-mg abelacimab regimen was noninferior to enoxaparin, and the 75-mg and 150-mg abelacimab regimens were superior to enoxaparin (P<0.001). Bleeding occurred in 2%, 2%, and none of the patients in the 30-mg, 75-mg, and 150-mg abelacimab groups, respectively, and in none of the patients in the enoxaparin group. CONCLUSIONS: This trial showed that factor XI is important for the development of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Factor XI inhibition with a single intravenous dose of abelacimab after total knee arthroplasty was effective for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and was associated with a low risk of bleeding.

Accurate identification of the women most at risk of preterm birth is key to prioritising who to transfer antenatally, but the administrative burden and pathway variation of in utero transfer in the UK are likely to compromise optimal clinical care. Women reported the impact that in utero transfers have on them, including the emotional and financial burdens of being transferred and the anxiety surrounding domestic and logistical concerns related to being away from home. The final section of the review explores new approaches to reforming the in utero transfer process, including learning from outside the UK and changing policy and guidelines. Examples of collaborative regional guidance include the recent Pan-London guidance on in utero transfers. Reforming the transfer process can also be aided through technology, such as utilising the CotFinder app. In utero transfer is an unavoidable aspect of maternity and neonatal care, and the burden will increase if preterm birth rates continue to rise in association with increased rates of multiple pregnancy, advancing maternal age, assisted reproductive technologies, and obstetric interventions. As funding and capacity pressures on health services increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic, better prioritisation and sustained multi-disciplinary commitment are essential to maximise better outcomes for babies born too soon.","Watson, Helena; McLaren, James; Carlisle, Naomi; Ratnavel, Nandiran; Watts, Tim; Zaima, Ahmed; Tribe, Rachel M.; Shennan, Andrew H.",F1000Res,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.25923.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32913633/,218
613720,Clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19,2020-12-11,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, and the main measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 were social distancing, quarantine, and self-isolation. Although these policies are effective in containing the spread of the virus, they might represent a challenge to psychological well-being, increasing levels of depressive and anxiety-related symptoms. Aims: We explored the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms during COVID-19 restrictions and associations with sociodemographic factors in a Brazilian sample. Method: Data of a total of 936 Brazilian adults (68.2% women) aged 18 to 77 years old (M = 38.95, SD = 13.91) were collected through an online survey. Results: In general, we observed a frequency of 17.36% for severe anxiety and 66.13% for severe depression symptoms, in which younger participants (18–39 years old) and women showed higher scores in anxiety and depression scales compared to older age groups. Logistic regressions showed that women were more likely to present severe symptoms of anxiety (20.4%) compared to men (10.9%), as well as respondents in the educational sector (24.3%) compared to those in the health sector (10%). Conclusions: We highlight the importance of mental health professionals in developing strategies to help younger adults to mitigate the effects of social restriction.","Ribeiro, Fabiana Silva; Santos, Flávia H.; Anunciação, Luis; Barrozo, Lucas; Landeira-Fernandez, Jesus; Leist, Anja K.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062783/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094847,218

Many African countries are burdened by fragile healthcare systems, hence, this paper emphasises the need for African policymakers to improve healthcare quality in their countries. Through a brief review of various online literatures concerning health systems strengthening in Africa, this paper focuses on the nature of healthcare in Nigeria amidst the COVID‐19 pandemic. The major stress areas include COVID‐19 testing capacity, health workforce, infection prevention and control, health information and surveillance systems, health insurance, public‐private partnerships, and governance. The COVID‐19 pandemic has amplified several challenges ravaging Africa's already fragile healthcare systems, leaving the health sectors of most African countries ill‐prepared to deal with the pandemic. If Nigeria and many other African countries had invested sufficiently in strengthening their healthcare systems prior to COVID‐19, their pandemic response efforts would have been more effective. Health systems strengthening is necessary to ensure steady progress toward universal health coverage and global health security. Through health systems strengthening, Nigeria and other African countries can greatly improve their infection prevention and control measures.","Elebesunu, Emmanuel Ebuka; Oke, Gabriel Ilerioluwa; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Nsofor, Ifeanyi McWilliams",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350637/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3296,218

The national guidelines in the UK advise non-operative treatment of fractures whenever possible to reduce the risk of surgical intervention to both patient and healthcare staff. The elderly population over 70 years are highlighted as a high-risk group in this pandemic as well as being often high risk for surgery in general due to co-morbidities. This article reviews the current literature regarding treatment of displaced olecranon fractures in the elderly. Literature search of the available databases. One randomised controlled trial has been published, comparing operative versus non-operative treatments of olecranon fractures in this age group. The study was terminated prematurely due to the high complication rate in the operative group. No difference in functional scores was recorded. Other published retrospective case series report good functional outcome scores and high satisfaction rates in the majority of patients in whom olecranon fractures were treated non-operatively. Non-operative treatment of olecranon fractures in elderly patients seems to be safe and an acceptable management option in these unprecedented times.","Abdelmalek, Amir; Crowther, Mark",Musculoskelet Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-021-00699-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511549/,218
615586,"Convalescent plasma for COVID-19: a meta-analysis, trial sequential analysis, and meta-regression",2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Travel to clinics for chronic wound management is burdensome to patients. Remote assessment and management of wounds using mobile and telehealth approaches can reduce this burden and improve patient outcomes. An essential step in wound documentation is the capture of wound images, but poor image quality can have a negative influence on the reliability of the assessment. To date, no study has investigated the quality of remotely acquired wound images and whether these are suitable for wound self-management and telemedical interpretation of wound status. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop a mobile health (mHealth) tool for the remote self-assessment of digital ulcers (DUs) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). We aimed to define and validate objective measures for assessing the image quality, evaluate whether an automated feedback feature based on real-time assessment of image quality improves the overall quality of acquired wound images, and evaluate the feasibility of deploying the mHealth tool for home-based chronic wound self-monitoring by patients with SSc. METHODS: We developed an mHealth tool composed of a wound imaging and management app, a custom color reference sticker, and a smartphone holder. We introduced 2 objective image quality parameters based on the sharpness and presence of the color checker to assess the quality of the image during acquisition and enable a quality feedback mechanism in an advanced version of the app. We randomly assigned patients with SSc and DU to the 2 device groups (basic and feedback) to self-document their DU at home over 8 weeks. The color checker detection ratio (CCDR) and color checker sharpness (CCS) were compared between the 2 groups. We evaluated the feasibility of the mHealth tool by analyzing the usability feedback from questionnaires, user behavior and timings, and the overall quality of the wound images. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were enrolled, of which 15 patients were included in the image quality analysis. The average CCDR was 0.96 (191/199) in the feedback group and 0.86 (158/183) in the basic group. The feedback group showed significantly higher (P<.001) CCS compared to the basic group. The usability questionnaire results showed that the majority of patients were satisfied with the tool, but could benefit from disease-specific adaptations. The median assessment duration was <50 seconds in all patients, indicating the mHealth tool was efficient to use and could be integrated into the daily routine of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an mHealth tool that enables patients with SSc to acquire good-quality DU images and demonstrated that it is feasible to deploy such an app in this patient group. The feedback mechanism improved the overall image quality. The introduced technical solutions consist of a further step towards reliable and trustworthy digital health for home-based self-management of wounds.","Zhang, Jia; Mihai, Carina; Tüshaus, Laura; Scebba, Gaetano; Distler, Oliver; Karlen, Walter",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328440/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26149,218

To best prepare doctors for providing optimal care in disaster situations, specific education and training should start at the medical school level. This study containes an online survey among German medical schools to evaluate the status quo of teaching disaster medicine and to reveal potential obstacles. Methods: The dean’s offices of 36 German medical schools were contacted from April 2016 to May 2017. Via an e-mail link, recipients could anonymously and voluntarily access an online questionnaire (74 items, 42 with a four-point “Likert-like” scale, 12 yes/no questions and 20 with listed items to choose from). The answers were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 25 medical schools participated in the survey. Twenty respondents were in favor of expanding disaster medicine teaching at their institutions. Incorporating single topics ranging from triage (n=21) to accidents involving radioactive materials (n=4) into the curriculum varied widely. Only two schools had established a teaching coordinator for disaster medicine and only one e-learning course had been established. Twenty-one respondents regarded funding issues and 18 regarded organizational matters to be major hurdles in the future. Conclusion: Though most faculty representatives indicated that they favor expanding and implementing disaster medicine education, German medical schools still have a lot of room for enhancement in this field. The incorporation of e-learning tools could facilitate the expansion of disaster medicine teaching while simultaneously addressing the expressed concerns of the survey’s participants and guarantee nationwide standardization.","Kasselmann, Nils; Willy, Christian; Domres, Bernd D.; Wunderlich, Robert; Back, David A.",GMS J Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056068/,218

METHODS: Muslim people with T1DM were surveyed in 13 countries between June and August 2020, shortly after the end of Ramadan (23rd April–23rd May 2020) using a simple questionnaire. RESULTS: 71.1% of muslims with T1DM fasted during Ramadan. Concerns about COVID-19 were higher in individuals ≥18 years (p = 0.002). The number of participants who decided not to fast plus those who received Ramadan-focused education were significantly higher in the ≥18-year group (p < 0.05). Hypoglycemia (60.7%) as well as hyperglycemia (44.8%) was major complications of fasting during Ramadan in both groups irrespective of age. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic had minor impact on the decision to fast Ramadan in T1DM cohort. This was higher in the age group of ≥18 years compared to those <18 years group. Only regional differences were noted for fasting attitude and behavior among T1DM groups. This survey highlights the need for Ramadan focused diabetes education to improve glucose control and prevent complications during fasting.","Hassanein, Mohamed; Alamoudi, Reem M.; Kallash, Majd-Aldeen; Aljohani, Naji J.; Alfadhli, Eman M.; Tony, Lobna El; Khogeer, Ghofran S.; Alfadhly, Abdulaziz F.; Khater, Ahmed ElMamoon; Ahmedani, Muhammad Yakoob; Buyukbese, Mehmet Akif; Shaltout, Inass; Belkhadir, Jamal; Hafidh, Khadija; Chowdhury, Tahseen A.; Hussein, Zanariah; Elbarbary, Nancy Samir",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168822720308834; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168822720308834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321160/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108626,218

This study aimed to investigate if enhanced hygienic measures, including the systematic use of personal protective equipment (PPE), determined a decrease in HAI during the recent COVID-19 outbreak in “COVID-free” neurological units. METHODS: Patients hospitalized in neurology and stroke units of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital in Rome from March 8, 2020 and discharged prior to May 31, 2020 were included in the study and compared with patients hospitalized during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 319 patients were included in the study (n = 103 in 2020, n = 216 in 2019). Among patients hospitalized in 2019, the incidence of HAIs was 31.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25–0.38), compared with 23.3% (95% CI: 0.15–0.32) in 2020 (p = 0.12). Multivariable logistic regression showed that hospitalization during 2020 was independently associated with a lower risk of HAIs (odds ratio: 0.34, 95% CI:0.16–0.71, p = 0.004). Poisson regression models showed that hospitalization during 2020 was also independently associated with both a lower number of HAIs (relative risk [RR]: 0.56, 95% CI:0.38–0.81, p = 0.01) and a lower number of prescribed antibiotics per patient (RR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49–0.87, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our study design provides evidence regarding the impact of stricter hygienic measures, such as increased PPE use, on HAIs. Larger studies are needed to support the extension of preventive measures even after the COVID-19 outbreak in order to limit the occurrence of HAIs.","Cerulli Irelli, Emanuele; Orlando, Biagio; Cocchi, Enrico; Morano, Alessandra; Fattapposta, Francesco; Di Piero, Vittorio; Toni, Danilo; Ciardi, Maria R.; Giallonardo, Anna T.; Fabbrini, Giovanni; Berardelli, Alfredo; Di Bonaventura, Carlo",J Neurol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X20304482; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X20304482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892033/,218

620357,"Dual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination was associated with lower short-term risks of all-cause and acute respiratory hospitalizations among the elderly in Shenzhen, China: a retrospective cohort study",2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prioritisation of healthcare quality across the six domains of efficiency, safety, patient-centredness, effectiveness, timeliness and accessibility has given rise to accelerated change both in the uptake of initiatives and the realisation of their outcomes to meet external targets. Whilst a multitude of change management methodologies exist, their application in complex healthcare contexts remains unclear. Our review sought to establish the methodologies applied, and the nature and effectiveness of their application in the context of healthcare. METHODS: A systematic review and narrative synthesis was undertaken. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts followed by the full-text articles that were potentially relevant against the inclusion criteria. An appraisal of methodological and reporting quality of the included studies was also conducted by two further reviewers. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies were included that reported the use of 12 change management methodologies in healthcare contexts across 10 countries. The most commonly applied methodologies were Kotter’s Model (19 studies) and Lewin’s Model (11 studies). Change management methodologies were applied in projects at local ward or unit level (14), institutional level (12) and system or multi-system (6) levels. The remainder of the studies provided commentary on the success of change efforts that had not utilised a change methodology with reference to change management approaches. CONCLUSION: Change management methodologies were often used as guiding principle to underpin a change in complex healthcare contexts. The lack of prescription application of the change management methodologies was identified. Change management methodologies were valued for providing guiding principles for change that are well suited to enable methodologies to be applied in the context of complex and unique healthcare contexts, and to be used in synergy with implementation and improvement methodologies.","Harrison, Reema; Fischer, Sarah; Walpola, Ramesh L; Chauhan, Ashfaq; Babalola, Temitope; Mears, Stephen; Le-Dao, Huong",J Healthc Leadersh,https://doi.org/10.2147/jhl.s289176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737854/,218

Methods: An online, cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21, 2020 to January 7, 2021. The outcome variables were HCWs' knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage, and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. Results: A total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 themselves. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it. Despite this, 66.7% of HCWs were not registered to receive the vaccine. HCWs' most common source of information about the new variant was social media platforms (67%), and this subgroup was significantly more worried about travelling. Nurses were more worried than physicians (P=0.001); additionally, those who had not travelled in the previous 3 months and those who had not received or registered for the COVID-19 vaccine were also significantly more worried (P = 0.037 and P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Most HCWs were aware of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and expressed substantial travel worries. Increased worry levels were found among HCWs who used social media as their main source of information, those with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and those with higher GAD-7 scores. Utilization of official social media platforms could improve accurate information dissemination among HCWs regarding the pandemic's evolving mutations.

Serological tests will improve our understanding of the infection and immunity in this population, unless the tests give false positive results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of SARS-Cov-2 serological assays with samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases collected before April 2019, thus defined as negative. Methods: Samples from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=10), rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=47) with or without rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP2) and RF +/- systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n=10), were tested with 17 commercially available lateral flow assays (LFA), two ELISA kits and one in-house developed multiplex bead-based assay. Results: Six LFA and the in-house IgG assay gave the correct negative results for all samples. However, the majority of assays (n=13), gave false positive signal with samples from patients with RA and SLE. This was most notable in RF positive RA samples. MS samples did not give any false positive in any of the assays. Conclusion: The majority of the verified serological assays were sensitive to interfering antibodies in samples from patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and therefore may have poor specificity in this context. For these patients, the risk of false positivity should be considered when interpreting results of the SARS-CoV-2 serological assays.","Kharlamova, N.; Dunn, N.; Bedri, S.

The spreading rate of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike-protein (S-protein) interacts with the human cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. However, the molecular mechanism of pathological mutations of S-protein is still unclear. In this perspective, we investigated the impact of mutations in the S-protein and their interaction with the ACE2 receptor for SAR-CoV-2 viral infection. We examined the stability of pathological nonsynonymous mutations in the S-protein, and the binding behavior of the ACE2 receptor with the S-protein upon nonsynonymous mutations using the molecular docking and MM_GBSA approaches. Using the extensive bioinformatics pipeline, we screened the destabilizing (L8V, L8W, L18F, Y145H, M153T, F157S, G476S, L611F, A879S, C1247F, and C1254F) and stabilizing (H49Y, S50L, N501Y, D614G, A845V, and P1143L) nonsynonymous mutations in the S-protein. The docking and binding free energy (ddG) scores revealed that the stabilizing nonsynonymous mutations show increased interaction between the S-protein and the ACE2 receptor compared to native and destabilizing S-proteins and that they may have been responsible for the virulent high level. Further, the molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) approach reveals the structural transition of mutants (N501Y and D614G) S-protein. These insights might help researchers to understand the pathological mechanisms of the S-protein and provide clues regarding mutations in viral infection and disease propagation. Further, it helps researchers to develop an efficient treatment approach against this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Aljindan, Reem Y.; Al-Subaie, Abeer M.; Al-Ohali, Ahoud I.; Kumar D, Thirumal; Doss C, George Priya; Kamaraj, Balu",Comput Biol Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104654; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521004480; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521004480?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346317/,218

Incomplete datasets have missing values in uncertain dimensions, so it is difficult to obtain useful information with traditional data mining methods on complete data. BitMap Index Guided Algorithm (BIG) is a good choice for solving this problem. However, it is even harder to find top-k dominance objects on incomplete big data. When the dataset is too large, the requirements for the feasibility and performance of the algorithm will become very high. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to apply MapReduce on the whole process with a pruning strategy, called Efficient Hadoop BitMap Index Guided Algorithm (EHBIG). This algorithm can realize TKD query on incomplete datasets through BitMap Index and use MapReduce architecture to make TKD query possible on large datasets. By using the pruning strategy, the runtime and memory usage are greatly reduced. What’s more, we also proposed an improved version of EHBIG (denoted as IEHBIG) which optimizes the whole algorithm flow. Our in-depth work in this article culminates with some experimental results that clearly show that our proposed algorithm can perform well on TKD query in an incomplete large dataset and shows great performance in a Hadoop computing cluster.","Wu, Jimmy Ming-Tai; Wei, Min; Wu, Mu-En; Tayeb, Shahab",J Supercomput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-021-04005-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421217/,218

We argue that the consequences of this one-size-fits-all order will be differentially distributed among economic groups. In this paper, we examine social distance behavior changes for lower income populations. We conduct a comparative analysis of responses between lower-income and upper-income groups and assess their relative exposure to COVID-19 risks. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences analysis of 3140 counties, we find social distance policy effect on the lower-income group is smaller than that of the upper-income group, by as much as 46% to 54%. Our explorations of the mechanisms behind the disparate effects suggest that for the work-related trips the stay-at-home orders do not significantly reduce low income work trips and this result is statistically significant. That is, the share of essential business defined by stay-at-home orders is significantly negatively correlated with income at county level. In the non-work-related trips, we find that both the lower-income and upper-income groups reduced visits to retail, recreation, grocery, and pharmacy visits after the stay-at-home order, with the upper-income group reducing trips more compared to lower-income group.","Lou, Jiehong; Shen, Xingchi; Niemeier, Deb",J Transp Geogr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519126/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102894; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692320309716; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692320309716,218

We investigate the effects of planning horizons on epidemic dynamics. We developed an epidemiological agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with the individuals’ payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the epidemic peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual’s perceived risk of infection.","Nardin, Luis G.; Miller, Craig R.; Ridenhour, Benjamin J.; Krone, Stephen M.; Joyce, Paul; Baumgaertner, Bert O.",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2678; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27843714/,218
624990,Short Communication: Coronavirus Disease 19 Among People Living with HIV in Western India: An Observational Cohort Study,2021,"The aim of this paper is to present a brief historical analysis of the Australian mining industry and the development of its social licence to operate. Commencing with the discovery of coal in the 18th century, to gold and copper and base metals in the 19th century, to the world class iron ore, mineral sands and diamond mines of the 20th century to the current day, the paper will attempt to determine how and why an industry, formerly well-respected by the public, is considered to be a pariah in the eyes of many sections of society. The theory of social licence and its use in the Australian minerals industry is briefly described and a working definition of “an honest, transparent engagement resulting in a beneficial outcome to all parties before, during and after mining” is adopted throughout the paper. Case studies illustrating examples where mining operations were, and continue to be sustained for decades, provide clear evidence of having a social licence to operate. On the other hand, examples are provided illustrating where poor environmental management practices, tailings dam failures, disputes with landowners, and/or government intervention have resulted in the loss of the social licence and early, unplanned closure. The paradox is that despite the industry's acknowledged contribution to the Australian economy, particularly in times of global ructions such as the GFC and the current coronavirus pandemic, there is considerable antipathy towards the industry by the public. Furthermore, the Australian mining industry's approach to environmental management and sustainable development is regularly used as a model for emerging mining economies. The industry has pioneered remediation and rehabilitation on challenging sites, including prime agricultural land, forests, riverine and beach environments. Successes are rarely acknowledged however but failures are highlighted, by the media, opponents of the industry, and governments. Clearly, the business as usual approach is not enough. Mining industry leaders need to take strong measures to ensure the industry is sustainable and maintains its social licence including eliminating all fatalities and serious injuries, ensuring the safety and stability of tailings storage facilities, accelerating progressive rehabilitation particularly on open cut coal mines, successfully closing mines, and lifting the environmental performance of all mines, not just a few.","Laurence, David",Extr Ind Soc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X20301799; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exis.2020.05.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214790X20301799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837929/,218

Method: Serum N protein in SARSCOV2 infected patients and non SARSCOV2 infected population was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) double antibody sandwich assay. Colloidal gold immunochromatography assay is used to detect serum N protein antibodies in the above population. Results: 50 cases of SARSCoV2 nucleic acid positive and SARSCoV2 antibody negative patients had a serum N protein positive rate of 76%, including 2% with a concentration of 10.00~49.99 pg / mL, 8% with a concentration of 50.00~99.99 pg / mL, 22% with a concentration of 100.00 ~299.99 pg/mL, and 44% with a concentration [≥]300.00 pg / mL. 37 samples of patients with serum SARSCoV2 antibody positive after infection had a serum SARSCoV2 N protein positive rate of 2.7%, of which 2.7% had the concentration of 10.00~49.99 pg / mL and 0% had the concentration of 50.00~99.99 pg / mL, 100.00 ~299.99 pg / mL, and [≥]300.00 pg / mL.

COVID19 is an interesting case study because there have been very different outcomes in different localities. These variations are best studied after the fact if precision is the goal; while a pandemic is still unfolding less precise analysis is of value in attempting to guide localities to learn lessons of those that preceded them. Methods: I examine two factors that could differentiate strategy: asymptomatic spread and the risks of basing strategy on untested claims, such as potential protective value of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine. Results: Differences in disease progression as well as the possibility of alternative strategies to prevent COVID-19 from entering the runaway phase or damping it down later can be elucidated by a study of asymptomatic infection. An early study to demonstrate not only what fraction are asymptomatic but how contagious they are would have informed policy on nonpharmaceutical interventions but could still be of value to understand containment during vaccine roll out. Conclusions: When a COVID-19 outbreak is at a level that makes accurate trace-and test possible, investigation of asymptomatic transmission is viable and should be attempted to enhance understanding of spread and variability in the disease as well as policy options for slowing the spread. Understanding mild cases could shed light on the disease in the longer term, including whether vaccines prevent contagiousness.","Machanick, Philip",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046170/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23524.3,218

Yet estimates of spared greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from consuming wild meat, rather than protein from the livestock sector, have not been quantified. We show that a mean per capita wild meat consumption of 41.7 kg yr(−1) for a population of ~ 150,000 residents at 49 Amazonian and Afrotropical forest sites can spare ~ 71 MtCO(2)-eq annually under a bovine beef substitution scenario, but only ~ 3 MtCO(2)-eq yr(−1) if this demand is replaced by poultry. Wild meat offtake by these communities could generate US$3M or US$185K in carbon credit revenues under an optimistic scenario (full compliance with the Paris Agreement by 2030; based on a carbon price of US$50/tCO(2)-eq) and US$1M or US$77K under a conservative scenario (conservative carbon price of US$20.81/tCO(2)-eq), representing considerable incentives for forest conservation and potential revenues for local communities. However, the wild animal protein consumption of ~ 43% of all consumers in our sample was below the annual minimum per capita rate required to prevent human malnutrition.

In this study, we aimed to develop a noninvasive ARDS monitoring protocol based on traditional quantitative and radiomics approaches from chest CT. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 31, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Quantitative and radiomics data were extracted from automatically segmented regions of interest (ROIs) of infection regions in the lungs. ARDS existence was measured by Pa02/Fi02 <300 in artery blood samples. Three different models were constructed by using the traditional quantitative imaging metrics, radiomics features and their combinations, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the effectiveness of the models. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to test the clinical value of the proposed model. Results: The proposed models were constructed using 352 CT images from 86 patients. The median age was 49, and the male proportion was 61.9%. The training dataset and the validation dataset were generated by randomly sampling the patients with a 2:1 ratio. Chi-squared test showed that there was no significant difference in baseline of the enrolled patients between the training and validation datasets. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of the traditional quantitative model, radiomics model and combined model in the validation dataset was 0.91, 0.91 and 0.94, respectively. Accordingly, the sensitivities were 0.55, 0.82 and 0.58, while the specificities were 0.97, 0.86 and 0.98. The DCA curve showed that when threshold probability for a doctor or patients is within a range of 0 to 0.83, the combined model adds more net benefit than “treat all” or “treat none” strategies, while the traditional quantitative model and radiomics model could add benefit in all threshold probability. Conclusions: It is feasible to monitor ARDS from CT images using radiomics or traditional quantitative analysis in COVID-19. The radiomics model seems to be the most practical one for possible clinical use. Multi-center validation with a larger number of samples is recommended in the future.","Chen, Yuntian; Wang, Yi; Zhang, Yuwei; Zhang, Na; Zhao, Shuang; Zeng, Hanjiang; Deng, Wen; Huang, Zixing; Liu, Sanyuan; Song, Bin",Int J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.48432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714080/,218

Various mRNA applications have reached major milestones at high speed in the immuno-oncology field. This can be attributed to the knowledge that mRNA is one of nature’s core building blocks carrying important information and can be considered as a powerful vector for delivery of therapeutic proteins to the patient. For a long time, the major focus in the use of in vitro transcribed mRNA was on development of cancer vaccines, using mRNA encoding tumor antigens to modify dendritic cells ex vivo. However, the versatility of mRNA and its many advantages have paved the path beyond this application. In addition, due to smart design of both the structural properties of the mRNA molecule as well as pharmaceutical formulations that improve its in vivo stability and selective targeting, the therapeutic potential of mRNA can be considered as endless. As a consequence, many novel immunotherapeutic strategies focus on the use of mRNA beyond its use as the source of tumor antigens. This review aims to summarize the state-of-the-art on these applications and to provide a rationale for their clinical application.","Van Hoecke, Lien; Verbeke, Rein; Dewitte, Heleen; Lentacker, Ine; Vermaelen, Karim; Breckpot, Karine; Van Lint, Sandra",Mol Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12943-021-01329-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658037/,218
629807,First do no harm—beware the risk of therapeutic plasma exchange in severe COVID-19,2020-06-18,"Inflammatory responses to an infection from a zoonotic pathogen, such as avian influenza viruses, hantaviruses and some coronaviruses, are distinctly different in their natural reservoir versus human host. While not as well studied in the natural reservoirs, the pro-inflammatory response and viral replication appear controlled and show no obvious pathology. In contrast, infection in humans results in an initial high viral load marked by an aggressive pro-inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm. The key difference in the course of the infection between the reservoir and human host is the inflammatory response. In this investigation, we apply a simple two-component differential equation model for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses and a detailed mathematical analysis to identify specific regions in parameter space for single stable endemic equilibrium, bistability or periodic solutions. The extensions of the deterministic model to two stochastic models account for variability in responses seen at the cell (local) or tissue (global) levels. Numerical solutions of the stochastic models exhibit outcomes that are typical of a chronic infection in the natural reservoir or a cytokine storm in human infection. In the chronic infection, occasional flare-ups between high and low responses occur when model parameters are in a region of bistability or periodic solutions. The cytokine storm with a vigorous pro-inflammatory response and less vigorous anti-inflammatory response occurs in the parameter region for a single stable endemic equilibrium with a strong pro-inflammatory response. The results of the model analyses and the simulations are interpreted in terms of the functional role of the cytokines and the inflammatory responses seen in infection of the natural reservoir or of the human host.","Zhang, Wenjing; Jang, Sophia; Jonsson, Colleen B; Allen, Linda J S",Math Med Biol,https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqy009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29961899/,218

There is the urgent need of more studies to identify the novel drug targets and the drug candidates against it to handle the situation. MAIN BODY: To virtually screen various drugs against SARS-CoV-2, the scientists need the detail information about the various drug targets identified till date. The present review provides the information about almost all the drug targets, including structural and non-structural proteins of virus as well as host cell surface receptors, that can be used for virtual screening of drugs. Moreover, this review also focuses on the different network analysis tools that have been used for the identification of new drug targets and candidate repurposable drugs against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: This review provides important insights of various drug targets and the network analysis tools to young bioinformaticians and will help in creating pace to the drug repurposing strategy for COVID-19 disease.","Singh, Rahul Kunwar; Yadav, Brijesh Singh; Mohapatra, Tribhuvan Mohan",Bull Natl Res Cent,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42269-020-00444-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230386/,218

The direct impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on COVID-19 infection outcome remains to be elucidated. However, the coincidence of common risk factors for OSA and severe COVID-19 suggests that patients with OSA receiving positive airway pressure therapy may have an advantage relative to those untreated when confronted with a COVID-19 infection. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial reduction of sleep medicine services, and the long-term consequences may be considerable.

Moreover, there were initial reports of poor surgical outcomes in patients who underwent surgery and were found to be positive for COVID-19 infection in post-operative period. In this study, we have evaluated the short-term outcomes of head and neck oncology patients operated in our institute following a strict screening protocol and conducting COVID-19 testing by Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction once the test was available. 68 patients operated between 1st April and 30th September, 2020 (COVID-19 era, study group) were compared with 59 patients operated during 1st October, 2019 to 31st March 2020 (Non COVID-19 era, control group). The comparison between the groups was done by measuring 30 days complication rate as defined by Dindo–Clavien classification. 10.3% of patients developed complications in study group as compared to 8.5% of patients in control group which was statistically non-significant (p = 0.7). Importantly, none of the patients developed any sign or symptom suggestive of COVID-19 infection in post-operative period in study group. Head and neck oncology related cancer procedures including complex reconstruction can safely be performed during COVID-19 era by proper screening and pre-operative testing for COVID-19. We also suggest use of N95 masks and face shields as bare minimum in order to ensure the safety of health care workers even after a negative COVID-19 report.","Jain, Sumeet; Gupta, Sumit; Singh, Tejinder Pal; Chhabra, Kavita; Jain, Richa; Sohi, Akashdeep Singh; Chhina, Deepender Kaur; Brar, Gurpreet Singh; Mittal, Rajinder Kumar; Gautam, Parshotam Lal",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437685/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12070-020-02334-6,218

The aim of this study was to determine the etiologies and to analyze the maternal or fetal complications of fever in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective single center study including all patients who consulted for fever above 38 °C during pregnancy in the gynecological emergency ward from August 2016 to July 2017. RESULTS: A total of 100 pregnant women who consulted for fever were included. The etiologies were common viral infections (37%), influenza (21%), pyelonephritis (11%), viral gastroenteritis (6%), chorioamnionitis (5%), other (5%). The etiology was unknown for 15%. Fever was confirmed during consultation in 45/100 patients (45%). Among patients with confirmed fever, 21/45 (47%) were hospitalized with a median stay of 3 days [IQR 2-4] and 10/45(22%) developed fetal or maternal complications. Probabilistic antibiotics were delivered for 34/45, 76% patients. Only 14/45, 31% had confirmed bacterial infections. Of the 32 patients with confirmed fever who had no etiologic diagnosis at the initial work-up in the emergency room, 19/32, 59% received presumptive treatment with amoxicillin against Listeria monocytogenes. None had confirmed listeriosis, and all were probably common viral infections. Among all patients, the complications rate was 13% and 22% in the subgroup with fever confirmed at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies the main etiologies and complications of fever during pregnancy. A challenge is to reduce excessive antibiotic use by improving rapid diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections. Prospective studies are needed to target patients at risk of complications in an optimal way and to study new management strategies.","Egloff, C.; Sibiude, J.; Couffignal, C.; Mandelbrot, L.; Picone, O.",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468784720302567; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468784720302567?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853830/,218

The authors describe early studies and interim standardized assessment reports to highlight effects of educational disruption and present critical questions for neuropsychologists. METHOD A summary of pre-pandemic and interim literature was compiled, including analyses of national and local assessment data and preliminary studies on academic gains related to remote learning, educational and school services disruption, chronic absenteeism, and child and adolescent mental and physical health during 2020-2021. Ten major themes were identified in the early reports on impacts of educational disruption. RESULTS Preliminary information indicates prolonged educational disruption has resulted in attenuated learning gains, most remarkably for those already at risk for educational disparities: students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, and students from low-income households. There have also been increased mental and physical health challenges for some youth during the pandemic. Other literature highlights challenges such as diagnosis of learning disabilities, reliance on normative data and development of academic recovery programs. CONCLUSION The effects of prolonged educational disruption and psychological stressors on learning and mental health should be considered in the neuropsychological evaluation of children and adolescents, especially marginalized students. Normative data collected prior to the pandemic may be insufficient for interpretation of scores, and evaluation and treatment may be delayed due to backlog and increased demand.

In professional practice, a facilitator structures, regulates, and motivates those behaviors of participants that help maintain productivity and creativity during a brainstorm. Emerging technologies, such as social robots, are being developed to support or even automate the facilitator’s role. However, little is known about whether and how brainstorming with a social robot influences productivity. To take a first look, we conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 54) that explored 1) whether brainstorming with a Wizard-of-Oz operated robot facilitator, compared to with a human facilitator, influences productivity; and 2) whether any effects on productivity might be explained by the robot’s negative effects on social anxiety and evaluation apprehension. The results showed no evidence for an effect of brainstorming with a teleoperated robot facilitator, compared to brainstorming directly with a human facilitator, on productivity. Although the results did suggest that overall, social anxiety caused evaluation apprehension, and evaluation apprehension negatively affected productivity, there was no effect of brainstorming with a robot facilitator on this relationship. Herewith, the present study contributes to an emerging body of work on the efficacy and mechanisms of the facilitation of creative work by social robots.","Geerts, Julia; de Wit, Jan; de Rooij, Alwin",Front Robot AI,https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.657291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34250026/,218

The current study aimed to (i) compare the effects of phonologically versus semantically focussed naming treatment and (ii) examine biographical and neuropsychological baseline factors predictive of response to each treatment. One hundred and four individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia underwent 3 weeks of phonologically focussed treatment and 3 weeks of semantically focussed treatment in an unblinded cross-over design. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compare the effects of treatment type on proportional change in correct naming across groups. Correlational analysis and stepwise regression models were used to examine biographical and neuropsychological predictors of response to phonological and semantic treatment across all participants. Last, chi-square tests were used to explore the association between treatment response and phonological and semantic deficit profiles. Semantically focussed treatment was found to be more effective at the group-level, independently of treatment order (P = 0.041). Overall, milder speech and language impairment predicted good response to semantic treatment (r range: 0.256–0.373) across neuropsychological tasks. The Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Spontaneous Speech score emerged as the strongest predictor of semantic treatment response (R(2) = 0.188). Severity of stroke symptoms emerged as the strongest predictor of phonological treatment response (R(2) = 0.103). Participants who showed a good response to semantic treatment were more likely to present with fluent speech compared to poor responders (P = 0.005), whereas participants who showed a good response to phonological treatment were more likely to present with apraxia of speech (P = 0.020). These results suggest that semantic treatment may be more beneficial to the improvement of naming performance in aphasia than phonological treatment, at the group-level. In terms of personalized predictors, participants with relatively mild impairments and fluent speech responded better to semantic treatment, while phonological treatment benefitted participants with more severe impairments and apraxia of speech.","Kristinsson, Sigfus; Basilakos, Alexandra; Elm, Jordan; Spell, Leigh Ann; Bonilha, Leonardo; Rorden, Chris; den Ouden, Dirk B; Cassarly, Christy; Sen, Souvik; Hillis, Argye; Hickok, Gregory; Fridriksson, Julius",Brain Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34423302/; https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcab174,218

The detection and treatment of TB at an early stage are critical for preventing the disease and decreasing the risk of mortality and transmission of it to others. Nowadays, as the most common medical imaging technique, chest radiography (CXR) is useful for determining thoracic diseases. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems are also crucial mechanisms to provide more reliable, efficient, and systematic approaches with accelerating the decision-making process of clinicians. In this study, we propose voting and preprocessing variations-based ensemble CNN model for TB detection. We utilize 40 different variations in fine-tuned CNN models based on InceptionV3 and Xception by also using CLAHE (contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization) preprocessing technique and 10 different image transformations for data augmentation types. After analyzing all these combination schemes, three or five best classifier models are selected as base learners for voting operations. We apply the Bayesian optimization-based weighted voting and the average of probabilities as a combination rule in soft voting methods on two TB CXR image datasets to get better results in various numbers of models. The computational results indicate that the proposed method achieves 97.500% and 97.699% accuracy rates on Montgomery and Shenzhen datasets, respectively. Furthermore, our method outperforms state-of-the-art results for the two TB detection datasets in terms of accuracy rate.","Tasci, Erdal; Uluturk, Caner; Ugur, Aybars",Neural Comput Appl,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06177-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34121816/,218

A few cases of concurrent myocarditis have been reported, but the extent of cardiac complications with the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is still largely unknown. CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old man, suspected to have COVID-19 due to a new-onset cough, shortness of breath, and hypoxia, was referred to Cardiology with sudden symptomatic bradycardia. Initial rhythm analysis revealed Type 2 atrioventricular block (Mobitz II). On arrival at the coronary care unit, he was found to be in complete heart block (Type 3). Routine blood tests showed normal electrolytes and renal function, and no elevation in troponin-I levels. Echocardiography showed mild impairment in left ventricular systolic function, with no regional wall motion abnormalities or valvular lesions. He then developed high-degree AV block lasting 6.2 s, prompting the need for an urgent permanent pacemaker implantation. DISCUSSION: Just over a third of patients with myocarditis reportedly develop a rise in cardiac troponin. Clinically suspected myocarditis can occur in the absence of a troponin rise and rarely can cause high-grade bradyarrhythmias. Myocarditis and non-specific cardiac arrhythmias have been reported in a few cases of COVID-19, but this is the first reported case of a high-grade atrioventricular conduction block with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ashok, Vishnu; Loke, Wei Ian",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089060/,218

Whether SARS-CoV-2 can trigger an autoimmune reaction against platelets and red blood cells remains unclear. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia associated with severe immune thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia. An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of both dyspnea and diffuse mucocutaneous bleeding. Exams revealed hemolytic anemia (HA), severe immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and bilateral pneumonia. Molecular testing confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Thrombocytopenia did not respond to first-line treatment with immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and platelet transfusions. Addition to therapy of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist, eltrombopag, resulted in full recovery. COVID-19 can be associated with ITP and HA.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: The case of an 83-year-old woman with COVID-19 pneumonia associated with two severe blood diseases that cause platelet and red cell destruction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We do not know exactly whether this virus can stimulate our immune system to react against platelets and red blood cells. Herein, we report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia associated with two severe blood diseases, immune thrombocytopenia, which causes platelet destruction, and hemolytic anemia, which causes red cell destruction. An 83-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of both difficulty in breathing and diffuse bleeding in mucosae and skin. Exams revealed hemolytic anemia, severe immune thrombocytopenia, and pneumonia in both lungs. Molecular testing confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The first treatment with immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and platelet transfusions was not enough to cure thrombocytopenia; the addition of eltrombopag which acts on the thrombopoietin receptor agonist resulted in full recovery.

640188,A pilot double‐blind safety and feasibility randomized controlled trial of high‐dose intravenous zinc in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients,2021-03-09,"According to the latest reports, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was successfully isolated from the excreta (stool and urine) of COVID-19 patients, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted through excreta contaminated water. As pit latrines and the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer were common in rural China, we surveyed 27 villages of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and found that pit latrines could be a potential source of SARS-CoV-2 water pollution. Recently, bats have been widely recognized as the source of SARS-CoV-2. There were many possible intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, including pangolin, snake, bird and fish, but which one was still not clear exactly. Here, we proposed a hypothesis to illustrate the mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 might spread from the excreta of infected humans in pit latrines to potential animal hosts, thus becoming a sustainable source of infection in rural China. Therefore, we believe that abolishing pit latrines and banning the use of untreated excreta as fertilizer can improve the local living environment and effectively prevent COVID-19 and other potential waterborne diseases that could emanate from the excreta of infected persons. Although this study focused on rural areas in China, the results could also be applied to low-income countries, especially in Africa.","Liu, Lilong; Hu, Junyi; Hou, Yaxin; Tao, Zhen; Chen, Zhaohui; Chen, Ke",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143283; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720368145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162149/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720368145?v=s5,218

This study aimed to characterize the mental health of third-year medical students starting clinical clerkships in the midst of a pandemic by assessing symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as risk, coping, and protective factors associated with psychological outcomes. Of 147 third-year medical students at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, 110 (75%) participated in this prospective survey-based study with 108 included in the final analysis. 43 (39.8%) respondents screened positive for symptoms of either MDD, GAD, or PTSD. Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater overall symptom severity was associated with more avoidant coping, more traumatic events witnessed, poorer student and leisure functioning, lower trait emotional stability, and lower social support. Worries related to COVID-19 did not significantly influence outcome variables. To better understand the role of the pandemic on psychological outcomes in third-year medical students, additional research should focus on the trajectory of these outcomes over the year during the coronavirus pandemic.

More generally, it has the potential to elucidate the complete human virome, including viruses that cause no overt symptoms of disease, but may have unrecognized immunological or developmental consequences. We have used NGS to identify RNA viruses in the blood of 195 patients with UAFI and compared them with those found in 328 apparently healthy (i.e., no overt signs of illness) control individuals, all from communities in southeastern Nigeria. Among UAFI patients, we identified the presence of nucleic acids from several well-characterized pathogenic viruses, such as HIV-1, hepatitis, and Lassa virus. In our cohort of healthy individuals, however, we detected the nucleic acids of two novel rhabdoviruses. These viruses, which we call Ekpoma virus-1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus-2 (EKV-2), are highly divergent, with little identity to each other or other known viruses. The most closely related rhabdoviruses are members of the genus Tibrovirus and Bas-Congo virus (BASV), which was recently identified in an individual with symptoms resembling hemorrhagic fever. Furthermore, by conducting a serosurvey of our study cohort, we find evidence for remarkably high exposure rates to the identified rhabdoviruses. The recent discoveries of novel rhabdoviruses by multiple research groups suggest that human infection with rhabdoviruses might be common. While the prevalence and clinical significance of these viruses are currently unknown, these viruses could have previously unrecognized impacts on human health; further research to understand the immunological and developmental impact of these viruses should be explored. More generally, the identification of similar novel viruses in individuals with and without overt symptoms of disease highlights the need for a broader understanding of the human virome as efforts for viral detection and discovery advance.","Stremlau, Matthew H.; Andersen, Kristian G.; Folarin, Onikepe A.; Grove, Jessica N.; Odia, Ikponmwonsa; Ehiane, Philomena E.; Omoniwa, Omowunmi; Omoregie, Omigie; Jiang, Pan-Pan; Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Matranga, Christian B.; Yang, Xiao; Gire, Stephen K.; Winnicki, Sarah; Tariyal, Ridhi; Schaffner, Stephen F.; Okokhere, Peter O.; Okogbenin, Sylvanus; Akpede, George O.; Asogun, Danny A.; Agbonlahor, Dennis E.; Walker, Peter J.; Tesh, Robert B.; Levin, Joshua Z.; Garry, Robert F.; Sabeti, Pardis C.; Happi, Christian T.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25781465/,218

643028,Rotational Thromboelastometry Reveals Distinct Coagulation Profiles for Patients With COVID-19 Depending on Disease Severity,2021-06-29,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are fighting a lethal virus with acute shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). These unprecedented circumstances have amplified the sources of emotional distress and worker burnout. However, many healthcare organizations (HCOs) in the United States, have opted for a “stoic approach” to healthcare worker support, i.e., no additional support beyond federal and state policy protections for the licensing and liability of healthcare workers. In this scenario, a key public health concern is sustaining an adequate healthcare workforce, both by way of quantity (adequate numbers) and quality (maximizing clinician resilience to provide safe care to large volumes of patients under challenging conditions). Therefore, it is imperative for HCO leaders to recognize that a limited view of worker psychological safety, without due consideration for the broader emotional distress created by the pandemic, could have the effect of restricting organizational resilience and adversely impacting patient safety and staff retention during and beyond the pandemic. This paper uses the organizational resilience framework to discuss the potential impact of a stoic approach to healthcare worker support on patient safety and staff retention in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) during COVID-19. The discussion in turn, helps to develop recommendations for HCOs to overcome these challenges.","Rangachari, Pavani; L.

Widely regarded as Halo effect, this phenomenon has been studied for more than 100 years now, and findings such as the relationship between aesthetic perception and other personality traits—such as competence and trustworthiness—have since been uncovered. Trustworthiness plays an especially crucial role in individuals' social interactions. Despite the large body of literature published on the Halo effect, and especially on the relationship between aesthetic appearance and perceived trustworthiness, little is known about the overall generalizability of the effect, as almost all of the studies have been conducted on adult participants from Western countries. Moreover, little is known about the stability of the effect over time, in the event of major destabilization, such as the outbreak of a pandemic. In this work, the cross-cultural generalizability of the Halo effect is investigated before and during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis of the generalizability and stability over time of the Halo effect is presented. Participants (N = 380, N = 145 Asians, N = 235 Caucasians) have been asked to rate the aesthetic appearance and perceived trustworthiness of a set of human faces of different ages, gender, and ethnicity. Result of our analysis demonstrated that the Halo effect (Aesthetic × trustworthiness) is influenced by the age of presented faces, but not by their gender or ethnicity. Moreover, our results show that the strength of the effect can be affected by external events and that the volatility is higher for adults' than children's faces.","Gabrieli, Giulio; Lee, Albert; Setoh, Peipei; Esposito, Gianluca",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.631871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841262/,218
644771,Vascular comorbidities worsen prognosis of patients with heart failure hospitalised with COVID-19,2021-06-14,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has placed intensive care units (ICU) triage at the center of bioethical discussions. National and international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria—e.g. medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life—are ethically acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them. SOURCES OF DATA: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment of triage decisions. GROWING POINTS: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Examine the universality vs. context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups and risk of discrimination; study the potential and challenges of AI for outcome and preference prediction and decision-support.","Vinay, Rasita; Baumann, Holger; Biller-Andorno, Nikola",Br Med Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34057458/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldab009,218

646537,Lactate dehydrogenase elevations is associated with severity of COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2020-07-24,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Conventional anti-cancer treatments for metastatic tumors include chemotherapy and radiation. These approaches can result in harmful side-effects and, in the vast majority of cases, are not curative. Recently, novel treatments have been developed in order to stimulate the host immune system to fight cancer. This type of therapeutic approach, called immunotherapy, has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to discoveries that have deciphered the immunosuppressive role of the tumor microenvironment and underpinning molecular signals. To enhance the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the tumor site, nanoparticle-based delivery systems can be used to reduce off-target effects, and to modulate immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment. This novel therapeutic approach can synergize with other immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors and adoptive cell therapy, by enhancing the infiltration of activated immune cells to the tumor site, and by limiting local immunosuppression. ABSTRACT: A number of novel cancer therapies have recently emerged that have rapidly moved from the bench to the clinic. Onco-immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies, have revolutionized the field, since they provide a way to induce strong anti-tumor immune responses, which are able to fight cancer effectively. However, despite showing great efficacy in hematological and some solid tumors, unresponsiveness, development of therapy resistance and the development of serious adverse effects, limit their capacity to impact the vast majority of tumors. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems are versatile vehicles for a wide variety of molecular cargoes and provide an innovative strategy to improve conventional onco-immunotherapies. They can be finely tuned to release their contents in the tumor microenvironment, or to deliver combinations of adjuvants and antigens in the case of nanovaccines. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in the field of nanobiotechnology, to remodel the tumor microenvironment and to enhance immunotherapies.","Mainini, Francesco; De Santis, Francesca; Fucà, Giovanni; Di Nicola, Massimo; Rivoltini, Licia; Eccles, Michael",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13153765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359665/,218

Relying on the hydrocarbon sector generates a significant trade-off between economic development and the environment. The GCC governments have an essential role in this process and can affect the outcomes. The policies that have been implemented in the GCC countries to protect the environment and empower sustainable consumption and production were explored and identified. Moreover, the success of these policies in achieving their goals was assessed. The analytical approach and utilizing the previous studies’ findings were used by the current study. This study finds that the institutional actions of the Gulf countries are not enough to generate sustainable consumption and production. These countries remain strongly affected by the hydrocarbon sector, and the diversification achievements are weak. Further, the energy price reforms have many problems as a tool to enhance sustainable consumption and production. Additionally, these countries work under the concept of entrepreneurial state capitalist. The government controls all the sectors, including the private sector, to secure the regime. The policy implication of the current paper is that the GCC countries should recover the process of diversifying the economy, enhancing the movements toward the free market economy, and adopting an efficient energy-environmental policy by enhancing more concrete actions toward new technologies.

This is the first study to describe the level of stress and mental health of parents of either healthy children or children with chronic conditions, during the 2020 pandemic. Methods: A representative sample of US parents was recruited from 10–17 April 2020. Parents completed online questionnaires about the past 7 days, including the Perceived Stress Scale, Resilient Coping Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale, Parental Stress Scale, PROMIS Anxiety and Depression scales and various other pandemic-related stress questions Results: Levels of stressors (e.g., job loss, school closures, etc.) were high during this time (e.g., 79% of children attended home/online school) and parents reported being moderately to highly stressed. Rates of clinical anxiety (44.6%) and depression (42.2%) were high. Parents of children with chronic conditions reported higher levels of stress and worse mental health, but did not differ from other parents in dealing with stress or interruptions in work, child schooling, and marital satisfaction.

647587,A randomised trial of Mycobacterium w in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (ARMY-1),2021-03-05,"The legal and illegal trade in wildlife for food, medicine and other products is a globally significant threat to biodiversity that is also responsible for the emergence of pathogens that threaten human and livestock health and our global economy. Trade in wildlife likely played a role in the origin of COVID-19, and viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in bats and pangolins, both traded widely. To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (> 50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families—Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In the light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2-related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our ‘upstream’ market chain samples suggests that these detections in ‘downstream’ animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network. While confirmatory serologic studies are needed, it is likely that Sunda pangolins are incidental hosts of coronaviruses. Our findings further support the importance of ending the trade in wildlife globally.","Lee, Jimmy; Hughes, Tom; Lee, Mei-Ho; Field, Hume; Rovie-Ryan, Jeffrine Japning; Sitam, Frankie Thomas; Sipangkui, Symphorosa; Nathan, Senthilvel K.

Many countries reported a two-wave pattern of COVID-19 deaths; however, studies comparing the two waves are limited. The objective of the study was to compare all-cause excess mortality between the two waves that occurred during the year 2020 using nationwide data. All-cause excess mortalities were estimated using negative binomial models with time modeled by quadratic splines. The models were also applied to estimate all-cause excess deaths “not directly attributable to COVD-19”, i.e., without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the first wave (25th February−31st May), we estimated 52,437 excess deaths (95% CI: 49,213–55,863) and 50,979 (95% CI: 50,333–51,425) during the second phase (10th October−31st December), corresponding to percentage 34.8% (95% CI: 33.8%–35.8%) in the second wave and 31.0% (95%CI: 27.2%–35.4%) in the first. During both waves, all-cause excess deaths percentages were higher in northern regions (59.1% during the first and 42.2% in the second wave), with a significant increase in the rest of Italy (from 6.7% to 27.1%) during the second wave. Males and those aged 80 or over were the most hit groups with an increase in both during the second wave. Excess deaths not directly attributable to COVID-19 decreased during the second phase with respect to the first phase, from 10.8% (95% CI: 9.5%–12.4%) to 7.7% (95% CI: 7.5%–7.9%), respectively. The percentage increase in excess deaths from all causes suggests in Italy a different impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the second wave in 2020. The decrease in excess deaths not directly attributable to COVID-19 may indicate an improvement in the preparedness of the Italian health care services during this second wave, in the detection of COVID-19 diagnoses and/or clinical practice toward the other severe diseases.","Dorrucci, Maria; Minelli, Giada; Boros, Stefano; Manno, Valerio; Prati, Sabrina; Battaglini, Marco; Corsetti, Gianni; Andrianou, Xanthi; Riccardo, Flavia; Fabiani, Massimo; Vescio, Maria Fenicia; Spuri, Matteo; Urdiales, Alberto Mateo; Martina, Del Manso; Onder, Graziano; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Bella, Antonino",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34336767/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.669209,218

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Two emergency departments in Detroit, Michigan, United States, during a local coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak (March 2020 to April 2020). PATIENTS: Emergency department patients receiving lung ultrasound for clinical suspicion of coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: None, observational analysis only. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: By a reference standard of serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, 42 patients were coronavirus disease 2019 positive, 16 negative, and eight untested (test results lost, died prior to testing, and/or did not meet hospital guidelines for rationing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests). Thirty-three percent, 44%, 38%, and 17% had mortality, ICU admission, intubation, and venous or arterial thromboembolism, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% CIs were calculated for five lung ultrasound patterns coded by a blinded reviewer and chest radiograph. Chest radiograph had area under the curve = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54–0.79), 74% sensitivity (95% CI, 48–93%), and 53% specificity (95% CI, 32–75%). Two lung ultrasound patterns had a statistically significant area under the curve: symmetric bilateral pulmonary edema (area under the curve, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–0.64), and a nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern (edema in superior lung ≥ inferior lung and no pleural effusion; area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90). Chest radiograph plus the nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern showed a statistically improved area under the curve (0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.90) compared to either alone, but at the ideal cutoff had sensitivity and specificity equivalent to nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema only (69% and 77%, respectively). The strongest combination of clinical, chest radiograph, and lung ultrasound factors for diagnosis was nondependent bilateral pulmonary edema pattern with temperature and oxygen saturation (area under the curve, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94; sensitivity = 77% [58–93%]; specificity = 76% [53–94%] at the ideal cutoff), which was superior to chest radiograph alone. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound diagnosed severe presentations of coronavirus disease 2019 with similar sensitivity to chest radiograph, CT, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (on first testing) and improved specificity compared to chest radiograph. Diagnostically useful lung ultrasound patterns differed from those hypothesized by previous, nonanalytical, reports (case series and expert opinion), and should be evaluated in a rigorous prospective study.","Favot, Mark; Malik, Adrienne; Rowland, Jonathan; Haber, Brian; Ehrman, Robert; Harrison, Nicholas",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766567/,218

Early data suggest higher rate of ischemic stroke in severe COVID-19 infection. We evaluated whether a relationship exists between emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from all patients who presented with ELVO to the Mount Sinai Health System Hospitals across New York City during the peak 3 weeks of hospitalization and death from COVID-19. Patients’ demographic, comorbid conditions, cardiovascular risk factors, COVID-19 disease status, and clinical presentation were extracted from the electronic medical record. Comparison was made between COVID-19 positive and negative cohorts. The incidence of ELVO stroke was compared with the pre-COVID period. RESULTS: Forty-five consecutive ELVO patients presented during the observation period. Fifty-three percent of patients tested positive for COVID-19. Total patients’ mean (±SD) age was 66 (±17). Patients with COVID-19 were significantly younger than patients without COVID-19, 59±13 versus 74±17 (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.94 [0.81–0.98]; P=0.004). Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 were male compared with 43% of patients without COVID-19 (odds ratio [95% CI], 3.99 [1.12–14.17]; P=0.032). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely to be White (8% versus 38% [odds ratio (95% CI), 0.15 (0.04–0.81); P=0.027]). In comparison to a similar time duration before the COVID-19 outbreak, a 2-fold increase in the total number of ELVO was observed (estimate: 0.78 [95% CI, 0.47–1.08], P≤0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the ELVO stroke patients during the peak time of the New York City’s COVID-19 outbreak were COVID-19 positive, and those patients with COVID-19 were younger, more likely to be male, and less likely to be White. Our findings also suggest an increase in the incidence of ELVO stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Majidi, Shahram; Fifi, Johanna T.; Ladner, Travis R.; Lara-Reyna, Jacques; Yaeger, Kurt A.; Yim, Benjamin; Dangayach, Neha; Oxley, Thomas J.; Shigematsu, Tomoyoshi; Kummer, Benjamin R.; Stein, Laura K.; Weinberger, Jesse; Fara, Michael G.; De Leacy, Reade; Dhamoon, Mandip S.; Tuhrim, Stanley; Mocco, J",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32755349/; https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.030397,218

The observation of such a large sample of planets will allow to deepen our understanding of planetary and atmospheric formation at the early stages, providing a truly representative picture of the chemical nature of exoplanets, and relating this directly to the type and chemical environment of the host star. Hence, the accurate and precise determination of the host star fundamental properties is essential to Ariel for drawing a comprehensive picture of the underlying essence of these planetary systems. We present here a structured approach for the characterisation of Ariel stars that accounts for the concepts of homogeneity and coherence among a large set of stellar parameters. We present here the studies and benchmark analyses we have been performing to determine robust stellar fundamental parameters, elemental abundances, activity indices, and stellar ages. In particular, we present results for the homogeneous estimation of the activity indices S and [Formula: see text] , and preliminary results for elemental abundances of Na, Al, Mg, Si, C, N. In addition, we analyse the variation of a planetary spectrum, obtained with Ariel, as a function of the uncertainty on the stellar effective temperature.

651535,Prognosis of French COVID-19 patients with chronic liver disease: A national retrospective cohort study for 2020,2021-05-14,"International population mobility is an underlying factor in the emergence of public health threats and risks that must be managed globally. These risks are often related, but not limited, to transmissible pathogens. Mobile populations can link zones of disease emergence to lowprevalence or nonendemic areas through rapid or high-volume international movements, or both. Against this background of human movement, other global processes such as economics, trade, transportation, environment and climate change, as well as civil security influence the health impacts of disease emergence. Concurrently, global information systems, together with regulatory frameworks for disease surveillance and reporting, affect organizational and public awareness of events of potential public health significance. International regulations directed at disease mitigation and control have not kept pace with the growing challenges associated with the volume, speed, diversity, and disparity of modern patterns of human movement. The thesis that human population mobility is itself a major determinant of global public health is supported in this article by review of the published literature from the perspective of determinants of health (such as genetics/biology, behavior, environment, and socioeconomics), population-based disease prevalence differences, existing national and international health policies and regulations, as well as inter-regional shifts in population demographics and health outcomes. This paper highlights some of the emerging threats and risks to public health, identifies gaps in existing frameworks to manage health issues associated with migration, and suggests changes in approach to population mobility, globalization, and public health. The proposed integrated approach includes a broad spectrum of stakeholders ranging from individual health-care providers to policy makers and international organizations that are primarily involved in global health management, or are influenced by global health events.","Gushulak, BD; Weekers, J; MacPherson, DW",Emerg Health Threats J,https://doi.org/10.3134/ehtj.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460280/,218

METHODS: This prospective study enrolled children aged 2–59 months admitted to the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined clinical pneumonia. Demographic and clinico-radiological data were collected through questionnaires, physical examination, and chest radiography. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal washing were collected for microbiological analysis including culture and molecular methods. RESULTS: From July 2017 to June 2018, 189 children were enrolled, of which 53.4% were infants. Pneumonia-related admissions were less frequent over the winter. Chest radiographies were obtained in 149 children; endpoints included pneumonia in 39 cases (26.2%), other infiltrates in 31 (20.8%), and were normal in 79 children (53.0%). Non-contaminated bacterial growth was detected in 8/152 (5.3%) blood cultures, with only two cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Viral detection in upper respiratory secretions was common, with at least one virus detected in 103/115 (89.6%). The three most-commonly isolated viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (52/115; 45.2%), rhinovirus (42/115; 36.5%), and human parainfluenza virus (19/115; 16.5%). A third of patients with viral infections showed mixed infections. Case fatality rate was 3.2% (6/189). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral infections predominated among this cohort of WHO-defined clinical pneumonia cases, whereas bacterial aetiologies were uncommon, highlighting the epidemiologic transition that Bhutan seems to have reached.","Jullien, Sophie; Pradhan, Dinesh; Tshering, Tashi; Sharma, Ragunath; Dema, Kumbu; Garcia-Garcia, Selene; Ribó, Jose Luis; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen; Bassat, Quique",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283281/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220302332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220302332,218
652464,Enhanced Recovery After Cesarean: Current and Emerging Trends,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND: As of March 31, 2020 the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic that started in China in December 2019 is now generating local transmission around the world. The geographic heterogeneity and associated intervention strategies highlight the need to monitor in real time the transmission potential of COVID-19. Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. METHODS: Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), of COVID-19 in Singapore from the publicly available daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays as of March 17, 2020. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis that accounts for truncation of case counts. RESULTS: The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020 while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020 was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.02). The overall mean reporting delay was estimated at 6.4 days (95% CI: 5.8, 6.9), but it was shorter among imported cases compared to local cases (mean 4.3 vs. 7.6 days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The trajectory of the reproduction number in Singapore underscores the significant effects of successful containment efforts in Singapore, but it also suggests the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission.","Tariq, Amna; Lee, Yiseul; Roosa, Kimberlyn; Blumberg, Seth; Yan, Ping; Ma, Stefan; Chowell, Gerardo",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511436/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.21.20026435,218

This article discusses mortality patterns of the deadliest epidemic in the last 120 years – the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. Statistical sources from Italy and the USA, published shortly after the pandemic, were analyzed. The analysis was carried out for mortality from all causes, since in this case inaccuracies associated with establishing the causes of death are minimized. Despite the fact that the first cases of the Spanish flu appeared in the United States as early as March 1918, this first wave of epidemic practically did not affect the total mortality rate. The main peak of mortality in 1918 occurred in October 1918 both in the USA and Italy, with a gradual decrease in mortality over several months. Analysis of age-specific mortality demonstrates a significant increase in mortality at middle ages (20–50 years) in 1918 compared with 1917. Analysis of mortality trends using the method of latent variables shows a significant increase in the background mortality factor in 1918, which turned out to be higher for Italy than the mortality losses during the Second World War. The Spanish flu pandemic differs from the current coronavirus pandemic, because of significant increase in mortality of middle-aged people, while the COVID-19 pandemic causes a more marked increase in mortality among the elderly. With this, the COVID-19 pandemic is more like the recent flu epidemics than the earlier Spanish flu pandemic.","Gavrilova, Natalia S.; Gavrilov, Leonid A.",Popul Econ,https://doi.org/10.3897/popecon.4.e53492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656548/,218

We performed metabolomics profiling of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients to understand better the underlying pathologic processes and pathways, and to identify potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. DESIGN: Blood was collected at predetermined ICU days to measure the plasma concentrations of 162 metabolites using both direct injection-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. SETTING: Tertiary-care ICU and academic laboratory. SUBJECTS: Patients admitted to the ICU suspected of being infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, using standardized hospital screening methodologies, had blood samples collected until either testing was confirmed negative on ICU day 3 (coronavirus disease 2019 negative) or until ICU day 10 if the patient tested positive (coronavirus disease 2019 positive). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Age- and sex-matched healthy controls and ICU patients that were either coronavirus disease 2019 positive or coronavirus disease 2019 negative were enrolled. Cohorts were well balanced with the exception that coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients suffered bilateral pneumonia more frequently than coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients. Mortality rate for coronavirus disease 2019 positive ICU patients was 40%. Feature selection identified the top-performing metabolites for identifying coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients from healthy control subjects and was dominated by increased kynurenine and decreased arginine, sarcosine, and lysophosphatidylcholines. Arginine/kynurenine ratio alone provided 100% classification accuracy between coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients and healthy control subjects (p = 0.0002). When comparing the metabolomes between coronavirus disease 2019 positive and coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients, kynurenine was the dominant metabolite and the arginine/kynurenine ratio provided 98% classification accuracy (p = 0.005). Feature selection identified creatinine as the top metabolite for predicting coronavirus disease 2019-associated mortality on both ICU days 1 and 3, and both creatinine and creatinine/arginine ratio accurately predicted coronavirus disease 2019-associated death with 100% accuracy (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Metabolomics profiling with feature classification easily distinguished both healthy control subjects and coronavirus disease 2019 negative patients from coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients.

At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 578 randomly selected health care workers (HCW) from Hospital Clinic de Barcelona was 11.2%. Methods. A follow-up survey one month after the baseline (April-May 2020) measured SARS-CoV-2 infection by real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and IgM, IgA, IgG and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by Luminex. Prevalence of infection was defined by a positive SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR and/or antibody seropositivity. Results. The cumulative prevalence of infection at month 1 was 14.9% (84/565) and the seroprevalence 14.5% (82/565) for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. We found 25 (5%) new infections in participants without previous evidence of infection at baseline (501) and two participants seroreverted for IgM and/or IgG and/or IgA. Among seropositive participants at baseline, IgM and IgA levels generally declined at month 1 (antibody decay rates of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.40-0.60) and 0.34 (95% CI, 0.26-0.44)), respectively. Eight percent of the participants seroreverted for IgM and 11% for IgA. Subjects reporting COVID-19-like symptoms and laboratory and other technicians had higher risk of infection. The most frequent subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG2, followed by IgG3, with higher levels of IgG1, and only IgA1 but no IgA2 was detected. Conclusions. Our findings highlight the importance of a continuous and improved surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCW, particularly in high risk groups. The decay of IgA and IgM levels have implications for seroprevalence studies using these isotypes.","Moncunill, G.; Mayor, A.; Santano, R.; Jimenez, A.; Vidal, M.; Tortajada, M.; Sanz, S.; Mendez, S.; Llupia, A.; Aguilar, R.; Alonso, S.; Barrios, D.; Carolis, C.; Cistero, P.; Choliz, E.; Cruz, A.; Fochs, S.; Jairoce, C.; Hecht, J.; Lamoglia, M.; Martinez, M.; Moreno, J.; Mitchell, R.; Ortega, N.; Pey, N.; Puyol, L.; Ribes, M.; Rosell, N.; Sotomayor, P.; Torres, S.; Williams, S.; Barroso, S.; Vilella, A.; Trilla, A.; Varela, P.; Dobano, C.; Garcia-Basteiro, A.

The rapid publication of information, both regarding the clinical course and the viral biology, has yielded incredible knowledge of the virus. In this review, we address the insights gained for the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, which we have integrated into the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database, a publicly available resource. Integrating evolutionary, structural, and interaction data with human proteins, we present how the SARS-CoV-2 proteome interacts with human disorders and risk factors ranging from cytokine storm, hyperferritinemic septic, coagulopathic, cardiac, immune, and rare disease-based genetics. The most noteworthy human genetic potential of SARS-CoV-2 is that of the nucleocapsid protein, where it is known to contribute to the inhibition of the biological process known as nonsense-mediated decay. This inhibition has the potential to not only regulate about 10% of all biological transcripts through altered ribosomal biology but also associate with viral-induced genetics, where suppressed human variants are activated to drive dominant, negative outcomes within cells. As we understand more of the dynamic and complex biological pathways that the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes for entry into cells, for replication, and for release from human cells, we can understand more risk factors for severe/lethal outcomes in patients and novel pharmaceutical interventions that may mitigate future pandemics.","Sirpilla, Olivia; Bauss, Jacob; Gupta, Ruchir; Underwood, Adam; Qutob, Dinah; Freeland, Tom; Bupp, Caleb; Carcillo, Joseph; Hartog, Nicholas; Rajasekaran, Surender; Prokop, Jeremy W.",J Proteome Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32686937/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00421,218

Eukaryote-infecting viruses have evolved a variety of ways to manipulate the cellular translation apparatus, in many cases using elegant RNA-centered strategies. These viral RNAs can alter or control every phase of the protein-making process, are very diverse in terms of target, mechanism, and the RNA structural characteristics, and are found in a wide range of viruses. In addition, as cells often attempt to limit infection by inhibiting translation, some of these viral RNAs act to overcome the cell’s antiviral response or even take advantage of it to further viral infection. Here, we present important illustrative examples of viral RNA-based strategies to exploit the translation machinery. We briefly describe what is understood of the structure and mechanism of diverse RNA elements, the advantages conferred to the virus, and some of the key unknowns that provide motivation for further exploration.","Jaafar, Zane A.; Kieft, Jeffrey S.",Nature Reviews Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514982/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0117-x,218

It is continually thwarted, though, by the fact that the treated organism is highly dynamic and the target molecule(s) is (are) never static. In this article, we address some of the factors that modify and cause the mobility and plasticity of drug targets and their interactions with ligands and discuss how these can lead to unexpected (lack of) effects of drugs. These factors include genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic variability, cellular plasticity, chronobiological rhythms, time, age and disease resolution, sex, drug metabolism, and distribution. We emphasize four existing approaches that can be taken, either singly or in combination, to try to minimize effects of pharmacological plasticity. These are firstly, to enhance specificity using target conditions close to those in diseases, secondly, by simultaneously or thirdly, sequentially aiming at multiple targets, and fourthly, in synchronization with concurrent dietary, psychological, training, and biorhythm‐synchronizing procedures to optimize drug therapy.","Parnham, Michael J.; Geisslinger, Gerd",Pharmacol Res Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31768257/; https://doi.org/10.1002/prp2.532,218

However, there is little evidence of porcine GCRV infections or of their genetic diversity in South Korea. We examined 137 diarrheic fecal specimens from 55 farms collected from six provinces. RT-PCR utilizing primer pairs specific for the GCRV VP6 gene detected GCRV-positive reactions in 36 (26.2%) diarrheic fecal samples. Of these, 17 samples (12.4%) tested positive for porcine GCRVs alone and 19 samples (13.8%) were also positive for other pathogens. Other enteric pathogens except for GCRV were detected in 64 feces samples (46.7%) and no enteric pathogens were evident in 37 feces samples (27.0%). Phylogenetic and sequence homology analyses of GCRV partial VP6 gene between 23 Korean and other known porcine GCRVs demonstrated that Korean strains belonged to the porcine lineage. Furthermore, one Korean porcine strain shared the highest nucleotide (89.7–89.0%) and deduced amino acid sequence (92.9–93.9%) identities with bovine GCRV strains and was placed in the bovine GCRV lineage indicative of bovine origin. In conclusion, porcine GCRV infections are widespread in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea. The infecting porcine GCRVs mostly belong to the porcine lineage with the exception of one bovine-like GCRV, which possibly originated from bovine GCRV due to interspecies transmission.","Jeong, Young-Ju; Park, Sang-Ik; Hosmillo, Myra; Shin, Dong-Jun; Chun, Young-Hyun; Kim, Hyun-Jeong; Kwon, Hyung-Jun; Kang, Shien-Young; Woo, Sang-Kyu; Park, Su-Jin; Kim, Gye-Yeop; Kang, Mun-Il; Cho, Kyoung-Oh",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362434/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.03.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509001539; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509001539,218

Our faculty has quickly adapted the curricula to online formats. The online format seems to be more advantageous in terms of content material and virtual activities, but the results of these adjustments will require subsequent evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate medical student expectations of online orthopedics learning that was created based on social constructivism theory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the fifth-year medical student expectations of our newly developed online orthopedics course during the outbreak. Constructivist Online Learning Environment Survey (COLLES) was applied for evaluating the expectations during orthopedic rotation. The survey contains six aspects based on social constructivist principles: relevance, reflection, interactivity, tutor support, peer support, and interpretation. All students responded to the preferred COLLES before starting the online course, and the actual COLLES was filled out when the online course was completed. Before and after attending the online course, the scores were compared and interpreted to assess student expectations. RESULTS: A total of 126 fifth-year medical students studied the online orthopedic course. The preferred COLLES were completed by 125 students, while 120 students replied to the actual COLLES. The overall scores from the post-course survey in all aspects were significantly higher than scores from the pre-course with P-value < 0.01. The comparison between the preferred and actual scores showed this online course fulfilled student expectations. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 has disrupted medical student education. The online orthopedic learning course in our department has been developed to deal with the current situation.

The evaluation was carried out through an online survey. Results: The clinical groups worsened over time in cognitive coping, anxiety and depression, while the control group only worsened in depression. Intergroup differences in anxiety, depression and coping strategies were maintained, highlighting the use of some maladaptive strategies (avoidance, spiritual) in clinical groups. Experiential avoidance and tolerance for uncertainty mainly affected coping.

The Spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains at least three regions that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the S1 and S2 domains. We previously characterized a panel of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) but the majority of epitopes recognized by the MAbs remained unknown. METHODS: In this study we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as in vitro and in vivo fitness. RESULTS: Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles. We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a mechanism to overcome neutralization escape by using broadly cross reactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor binding domain, critical for virus replication and virulence.","Rockx, Barry; Donaldson, Eric; Frieman, Matthew; Sheahan, Timothy; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Baric, Ralph S.",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/201/6/946/18061591/201-6-946.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144042/; https://doi.org/10.1086/651022,218

It is a risk factor for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. There is some evidence it may also be associated with increased morbidity for COVID-19–associated illness. The authors sought to quantify the relationship between BMI and mortality after COVID-19. Methods: This was an observational retrospective cohort study from 178 hospitals from a large health system across the United States. Patients who presented to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1st, 2020, and September 1st, 2020 were evaluated for outcomes during hospitalization, including disease severity by level of care, intensive care unit admission, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital death. Disease severity was classified as moderate, severe or critical. Moderate disease was defined as highest level of care being the medical floor;critical disease was defined as highest level of care being the intensive care unit (ICU) and requiring mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressor support;and severe disease was defined as highest level of care being ICU but not meeting criteria for critical disease. Results: There were 45,340 patients in the cohort. The median age was 63 years (IQR 49-75). Forty eight percent of the cohort was female. Median overall BMI was 29.3 (IQR 25.1 to 34.7). In men median BMI was 28.6 (IQR 25.0 to33.3). In women the median BMI was 30.1 (IQR 25.4 to 36.2). Men had a significantly lower BMI when compared to women (P<0.001). Age was inversely correlated to BMI (P<0.001, 95% CI -0.130 to -0.130). The majority of the cohort (57%) had moderate disease, with 29% having severe disease and 14% have critical diseases. The overall mortality was 15%. The overall hospital median length of stay (LOS) was 5 days (IQR 3-11). Patients with higher BMI were significantly more likely to require mechanical ventilation and require pressor support (P<0.0001, 95% CI 0.0013 to 0.0021) [Figure 1]. Patients with higher BMI were also significantly more likely to die (P<0.001, OR 1.031, 95% CI 1.03-1.04). This association held true even when analyzed in a multivariable regression model controlled for age and sex (p=0.0131). The hospital length of stay was inversely correlated to the BMI. Bivariate analysis demonstrated that the average length-of-stay could be approximated as 9.1 days -0.03*BMI. Presumably, this is because at higher BMIs there is higher mortality resulting in shorter LOS. Conclusion: Patients with elevated BMI were significantly more likely to have highest disease severity, higher mortality and shorter length-of-stay in this large national cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

At present, it is known that inflammasomes are multimolecular complexes (cytosolic multiprotein oligomers of the innate immune system) that contain many copies of receptors recognizing the molecular structures of cell-damaging factors and pathogenic agents. Inflammasomes are mainly formed in myeloid cells, and their main function is participation in the cleavage of the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 cytokines into their biologically active forms (IL-1β, IL-18). Each type of microorganism influences particular inflammasome activation, and long-term exposure of the organism to viruses, bacteria, yeasts or parasites, among others, can induce uncontrolled inflammation and autoinflammatory diseases. Therefore, this review aims to present the most current scientific data on the molecular interplay between inflammasomes and particular microorganisms. Knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for the interaction between the host and certain types of microorganisms could contribute to the individuation of innovative strategies for the treatment of uncontrolled inflammation targeting a specific type of inflammasome activated by a specific type of pathogen.","Antushevich, Hanna",Immunol Lett,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247820303837?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2020.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32971149/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247820303837,218

663068,COVID-19: A Single-Center ICU Experience of the First Wave in the Philippines,2021-01-30,"The current pandemic disease coronavirus (COVID-19) has not only become a worldwide health emergency, but also devoured the global economy. Despite appreciable research, identification of targeted populations for testing and tracking the spread of COVID-19 at a larger scale is an intimidating challenge. There is a need to quickly identify the infected individual or community to check the spread. The diagnostic testing done at large-scale for individuals has limitations as it cannot provide information at a swift pace in large populations, which is pivotal to contain the spread at the early stage of its breakouts. Recently, scientists are exploring the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the faeces discharged in municipal wastewater. Wastewater sampling could be a potential tool to expedite the early identification of infected communities by detecting the biomarkers from the virus. However, it needs a targeted approach to choose optimized locations for wastewater sampling. The present study proposes a novel fuzzy based Bayesian model to identify targeted populations and optimized locations with a maximum probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater networks. Consequently, real time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater using autosamplers or biosensors could be deployed efficiently. Fourteen criteria such as population density, patients with comorbidity, quarantine and hospital facilities, etc. are analysed using the data of 14 lac individuals infected by COVID-19 in the USA. The uniqueness of the proposed model is its ability to deal with the uncertainty associated with the data and decision maker's opinions using fuzzy logic, which is fused with Bayesian approach. The evidence-based virus detection in wastewater not only facilitates focused testing, but also provides potential communities for vaccine distribution. Consequently, governments can reduce lockdown periods, thereby relieving human stress and boosting economic growth.","Rallapalli, Srinivas; Aggarwal, Shubham; Singh, Ajit Pratap",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146294; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721013620?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721013620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33714094/,218

Moreover, women admitted during lockdown were more likely to give birth alone [140 (11.1) vs 50 (4.1), p<0.001]. However, during 2020, the rate of mother and newborn skinto-skin contact [1036 (82.2) vs 897 (73.8), p<0.001] and that of breastfeeding within 2 hours from birth [1003 (79.6) vs 830 (68.3), p<0.001] was higher. We found no significant differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes.

We developed and validated a supervised machine learning pipeline to distinguish the two viral infections using the available vital signs and demographic dataset from the first hospital/emergency room encounters of 3883 patients who had confirmed diagnoses of influenza A/B, COVID-19 or negative laboratory test results. The models were able to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of at least 97% using our multiclass classifier. The predictive models were externally validated on 15,697 encounters in 3125 patients available on TrinetX database that contains patient-level data from different healthcare organizations. The influenza vs COVID-19-positive model had an AUC of 98.8%, and 92.8% on the internal and external test sets, respectively.

The best anticoagulation strategy for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in such patients is still under debate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact that different anticoagulation protocols have on filter clotting risk. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study comparing two different anticoagulation strategies (citrate only and citrate plus intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin) in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), associated or not with COVID-19 (COV + AKI and COV − AKI, respectively), who were submitted to CRRT. Filter clotting risks were compared among groups. RESULTS: Between January 2019 and July 2020, 238 patients were evaluated: 188 in the COV + AKI group and 50 in the COV − AKI group. Filter clotting during the first filter use occurred in 111 patients (46.6%). Heparin use conferred protection against filter clotting (HR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.25–0.55), resulting in longer filter survival. Bleeding events and the need for blood transfusion were similar between the citrate only and citrate plus unfractionated heparin strategies. In-hospital mortality was higher among the COV + AKI patients than among the COV − AKI patients, although it was similar between the COV + AKI patients who received heparin and those who did not. Filter clotting was more common in patients with D-dimer levels above the median (5990 ng/ml). In the multivariate analysis, heparin was associated with a lower risk of filter clotting (HR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.18–0.43), whereas an elevated D-dimer level and high hemoglobin were found to be risk factors for circuit clotting. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was marginally associated with an increased risk of circuit clotting (HR = 2.15, 95% CI 0.99–4.68). CONCLUSIONS: In COV + AKI patients, adding systemic heparin to standard regional citrate anticoagulation may prolong CRRT filter patency by reducing clotting risk with a low risk of complications.

FT data mining is more suitable for extracting interesting information from real-world data that may be polluted by noise. In particular, the increasing amount of today’s biological databases requires such a data mining technique to mine important data, e.g., motifs. In this paper, we propose the concept of proportional FT mining of frequent patterns. The number of tolerable faults in a proportional FT pattern is proportional to the length of the pattern. Two algorithms are designed for solving this problem. The first algorithm, named FT-BottomUp, applies an FT-Apriori heuristic and finds all FT patterns with any number of faults. The second algorithm, FT-LevelWise, divides all FT patterns into several groups according to the number of tolerable faults, and mines the content patterns of each group in turn. By applying our algorithm on real data, two reported epitopes of spike proteins of SARS-CoV can be found in our resulting itemset and the proportional FT data mining is better than the fixed FT data mining for this application.","Lee, Guanling; Peng, Sheng-Lung; Lin, Yuh-Tzu",Inf Syst Front,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-009-9158-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214877/,218
665571,"Presence, detection, and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the sustainable remedial measures",2021-06-28,"The massive worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is fueling the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first whole-genome sequence was published in January 2020, a growing database of tens of thousands of viral genomes has been constructed. This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15,342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP 12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major {beta}-interferon antagonists. The study provides valuable information for therapeutics and vaccine design, as well as insight into mutation tendencies that could facilitate preventive control.","Tomaszewski, Tre; DeVries, Ryan S; Dong, Mengyi; Bhatia, Gitanshu; Norsworthy, Miles D; Zheng, Xuying; Caetano-Anolles, Gustavo",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.231472,218

This study tries to discover a novel potential inhibitor to the main protease of the virus, by computer aided drug discovery where various major active phytochemicals of the plant Boerhavia diffusa Linn. namely 2-3-4 beta-Ecdysone, Bioquercetin, Biorobin, Boeravinone J, Boerhavisterol, kaempferol, Liriodendrin, quercetin and trans-caftaric acid were docked to SAR-CoV-2 Main Protease using Molecular docking server. The ligands that showed the least binding energy were Biorobin with − 8.17 kcal/mol, Bioquercetin with − 7.97 kcal/mol and Boerhavisterol with − 6.77 kcal/mol. These binding energies were found to be favorable for an efficient docking and resultant inhibition of the viral main protease. The graphical illustrations and visualizations of the docking were obtained along with inhibition constant, intermolecular energy (total and degenerate), interaction surfaces and HB Plot for all the successfully docked conditions of all the 9 ligands mentioned. Additionally the druglikeness of the top 3 hits namely Bioquercetin, Biorobin and Boeravisterol were tested by ADME studies and Boeravisterol was found to be a suitable candidate obeying the Lipinsky’s rule. Since the main protease of SARS has been reported to possess structural similarity with the main protease of MERS, comparative docking of these ligands were also carried out on the MERS Mpro, however the binding energies for this target was found to be unfavorable for spontaneous binding. From these results, it was concluded that Boerhavia diffusa possess potential therapeutic properties against COVID-19.

667177,REMDESIVIR CAUSING PROFOUND BRADYCARDIA,2021-05-11,"Background and objective. The incubation period of COVID-19 helps to determine the optimal duration of the quarantine and inform predictive models of incidence curves. Several emerging studies have produced varying results; this systematic review aims to provide a more accurate estimate of the incubation period of COVID-19. Methods. For this systematic review, a literature search was conducted using Pubmed, Scopus/EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases, covering all observational and experimental studies reporting the incubation period and published from 1 January 2020 to 21 March 2020.We estimated the mean and 95th percentile of the incubation period using meta-analysis, taking into account between-study heterogeneity, and the analysis with moderator variables. Results. We included seven studies (N= 792) in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity (I2 83.0%, p< 0.001)was significantly decreased when we included the study quality and the statistical model used as moderator variables (I2 15%). The mean incubation period ranged from 5.6 (95%CI: 5.2 to 6.0) to 6.7 days (95% CI: 6.0 to 7.4) according to the statistical model. The 95th percentile was 12.5 days when the mean age of patients was 60 years, increasing 1 day for every 10 years. Conclusion. Based on the published data reporting the incubation period of COVID-19, the mean time between exposure and onset of clinical symptoms depended on the statistical model used, and the 95th percentile depended on the mean age of the patients. It is advisable to record sex and age when collecting data in order to analyze possible differential patterns. Antecedentes y objetivo. El período de incubación de la COVID-19 ayuda a determinar la duración óptima del período de cuarentena y a crear modelos predictivos de curvas de incidencia. Se han reportado resultados variables en recientes estudios y, por ello, el objetivo de esta revisión sistemática es proporcionar una estimación más precisa del período de incubación de la COVID-19. Métodos. Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica en las bases de datos de Pubmed, Scopus / EMBASE y la Cochrane Library, incluyendo todos los estudios observacionales y experimentales que reportaban un período de incubación y que se habían publicado entre el 1 de enero y el 21 de marzo de 2020. Se estimó la media y el percentil 95 del período de incubación mediante metaanálisis, teniendo en cuenta la heterogeneidad entre los estudios y el análisis con variables moderadoras. Resultados. Se incluyeron siete estudios (N = 792) en el metaanálisis. La heterogeneidad (I2 83,0 %, p <0,001) disminuyó significativamente cuando se tuvo en cuenta la calidad del estudio y el modelo estadístico utilizado como variables moderadoras (I2 15%).

667182,Virus-sampling technologies in different environments,2021-06-28,"Resistance to the adamantane class of antiviral drugs by human A/H3N2 influenza viruses currently exceeds 90% in the United States and multiple Asian countries. Adamantane resistance is associated with a single amino acid change (S31N) in the M2 protein, which was shown to rapidly disseminate globally in 2005 in association with a genome reassortment event. However, the exact origin of influenza A/H3N2 viruses carrying the S31N mutation has not been characterized, particularly in South-East Asia. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the HA, NA, and M1/2 segments of viral isolates collected between 1997-2007 from temperate localities in the Northern hemisphere (New York State, United States, 492 isolates) and Southern hemisphere (New Zealand and Australia, 629 isolates) and a subtropical locality in South-East Asia (Hong Kong, 281 isolates). We find that although the S31N mutation was independently introduced at least 11 times, the vast majority of resistant viruses now circulating globally descend from a single introduction that was first detected in the summer of 2003 in Hong Kong. These resistant viruses were continually detected in Hong Kong throughout 2003-2005, acquired a novel HA through reassortment during the first part of 2005, and thereafter spread globally. The emergence and persistence of adamantane-resistant viruses in Hong Kong further supports a source-sink model of global influenza virus ecology, in which South-East Asia experiences continuous viral activity and repeatedly seeds epidemics in temperate areas.","Nelson, Martha I.; Simonsen, Lone; Viboud, Cécile; Miller, Mark A.; Holmes, Edward C.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209002013; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2705899?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19394063/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209002013; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.03.026,218

However, no researches described the patients complicated with pleural effusion (PE). In the present study, we aimed to clinically characterize the COVID-19 patients complicated with PE and to create a predictive model on the basis of PE and other clinical features to identify COVID-19 patients who may progress to critical condition. METHODS: This retrospective study examined 476 COVID-19 inpatients, involving 153 patients with PE and 323 without PE. The data on patients’ past history, clinical features, physical checkup findings, laboratory results and chest computed tomography (CT) findings were collected and analyzed. LASSO regression analysis was employed to identify risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Laboratory findings showed that patients with PE had higher levels of white blood cells, neutrophils, lactic dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein and D-dimer, and lower levels of lymphocytes, platelets, hemoglobin, partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation. Meanwhile, patients with PE had higher incidence of severe or critical illness and mortality rate, and longer hospital stay time compared to their counterparts without pleural effusion. Moreover, LASSO regression analysis exhibited that pleural effusion, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer and total bilirubin (TBIL) might be risk factors for critical COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusion could serve as an indicator for severe inflammation and poor clinical outcomes, and might be a complementary risk factor for critical type of COVID-19.","Zhan, Na; Guo, Yingyun; Tian, Shan; Huang, Binglu; Tian, Xiaoli; Zou, Jinjing; Xiong, Qiutang; Tang, Dongling; Zhang, Liang; Dong, Weiguo",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-05856-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588779/,218

However, accurate estimates of the asymptomatic proportion require systematic detection and follow-up to differentiate between truly asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of current evidence regarding the asymptomatic proportion of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on methodologically-appropriate studies in community settings. Methods: We searched Medline and EMBASE for peer-reviewed articles, and BioRxiv and MedRxiv for pre-prints published prior to 05/05/2020. We included studies based in community settings that involved systematic PCR testing on participants and follow-up symptom monitoring regardless of symptom status. We extracted data on study characteristics, frequencies of PCR-confirmed infections by symptom status, and (if available) cycle threshold values and/or duration of viral shedding by symptom status. We computed estimates of the asymptomatic proportion and 95% confidence intervals for each study and overall using random effect meta-analysis. Findings: We screened 270 studies and included 6. The pooled estimate for the asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections was 11% (95% CI 4%-18%). Estimates of baseline viral load appeared to be similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic cases based on available data in three studies, though detailed reporting of cycle threshold values and natural history of viral shedding by symptom status was limited. Interpretation: The asymptomatic proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections is relatively low when estimated from methodologically-appropriate studies.

METHOD: To treat pregnant patients meeting criteria for severe or critical COVID-19 with high-dose (160–200 ppm) nitric oxide by mask twice daily and report on their clinical response. EXPERIENCE: Six pregnant patients were admitted with severe or critical COVID-19 at Massachusetts General Hospital from April to June 2020 and received inhalational nitric oxide therapy. All patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A total of 39 treatments was administered. An improvement in cardiopulmonary function was observed after commencing nitric oxide gas, as evidenced by an increase in systemic oxygenation in each administration session among those with evidence of baseline hypoxemia and reduction of tachypnea in all patients in each session. Three patients delivered a total of four neonates during hospitalization. At 28-day follow-up, all three patients were home and their newborns were in good condition. Three of the six patients remain pregnant after hospital discharge. Five patients had two negative test results on nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 within 28 days from admission. CONCLUSION: Nitric oxide at 160–200 ppm is easy to use, appears to be well tolerated, and might be of benefit in pregnant patients with COVID-19 with hypoxic respiratory failure.","Safaee Fakhr, Bijan; Wiegand, Steffen B.; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Gianni, Stefano; Morais, Caio C.

The remarkably high guanine content of the Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) genome prompted us to investigate both the presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the viral genome and the possibility to target them with G-quadruplex ligands to obtain anti-HSV-1 effects with a novel mechanism of action. Using biophysical, molecular biology and antiviral assays, we showed that the HSV-1 genome displays multiple clusters of repeated sequences that form very stable G-quadruplexes. These sequences are mainly located in the inverted repeats of the HSV-1 genome. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with the G-quadruplex ligand BRACO-19 induced inhibition of virus production. BRACO-19 was able to inhibit Taq polymerase processing at G-quadruplex forming sequences in the HSV-1 genome, and decreased intracellular viral DNA in infected cells. The last step targeted by BRACO-19 was viral DNA replication, while no effect on virus entry in the cells was observed. This work, presents the first evidence of extended G-quadruplex sites in key regions of the HSV-1 genome, indicates the possibility to block viral DNA replication by G-quadruplex-ligand and therefore provides a proof of concept for the use of G-quadruplex ligands as new anti-herpetic therapeutic options.","Artusi, Sara; Nadai, Matteo; Perrone, Rosalba; Biasolo, Maria Angela; Palù, Giorgio; Flamand, Louis; Calistri, Arianna; Richter, Sara N.",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354215000807; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354215000807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843424/,218

On the 14th October England introduced a three-tier system of regional restrictions in an attempt to control the epidemic. This lasted until the 5th November when a new national lockdown was imposed. Tier 1 was the least and tier 3 the most restrictive tiers. We used publicly available data of daily cases by local authority (local government areas) and estimated the reproductive rate (R value) of the epidemic over the previous 14 days at various time points after the imposition of the tier system or where local authorities were moved into higher tiers at time points after reallocation. At day 0 there vas very little difference in the R value between authorities in the different groups but by day 14 the R value in tier 3 authorities had fallen to about 0.9, in tier 2 to about 1.0 and in tier 1 the R value was about 1.5. The restrictions in tier 1 had little impact on transmission and allowed exponential growth in the large majority of authorities. By contrast the epidemic was declining in most tier 3 authorities. In tier 2, exponential growth was being seen in about half of authorities but declining in half. We concluded that the existing three tier system would have been sufficient to control the epidemic if all authorities had been moved out of tier 1 into tier 2 and there had been more rapid identification and transfer of those authorities where the epidemic was increasing out of tier 2 into tier 3. A more restrictive tier than tier 3 may be needed but only by a small number of authorities.","Hunter, P. R.; Brainard, J.

Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes spike (S) glycoproteins, which protrude from the surface of mature virions. The S glycoprotein plays essential roles in virus attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. Surface location of the S glycoprotein renders it a direct target for host immune responses, making it the main target of neutralizing antibodies. In the light of its crucial roles in viral infection and adaptive immunity, the S protein is the focus of most vaccine strategies as well as therapeutic interventions. In this review, we highlight and describe the recent progress that has been made in the biosynthesis, structure, function, and antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, aiming to provide valuable insights into the design and development of the S protein-based vaccines as well as therapeutics.","Duan, Liangwei; Zheng, Qianqian; Zhang, Hongxia; Niu, Yuna; Lou, Yunwei; Wang, Hui",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.576622; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117378/,218

In order to understand the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Sri Lanka, we carried out genomic sequencing overlaid on available epidemiological data. The B.1.411 lineage was most prevalent, which was established in Sri Lanka and caused outbreaks throughout the country. The estimated time of the most recent common ancestor of this lineage was 10th August 2020 (95% lower and upper bounds 6th July to 7th September), suggesting cryptic transmission may have occurred, prior to a large epidemic starting in October 2020. Returning travellers were identified with infections caused by lineage B.1.258 , as well as the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage.

The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. METHODS: This study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (2014–2016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected. Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection. The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoVs, and they are an important source of human infection with MERS.","Kasem, Samy; Qasim, Ibraheem; Al-Hufofi, Ali; Hashim, Osman; Alkarar, Ali; Abu-Obeida, Ali; Gaafer, Albagir; Elfadil, Abdelhamid; Zaki, Ahmed; Al-Romaihi, Ahmed; Babekr, Nasereldeen; El-Harby, Nadr; Hussien, Raed; AL-Sahaf, Ali; Al-Doweriej, Ali; Bayoumi, Faisal; Poon, Leo L.M.; Chu, Daniel K.W.; Peiris, Malik; Perera, Ranawaka A.P.M.",J Infect Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034117302575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993171/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2017.09.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034117302575,218

The present study intends to clarify the effect of these restrictions on emergency medical service (EMS) operations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of EMS operation protocols over the first 6 months of 2020 (n = 6668 rescue missions) in four rescue stations in eastern Lower Saxony (Germany). Description and statistical comparison of operations 6 weeks before the restrictions with an equally long period after the order of the restrictions (“lockdown”). RESULTS: During the 6 weeks after the lockdown the frequency of rescue operations decreased by 17.7%. In particular, there was a 40.6% (n = 91) decrease of emergency cases with respiratory diseases, mainly due to a decline of pneumonia and exacerbated chronic–obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). At the same time, patients’ mean age increased with fewer patients under 65 years. There were no changes in the frequency of psychiatric disorders, deceased or injured patients, or refusal of treatment and transport. A total of 67 patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV‑2 infection (1.0%) were observed during this period. DISCUSSION: EMS experienced a reduction of operations as a result of contact restrictions, although not as pronounced as was recently described for emergency rooms. This supports the hypothesis that the reduction is particularly evident in less severe cases and in younger patients. The reduction in pneumonia and COPD cases is striking. On the one hand, this could indicate that contact restrictions reduce the incidence of other respiratory infections and their impact on chronic respiratory disorders, but it could also mean that patients try to avoid hospital treatment.","Müller, Frank; Hummers, Eva; Jablonka, Alexandra; Schmidt, Tobias; Noack, Eva Maria",Notf Rett Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33903799/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10049-021-00873-1,218

METHODS: In this cross-sectional and correlational study conducted with 1216 individuals from different provinces of Turkey, the Perception of Causes of COVID-19 (PCa-COVID-19) Scale was used. In addition, a questionnaire including the participants’ descriptive characteristics, their attitudes towards vaccine and their level of trust in information sources about Covid-19 was used. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 35.9 ± 12.3 years. Of them, 62.5% were women, 59.0% were married, and 62.1% were university graduates. As for their view of having the Covid-19 vaccine, 54.1% thought to have it, 16.2% did not think, and 29.7% were undecided. Although the correlation was not significant, of the participants, those who considered having vaccination mostly trusted YouTube as their source of information. Of the participants, those whose level of trust in government institutions and health professionals was high displayed significantly more favorable attitudes towards vaccine. The participants obtained the highest mean score from the Conspiracy Theories subscale of the PCa-COVID-19 scale. There was a positive and low-level relationship between attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine, and the Conspiracy Theories (r: 0.214) and Faith Factors (r: 0.066) sub-dimensions of the PCa-COVID-19 Scale. CONCLUSIONS: The level of vaccine hesitancy in Turkey is at an alarming level, and the virus is defined by moderate conspiracy theories. In this context, in the fight against infodemic, it is critical to implement mechanisms that can reveal misinformation and to plan initiatives that can increase the health literacy levels of societies.

676823,Efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine (Kang-ai injection) as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis,2021-04-27,"Children with the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have milder symptoms and a better prognosis than adult patients. Several investigations assessed type I, II, and III interferon (IFN) signatures in SARS-CoV-2 infected adults, however no data are available for pediatric patients. TRIM28 and SETDB1 regulate the transcription of multiple genes involved in the immune response as well as of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Exogenous viral infections can trigger the activation of HERVs, which in turn can induce inflammatory and immune reactions. Despite the potential cross-talks between SARS-CoV-2 infection and TRIM28, SETDB1, and HERVs, information on their expressions in COVID-19 patients is lacking. We assessed, through a PCR real time Taqman amplification assay, the transcription levels of six IFN-I stimulated genes, IFN-II and three of its sensitive genes, three IFN-lIIs, as well as of TRIM28, SETDB1, pol genes of HERV-H, -K, and -W families, and of env genes of Syncytin (SYN)1, SYN2, and multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus (MRSV) in peripheral blood from COVID-19 children and in control uninfected subjects. Higher expression levels of IFN-I and IFN-II inducible genes were observed in 36 COVID-19 children with mild or moderate disease as compared to uninfected controls, whereas their concentrations decreased in 17 children with severe disease and in 11 with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Similar findings were found for the expression of TRIM-28, SETDB1, and every HERV gene. Positive correlations emerged between the transcriptional levels of type I and II IFNs, TRIM28, SETDB1, and HERVs in COVID-19 patients. IFN-III expressions were comparable in each group of subjects. This preserved induction of IFN-λs could contribute to the better control of the infection in children as compared to adults, in whom IFN-III deficiency has been reported. The upregulation of IFN-I, IFN-II, TRIM28, SETDB1, and HERVs in children with mild symptoms, their declines in severe cases or with MIS-C, and the positive correlations of their transcription in SARS-CoV-2-infected children suggest that they may play important roles in conditioning the evolution of the infection.","Tovo, Pier-Angelo; Garazzino, Silvia; Daprà, Valentina; Pruccoli, Giulia; Calvi, Cristina; Mignone, Federica; Alliaudi, Carla; Denina, Marco; Scolfaro, Carlo; Zoppo, Marisa; Licciardi, Francesco; Ramenghi, Ugo; Galliano, Ilaria; Bergallo, Massimiliano",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299101/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22147481,218

Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression. Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS). Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety. Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables. Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals’ mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders. Clinical psychologists should identify individuals’ particular cognition and mental disorders to provide a more accurate and adequate intervention for them.","Zhu, Yue; Zhang, Lihua; Zhou, Xia; Li, Chenxiang; Yang, Dong",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720330883?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316718/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720330883,218

This study investigates the clinical knowledge of healthcare workers about COVID-19, their ways of acquiring information, their emotional distress and risk perception, their adherence to preventive guidelines, their changed work situation due to the pandemic, and their perception of how the healthcare system has coped with the pandemic. It is based on a quantitative cross-sectional survey of 185 Swiss healthcare workers directly attending to patients during the pandemic, with 22% (n = 40) of them being assigned to COVID-19-infected patients. The participants answered between 16th June and 15th July 2020, shortly after the first wave of COVID-19 had been overcome and the national government had relaxed its preventive regulations to a great extent. The questionnaire incorporated parts of the “Standard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreak” (version 2015), which were adapted to the case of COVID-19. Clinical knowledge was lowest regarding the effectiveness of standard hygiene (p < 0.05). Knowledge of infectiousness, incubation time, and life-threatening disease progression was higher, however still significantly lower than regarding asymptomatic cases and transmission without physical contact (p < 0.001). 70% (95%-confidence interval: 64-77%) of the healthcare workers reported considerable emotional distress on at least one of the measured dimensions. They worried significantly more strongly about patients, elderly people, and family members, than about their own health (p < 0.001). Adherence to (not legally binding) preventive guidelines by the government displayed patterns such that not all guidelines were followed equally. Most of the participants were faced with a lack of protective materials, personnel, structures, processes, and contingency plans.

679126,Enhanced thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection,2021-04-04,"OBJECTIVES: Self-injurious behavior (SIB) refers to any repeated self-directed, non-suicidal, behavior that may cause or has the potential to cause physical harm to the person’s body. Behavioral interventions provide the standard evidence-based treatments for SIB by people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities (ID). Translating the proven effectiveness of behavioral interventions to treatment of self-injury in community settings by clinicians and caregivers has not been totally successful. The aim of the present study was to advance translational research by providing real-time telehealth consultation to a treatment team at a community-based mental health agency that provided inpatient and outpatient services to individuals with ASD and ID. METHOD: The participants of this single-case experimental study were three adolescents with ASD who had been referred for services because of their increasingly unmanageable SIB both at home and at school. The telehealth consultant provided real-time assistance to the treatment team within a translational model of care in the development and implementation of a behavior support plan and an informal mindfulness-based Soles of the Feet (SoF) program. RESULTS: Both visual and statistical analyses demonstrated reductions in the frequency of SIB for all three adolescents, with overall clinically significant reductions only with the SoF intervention. CONCLUSION: The results of this translational study suggest that telehealth consultation might be a viable technological alternative in situations which preclude face-to-face consultation. Telehealth consultation could be one method of supporting people with behavioral difficulties during pandemics, such as COVID-19.","Singh, Nirbhay N.; Lancioni, Giulio E.; Medvedev, Oleg N.; Hwang, Yoon-Suk; Myers, Rachel E.",Adv Neurodev Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490369/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41252-021-00192-z,218

We leverage an increase in balcony birdwatching, a million eBird entries, and difference-in-difference techniques to test if avian species richness rose during India’s COVID lockdown. We find that birdwatchers in India’s 20 most populous cities observed 8-17% more species during the lockdown. Most additional observations occurred after a two-week lag, signaling greater abundance instead of improved detection. More frequent appearances of at-risk, rare, and common species were recorded, implying that making our cities more wildlife friendly can protect threatened species in addition to urban specialists. Our contributions are: 1) to isolate and estimate a causal impact of reducing human activity on avian diversity, 2) to improve the external validity of this literature in rapidly urbanizing bio-diverse developing countries, and, 3) to illustrate a method separating abundance from detection in observational avian surveys.","Madhok, Raahil; Gulati, Sumeet",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422890,218

We clarified the relationship between psychological distress and the rate of prolonged sedentary bouts (PSBs) among the elderly over four periods. Methods: In a secondary analysis, a sample population of 68 adults aged 65 years or older in Japan was used. The following proxy variables were used: PSB (mental health) and the Kessler 6 scale; K6 scores (psychological distress). Results: Using the cross-lagged effects models, from “2016 K6” to “2017 PSB” (p = 0.004), from “2017 K6” to “2018 PSB” (p < 0.001), and from “2018 K6” to “2019 PSB” (p = 0.021) were all significant; however, the reverse were not all significant in one period. In four periods, from “2016 PSB” to “2019 K6” (p = 0.025) was significant; however, the reverse was not significant.

681689,Editorial: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): The Impact and Role of Mass Media During the Pandemic,2021-08-23,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence links COVID‐19 incidence and outcomes with vitamin D status. We investigated if an interaction existed between vitamin D levels and social deprivation in those with and without COVID‐19 infection. METHODS: Upper or lower respiratory tract samples from 104 patients were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in accordance with Public Health England criteria (January‐May 2020) using RT‐PCR. The latest serum total 25‐hydroxyvitamin D(25‐OHD) levels, quantified by LC‐MS/MS, was obtained for each patient (September 2019‐April 2020). Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was generated for each patient. Univariate and logistic regression analyses examined associations between age, gender, 25‐OHD, IMD score and SARS‐CoV‐2 result in the total cohort and subgroups. RESULTS: In the total cohort, a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test was significantly associated with lower 25‐OHD levels and higher IMD. A positive test was associated with higher IMD in the male subgroup and with lower 25‐OHD levels in those aged >72 years. Low 25‐OHD and IMD quintile 5 were separately associated with positive COVID‐19 outcome in the cohort. Patients in IMD quintile 5 with vitamin D levels ≤ 34.4 nmol/L were most likely to have a positive COVID‐19 outcome, even more so if aged >72 years (OR: 19.07, 95%CI: 1.71‐212.25; P = .016). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, combined low vitamin D levels and higher social deprivation were most associated with COVID‐19 infection. In older age, this combination was even more significant. Our data support the recommendations for normalising vitamin D levels in those with deficient / insufficient levels and in groups at high risk for deficiency.","Livingston, Mark; Plant, Aiden; Dunmore, Simon; Hartland, Andrew; Jones, Stephen; Laing, Ian; Ramachandran, Sudarshan",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797849/,218

The study tests the presence of regime changes in the GARCH volatility dynamics of the G7 stock indexes, Bitcoin, Gold, and energy assets (energy index, oil, and gas) by using the Markov–Switching GARCH model. It estimates the dynamic correlation and volatility spillover between energy and financial assets, by using the multivariate MSGARCH models. The estimation results of the Markov-Switching-BEKK-GARCH prove the volatility spillover from energy assets to financial assets. For the high regime, the results indicate a high level of dynamic correlation between energy assets and stock indexes which proves the contagion effect of the COVID-19. On the contrary, the dynamic conditional correlation between energy assets and Gold prices decreased during the COVID-19 crisis. This paper makes an original contribution in identifying the contagion between energy and financial assets and indicates that Gold is a safe haven for all energy and financial assets during the COVID-19 crisis. However, Bitcoin cannot be considered as a safe haven during the COVID-19 pandemic when investing in energy assets (crude oil and gas).","Ghorbel, Achraf; Jeribi, Ahmed",Eurasian Econ Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40822-021-00181-6,218

Currently, deep learning-based SISR approaches have been widely discussed in medical image processing, because of their potential to achieve high-quality, high spatial resolution images without the cost of additional scans. However, most existing methods are designed for scale-specific SR tasks and are unable to generalize over magnification scales. In this paper, we propose an approach for medical image arbitrary-scale super-resolution (MIASSR), in which we couple meta-learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to super-resolve medical images at any scale of magnification in [Formula: see text]. Compared to state-of-the-art SISR algorithms on single-modal magnetic resonance (MR) brain images (OASIS-brains) and multi-modal MR brain images (BraTS), MIASSR achieves comparable fidelity performance and the best perceptual quality with the smallest model size. We also employ transfer learning to enable MIASSR to tackle SR tasks of new medical modalities, such as cardiac MR images (ACDC) and chest computed tomography images (COVID-CT). The source code of our work is also public. Thus, MIASSR has the potential to become a new foundational pre-/post-processing step in clinical image analysis tasks such as reconstruction, image quality enhancement, and segmentation.","Zhu, Jin; Tan, Chuan; Yang, Junwei; Yang, Guang; Lio039,; Pietro,",Int J Neural Syst,https://doi.org/10.1142/s0129065721500374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34304719/,218

METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched from December-31, 2019 to April-23, 2020. The search was limited to the studies that reported the data on the number of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers, among the COVID-19 positive patients. Case reports, duplicate publications, reviews, and family-based studies were excluded. The methodological quality of studies was assessed by the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) tool. RESULTS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pooled eleven studies to investigate the above factors. The overall proportion of HCW who were SARS-CoV-2 positive among all COVID-19 patients was 10.1% (95%CI: 5.3–14.9). This proportion varied according to the country of study i.e. China (7 studies) - 4.2%, 95%CI:2.4–6.0; United States (3 studies) – 17.8%, 95%CI:7.5–28.0; and Italy (1 study) – 9.0%, 95%CI:8.6–9.4. The incidence of severe or critical disease in HCW (9.9%, 95%CI:0.8–18.9) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than the incidence of severe or critical disease in all COVID-19 positive patients (29.4%, 95%CI:18.6–40.2). Similarly, the mortality among HCW (0.3%, 95%CI:0.2–0.4) was also significantly lower (p < 0.001) as compared to that of all patients (2.3%, 95%CI:2.2–2.4).

Second, these responses can be understood as a form of “emergency Keynesianism,” which is characterized by the massive use of deficit spending during economic crises, with the aim of to supporting rather than challenging core capitalist institutions.

A retrospective cohort study,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Public health measures, such as social isolation, are vital to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but such measures may increase the risk of depression. Thus, this study examines the influencing and moderating factors of depressive symptoms among individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted to collect data from people under mandatory home or centralized social isolation in Shenzhen, China, from February 28 to March 6, 2020. The perceived risk of infection with COVID-19, perceived tone of media coverage, perceived quality of people-oriented public health services, and their depressive symptoms were assessed. Three rounds of stepwise multiple regression were performed to examine the moderating effects after controlling various variables, such as demographics, duration and venue of mandatory social isolation, infection and isolation status of family, time spent on COVID-related news, and online social support. RESULTS: Among the 340 participants, 57.6% were men, the average age was 35.5 years old (SD = 8.37), and 55.6% held a bachelor’s degree or above. Individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation generally reported low levels of depressive symptoms. Perceived susceptibility to infection was relatively low, whereas perceived tone of media coverage was mainly positive. In terms of perceived quality of public health services, 12 (3.5%), 103 (30.3%), and 225 (66.2%) participants reported low, medium, and high quality of people-oriented services, respectively. Perceived susceptibility was positively associated with depression, whereas perceived tone of media coverage was negatively associated. The quality of people-centered public health services moderated the association between perceived risk and depressive symptoms and between perceived tone of media coverage and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the depressive symptoms among individuals subjected to mandatory social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted that frontline public health workers play a critical role in protecting public mental health.

687999,ST-Segment Elevation in Patients with Covid-19 — A Case Series,2020-04-17,"Interferon inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are one of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that restrict entry of enveloped viruses, including flaviviruses, filoviruses and retroviruses. It has been recently reported that in U87 glioblastoma cells IFITM proteins inhibit HIV-1 entry in a co-receptor-dependent manner, that is, IFITM1 is more inhibitory on CCR5 tropic HIV-1 whereas IFITM2/3 confers a greater suppression of CXCR4 counterparts. However, how entry of HIV-1 with distinct co-receptor usage is modulated by different IFITM orthologs in physiologically relevant CD4(+) T cells and monocytes/macrophages has not been investigated in detail. Here, we report that overexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in human CD4(+) HuT78 cells, SupT1 cells, monocytic THP-1 cells and U87 cells expressing CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.3 and HXB2, CCR5 tropic viruses AD8 and JRFL, dual tropic 89.6 virus, as well as a panel of 32 transmitted founder (T/F) viruses, with a consistent order of potency, that is, IFITM3 > IFITM2 > IFITM1. Consistent with previous reports, we found that some CCR5-using HIV-1 isolates, such as AD8 and JRFL, were relatively resistant to inhibition by IFITM2 and IFITM3, although the effect can be cell-type dependent. However, in no case have we observed that IFITM1 had a stronger inhibition on entry of any HIV-1 strains tested, including those of CCR5-using T/Fs. We knocked down the endogenous IFITMs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and purified CD4(+) T cells and observed that, while this treatment did greatly enhance the multiple-round of HIV-1 replication but had modest effect to rescue the single-round HIV-1 infection, reinforcing our previous conclusion that the predominant effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 infection is in viral producer cells, rather than in target cells to block viral entry. Overall, our results argue against the idea that IFITM proteins distinguish co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to inhibit entry but emphasize that the predominant role of IFITMs on HIV-1 is in producer cells that intrinsically impair the viral infectivity.","Yu, Jingyou; Liu, Shan-Lu",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v10080413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30087232/,218

We investigated the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 21 consecutive patients with clinically definite MS to produce interferons and lymphokines in response to viral or mitogenic stimulation. Ten patients showed clinical signs of disease activity (acute relapse) and 11 patients were in a stable condition. Additionally, white blood count, leukocyte differentiation and lymphocyte subtyping were performed. A group of age-related healthy blood donors served as control (n=20). There was no difference between patients and controls in the production of IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor. IFN-α and IFN-β responsiveness, however, was significantly lower in patients with stable disease than in patients with active disease and controls (p<0.001). Furthermore, secretion of IL-2 after stimulation was significantly diminished in both patient groups as compared to the control group (p<0.01). Analysis of T-cell subsets revealed a significantly lower amount of CD8(+) T-cells in patients with stable disease, leading to a significantly higher CD4/CD8 ratio in this group as compared to patients with active disease. Our study depicted an IL-2 deficiency in MS patients which is shared with other autoimmune diseases. In addition, our findings suggest that the ability to produce type-I IFNs, IFN-α and IFN-β, is primarily impaired in MS patients and changes in correlation to the course of disease activity.","Wandinger, Klaus-Peter; Wessel, Karl; Neustock, Petra; Siekhaus, Aja; Kirchner, Holger",J Neurol Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X97053835; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X97053835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9168171/,218

We set out to investigate whether participants in Virus Watch - a large community cohort study based in England and Wales - reported different levels of exposure to public activities and non-household contacts during the Autumn-Winter phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic deprivation. Methods: Participants (n=20120-25228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during three weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020, and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was quantified based on participants' postcode of residence using English or Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public activities during each survey period. Results: Relative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas persistently exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (aRR range across time points 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR 3.13-5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR 1.09-1.21), essential shops (aRR 1.09-1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR 1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods. Conclusion: Differential exposure to essential public activities in deprived communities is likely to contribute to inequalities in infection risk and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

689072,Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure Hospitalized With COVID-19,2020-12-28,"BACKGROUND: Ribonuclease III (RNase III) activity modulates hundreds of genes in Escherichia coli (E. coli). YmdB, a member of the macrodomain protein family, is one of known trans-acting regulators of RNase III activity; however, the significance of its regulatory role in specific bacterial cellular processes and related genes has not been determined. YmdB overexpression was used to model YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified gene targets and cellular processes related to RNase III inhibition. RESULTS: The expression of >2,000 E. coli genes was modulated by YmdB induction; 129 genes were strongly regulated, of which 80 have not been reported as RNase III targets. Of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. Significantly, YmdB overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon RNase III inhibition. Moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by RpoS, a known stress response regulator and biofilm inhibitor, and by YmdB. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first global profile of target genes modulated by YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in E. coli, and the data reveal a novel, hitherto unrecognized regulatory role for YmdB in biofilm modulation.","Kim, Taeyeon; Lee, Juyeon; Kim, Kwang-sun",BMC Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-13-266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267348/,218

689907,Can mHealth interventions improve quality of life of cancer patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-10-20,"Due to its ability to reflect the capacity to engage in context-appropriate responses, tonic heart rate variability (HRV) is considered a putative biomarker of stress resilience. However, most studies are cross-sectional, precluding causal inferences. The high levels of uncertainty and fear at a global level that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to investigate the longitudinal role of HRV in stress resilience. The present study examined whether HRV, measured about 2 years earlier (Time 0), could predict emotion regulation strategies and daily affect in healthy adults during the May 2020 lockdown (Time 1). Moreover, we evaluated the association between HRV measures, emotion regulation strategies, subjective perception of COVID-19 risk, and self-reported depressive symptoms at Time 1. Higher tonic HRV at Time 0 resulted a significant predictor of a stronger engagement in more functional emotion regulation strategies, as well as of higher daily feelings of safeness and reduced daily worry at Time 1. Moreover, depressive symptoms negatively correlated with HRV and positively correlated with the subjective perception of COVID-19 risk at Time 1. Current data support the view that HRV might be not only a marker but also a precursor of resilience under stressful times.","Makovac, E.; Carnevali, L.; Hernandez-Medina, S.; Sgoifo, A.; Petrocchi, N.; Ottaviani, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.17.21259071; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.21259071v1?rss=1,218

690450,Efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID‐19: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,2021-02-05,"We describe the results of testing health care workers, from a tertiary care hospital in Japan that had experienced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak during the first peak of the pandemic, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody seroconversion. Using two chemiluminescent immunoassays and a confirmatory surrogate virus neutralization test, serological testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses (27/64 cases) occurred when case detection relied solely on SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Our results suggest that the NAAT-positive population is only the tip of the iceberg and the portion left undetected might potentially have led to silent transmissions and triggered the spread. A questionnaire-based risk assessment was further indicative of exposures to specific aerosol-generating procedures (i.e., noninvasive ventilation and airway suctioning) having mediated transmission and served as the origins of the outbreak. Our observations are supportive of a multitiered testing approach, including the use of serological diagnostics, in order to accomplish exhaustive case detection along the whole COVID-19 spectrum. IMPORTANCE We describe the results of testing frontline health care workers, from a hospital in Japan that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Antibody testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses occurred when case detection relied solely on PCR-based viral detection. COVID-19 clusters have been continuously striking the health care system around the globe. Our findings illustrate that such clusters are lined with hidden infections eluding detection with diagnostic PCR and that the cluster burden in total is more immense than actually recognized. The mainstays of diagnosing infectious diseases, including COVID-19, generally consist of two approaches, one aiming to detect molecular fragments of the invading pathogen and the other to measure immune responses of the host. Considering antibody testing as one trustworthy option to test our way through the pandemic can aid in the exhaustive case detection of COVID-19 patients with variable presentations.","Nakagama, Yu; Komase, Yuko; Candray, Katherine; Nakagama, Sachie; Sano, Fumiaki; Tsuchida, Tomoya; Kunishima, Hiroyuki; Imai, Takumi; Shintani, Ayumi; Nitahara, Yuko; Kaku, Natsuko; Kido, Yasutoshi",Microbiol Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01082-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34550021/,218
690552,Use of Ivermectin is Associated with Lower Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 (ICON study),2020-10-13,"Background With the emergence of 4rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered a new period. We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). Conclusions The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.","Chen, Zhaowei; Hu, Jijia; Zhang, Zongwei; Jiang, Shan; Wang, Tao; Shi, Zhengli; Zhang, Zhan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.20030833,218
