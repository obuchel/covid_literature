264,Regulation of the apoptosis-inducing kinase DRAK2 by cyclooxygenase-2 in colorectal cancer,2009-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is over-expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), rendering tumour cells resistant to apoptosis. Selective COX-2 inhibition is effective in CRC prevention, although having adverse cardiovascular effects, thus focus has shifted to downstream pathways. METHODS: Microarray experiments identified genes regulated by COX-2 in HCA7 CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo regulation of DRAK2 (DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2 or STK17β, an apoptosis-inducing kinase) by COX-2 was validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Inhibition of COX-2 induced apoptosis and enhanced DRAK2 expression in HCA7 cells (4.4-fold increase at 4 h by qRT-PCR, P=0.001), an effect prevented by co-administration of PGE(2). DRAK2 levels were suppressed in a panel of human colorectal tumours (n=10) compared to normal mucosa, and showed inverse correlation with COX-2 expression (R=−0.68, R(2)=0.46, P=0.03). Administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib to patients with CRC (n=5) induced DRAK2 expression in tumours (2.5-fold increase, P=0.01). In vitro silencing of DRAK2 by RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival following COX-2 inhibitor treatment. CONCLUSION: DRAK2 is a serine–threonine kinase implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and is negatively regulated by COX-2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism for the effect of COX-2 on cancer cell survival.","Doherty, G A; Byrne, S M; Austin, S C; Scully, G M; Sadlier, D M; Neilan, T G; Kay, E W; Murray, F E; Fitzgerald, D J",Br J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720240/,129
1804,The association of polymorphisms of TLR4 and CD14 genes with susceptibility to sepsis in a Chinese population,2014-11-14,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is now the leading cause of death in the non-cardiovascular intensive care unit (ICU). Recent research suggests that sepsis is likely to be due to an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Genetic mutations of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) genes are involved in the immune and (or) inflammatory response. These may contribute to the susceptibility to sepsis in patients. This study was designed to evaluate whether the TLR4 and cluster CD14 gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to sepsis. METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR4 (rs10759932, rs11536889, rs7873784, rs12377632, rs1927907, rs1153879) and CD14 (rs2569190 and rs2563298) in patients with sepsis and control subjects in the Guangxi Province were analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction-single base extension (PCR-SBE) and DNA sequencing methods. RESULTS: The rs11536889 polymorphism in TLR4 and rs2563298 polymorphism in CD14 were significantly associated with the risk of sepsis when compared to the control group. The frequencies of rs11536889 and rs2563298 polymorphisms in the group with sepsis were higher than that in the control group (OR = 1.430, 95% CI, 1.032-1.981, P<0.05; OR = 2.454, 95% CI, 1.458-4.130, P<0.05, respectively). Followed up haplotype analysis suggested that there were two haplotypes in which increased risk factors for sepsis were indicated. CONCLUSIONS: The rs11536889 polymorphism in TLR4 and rs2563298 polymorphism in CD14, and two haplotypes were associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis.","Wang, Haiyan; Wei, Yesheng; Zeng, Yi; Qin, Yueqiu; Xiong, Bin; Qin, Gang; Li, Jun; Hu, Donghai; Qiu, Xiaowen; Sooranna, Suren R; Pinhu, Liao",BMC Med Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411696/,129
2126,Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and kidney fibrosis in diabetes,2016-02-13,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease worldwide and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Recent evidence revealed that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors may exhibit a protective effect against DN. In fact, the kidney is the organ where the DPP-4 activity is the highest level per organ weight. A preclinical analysis revealed that DPP-4 inhibitors also ameliorated kidney fibrosis. In this review, we analyzed recent reports in this field and explore the renoprotective effects and possible mechanism of the DPP-4 inhibitors.","Shi, Sen; Koya, Daisuke; Kanasaki, Keizo",Fibrogenesis Tissue Repair,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752740/,129

2657,Decreased Levels of Foldase and Chaperone Proteins Are Associated with an Early-Onset Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,2017-04-06,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. One of the peculiar clinical characteristics of ALS is the wide distribution in age of onset, which is probably caused by different combinations of intrinsic and exogenous factors. We investigated whether these modifying factors are converging into common pathogenic pathways leading either to an early or a late disease onset. This would imply the identification of phenotypic biomarkers, that can distinguish the two populations of ALS patients, and of relevant pathways to consider in a therapeutic intervention. Toward this aim a differential proteomic analysis was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset ≤55 years and a group of 16 ALS patients with an age of onset ≥75 years, and matched healthy controls. We identified 43 differentially expressed proteins in the two groups of patients. Gene ontology analysis revealed that there was a significant enrichment in annotations associated with protein folding and response to stress. We next validated a selected number of proteins belonging to this functional group in 85 patients and 83 age- and sex-matched healthy controls using immunoassays. The results of the validation study confirmed that there was a decreased level of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (also known as cyclophilin A), heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (also known as BiP) and protein deglycase DJ-1 in PBMC of ALS patients with an early onset. Similar results were obtained in PBMC and spinal cord from two SOD1(G93A) mouse models with an early and late disease onset. This study suggests that a different ability to upregulate proteins involved in proteostasis, such as foldase and chaperone proteins, may be at the basis of a different susceptibility to ALS, putting forward the development of therapeutic approaches aiming at boosting the protein quality control system.","Filareti, Melania; Luotti, Silvia; Pasetto, Laura; Pignataro, Mauro; Paolella, Katia; Messina, Paolo; Pupillo, Elisabetta; Filosto, Massimiliano; Lunetta, Christian; Mandrioli, Jessica; Fuda, Giuseppe; Calvo, Andrea; Chiò, Adriano; Corbo, Massimo; Bendotti, Caterina; Beghi, Ettore; Bonetto, Valentina",Front Mol Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382314/,129
2890,The Role of Na/K-ATPase Signaling in Oxidative Stress Related to Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease,2016-09-03,"Na/K-ATPase has been extensively studied for its ion pumping function, but, in the past several decades, has been identified as a scaffolding and signaling protein. Initially it was found that cardiotonic steroids (CTS) mediate signal transduction through the Na/K-ATPase and result in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are also capable of initiating the signal cascade. However, in recent years, this Na/K-ATPase/ROS amplification loop has demonstrated significance in oxidative stress related disease states, including obesity, atherosclerosis, heart failure, uremic cardiomyopathy, and hypertension. The discovery of this novel oxidative stress signaling pathway, holds significant therapeutic potential for the aforementioned conditions and others that are rooted in ROS.","Srikanthan, Krithika; Shapiro, Joseph I.; Sodhi, Komal",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5642908/,129
2919,Novel prostate cancer immunotherapy with a DNA-encoded anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen monoclonal antibody,2017-08-17,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed at high levels on malignant prostate cells and is likely an important therapeutic target for the treatment of prostate carcinoma. Current immunotherapy approaches to target PSMA include peptide, cell, vector or DNA-based vaccines as well as passive administration of PSMA-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Conventional mAb immunotherapy has numerous logistical and practical limitations, including high production costs and a requirement for frequent dosing due to short mAb serum half-life. In this report, we describe a novel strategy of antibody-based immunotherapy against prostate carcinoma that utilizes synthetic DNA plasmids that encode a therapeutic human mAb that target PSMA. Electroporation-enhanced intramuscular injection of the DNA-encoded mAb (DMAb) plasmid into mice led to the production of functional and durable levels of the anti-PSMA antibody. The anti-PSMA produced in vivo controlled tumor growth and prolonged survival in a mouse model. This is likely mediated by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect with the aid of NK cells. Further study of this novel approach for treatment of human prostate disease and other malignant conditions is warranted.","Muthumani, Kar; Marnin, Liron; Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Perales-Puchalt, Alfredo; Choi, Hyeree; Agarwal, Sangya; Scott, Veronica L.; Reuschel, Emma L.; Zaidi, Faraz I.; Duperret, Elizabeth K.; Wise, Megan C.; Kraynyak, Kimberly A.; Ugen, Kenneth.

3159,Molecularly specific detection of bacterial lipoteichoic acid for diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection of the bone,2018-04-25,"Discriminating sterile inflammation from infection, especially in cases of aseptic loosening versus an actual prosthetic joint infection, is challenging and has significant treatment implications. Our goal was to evaluate a novel human monoclonal antibody (mAb) probe directed against the Gram-positive bacterial surface molecule lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Specificity and affinity were assessed in vitro. We then radiolabeled the anti-LTA mAb and evaluated its effectiveness as a diagnostic imaging tool for detecting infection via immunoPET imaging in an in vivo mouse model of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). In vitro and ex vivo binding of the anti-LTA mAb to pathogenic bacteria was measured with Octet, ELISA, and flow cytometry. The in vivo PJI mouse model was assessed using traditional imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET) with [(18)F]FDG and [(18)F]NaF as well as X-ray computed tomography (CT), before being evaluated with the zirconium-89-labeled antibody specific for LTA ([(89)Zr]SAC55). The anti-LTA mAb exhibited specific binding in vitro to LTA-expressing bacteria. Results from imaging showed that our model could reliably simulate infection at the surgical site by bioluminescent imaging, conventional PET tracer imaging, and bone morphological changes by CT. One day following injection of both the radiolabeled anti-LTA and isotype control antibodies, the anti-LTA antibody demonstrated significantly greater (P < 0.05) uptake at S. aureus-infected prosthesis sites over either the same antibody at sterile prosthesis sites or of control non-specific antibody at infected prosthesis sites. Taken together, the radiolabeled anti-LTA mAb, [(89)Zr]SAC55, may serve as a valuable diagnostic molecular imaging probe to help distinguish between sterile inflammation and infection in the setting of PJI. Future studies are needed to determine whether these findings will translate to human PJI.","Pickett, Julie E.; Thompson, John M.; Sadowska, Agnieszka; Tkaczyk, Christine; Sellman, Bret R.; Minola, Andrea; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Miller, Lloyd S.; Thorek, Daniel LJ",Bone Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5916877/,129
3177,"Mutation of IFNLR1, an interferon lambda receptor 1, is associated with autosomal-dominant non-syndromic hearing loss",2018-02-16,"Background Hereditary sensorineural hearing loss is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Objectives This study was designed to explore the genetic etiology of deafness in a large Chinese family with autosomal dominant, nonsyndromic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss (ADNSHL). Methods Whole exome sequencing and linkage analysis were performed to identify pathogenic mutation. Inner ear expression of Ifnlr1 was investigated by immunostaining in mice. ifnlr1 Morpholino knockdown Zebrafish were constructed to explore the deafness mechanism. Results We identified a cosegregating heterozygous missense mutation, c.296G>A (p.Arg99His) in the gene encoding interferon lambda receptor 1 (IFNLR1) – a protein that functions in the Jak/ STAT pathway– are associated with ADNSHL. Morpholino knockdown of ifnlr1 leads to a significant decrease in hair cells and non-inflation of the swim bladder in late-stage zebrafish, which can be reversed by injection with normal Zebrafish ifnlr1 mRNA. Knockdown of ifnlr1 in zebrafish causes significant upregulation of cytokine receptor family member b4 (interleukin-10r2), jak1, tyrosine kinase 2, stat3, and stat5b in the Jak1/STAT3 pathway at the mRNA level. Conclusion IFNLR1 function is required in the auditory system and that IFNLR1 mutations are associated with ADNSHL.

3497,"Soluble immune checkpoints in cancer: production, function and biological significance",2018-11-27,"Immune checkpoints play important roles in immune regulation, and blocking immune checkpoints on the cell membrane is a promising strategy in the treatment of cancer. Based on this, monoclonal antibodies are having much rapid development, such as those against CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1).But the cost of preparation of monoclonal antibodies is too high and the therapeutic effect is still under restrictions. Recently, a series of soluble immune checkpoints have been found such as sCTLA-4 (soluble CTLA-4) and sPD-1 (soluble PD-1). They are functional parts of membrane immune checkpoints produced in different ways and can be secreted by immune cells. Moreover, these soluble checkpoints can diffuse in the serum. Much evidence has demonstrated that these soluble checkpoints are involved in positive or negative immune regulation and that changes in their plasma levels affect the development, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Since they are endogenous molecules, they will not induce immunological rejection in human beings, which might make up for the deficiencies of monoclonal antibodies and enhance the utility value of these molecules. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investigating novel soluble checkpoints and their functions, and it is promising to develop relevant therapies in the future. In this review, we describe the production mechanisms and functions of various soluble immune checkpoint receptors and ligands and discuss their biological significance in regard to biomarkers, potential candidate drugs, therapeutic targets, and other topics.","Gu, Daqian; Ao, Xiang; Yang, Yu; Chen, Zhuo; Xu, Xiang",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6260693/,129

4250,Imaging of tumour response to immunotherapy,2020-01-03,"A wide range of cancer immunotherapy approaches has been developed including non-specific immune-stimulants such as cytokines, cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and adoptive T cell therapy. Among them, ICIs are the most commonly used and intensively studied. Since 2011, these drugs have received marketing authorisation for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal, and head and neck cancers, with remarkable and long-lasting treatment response in some patients. The novel mechanism of action of ICIs, with immune and T cell activation, leads to unusual patterns of response on imaging, with the advent of so-called pseudoprogression being more pronounced and frequently observed when compared to other anticancer therapies. Pseudoprogression, described in about 2–10% of patients treated with ICIs, corresponds to an increase of tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions due to infiltration by activated T cells before the disease responds to therapy. To overcome the limitation of response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) to assess these specific changes, new imaging criteria—so-called immune-related response criteria and then immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)—were proposed. The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions into disease assessments and the need for a 4-week re-assessment to confirm or not confirm progression. The RECIST working group introduced the new concept of “unconfirmed progression”, into the irRECIST. This paper reviews current immunotherapeutic approaches and summarises radiologic criteria to evaluate new patterns of response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, imaging features of immunotherapy-related adverse events and available predictive biomarkers of response are presented.","Dromain, Clarisse; Beigelman, Catherine; Pozzessere, Chiara; Duran, Rafael; Digklia, Antonia",Eur Radiol Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942076/,129

To differentiate eggs from different hookworm species, it is necessary to use molecular methodologies, since the eggs are morphologically similar. Here, we performed the molecular identification of single hookworm eggs from six Brazilian states. Of the 634 eggs individually analyzed, 98.1% (622/634) represented Necator americanus, and surprisingly, 1.9% (12/634 eggs from the same patient) represented Ancylostoma caninum. DNA analysis of the A. caninum-positive stool sample revealed no contamination with animal feces. This is the first report of the presence of A. caninum eggs in human feces, which may have a direct implication for the epidemiology of hookworm infection caused by this species. This suggests the need for special attention regarding prophylaxis, as different reservoirs, previously not described, may have great relevance for the spread of A. caninum.","Furtado, Luis Fernando Viana; Dias, Lucas Teixeira de Oliveira; Rodrigues, Thais de Oliveira; Silva, Vivian Jordania da; Oliveira, Valéria Nayara Gomes Mendes de; Rabelo, Élida Mara Leite",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033205/,129

As a result, this study employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) to explore the relative technical efficiency of LHDs operating in the United States using 2005 data. The DEA indicates that the typical LHD operates with about 28% inefficiency although inefficiency runs as high as 69% for some LHDs. Multiple regression analysis reveals that more centralized and urban LHDs are less efficient at producing local public health services. The findings also suggest that efficiency is higher for LHDs that produce a greater variety of services internally and rely more on internal funding. However, because this is the first study of LHD efficiency and some shortcomings exist with the available data, we are reluctant to draw strong policy conclusions from the analysis.","Mukherjee, Kankana; Santerre, Rexford E.; Zhang, Ning Jackie",Health Care Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087578/,129

A policy analysis of the integration into Public Health is completed by merging findings from 48 key informant interviews conducted with government, civil society, and food supply chain representatives involved in the initiatives along with relevant documents and participant/direct observations. The paper then examines the results within the context of historic and international trends and theoretical models of food policy, community food security, and applied policy research. Public Health re-emerged as a driver of food security in BC—both as a key player and in positing the public’s health as a driver in food security and food systems. While Public Health’s lead role supported an increase in legitimacy for food security in BC, interviewees described a clash of cultures between Public Health and civil society. The clash of cultures occurred partly as a result of Public Health’s limited food security mandate and top down approach. Consequently civil society voice at the provincial level was marginalized. A social policy movement toward a new political paradigm—regulatory pluralism—calls for greater engagement of civil society, and for all sectors to work together toward common goals. A new, emerging policy map is proposed for analyzing the dynamics of food security and health promotion initiatives in BC.","Seed, Barbara; Lang, Tim; Caraher, Martin; Ostry, Aleck",Agric Human Values,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087988/,129
5239,Experimental Biology for the Identification of Causal Pathways in Atherosclerosis,2016-02-05,"The transposase encoded by insertion sequence IS 1 is produced from two out-of-phase reading frames (insA and B′-insB) by translational frameshifting, which occurs within a run of six adenines in the −1 direction. To determine the sequence essential for frameshifting, substitution mutations were introduced within the region containing the run of adenines and were examined for their effects on frameshifting. Substitutions at each of three (2nd, 3rd and 4th) adenine residues in the run, which are recognized by tRNA(Lys) reading insA, caused serious defects in frameshifting, showing that the three adenine residues are essential for frameshifting. The effects of substitution mutations introduced in the region flanking the run of adenines and in the secondary structures located downstream were, however, small, indicating that such a region and structures are not essential for frameshifting. Deletion of a region containing the termination codon of insA caused a decrease in β-galactosidase activity specified by the lacZ fusion plasmid in frame with B′-insB. Exchange of the wild-type termination codon of insA for a different one or introduction of an additional termination codon in the region upstream of the native termination codon caused an increase in β-galactosidase activity, indicating that the termination codon in insA affects the efficiency of frameshifting.","Sekine, Yasuhiko; Ohtsubo, Eiichi",Mol Gen Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088269/,129

METHODS: A consensus conference on the spectrum of lung–kidney interactions in critical illness was held under the auspices of the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) in Innsbruck, Austria, in June 2018. Through review and critical appraisal of the available evidence, the current state of research, and both clinical and research recommendations were described on the following topics: epidemiology, pathophysiology and strategies to mitigate pulmonary dysfunction among patients with acute kidney injury and/or kidney dysfunction among patients with acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, emphasis was put on patients receiving organ support (RRT, IMV and/or ECMO) and its impact on lung and kidney function. CONCLUSION: The ADQI 21 conference found significant knowledge gaps about organ crosstalk between lung and kidney and its relevance for critically ill patients. Lung protective ventilation, conservative fluid management and early recognition and treatment of pulmonary infections were the only clinical recommendations with higher quality of evidence. Recommendations for research were formulated, targeting lung–kidney interactions to improve care processes and outcomes in critical illness.

This report presents information on zoonotic pathogens in animal wastes and the generation, fate, and transport of bioaerosols associated with animal feeding operations and land applied manures. Though many bioaerosol studies have been conducted at animal production facilities, few have investigated the transport of bioaerosols during the land application of animal manures. As communities in rural areas converge with land application sites, concerns over bioaerosol exposure will certainly increase. Although most studies at animal operations and wastewater spray irrigation sites suggest a decreased risk of bioaerosol exposure with increasing distance from the source, many challenges remain in evaluating the health effects of aerosolized pathogens and allergens in outdoor environments. To improve our ability to understand the off-site transport and diffusion of human and livestock diseases, various dispersion models have been utilized. Most studies investigating the transport of bioaerosols during land application events have used a modified Gaussian plume model. Because of the disparity among collection and analytical techniques utilized in outdoor studies, it is often difficult to evaluate health effects associated with aerosolized pathogens and allergens. Invaluable improvements in assessing the health effects from intensive livestock practices could be made if standardized bioaerosol collection and analytical techniques, as well as the use of specific target microorganisms, were adopted.","Dungan, R.

8135,Is routine evaluation of gastric residuals for premature infants safe or effective?,2020-01-07,"Fresh TiO(2) was found to possess a strong germicidal activity even without UV irradiation. Live Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh TiO(2) were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. The cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm(−1) in FT-IR spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh TiO(2) to cells. The deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst and release of intracellular materials. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the wetting property of TiO(2). Cells are negatively charged, for Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Gram-positive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO(2) gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the wetting property decreased. This kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO(2) or Ag(+). This shed light on designing new germicidal material either maintained by visible light irradiation, or by oxidation effect generated by reactive oxygen species.","LIU, Lifen; John, Barford; YEUNG, King Lun",J Environ Sci (China),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128095/,129

9752,Epidemiology of encephalitis in children: A 20‐Year survey,2004-10-08,"Infectious agents have been postulated as causes of multiple sclerosis for over a century. The possible role of a virus or viruses is supported by data that (1) a childhood exposure is involved and “viral” infections may precipitate exacerbations of disease, (2) experimental infections in animals and natural infections in humans can cause diseases with long incubation periods, remitting and relapsing courses, and demyelination, and (3) patients with multiple sclerosis have abnormal immune responses to viruses. The pathogenesis of three human demyelinating diseases of known viral etiology is discussed. In progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a papovavirus selectively infects oligodendrocytes and causes focal areas of demyelination. In postmeasles encephalomyelitis, the virus is lymphotrophic and disrupts immune regulation that can result in an autoimmune perivenular demyelinating illness without evidence of infection of the central nervous system. In human immunodeficiency virus‐encephalopathy and myelopathy virus is present in macrophages and microglia and the myelin abnormalities apparently are caused by soluble factors such as viral proteins, cytokines, or neurotoxins. These findings may have implications on how, when, and where to seek viruses in multiple sclerosis.","Johnson, Richard T.",Ann Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159614/,129

The prevalence rate per 100,000 was equal to 40. Data on the past medical history of 63 MS patients and matched controls were collected. The frequency and age at occurrence of common childhood infections were similar for both the MS cases and controls. There was no difference between the frequency of vaccination for MS patients and for controls. However, the age at which MS patients were immunized against poliomyelitis was significantly higher than the corresponding age for controls (15.8 years versus 8.9 years, P < 0.01). Antibody titers for various viruses were measured. The mumps antibody titer was significantly higher in the MS patients than in the controls. Also, MS patients tended to have higher titers for measles antibodies.","Berr, C.; Puel, J.; Clanet, M.; Ruidavets, J. B.; Mas, J.

10188,Urinary club cell protein 16 (CC16): Utility of its assay during acute bronchiolitis,2019-11-26,"Enveloped animal viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human papillomavirus, Marburg, and influenza are major public health concerns around the world. The prohibitive cost of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for most HIV‐infected patients in sub‐Saharan Africa and the serious side effects in those who have access to ARV drugs make a compelling case for the study of complementary and alternative therapies. Such therapies should have scientifically proved antiviral activity and minimal toxic effects. A plant extract, Secomet‐V, with an anecdotal indication in humans for promise as an anti‐HIV treatment, was investigated. Using a previously described attenuated vaccinia virus vGK5, we established the antiviral activity of Secomet‐V. Chemical analysis showed that it has an acidic pH, nontoxic traces of iron (<10 ppm), and almost undetectable levels of arsenic (<1.0 ppm). The color varies from colorless to pale yellow to dark brown. The active agent is heat stable at least up to sterilizing temperature of 121°C. The crude plant extract is a mixture of several small molecules separable by high‐pressure liquid chromatography. The HIV viral loads were significantly reduced over several months in a few patients monitored after treatment with Secomet‐V. Secomet‐V was also found to have antiviral activity against the SARS virus but not against the West Nile virus. Secomet‐V, therefore, is a broad‐spectrum antiviral, which possibly works by neutralizing viral infectivity, resulting in the prevention of viral attachment.","KOTWAL, GIRISH J.; KACZMAREK, JENNIFER N.; LEIVERS, STEVEN; GHEBREMARIAM, YOHANNES T.; KULKARNI, AMOD P.; BAUER, GABRIELE; DE BEER, CORENA; PREISER, WOLFGANG; MOHAMED, ABDU RAHMAN",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167892/,129

10762,Inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy: Etiology and clinical management,2020-03-02,"BACKGROUND: One hundred years ago, marine organisms were the dominant systems for the study of developmental biology. The challenges in rearing these organisms outside of a marine setting ultimately contributed to a shift towards work on a smaller number of so-called model systems. Those animals are typically non-marine organisms with advantages afforded by short life cycles, high fecundity, and relative ease in laboratory culture. However, a full understanding of biodiversity, evolution, and anthropogenic effects on biological systems requires a broader survey of development in the animal kingdom. To this day, marine organisms remain relatively understudied, particularly the members of the Lophotrochozoa (Spiralia), which include well over one third of the metazoan phyla (such as the annelids, mollusks, flatworms) and exhibit a tremendous diversity of body plans and developmental modes. To facilitate studies of this group, we have previously described the development and culture of one lophotrochozoan representative, the slipper snail Crepidula atrasolea, which is easy to rear in recirculating marine aquaria. Lab-based culture and rearing of larger populations of animals remain a general challenge for many marine organisms, particularly for inland laboratories. RESULTS: Here, we describe the development of an automated marine aquatic rack system for the high-density culture of marine species, which is particularly well suited for rearing filter-feeding animals. Based on existing freshwater recirculating aquatic rack systems, our system is specific to the needs of marine organisms and incorporates robust filtration measures to eliminate wastes, reducing the need for regular water changes. In addition, this system incorporates sensors and associated equipment for automated assessment and adjustment of water quality. An automated feeding system permits precise delivery of liquid food (e.g., phytoplankton) throughout the day, mimicking real-life feeding conditions that contribute to increased growth rates and fecundity. CONCLUSION: This automated system makes laboratory culture of marine animals feasible for both large and small research groups, significantly reducing the time, labor, and overall costs needed to rear these organisms.","Henry, Jonathan Q.; Lesoway, Maryna P.; Perry, Kimberly J.",BMC Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199361/,129
10955,Hydrocortisone and bronchopulmonary dysplasia: variables associated with response in premature infants,2020-05-07,"PURPOSE: Granulomatous inflammation is a common cause of subacute cervicofacial lymphadenitis in children. Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections and cat-scratch disease (CSD) are the most frequent causes. Optimal treatment, which may include surgery, antibiotic treatment or wait-and-see approach, is debatable. The goal of this study was to compare the short- and long-term outcome of various surgical procedures. METHODS: Case series with a chart review of all children treated by surgical excision of granulomatous lymph nodes in the cervicofacial area from 2000 to 2016 at two tertiary care centers. RESULTS: Forty patients were included in this study. The median age at first symptoms was 3.7 years (13 months–14 years). Mean follow-up was 5.8 years (6 months–15.3 years). 25 patients fit with diagnosis of NTM infection, 6 with CSD while diagnosis remained uncertain in 9 patients. The primary surgical procedure consisted of total excision (n = 27), incision/drainage (n = 9) or incomplete excision (n = 4). None of the patients treated by primary complete excision needed further intervention contrary to the group of patients with incomplete surgical procedures where additional surgical management was required in 54%. At follow-up, all patients were healthy without evidence of recurrence. CONCLUSION: We advocate early surgical intervention with complete excision to reach quick resolution and reduce the need for additional surgery. The long-term outcome was favorable.","Neven, Quentin; Van der Linden, Dimitri; Hainaut, Marc; Schmitz, Sandra",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222061/,129

The study sample consists of 227 nurses who were available and participated in the research voluntarily during the study. The study data were collected by using “Nurse Description Form” and “Compassion Scale (CS).” In the analysis of the study data, number, percentage, mean and independent T test and ANOVA test were used. The total mean score of CS of the nurses was found as 97.02 ± 10.67. There was no statistically significant difference between gender, marital status and weekly work hours of the nurses and their total CS score means and total sub-scale score means. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference between the age variable of the nurses and the sub-scale of “separation,” between the education level of the nurses and their total CS score means. As a result, it was found that the level of compassion of the nurses was moderate and the level of education affected the compassion levels of the nurses.","Arkan, B.; Yılmaz, D.; Düzgün, F.",J Relig Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222067/,129

METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and Pediatric Neurology unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India involving children with PCR confirmed Influenza A (H1N1) with neurological manifestations during 2019 outbreak. RESULTS: Six children (5 females, 1 male) were enrolled. All presented with neurological symptoms (seizures and altered sensorium) accompanied with fever and respiratory symptoms with duration of illness of 2–7 d. The admission Glasgow Coma Scale ranged from 4 to 12. Only 2 cases showed cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. Neuroimaging was suggestive of diffuse cerebral edema, acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. All were treated with Oseltamivir. Four cases had clinical features of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and were managed in PICU, 3 of them needed mechanical ventilation, 3 needed vasoactive drugs, 3 received 3% saline infusion, 1 underwent invasive ICP monitoring, and 3 (cases 4, 5 and 6) received intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) for 5 d. Total duration of hospital stay was 10–30 d. Case 2 expired due to refractory raised ICP. Among survivors, 3 children had residual neurological deficits and the remaining 2 had achieved premorbid condition. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A (H1N1) can present with isolated or predominant neurological manifestations which can contribute to poor outcome. The authors suggest to rule out H1N1 in any child who presents with unexplained neurological manifestations during seasonal outbreaks of H1N1.","Takia, Lalit; Saini, Lokesh; Keshavan, Shivan; Angurana, Suresh Kumar; Nallasamy, Karthi; Suthar, Renu; Verma, Sanjay; Singh, Paramjeet; Goyal, Kapil; Ratho, RK; Jayashree, Muralidharan",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222163/,129
11085,Bubble bilevel ventilation facilitates gas exchange in anesthetized rabbits,2020-05-01,"Most bacteria form biofilms, which are thick multicellular communities covered in extracellular matrix. Biofilms can become thick enough to be even observed by the naked eye, and biofilm formation is a tightly regulated process. Paracoccus denitrificans is a non-motile, Gram-negative bacterium that forms a very thin, unique biofilm. A key factor in the biofilm formed by this bacterium is a large surface protein named biofilm-associated protein A (BapA), which was recently reported to be regulated by cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP or c-di-GMP). Cyclic-di-GMP is a major second messenger involved in biofilm formation in many bacteria. Though cyclic-di-GMP is generally reported as a positive regulatory factor in biofilm formation, it represses biofilm formation in P. denitrificans. Furthermore, quorum sensing (QS) represses biofilm formation in this bacterium, which is also reported as a positive regulator of biofilm formation in most bacteria. The QS signal used in P. denitrificans is hydrophobic and is delivered through membrane vesicles. Studies on QS show that P. denitrificans can potentially form a thick biofilm but maintains a thin biofilm under normal growth conditions. In this review, we discuss the peculiarities of biofilm formation by P. denitrificans with the aim of deepening the overall understanding of bacterial biofilm formation and functions.","Morinaga, Kana; Yoshida, Keitaro; Takahashi, Kohei; Nomura, Nobuhiko; Toyofuku, Masanori",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223048/,129
11235,HIV Prevalence and Factors Related to HIV Infection Among Transgender Women in Vietnam: A Respondent Driven Sampling Approach,2020-04-15,"A goal of HIV vaccine development is to elicit antibodies with neutralizing breadth. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to HIV often have unusual sequences with long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region loops, high somatic mutation rates and polyreactivity. A subset of HIV-infected individuals develops such antibodies, but it is unclear whether this reflects systematic differences in their antibody repertoires or is a consequence of rare stochastic events involving individual clones. We sequenced antibody heavy-chain repertoires in a large cohort of HIV-infected individuals with bNAb responses or no neutralization breadth and uninfected controls, identifying consistent features of bNAb repertoires, encompassing thousands of B cell clones per individual, with correlated T cell phenotypes. These repertoire features were not observed during chronic cytomegalovirus infection in an independent cohort. Our data indicate that the development of numerous B cell lineages with antibody features associated with autoreactivity may be a key aspect in the development of HIV neutralizing antibody breadth.","Roskin, Krishna M.; Jackson, Katherine J.

13006,"Diagnosis, Background, and Treatment of Hypothalamic Damage in Craniopharyngioma",2020-06-24,"Better adjuvants are needed for vaccines against seasonal influenza. TLR7 agonists are potent activators of innate immune responses and thereby may be promising adjuvants. Among the imidazoquinoline compounds, 1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine (BBIQ) was reported to be a highly active TLR7 agonist but has remained relatively unexplored because of its commercial unavailability. Indeed, in silico molecular modeling studies predicted that BBIQ had a higher TLR7 docking score and binding free energy than imiquimod, the gold standard TLR7 agonist. To circumvent the availability issue, we developed an improved and higher yield method to synthesize BBIQ. Testing BBIQ on human and mouse TLR7 reporter cell lines confirmed it to be TLR7 specific with significantly higher potency than imiquimod. To test its adjuvant potential, BBIQ or imiquimod were admixed with recombinant influenza hemagglutinin protein and administered to mice as two intramuscular immunizations 2 weeks apart. Serum anti-influenza IgG responses assessed by ELISA 2 weeks after the second immunization confirmed that the mice that received vaccine admixed with BBIQ had significantly higher anti-influenza IgG1 and IgG2c responses than mice immunized with antigen alone or admixed with imiquimod. This confirmed BBIQ to be a TLR7-specific adjuvant able to enhance humoral immune responses.","Kaushik, Deepender; Dhingra, Simran; Patil, Madhuri T.; Piplani, Sakshi; Khanna, Varun; Honda-Okubo, Yoshikazu; Li, Lei; Fung, Johnson; Sakala, Isaac G.; Salunke, Deepak B.; Petrovsky, Nikolai",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7482670/,129

Histopathological studies found malignant cells in macroscopically unsuspicious brain parenchyma remote from the primary tumor, even affecting the contralateral hemisphere. In early stages, diffuse interneural infiltration with changes of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) is suspected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of DTI as a possible instrument of depicting evidence of tumor invasion into the corpus callosum (CC). Preoperatively, 31 patients with high-grade brain tumors (8 AA and 23 GBM) were examined by MRI at 3 T, applying a high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequence. ADC- and FA-values were analyzed in the tumor-associated area of the CC as identified by fiber tracking, and were compared to matched healthy controls. In (MR-)morphologically normal appearing CC the ADC values were elevated in the tumor patients (n = 22; 0.978 × 10(−3) mm²/s) compared to matched controls (0.917 × 10(−3) mm²/s, p < 0.05), and the corresponding relative FA was reduced (rFA: 88 %, p < 0.01). The effect was pronounced in case of affection of the CC visible on MRI (n = 9; 0.978 × 10(−3) mm²/s, p < 0.05; rFA: 72 %, p < 0.01). Changes in diffusivity and anisotropy in the CC can be interpreted as an indicator of tumor spread into the contralateral hemisphere not visible on conventional MRI.","Kallenberg, K.; Goldmann, T.; Menke, J.; Strik, H.; Bock, H.

13035,Counselees’ Expressed Level of Understanding of the Risk Estimate and Surveillance Recommendation are Not Associated with Breast Cancer Surveillance Adherence,2016-04-01,"BACKGROUND: Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) is a rapid-onset sensorineural hearing impairment with unclear etiology and unsatisfying treatment effects. Vestibular dysfunction has been considered as a poor indicator in the clinical manifestations and prognosis of ISSNHL, which occurred in approximately 28–57% cases. Glucocorticoids, administered through oral or intratympanic way, are currently regularly and standardly applied for ISSNHL to improve the hearing outcome. However, the vestibular prognosis of ISSNHL after routine treatments remains seldom explored. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of oral and intratympanic glucocorticoids in ISSNHL with vestibular dysfunction in terms of the pattern and trajectory of possible process of vestibular function recovery. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized, outcome-assessor- and analyst-blinded, controlled, clinical trial (RCT) will be carried out. Seventy-two patients with ISSNHL complaining of vestibular dysfunction appearing as vertigo or imbalance will be recruited and randomized into either oral or intratympanic glucocorticoid therapy group with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcomes will be vestibular function outcomes assessed by sensory organization test, caloric test, video head impulse test, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential, and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential; the secondary outcomes include self-reported vestibular dysfunction symptoms; dizziness-related handicap, visual analogue scale for vertigo and tinnitus; and pure tone audiometry. Assessments of primary outcomes will be performed at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks post-randomization, while assessments of secondary outcomes will be performed at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks post-randomization. DISCUSSION: Previous intervention studies of ISSNHL included only hearing outcomes, with little attention paid on the prognosis of vestibular dysfunction. This trial will be the first RCT study focusing on the progress and prognosis of vestibular dysfunction in ISSNHL. The efficacy of two commonly used therapies of glucocorticoids will be compared in both auditory and vestibular function fields, rather than in the hearing outcome alone.

Plasma lipidomic measure may improve the prognostic performances of clinical endpoints of CAD. Our research is designed to identify the correlations between plasma lipid species and the risks of death, major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and left ventricular (LV) remodeling in patients with CAD. METHODS: A total of 1569 Chinese patients with CAD, 1011 single‐centre patients as internal training cohort, and 558 multicentre patients as external validation cohort, were enrolled. The concentration of plasma lipids in both cohorts was determined through widely targeted lipidomic profiling. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox and multivariate Cox regressions were used to develop prognostic models for death and MACE, respectively. RESULTS: Ten (Cer(d18:1/20:1), Cer(d18:1/24:1), PE(30:2), PE(32:0), PE(32:2), PC(O‐38:2), PC(O‐36:4), PC(16:1/22:2), LPC(18:2/0:0) and LPE(0:0/24:6)) and two (Cer(d18:1/20:1) and LPC(20:0/0:0)) lipid species were independently related to death and MACE, respectively. Cer(d18:1/20:1) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) were correlated with LV remodeling (P < .05). The lipidic panel incorporating 10 lipid species and two traditional biomarkers for predicting 5‐year death risk represented a remarkable higher discrimination than traditional model with increased area under the curve from 76.56 to 83.65%, continuous NRI of 0.634 and IDI of 0.131. Furthermore, the panel was successfully used in differentiating multicentre patients with low, middle, or high risks (P < .0001). Further analysis indicated that the number of double bonds of phosphatidyl choline and the content of carbon atoms of phosphatidyl ethanolamines were negatively associated with death risk. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in the prediction of death confirms the effectiveness of plasma lipids as predictors to risk classification in patients with CAD. The association between the structural characteristics of long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and death risk highlights the need for mechanistic research that characterizes the role of individual lipid species in disease pathogenesis.","Qin, Min; Zhu, Qian; Lai, Weihua; Ma, Qilin; Liu, Chen; Chen, Xiaoping; Zhang, Yuelin; Wang, Zixian; Chen, Hui; Yan, Hong; Lei, Heping; Zhang, Shuyao; Dong, Xuekui; Wang, Hong; Huang, Min; Lian, Qizhou; Zhong, Shilong",Clin Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522592/,129

Results: The LSTM vs. U-Net model provided breathing metrics which were strongly correlated with those from the reference signal (all p < 0.001, except for inspiratory: expiratory ratio). The following absolute mean bias (95% confidence interval) values were observed (in seconds): inspiration time 0.01(−2.31, 2.34) vs. −0.02(−2.19, 2.16), expiration time −0.19(−2.35, 1.98) vs. −0.24(−2.36, 1.89), and inter-breath intervals −0.19(−2.73, 2.35) vs. −0.25(2.76, 2.26). The inspiratory:expiratory ratios were −0.14(−1.43, 1.16) vs. −0.14(−1.42, 1.13). Respiratory rate (breaths per minute) values were 0.22(−2.51, 2.96) vs. 0.29(−2.54, 3.11). While percentage bias was low, the 95% limits of agreement was high (~35% for respiratory rate). Conclusion: Both machine learning models show strong correlation and good comparability with reference, with low bias though wide variability for deriving breathing metrics in asthma and health cohorts. Future efforts should focus on improvement of performance of these models, e.g., by increasing the size of the training dataset at the lower breathing rates.","Prinable, Joseph; Jones, Peter; Boland, David; McEwan, Alistair; Thamrin, Cindy",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7764376/,129

14723,Application of physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to predict the pharmacokinetics of telavancin in obesity with renal impairment,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND: In preterm infants, InSurE (Intubation–Surfactant–Extubation) and LISA (less invasive surfactant administration) techniques allow for exogenous surfactant administration while reducing lung injury associated with mechanical ventilation. We compared the acute pulmonary response and lung deposition of surfactant by LISA and InSurE in surfactant-depleted adult rabbits. METHODS: Twenty-six spontaneously breathing surfactant-depleted adult rabbits (6–7 weeks old) with moderate RDS and managed with nasal continuous positive airway pressure were randomized to 3 groups: (1) 200 mg/kg of surfactant by InSurE; (2) 200 mg/kg of surfactant by LISA; (3) no surfactant treatment (Control). Gas exchange and lung mechanics were monitored for 180 min. After that, surfactant lung deposition and distribution were evaluated monitoring disaturated-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and surfactant protein C (SP-C), respectively. RESULTS: No signs of recovery were found in the untreated animals. After InSurE, oxygenation improved more rapidly compared to LISA. However, at 180’ LISA and InSurE showed comparable outcomes in terms of gas exchange, ventilation parameters, and lung mechanics. Neither DSPC in the alveolar pool nor SP-C signal distributions in a frontal lung section were significantly different between InSurE and LISA groups. CONCLUSIONS: In an acute setting, LISA demonstrated efficacy and surfactant lung delivery similar to that of InSurE in surfactant-depleted adult rabbits. IMPACT: Although LISA technique is gaining popularity, there are still several questions to address. This is the first study comparing LISA and InSurE in terms of gas exchange, ventilation parameters, and lung mechanics as well as surfactant deposition and distribution. In our animal study, three hours post-treatment, LISA method seems to be as effective as InSurE and showed similar surfactant lung delivery. Our findings provide some clarifications on a fair comparison between LISA and InSurE techniques, particularly in terms of surfactant delivery. They should reassure some of the concerns raised by the clinical community on LISA adoption in neonatal units.","Ricci, Francesca; Bresesti, Ilia; LaVerde, Paola Azzurra Maria; Salomone, Fabrizio; Casiraghi, Costanza; Mersanne, Arianna; Storti, Matteo; Catozzi, Chiara; Tigli, Laura; Zecchi, Riccardo; Franceschi, Pietro; Murgia, Xabier; Simonato, Manuela; Cogo, Paola; Carnielli, Virgilio; Lista, Gianluca",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809896/,129

Yet, in situ metagenomic water surveys face substantial challenges in cost and logistics. Here, we present a simple, fast, cost-effective and remotely accessible freshwater diagnostics workflow centred around the portable nanopore sequencing technology. Using defined compositions and spatiotemporal microbiota from surface water of an example river in Cambridge (UK), we provide optimised experimental and bioinformatics guidelines, including a benchmark with twelve taxonomic classification tools for nanopore sequences. We find that nanopore metagenomics can depict the hydrological core microbiome and fine temporal gradients in line with complementary physicochemical measurements. In a public health context, these data feature relevant sewage signals and pathogen maps at species level resolution. We anticipate that this framework will gather momentum for new environmental monitoring initiatives using portable devices.","Urban, Lara; Holzer, Andre; Baronas, J Jotautas; Hall, Michael B; Braeuninger-Weimer, Philipp; Scherm, Michael J; Kunz, Daniel J; Perera, Surangi N; Martin-Herranz, Daniel E; Tipper, Edward T; Salter, Susannah J; Stammnitz, Maximilian R",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7815314/,129
14987,THE INCIDENCE OF NEOVASCULARIZATION IN CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY BY OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY,2020-04-14,"Plant Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) proteins, probably the only influx transporters for phosphate (Pi) uptake, are partially degraded on sufficient Pi levels to prevent excessive Pi accumulation. Therefore, the basal/constitutive expression level of PHT1 genes is vital for maintaining Pi uptake under Pi‐replete conditions. Rice (Oryza sativa) OsPHT1;1 is a unique gene as it is highly expressed and not responsive to Pi, however the mechanism for maintaining its basal/constitutive expression remains unknown. Using biochemical and genetic approaches, we identified and functionally characterised the transcription factors maintaining the basal/constitutive expression of OsPHT1;1. OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY108 interact within the nucleus and both bind to the W‐box in the OsPHT1;1 promoter. Overexpression of OsWRKY21 or OsWRKY108 led to increased Pi accumulation, resulting from elevated expression of OsPHT1;1. By contrast, oswrky21 oswrky108 double mutants showed decreased Pi accumulation and OsPHT1;1 expression in a Pi‐dependent manner. Moreover, similar to ospht1;1 mutants, plants expressing the OsWRKY21–SRDX fusion protein (a chimeric dominant suppressor) were impaired in Pi accumulation in Pi‐replete roots, accompanied by downregulation of OsPHT1;1 expression. Our findings demonstrated that rice WRKY transcription factors function redundantly to promote Pi uptake by activating OsPHT1;1 expression under Pi‐replete conditions, and represent a novel pathway independent of the central Pi signalling system.","Zhang, Jun; Gu, Mian; Liang, Ruisuhua; Shi, Xinyu; Chen, Lingling; Hu, Xu; Wang, Shichao; Dai, Xiaoli; Qu, Hongye; Li, Huanhuan; Xu, Guohua",New Phytol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820984/,129
15098,Fast Identification of Possible Drug Treatment of Coronavirus Disease −19 (COVID-19) Through Computational Drug Repurposing Study,2020-02-21,"This study aimed to evaluate the validity and precision of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for climacteric women using computational intelligence techniques. The instrument was applied to 873 women aged between 40 and 65 years. Considering the proposal to regroup the set of data related to the level of physical activity of climacteric women using the IPAQ, we used 2 algorithms: Kohonen and k-means, and, to evaluate the validity of these clusters, 3 indexes were used: Silhouette, PBM and Dunn. The questionnaire was tested for validity (factor analysis) and precision (Cronbach's alpha). The Random Forests technique was used to assess the importance of the variables that make up the IPAQ. To classify these variables, we used 3 algorithms: Suport Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree. The results of the tests to evaluate the clusters suggested that what is recommended for IPAQ, when applied to climacteric women, is to categorize the results into two groups. The factor analysis resulted in three factors, with factor 1 being composed of variables 3 to 6; factor 2 for variables 7 and 8; and factor 3 for variables 1 and 2. Regarding the reliability estimate, the results of the standardized Cronbach's alpha test showed values between 0.63 to 0.85, being considered acceptable for the construction of the construct. In the test of importance of the variables that make up the instrument, the results showed that variables 1 and 8 presented a lesser degree of importance and by the analysis of Accuracy, Recall, Precision and area under the ROC curve, there was no variation when the results were analyzed with all IPAQ variables but variables 1 and 8. Through this analysis, we concluded that the IPAQ, short version, has adequate measurement properties for the investigated population.","Ferreira Freitas, Ronilson; Santos Brant Rocha, Josiane; Ives Santos, Laercio; de Carvalho Braule Pinto, André Luiz; Rodrigues Moreira, Maria Helena; Piana Santos Lima de Oliveira, Fernanda; Marques, Maria Suzana; Souza Guerra Júnior, Geraldo Edson; de Oliveira Silva Guerra, Kelma Dayana; Araújo Drummond, Andreia Maria; Villas Boas Spelta, João Victor; Ananias Meira Trovão, Carolina; Schmidt França, Dorothéa; Borges Oliveira, Lanuza; Prates Caldeira, Antônio; Silveira Vasconcelos D’Angelo, Marcos Flávio",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7808655/,129
15117,Sex disparities in cystic fibrosis: review on the effect of female sex hormones on lung pathophysiology and outcomes,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Social media offers a platform for its users to share information and spread awareness regarding various issues including mental health problems. In some previous studies it was found that people suffering from mental health issues benefited from social media. However, the use of social media is also significantly associated with increased depression, mood and anxiety disorders in adolescents. Furthermore, it was found that the prevalence of poor mental health was high in medical students. With this background, this study was taken up to contribute to the scarce literature about the impact social media has on the mental well-being of medical students. METHODS: The setting was a medical college and research centre, situated in the metropolitan city of Bengaluru in Karnataka. A pretested and predesigned questionnaire was self-administered anonymously by 318 students. The data was analyzed using appropriate statistics. RESULTS: A statistically significant relationship was found between the amount of time spent on social media and the mental well-being score, according to the Sell and Nagpal scale, of students. In participants with scores of < 90.8, (30.2%) of them used social media for 4 hrs or more, as opposed to those with scores ≥ to 90.8, (35.6%) of them spent between 1 and 2 hrs a day on social media, 90.8 being the mean well-being score in India. CONCLUSIONS: Students need to monitor their screen time.

15792,Novel Green Biosynthesis of 5-Fluorouracil Chromium Nanoparticles Using Harpullia pendula Extract for Treatment of Colorectal Cancer,2021-02-06,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The introduction of immunotherapy has had a significant impact on the cancer treatment landscape, with unprecedented survival outcomes in some tumor types. However, clinical development of immune-oncology (IO) agents presents both opportunities and challenges, and not all patients benefit to the same extent. Many factors influence trial designs and could potentially threaten the success of promising IO drugs: 1. Most IO trials still rely on response evaluation criteria based on image assessment only, while new approaches including biomarkers tracking response should be incorporated. 2. Surrogate endpoints for efficacy are still inferred from classical anticancer drugs that have not been specifically validated for IO trials. 3. There is a need for biomarker-driven clinical studies in order to select appropriated patients. 4. Long-term toxicity monitoring is needed, and dosage calculation should not rely on dose-dependent toxicities. 5. Optimizing the design of new IO agents with collaborative approaches assessing multiple drugs on a biomarker-based basis is needed. ABSTRACT: The rapidly evolving landscape of immuno-oncology (IO) is redefining the treatment of a number of cancer types. IO treatments are becoming increasingly complex, with different types of drugs emerging beyond checkpoint inhibitors. However, many of the new drugs either do not progress from phase I-II clinical trials or even fail in late-phase trials. We have identified at least five areas in the development of promising IO treatments that should be redefined for more efficient designs and accelerated approvals. Here we review those critical aspects of IO drug development that could be optimized for more successful outcome rates in all cancer types. It is important to focus our efforts on the mechanisms of action, types of response and adverse events of these novel agents. The use of appropriate clinical trial designs with robust biomarkers of response and surrogate endpoints will undoubtedly facilitate the development and subsequent approval of these drugs. Further research is also needed to establish biomarker-driven strategies to select which patients may benefit from immunotherapy and identify potential mechanisms of resistance.","Bergamino Sirvén, Milana; Pernas, Sonia; Cheang, Maggie C.

However, the molecules that confer this sensitivity remain unknown. We used comparative transcriptomics to show that expression of three genes encoding homologs of the MscS-Like (MSL) and OSCA/TMEM63 family of mechanosensitive ion channels are localized to touch-sensitive trigger hairs of Venus flytrap. We focus here on the candidate with the most enriched expression in trigger hairs, the MSL homolog FLYCATCHER1 (FLYC1). We show that FLYC1 transcripts are localized to mechanosensory cells within the trigger hair, transfecting FLYC1 induces chloride-permeable stretch-activated currents in naïve cells, and transcripts coding for FLYC1 homologs are expressed in touch-sensing cells of Cape sundew, a related carnivorous plant of the Droseraceae family. Our data suggest that the mechanism of prey recognition in carnivorous Droseraceae evolved by co-opting ancestral mechanosensitive ion channels to sense touch.","Procko, Carl; Murthy, Swetha; Keenan, William T; Mousavi, Seyed Ali Reza; Dabi, Tsegaye; Coombs, Adam; Procko, Erik; Baird, Lisa; Patapoutian, Ardem; Chory, Joanne",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7963481/,129
16472,Face masks: all for one and one for all,2021-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a promising biomarker proposed for the prediction of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity. Therefore, we aimed to assess the role of SP-D in the prediction of CAP severity in pediatric patients. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out at the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and wards of Menoufia University Hospital. We recruited 112 children admitted into wards with pneumonia (simple pneumonia) and 68 children admitted into PICU with severe pneumonia (PICU admitted). World Health Organization (WHO) classification and mortality predictive scores were calculated to determine the severity of pneumonia for the two groups, including the Pediatric Respiratory Severity Score (PRESS) and the Predisposition, Insult, Response, and Organ dysfunction modified Score (PIROm). SP-D was measured at admission. RESULTS: The SP-D level was significantly lower in patients with simple pneumonia than in patients with severe pneumonia (P < 0.001). SP-D was significantly higher among children with severe pneumonia, as determined by WHO, PRESS, and PIROm (P = 0.001). SP-D was significantly higher among children with mechanical ventilation, shock, hypoxia, sepsis, and mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for SP-D showed that the area under the curve was 0.741 (P value < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 85.3% and a specificity of 44.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Serum SP-D level has a predictive value for the detection of community-acquired pneumonia severity in children. IMPACT: SP-D is a good predictor for the detection of CAP severity in hospitalized children. SP-D was correlated with severity scores and was associated with indicators of CAP severity, including mechanical ventilation, shock, hypoxia, sepsis, and mortality.","Saleh, Nagwan Yossery; Ibrahem, Reda Abdel Latif; Saleh, Amany Abdel hakim; Soliman, Shimaa El shafey; Mahmoud, Asmaa Abdel Sameea",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010482/,129
16565,NLRC5 regulates expression of MHC-I and provides a target for anti-tumor immunity in transmissible cancers,2021-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS) and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) are effective and safe therapies for overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome in adults. However, few randomized sham-controlled trials have been conducted in a pediatric population. To our knowledge, both therapies never have been compared in children. AIM: The aim of the complete study is twofold: (1) to assess the efficacy of TTNS therapy on bladder symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment in a pediatric population with idiopathic overactive bladder syndrome (iOAB) and/or nocturnal enuresis (part I) and (2) to assess the effect of TTNS compared to PTNS (part II). In this article, we aim to present the protocol of the first part of the TaPaS trial (TTNS, PTNS, sham therapy). METHODS: Part I of the TaPaS trial is set up as a single-center randomized-controlled trial. Children, aged from 5 to 12 years with iOAB and/or nocturnal enuresis, are assigned to two groups by computer-generated randomization: TTNS therapy (intervention) and sham therapy (control). The primary outcome is the percentage difference in average voided volume (AVV) between baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints are the percentage difference in supervoid volumes, number of urinary incontinence episodes/24 h and in voiding frequency, the difference in parent reported outcomes between baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, and the duration of clinical response. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that TTNS is a non-inferior treatment for iOAB in children compared to PTNS therapy. Since literature is inconclusive about the efficacy of TTNS in a pediatric population, a sham-controlled RCT on TTNS will be conducted (part I). A protocol for a prospective randomized sham-controlled trial has been developed. Enrolment has started in November 2018. Study completion of part I is expected by August 2021.

17201,A Novel Behavioral Intervention for Rural Appalachian Cancer Survivors (weSurvive): Participatory Development and Proof-of-Concept Testing,2021-04-12,"BACKGROUND: Snakebite envenoming is a medical emergency which is common in many tropical lower- and middle-income countries. Traditional healers are frequently consulted as primary care-givers for snakebite victims in distress. Traditional healers therefore present a valuable source of information about how snakebite is perceived and handled at the community level, an understanding of which is critical to improve and extend snakebite-related healthcare. METHOD: The study was approached from the interpretive paradigm with phenomenology as a methodology. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 traditional healers who treat snakebite patients in two rural settings in Ghana. From the Ashanti and Upper West regions respectively, 11 and 8 healers were purposively sampled. Interview data was coded, collated and analysed thematically using ATLAS.ti 8 software. Demographic statistics were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26. FINDINGS: Snakebite was reportedly a frequent occurrence, perceived as dangerous and often deadly by healers. Healers felt optimistic in establishing a diagnosis of snakebite using a multitude of methods, ranging from herbal applications to spiritual consultations. They were equally confident about their therapies; encompassing the administration of plant and animal-based concoctions and manipulations of bite wounds. Traditional healers were consulted for both physical and spiritual manifestations of snakebite or after insufficient pain control and lack of antivenom at hospitals; referrals by healers to hospitals were primarily done to receive antivenom and care for wound complications. Most healers welcomed opportunities to engage more productively with hospitals and clinical staff. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that traditional healers did sometimes refer victims to hospitals indicates that improvement of antivenom stocks, pain management and wound care can potentially improve health seeking at hospitals. Our results emphasize the need to explore future avenues for communication and collaboration with traditional healers to improve health seeking behaviour and the delivery of much-needed healthcare to snakebite victims.","Steinhorst, Jonathan; Aglanu, Leslie Mawuli; Ravensbergen, Sofanne J.; Dari, Chrisantus Danaah; Abass, Kabiru Mohammed; Mireku, Samuel Osei; Adu Poku, Joseph Ken; Enuameh, Yeetey A.

There is a lack of published systematic review in the scientific literature on this topic. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on hair loss after MBS in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and four Chinese databases were searched. Data were pooled using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 12.0, and subgroups were performed if necessary and feasible. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies (n = 2538) were included. The pooled results showed that the incidence of hair loss after MBS was 57% (95% CI 42–71%). It decreased with longer follow-up times.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed, including all women aged 17–41 years admitted to a level 3 ICU in the Netherlands, between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2016. Primary outcome was indication for admission and mortality. Mortality, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation and APACHE II score were compared between obstetric and non-obstetric admissions. The obstetric group was further analyzed for maternal and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: 3461 women (median age 32 years) were included, with an overall mortality rate of 13.3%. The obstetric group consisted of 265 women (7.7%). The non-obstetric group (n = 3196) was admitted most often for cardiovascular disease (19.6%), followed by oncologic disease (15%). Mortality was the highest in women with oncologic disease (23.9%). The obstetric group had lower mortality compared to the non-obstetric group (4.9% vs. 14%, p < 0.001), despite higher APACHE II score (14 vs. 11, p < 0.001) and a higher ventilation rate (47.9% vs. 39%, p = 0.004). Major surgical or endovascular interventions, besides caesarean section, were performed in 46% of the obstetric group. Perinatal death occurred in 17.2% and of the surviving infants, 63.2% were born preterm and 45.1% required Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular disease is the most important indication for admission and oncologic disease is associated with highest mortality in women of reproductive age. Obstetric patients constitute a small percentage of all ICU admissions in a tertiary ICU center. They have lower mortality rates than non-obstetric young female patients, despite a more severe initial presentation.

18963,Mounting Pressure of Periodontitis,2021-06-21,"IMPORTANCE: Tobacco use prevalence among individuals involved in the criminal-legal system is 125% higher than that of the general population and leads to high levels of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To examine the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary clinical outcomes of a smoking cessation intervention for individuals who are incarcerated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pilot randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 2019 to May 2020. Participants were recruited in a pretrial county jail in a large Midwestern US city and were followed up after release. Participants were incarcerated, smoked daily before incarceration, desired to stay quit or reduce cigarette smoking upon release, and expected to be released to the community within 90 days of enrollment. Data analysis was performed from June to October 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to the counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) group received 1 hour of smoking cessation counseling in jail, a supply of nicotine lozenges upon release, and up to 4 telephone counseling sessions after release. Those randomized to brief health education (BHE) received 30 minutes of general health education in jail. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary clinical outcome was biologically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 3 weeks after release. Secondary clinical outcomes included 7-day PPA at 12 weeks, changes in number of cigarettes per day, and time to smoking lapse and relapse. RESULTS: A total of 46 participants (42 men [91%]; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [9.1] years) were enrolled and remained eligible at release; 23 were randomized to the counseling plus NRT group and 23 were randomized to the BHE group. Recruitment, enrollment, and retention of participants was feasible and acceptable. There were no significant differences in smoking abstinence between groups as determined by 7-day PPA at 3 weeks (adjusted 7-day PPA, 11.9% for counseling plus NRT vs 10.6% for BHE; odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.14-9.07) and at 12 weeks (adjusted 7-day PPA, 11.1% for counseling plus NRT vs 14.3% for BHE; odds ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.09-6.11). Cigarettes per day for the counseling plus NRT group decreased more compared with the BHE group at both 3 weeks (difference [SE], −4.58 [1.58] cigarettes per day; 95% CI, −7.67 to −1.48 cigarettes per day; P = .007) and 12 weeks (difference [SE], −3.26 [1.58] cigarettes per day; 95% CI, −5.20 to −0.20 cigarettes per day; P = .04) after release. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Initiation of counseling plus NRT during incarceration and continuing after release is feasible and acceptable to participants and may be associated with reduced cigarette use after release.

19526,Multidisciplinary clinics in prostate cancer,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: High-level antibiotic consumption plays a critical role in the selection and spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in the ICU. Implementation of a stewardship program including a restrictive antibiotic policy was evaluated with respect to ESBL-E acquisition (carriage and infection). METHODS: We implemented a 2-year, before-and-after intervention study including all consecutive adult patients admitted for > 48 h in the medical-surgical 26-bed ICU of Guadeloupe University Hospital (French West Indies). A conventional strategy period (CSP) including a broad-spectrum antibiotic as initial empirical treatment, followed by de-escalation (period before), was compared to a restrictive strategy period (RSP) limiting broad-spectrum antibiotics and shortening their duration. Antibiotic therapy was delayed and initiated only after microbiological identification, except for septic shock, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and meningitis (period after). A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted on propensity score values was performed. The main outcome was the median time of being ESBL-E-free in the ICU. Secondary outcome included all-cause ICU mortality. RESULTS: The study included 1541 patients: 738 in the CSP and 803 in the RSP. During the RSP, less patients were treated with antibiotics (46.8% vs. 57.9%; p < 0.01), treatment duration was shorter (5 vs. 6 days; p < 0.01), and administration of antibiotics targeting anaerobic pathogens significantly decreased (65.3% vs. 33.5%; p < 0.01) compared to the CSP. The incidence of ICU-acquired ESBL-E was lower (12.1% vs. 19%; p < 0.01) during the RSP. The median time of being ESBL-E-free was 22 days (95% CI 16-NA) in the RSP and 18 days (95% CI 16–21) in the CSP. After propensity score weighting and adjusted analysis, the median time of being ESBL-E-free was independently associated with the RSP (hazard ratio, 0.746 [95% CI 0.575–0.968]; p = 0.02, and hazard ratio 0.751 [95% CI 0.578–0.977]; p = 0.03, respectively). All-cause ICU mortality was lower in the RSP than in the CSP (22.5% vs. 28.6%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a program including a restrictive antibiotic strategy is feasible and is associated with less ESBL-E acquisition in the ICU without any worsening of patient outcome.

19528,French recommendations for the management of systemic sclerosis,2021-07-26,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic head positioning plays a role in the management of patients with acute brain injury. Although intracranial pressure (ICP) is typically lower in an upright posture than in a flat position, limited data exist concerning the effect of upright positioning on brain oxygenation and circulation. We sought to determine the impact of supine (0°) and semirecumbent (15° and 30°) postures on ICP, brain oxygenation, and brain circulation. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted between February 2012 and September 2015. Twenty-three patients with severe acute brain injury were successively observed at head elevations of 30°, 15°, and 0°. Postural-induced changes in ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, brain tissue oxygenation pressure, and transcranial Doppler findings were simultaneously measured during three repeated experiments: 24 h after admission to the intensive care unit (exp1), 24 h later (exp2), and 96 h later (exp3). Cerebral perfusion pressure, arterial blood gases, hemoglobin content, and body temperature remained unchanged during the three experiments. RESULTS: Using linear random-slope mixed models, we found that during the early phase of acute brain injury (exp1), lowering the head posture from 30° to 15°, and then to 0°, was associated with a gradual mean ICP increase of 2.6 mm Hg (1.4–3.7 mm Hg; P < 0.001); and from 30° to 0°, an increase of 7.4 mm Hg (6.3–8.6 mm Hg; P < 0.001). Furthermore, brain tissue oxygenation pressure and mean blood flow velocity improved when the head posture was lowered from 30° to 0° by 1.2 mm Hg (0.2–2.3 mm Hg) and 4.1 cm/s (0.0–8.2 cm/s), respectively (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Changing the positioning of stable patients with acute brain injury resulted in opposite changes of ICP versus brain oxygenation and circulation. This information supports the concept of an individualized approach to head positioning that is based on the multimodal monitoring of brain parameters.","Burnol, Laetitia; Payen, Jean-Francois; Francony, Gilles; Skaare, Kristina; Manet, Romain; Morel, Jérôme; Bosson, Jean-Luc; Gergele, Laurent",Neurocrit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8312355/,129
19576,Threshold of Inotropic Score and Vasoactive–Inotropic Score for Predicting Mortality in Pediatric Septic Shock,2021-07-27,"Keyword extraction refers to the process of detecting the most relevant terms and expressions in a given text in a timely manner. In the information explosion era, keyword extraction has attracted increasing attention. The importance of keyword extraction in text summarization, text comparisons, and document categorization has led to an emphasis on graph-based keyword extraction techniques because they can capture more structural information compared to other classic text analysis methods. In this paper, we propose a simple unsupervised text mining approach that aims to extract a set of keywords from a given text and analyze its topic diversity using graph analysis tools. Initially, the text is represented as a directed graph using synonym relationships. Then, community detection and other measures are used to identify keywords in the text. The set of extracted keywords is used to assess topic diversity within the text and analyze its sentiment. The proposed approach relies on grouping semantically similar candidate words. This approach ensures that the set of extracted keywords is comprehensive. Differing from other graph-based keyword extraction approaches, the proposed method does not require user parameters during graph construction and word scoring. The proposed approach achieved significant results compared to other keyword extraction techniques.","Alrasheed, Hend",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8315826/,129

Ten consecutive patients, aged 12 days to 5 years with ARDS and hypoxaemic respiratory failure on conventional ventilation (CV), using a lung protective strategy, were managed with HFOV early in the course of the disease process (median length of CV 4 h). Arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (P(A-a)O(2)) and PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio were prospectively recorded prior to HFOV (0 h) and at predetermined intervals throughout the course of the HFOV protocol. There was a significant improvement in PaCO(2) 4 h after institution of HFOV ( P =0.012). A significant and sustained increase ( P <0.001) in PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio and a significant and sustained decrease ( P <0.001) in OI and P(A-a)O(2) were demonstrated during the HFOV trial. These improvements were achieved 4 h after initiating HFOV ( P <0.05). Eight patients survived. There were no deaths from respiratory failure. Conclusion: In paediatric patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypoxaemic respiratory failure on conventional ventilation, using a lung protective strategy, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation used as an “early rescue” therapy, improves gas exchange in a rapid and sustained fashion and provides a good outcome. Use of this therapy should probably be considered early in the course of the disease process.","Ben Jaballah, Nejla; Mnif, Khaled; Bouziri, Asma; Kazdaghli, Kalthoum; Belhadj, Sarra; Zouari, Bechir",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319897/,129

However, methods to quantify cargo proteins loaded into engineered EVs are lacking. Here, we describe a workflow for EV analysis at the single‐vesicle and single‐molecule level to accurately quantify the efficiency of different EV‐sorting proteins in promoting cargo loading into EVs. Expi293F cells were engineered to express EV‐sorting proteins fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). High levels of GFP loading into secreted EVs was confirmed by Western blotting for specific EV‐sorting domains, but quantitative single‐vesicle analysis by Nanoflow cytometry detected GFP in less than half of the particles analysed, reflecting EV heterogeneity. Anti‐tetraspanin EV immunostaining in ExoView confirmed a heterogeneous GFP distribution in distinct subpopulations of CD63(+), CD81(+), or CD9(+) EVs. Loading of GFP into individual vesicles was quantified by Single‐Molecule Localization Microscopy. The combined results demonstrated TSPAN14, CD63 and CD63/CD81 fused to the PDGFRβ transmembrane domain as the most efficient EV‐sorting proteins, accumulating on average 50–170 single GFP molecules per vesicle. In conclusion, we validated a set of complementary techniques suitable for high‐resolution analysis of EV preparations that reliably capture their heterogeneity, and propose highly efficient EV‐sorting proteins to be used in EV engineering applications.","Silva, Andreia M.; Lázaro‐Ibáñez, Elisa; Gunnarsson, Anders; Dhande, Aditya; Daaboul, George; Peacock, Ben; Osteikoetxea, Xabier; Salmond, Nikki; Friis, Kristina Pagh; Shatnyeva, Olga; Dekker, Niek",J Extracell Vesicles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8329990/,129

20737,Platelet-Derived Procoagulant Microparticles as Blood-based Biomarker of Breast Cancer,2021-05-11,"People can exhibit their status by the consumption of particular goods or experiential purchases; this is known as “conspicuous consumption”; the practice is widespread and explains the market characteristics of a whole class of goods, Veblen goods, demand for which increase in tandem with their price. The value of such positional goods lies in their distribution among the population—the rarer they are, the more desirable they become. At the same time, higher income, often associated with higher status, has been studied in its relation to unethical behavior. Here we present research that shows how a particular Veblen good, illicit behavior, and wealth, combine to produce the display of illegality as a status symbol. We gathered evidence at a large, country-level, scale of a particular form of consumption of an illictly acquired good for status purposes. We show that in Greece, a developed middle-income country, where authorities cannot issue custom vanity license plates, people acquire distinguishing plate numbers that act as vanity plate surrogates. We found that such license plates are more common in cars with bigger engines and in luxury brands, and are therefore associated with higher value vehicles. This cannot be explained under the lawful procedures for allocating license plates and must therefore be the result of illegal activities, such as graft. This suggests a pattern of “conspicuous corruption”, where individuals break the law and use their gains as status symbols, knowing that the symbols hint at rule-breaking, as long as the unlawful practice cannot be incontestably established.","Louridas, Panos; Spinellis, Diomidis",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8409654/,129

Identifying novel host factors and deciphering the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of latency are critical to discover new targets for the development of novel anti-HIV agents. Here, we show that ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) modulates HIV-1 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription of the viral genome as a novel HIV-1 restriction factor. Correspondingly, UHRF1 depletion reversed the latency of HIV-1 proviruses. Mechanistically, UHRF1 competed with positive transcription factor b (p-TEFb) for the binding to the cysteine-rich motifs of HIV-1 Tat via its TTD, PHD, and RING finger domains. Furthermore, UHRF1 mediated K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Tat in RING-dependent ways, leading to the disruption of Tat/cyclin T1/CDK9 complex and consequential impediment of transcription elongation. In summary, our findings revealed that UHRF1 is an important mediator of HIV-1 latency by controlling Tat-mediated transcriptional activation, providing novel insights on host-pathogen interaction for modulating HIV-1 latency, beneficial for the development of anti-AIDS therapies.","Liang, Taizhen; Zhang, Qiao; Wu, Ziyao; Chen, Pei; Huang, Yifan; Liu, Shuwen; Li, Lin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406157/,129
20900,Endoscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Approach for the Surgical Treatment of Pituitary Apoplexy and Clinical Outcomes,2021-09-04,"BACKGROUND: Integrated community case management (iCCM) of malaria complements public health services to improve access to timely diagnosis and treatment of malaria. ICCM relies on standardized test-and-treat algorithms implemented by community health workers using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). However, due to a changing epidemiology of fever causes in Africa, positive RDT results might not correctly reflect malaria. In this study, we modeled diagnostic predictive values for all malaria-endemic African regions as an indicator of the programmatic usefulness of RDTs in iCCM campaigns on malaria. METHODS: Positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) of RDTs for clinical malaria were modeled. Assay-specific performance characteristics stem from the Cochrane Library and data on the proportion of malaria-attributable fevers among African febrile children aged <5 years were used as prevalence matrix. RESULTS: Average country-level PPVs vary considerably. Ethiopia had the lowest PPVs (histidine-rich protein II [HRP2] assay, 17.35%; parasite lactate dehydrogenase [pLDH] assay, 39.73%), and Guinea had the highest PPVs (HRP2 assay, 95.32%; pLDH assay, 98.46%). On the contrary, NPVs were above 90% in all countries (HRP2 assay, ≥94.87%; pLDH assay, ≥93.36%). CONCLUSIONS: PPVs differed considerably within Africa when used to screen febrile children, indicating unfavorable performance of RDT-based test-and-treat algorithms in low-PPV settings. This suggests that the administration of antimalarials alone may not constitute causal treatment in the presence of a positive RDT result for a substantial proportion of patients, particularly in low-PPV settings. Therefore, current iCCM algorithms should be complemented by information on other setting-specific major causes of fever.","Mischlinger, Johannes; Dudek, Veronika; Ramharter, Michael",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8423504/,129

A scaffold with niche-specific structure and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition might have the advantage to improve long-term clinical outcomes, in particular for patients with severe damage or complete loss of the limbal niche tissue structure. Therefore, we evaluated the decellularized human limbus (DHL) as a biomimetic scaffold for the transplantation of LEPCs. Corneoscleral tissue was decellularized by sodium deoxycholate and deoxyribonuclease I in the presence or absence of dextran. We evaluated the efficiency of decellularization and its effects on the ultrastructure and ECM composition of the human corneal limbus. The recellularization of these scaffolds was studied by plating cultured LEPCs and limbal melanocytes (LMs) or by allowing cells to migrate from the host tissue following a lamellar transplantation ex vivo. Our decellularization protocol rapidly and effectively removed cellular and nuclear material while preserving the native ECM composition. In vitro recellularization by LEPCs and LMs demonstrated the good biocompatibility of the DHL and intrastromal invasion of LEPCs. Ex vivo transplantation of DHL revealed complete epithelialization as well as melanocytic and stromal repopulation from the host tissue. Thus, the generated DHL scaffold could be a promising biological material as a carrier for the transplantation of LEPCs to treat LSCD.","Polisetti, Naresh; Roschinski, Benjamin; Schlötzer-Schrehardt, Ursula; Maier, Philip; Schlunck, Günther; Reinhard, Thomas",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8471675/,129

In the meantime, protein deubiquitination by various deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) regulates protein stability within cells, and it can counterbalance intracellular homeostasis mediated by ubiquitination. Numerous reports have demonstrated that an aberrant process of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) regulated by the ubiquitination and deubiquitination systems results in failure of balancing between protein stability and degradation, and this failure can lead to tumorigenesis in various organs and tissues of mammals. The identification of molecular properties for various DUBs is very critical to understand cancer development and tumorigenesis. Therefore, knowledge of DUBs and their association with cancer and diseases is indispensible for developing effective inhibitors for DUBs.

Given this particular practical relevance, a plethora of digital maturity models, designed to asses a company’s digital status quo, has emerged over the past few years. Largely developed and published by practitioners, the academic value of these models remains obviously unclear. To shed light on their value in a broader sense, in this paper we critically evaluate 17 existing digital maturity models – identified through a systematic literature search (2011–2019) – with regard to their validity of measurement. We base our evaluation on established academic criteria, such as generalizability or theory-based interpretation, that we apply in a qualitative content analysis to these models. Our analysis shows that most of the identified models do not conform to the established evaluation criteria. Based on these insights, we derive a detailed research agenda and suggest respective research questions and strategies.","Thordsen, Tristan; Murawski, Matthias; Bick, Markus","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134267/,129

30973,Symposium summaries,2004-10-18,"Steppe grasslands are distributed over vast areas in arid and semiarid regions of Eurasia. However, steppe grasslands face desertification or degradation caused by human over‐activity. In the last decades, steppe regions have seen increased areas of crop cultivation and subsequent abandonment due to inappropriate agricultural management. Land degradation of abandoned croplands has become a common problem in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. A field survey was conducted in the Xilingol steppe, and vegetation was classified into three groups. Based on comparisons of species composition and soil characters, group 1 represents steppe grassland, group 2 represents abandoned croplands and group 3 represents yardangs. The typical indicator species of steppe, abandoned croplands and yardangs are Leymus chinensis, Cleistogenes squarrosa and Elymus dahuricus, respectively. Abandoned croplands are exposed to wind and rain, resulting in soil erosion, which not only increases coarse sand content but also decreases total carbon and total nitrogen in the soil. We found that soil condition is an important factor affecting the early stages of secondary succession in abandoned croplands and that farming in typical steppes might contribute to land degradation. We concluded that abandoned croplands can be converted to yardangs by erosion. The extension of yardangs might then lead to desertification in steppe regions. Land managers should be aware that farming in typical steppes is associated with a risk of desertification. The degree of degradation of steppe can be measured by monitoring these indicator species.","Kawada, Kiyokazu; , Wuyunna; Nakamura, Toru",Grassl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165941/,129

We sought to explore whether electronic adherence monitoring combined with weekly feedback regarding adherence along with a reminder to use inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) would lead to improved compliance with ICS in infants and younger children with asthma. METHODS: 96 recruited children (aged 6 months to 3 years) with mild or moderate persistent asthma who were on regular inhaled corticosteroids were randomly allocated to receive electronic monitoring combined with instant messaging software (IMS)-based weekly feedback regarding adherence along with a reminder to keep taking the ICS (intervention group) and to receive electronic monitoring only (control group). RESULTS: The mean device-monitored adherence was significantly higher in the intervention group (80%) than in the control group (45.9%), with a difference of 34.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.8–41.3%; P < 0.001). No difference in the mean caregiver-reported adherence between the interventional group (89.7%) and the control group (92.7%) was observed (P = 0.452). CONCLUSIONS: Electronic monitoring combined with IMS-based weekly feedback regarding adherence along with a reminder to keep taking the ICS significantly improved the treatment compliance of infants and younger children with asthma.

43111,Hypoxia Correlates With Poor Survival and M2 Macrophage Infiltration in Colorectal Cancer,2020-11-20,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with localised CNS-germinoma have excellent survival. More recently, intensive inpatient chemotherapy (carboPEI=carboplatin/etoposide/ifosfamide in Europe) has been effectively employed to reduce radiotherapy fields and/or dose. Current research priorities focus on reducing treatment burden and long-term sequelae. Of note, outpatient-based single-agent carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with excellent outcomes in metastatic testicular seminoma (an identical pathology) [Alifrangis,EJC,2020]. Recently, successful vinblastine monotherapy was reported in localised CNS-germinoma [Murray,Neurooncol-Adv,2020]. METHODS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, adapted UK guidelines for germ-cell-tumour management were distributed, including potential non-standard treatment options that would reduce hospital visits/admissions. A 30-year-old patient presented with a 32mmx30mmx35mm diameter solid+multi-cystic localised pineal CNS lesion, consistent radiologically with a germ-cell-tumour with prominent teratoma component. Investigation revealed negative AFP/HCG markers and biopsy-proven pure germinoma. After appropriate consent, the patient commenced 12-week induction with weekly vinblastine monotherapy (low-grade-glioma dosing [Lassaletta,JCO,2016]), with wk6&12 MRI re-assessment prior to definitive radiotherapy. RESULTS: Vinblastine was well-tolerated. After initial 4mg/m2 test-dosing (wk1), standard 6mg/m2 was delivered for wk2, but resulted in asymptomatic neutropenia (nadir 0.3x10^9/l) and missed dosing at wk3. Subsequent doses were 4mg/m2, with no further neutropenia. As expected, MRI showed moderate 40% tumour volume reduction by wk12. Surgical resection of the residual presumed teratoma component was undertaken prior to radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with CNS-germinoma have excellent outcomes and reduction of treatment-effects remains a priority. The exquisite chemosensitivity of germinoma, excellent results from monotherapy for metastatic testicular disease, and early promise of vinblastine monotherapy lend itself to further exploration for CNS-germinoma.","Moleron, Rafael; Stoneham, Sara; Ajithkumar, Thankamma; Cross, Justin; Nicholson, James; Murray, Matthew",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7715855/,129

44243,Managing allergic reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Pneumothorax has been reported with the use of positive pressure ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia. Literature on spontaneous pneumothorax (PTX) in COVID-19 patients is scant. We present a case series of 7 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, who developed spontaneous pneumothorax without prior mechanical ventilation. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 7 cases was performed from two different hospitals in the US between 4/6/2020–5/15/2020. Hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR who developed spontaneous pneumothorax were included. Collected data included demographics, co-morbidities, inflammatory biomarkers, chest imaging and management strategies. Length of stay, transfer to intensive care unit and death were the assessed outcomes. A descriptive analysis was done. RESULTS: There were 3 patients from Henry Ford Health System, Michigan and 4 patients from Silver Cross Hospital, Illinois. Median age was 75 years and 6 out of 7 (85.7%) were males (Table 1). There were no co-morbidities associated with spontaneous pneumothorax except for one patient with COPD. None of the patients’ imaging prior to diagnosis of pneumothorax revealed any underlying blebs. Median time from symptom onset to diagnosis of pneumothorax was 17 days. One of the patients had tension pneumothorax, two had bilateral pneumothorax and three had pneumomediastinum (Figure 1). Four patients required chest tube placement, three required escalation to ICU, of which two died. Table 1. Demographics and Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Spontaneous Pneumothorax [Image: see text] Figure 1. CT imaging before (left) and after (right) Spontaneous Pneumothorax [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Spontaneous pneumothorax may be an unrecognized late complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. In hospitalized patients with acute respiratory decompensation, spontaneous pneumothorax should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. Repeat chest imaging should be considered in these cases.

However, numerous scientific evidences and reports have demonstrated that the natural milk possesses more beneficial nutrients and bioactive components than artificially manufactured plant-derived milks. The biochemical and nutritional advantages and functionalities of natural dairy milk cannot be replaced by man-made or crafted plant-based beverage products. On the other hand, the tremendous increase in production and consumption of the plant-based alternative milks in recent years has led a serious business downturn in traditional roles and stability of the dairy industry, especially in the major dairy producing Western countries. Although plant-based milk alternatives may have some benefits on nutrition and health of certain consumers, the plant-derived alternative milks may not overshadow the true values of natural milk. Milk is not a high fat and high cholesterol food as animal meat products. Unlike plant-based alternative milks, natural milk contains many bioactive as well as antiappetizing peptides, which can reduce body weight. It has proven that taking low-fat, cultured and lactase treated milk and dairy products with other diversified nutritionally balanced diets have been shown to be healthier dietary option than plant-based milk/foods alone.","Park, Young Woo",Food Sci Anim Resour,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7810394/,129

Using annual data from 1970 to 2019 and the autoregressive distributed lags bounds testing approach, evidence shows that the long-run elasticities of the exchange rate on the net trade balance are bigger than the short-run impacts. In both the short run and long run, the impact of domestic income on the net trade balance is the biggest followed by consumer prices and then last is the nominal effective exchange rate. The long-run impact of the domestic income is nearly double that of the exchange rate. This shows that domestic income has a bigger effect on the net trade balance than both the price levels and the exchange rate effects. These results imply that policymakers designing the exchange rate policy should complement this with an appropriate industrial policy which emphasises the value of import-substituting industries to eliminate the net trade deterioration. At the same time, the design of the inflation targeting framework matters. Hence, there is a need to pursue import-substitution strategies to strengthen the domestic industrial base with all the associated multiplier effects throughout the economy and this contributes to the reduction of the worsening trade deficits.","Ndou, Eliphas",SN Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849224/,129
45542,ERS International Congress 2020 Virtual: highlights from the Allied Respiratory Professionals Assembly,2021-02-08,"First responders experience substantial stress due to the nature of their work (Carleton et al. 2017). Occupational stress (OS) results from a myriad of employment conditions (e.g., ambiguous work expectations, unreasonable workload; Osipow 1998). OS can lead to maladaptive anger, which negatively impacts personal well-being and work performance (Velichkovsky 2009). In contrast, resilience to demanding working conditions is associated with lower state and trait anger (Wilson et al. 2001); thus, resilience may serve a protective ‘buffer’ role against anger in the face of stress. Thus, we hypothesized that resiliency would mediate relations between dimensions of OS and anger. The current study included 201 first responders (male = 77.6%; M(age) = 43.73 years (SD = 10.97); police officers = 64.2%) who completed measures of OS (OSI-R; Osipow 1998), Anger (DSM-5 CC Anger; APA 2013), and Resiliency (CD-RISC; Connor and Davidson 2003). Results indicated that resiliency mediated relations between five components of OS and anger: Role Overload (p < .001); Insufficiency (p < .001); Role Boundary (p < .001); Role Ambiguity (p < .001); and Role Responsibility (p < .001). Results support the importance of resiliency-enhancing interventions to offset the experience of anger when confronted with occupational stress in first responders.","Doyle, Jessie N.; Campbell, Mary Ann; Gryshchuk, Lena",J Police Crim Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7857936/,129

This image is formed due to different factors, among them is a university professor’s image which is shaped by a variety of expectations from different social groups referring to the rights, obligations and standards such a professor is to follow. Although there is a lot of research done as for the professor’s image and expectations of different stakeholders, there is a limited number of works analyzing the students’ expectations. To bridge this gap, the paper aims at investigating the students’ views in regard of a professor’s image, comparing them with those of the other stakeholders and providing recommendations to follow. The paper uses both theoretical research methods based on the analysis of recent publications and discussions in the academic community and empirical methods in the form of a survey among students and its content analysis. The results show a mismatch between expectations of employers, community, professors and students as for the role of a professor in society in regard of their behavioral characteristics, research performance and leadership in teaching. The authors recommend that the professors prioritize the expectations from the students and teaching is the primary mission of the university.

Bug description is an essential attribute that helps to predict other bug attributes, such as severity, priority, and time fixes. We need to consider the noise and confusion present in the text of the bug report, as it can impact the output of different machine learning techniques. Shannon entropy has been used in this paper to calculate summary uncertainty about the bug. Bug severity attribute tells about the type of impact the bug has on the functionality of the software. Correct bug severity estimation allows scheduling and repair bugs and hence help in resource and effort utilization. To predict the severity of the bug we need software project historical data to train the classifier. These training data are not always available in particular for new software projects. The solution which is called cross project prediction is to use the training data from other projects. Using bug priority, summary weight and summary entropy, we have proposed cross project bug severity assessment models. Results for proposed summary entropy based approach for bug severity prediction in cross project context show improved performance of the Accuracy and F-measure up to 70.23% and 93.72% respectively across all the machine learning techniques over existing work.","Kumari, Madhu; Singh, Ujjawal Kumar; Sharma, Meera",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974975/,129

The existence of the entrepreneurial phenomenon is explained from the social roots of human behaviour. Without sociability, there is no firm and without awareness, there is no responsible firm. By deeply exploring a case study of a conscious firm awarded by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, this study contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship and ethical and socially responsible business management. We offer a theory and a productive model with human development that fosters entrepreneurship and makes it possible to build ethical interactions between the firm and the stakeholders. The methodology used is qualitative with a humanistic approach and presents the hypothesis that, if conscious firms want to have high productive performance, they must empower the worker in a way that turns them into entrepreneurs of their own work. The most important conclusion of this work is that conscious firms must have a productivity model that combines two processes: sustainable economic growth and comprehensive human development.

50907,Anaphylaxis in Australia with AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine,2021-03-27,"Flavonoids, a class of polyphenols, consumed daily in our diet, are associated with a reduced risk for oxidative stress (OS)-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and inflammation. The involvement of flavonoids with OS-related chronic diseases have been traditionally attributed to their antioxidant activity. However, evidence from recent studies indicate that flavonoids’ beneficial impact may be assigned to their interaction with cellular macromolecules, rather than exerting a direct antioxidant effect. This review provides an overview of the recent evolving research on interactions between the flavonoids and lipoproteins, proteins, chromatin, DNA, and cell-signaling molecules that are involved in the OS-related chronic diseases; it focuses on the mechanisms by which flavonoids attenuate the development of the aforementioned chronic diseases via direct and indirect effects on gene expression and cellular functions. The current review summarizes data from the literature and from our recent research and then compares specific flavonoids’ interactions with their targets, focusing on flavonoid structure–activity relationships. In addition, the various methods of evaluating flavonoid–protein and flavonoid–DNA interactions are presented. Our aim is to shed light on flavonoids action in the body, beyond their well-established, direct antioxidant activity, and to provide insights into the mechanisms by which these small molecules, consumed daily, influence cellular functions.","Atrahimovich, Dana; Avni, Dorit; Khatib, Soliman",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7999194/,129

52302,Canadian findings on AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine and COVISHIELD,2021-05-01,"It is well known that hypoxanthine (HX) inhibits nuclear maturation of oocytes by elevating the intracellular cAMP level, while melatonin (MT) is a molecule that reduces cAMP production, which may physiologically antagonize this inhibition and restore the meiosis process. We conducted in vitro and in vivo studies to examine this hypothesis. The results showed that 10(–3) M MT potentiated the inhibitory effect of HX on mouse oocyte meiosis by lowering the rate of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and the first polar body (PB1). However, 10(–5) M and 10(–7) M MT significantly alleviated the nuclear suppression induced by HX and restored meiosis in 3- and 6-week-old mouse oocytes, respectively. We identified that the rate-limiting melatonin synthetic enzyme AANAT and melatonin membrane receptor MT1 were both expressed in oocytes and cumulus cells at the GV and MII stages. Luzindole, a non-selective melatonin membrane receptor antagonist, blocked the activity of MT on oocyte meiotic recovery (P < 0.05). This observation indicated that the activity of melatonin was mediated by the MT1 receptor. To understand the molecular mechanism further, MT1 knockout (KO) mice were constructed. In this MT1 KO animal model, the PB1 rate was significantly reduced with the excessive expression of cAPM synthases (Adcy2, Adcy6, Adcy7, and Adcy9) in the ovaries of these animals. The mRNA levels of Nppc and Npr2 were upregulated while the genes related to progesterone synthesis (Cyp11a11), cholesterol biosynthesis (Insig1), and feedback (Lhcgr, Prlr, and Atg7) were downregulated in the granulosa cells of MT1 KO mice (P < 0.05). The altered gene expression may be attributed to the suppression of oocyte maturation. In summary, melatonin protects against nuclear inhibition caused by HX and restores oocyte meiosis via MT1 by reducing the intracellular concentration of cAMP.","Wang, Jing; Zhuo, Zhiyong; Ma, Xiao; Liu, Yunjie; Xu, Jing; He, Changjiu; Fu, Yao; Wang, Feng; Ji, Pengyun; Zhang, Lu; Liu, Guoshi",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083900/,129
52580,No evidence of TTS risk with Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine,2021-05-08,"Background: Manifestations of Cushing disease, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity are risk factors for severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. A potential for severe COVID-19 disease might be hypothesized in Cushing disease patients. We present a finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive nasopharyngeal PCR test in an untreated Cushing disease patient. Case: A 19 year old female presented in January 2020 reporting amenorrhea and cushingoid facies. Her last menstrual period was two years ago. Low energy, fatigue, easy bruising and dark stretch marks on her legs, axillae and flanks were reported. Physical exam showed blood pressure 123/83 mmHg, pulse 89 bpm, BMI 20.80 kg/m². She had a cushingoid appearance with fullness in the face, neck and supraclavicular area, mild proptosis, pink cheeks and a few faint lavender striae on the inner thighs and flanks. Test results relevant to or supporting a diagnosis of Cushing disease included the following: 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test: AM cortisol 23.9 ug/dl (6.7-22.6 ug/dl). Random 1019 hrs AM ACTH was 32 pg/ml (<47 pg/ml), cortisol 6.5 ug/dl (4-22ug/dl). Repeat 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test: AM cortisol was 36.5 ug/dl (4-22 ug/dl), Dexamethasone 249.2 ng/dl (140-295 expected post 1 mg DXA the night before). 24 hr urine free cortisol was 391.4 (<=45.0 ug/d). Other endocrine labs were within normal limits. Left sided hypoenhancing lesion (2mmx2mmx2mm) consistent with pituitary microadenoma was seen on pituitary MRI. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling supported the presence of central disease and left pituitary location, concordant with the MRI. The time course from first clinical presentation to surgery was impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic temporarily halting elective surgical treatments and her access to care. At August, 2020 pre-op evaluation, the COVID-19 nasopharyngeal PCR was positive. Surgery was rescheduled. She denied symptoms of COVID-19 but recalled community exposure, including known COVID-19 positive contacts, while working as a waitress. Discussion: Increased susceptibility to and increased severity of COVID-19 manifestations might be feared in Cushing disease patients due to Cushing disease-associated immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity and venous thromboembolism. In contrast, randomized control trials have shown glucocorticoids, at doses sufficient to produce iatrogenic Cushing syndrome, may improve mortality in COVID-19 patients. Although asymptomatic COVID-19 infection is known to occur in young adults, the finding of asymptomatic COVID-19 positive test in a young woman with untreated Cushing disease also raises the possibility that endogenous hypercortisolism confers a similar benefit against severe manifestations of COVID-19 infection.","Mehfooz, Ayesha; Araki, Takako; Burmeister, Lynn Ann",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090532/,129

Biologics-based immunotherapy is exerting a critical role against these diseases, whereas the usage of the immunomodulators is always limited by various factors such as susceptibility to digestion by enzymes in vivo, poor penetration across biological barriers, and rapid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. Drug delivery strategies are potent to promote their delivery. Herein, we reviewed the potential targets for immunotherapy against the major inflammatory diseases, discussed the biologics and drug delivery systems involved in the immunotherapy, particularly highlighted the approved therapy tactics, and finally offer perspectives in this field.","Xiao, Qingqing; Li, Xiaotong; Li, Yi; Wu, Zhenfeng; Xu, Chenjie; Chen, Zhongjian; He, Wei",Acta Pharm Sin B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8105778/,129

54071,Development of Antimicrobial Multifunctional Textiles to Avoid from Hospital-Acquired Infections,2021-06-09,"Ethical and consensual digital phenotyping through smartphone activity (i. e., passive behavior monitoring) permits measurement of temporal risk trajectories unlike ever before. This data collection modality may be particularly well-suited for capturing emotion dysregulation, a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, across lifespan transitions. Adolescence, emerging adulthood, and perinatal transitions are particularly sensitive developmental periods, often marked by increased distress. These participant groups are typically assessed with laboratory-based methods that can be costly and burdensome. Passive monitoring presents a relatively cost-effective and unobtrusive way to gather rich and objective information about emotion dysregulation and risk behaviors. We first discuss key theoretically-driven concepts pertaining to emotion dysregulation and passive monitoring. We then identify variables that can be measured passively and hold promise for better understanding emotion dysregulation. For example, two strong markers of emotion dysregulation are sleep disturbance and problematic use of Internet/social media (i.e., use that prompts negative emotions/outcomes). Variables related to mobility are also potentially useful markers, though these variables should be tailored to fit unique features of each developmental stage. Finally, we offer our perspective on candidate digital variables that may prove useful for each developmental transition. Smartphone-based passive monitoring is a rigorous method that can elucidate psychopathology risk across human development. Nonetheless, its use requires researchers to weigh unique ethical considerations, examine relevant theory, and consider developmentally-specific lifespan features that may affect implementation.","Vlisides-Henry, Robert D.; Gao, Mengyu; Thomas, Leah; Kaliush, Parisa R.; Conradt, Elisabeth; Crowell, Sheila E.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183608/,129

RCT is the mainstay to achieve evidence in the literature in clinical research. A RCT is the main research design to study the effect of an intervention and the only way to confirm the value of a new treatment. MAIN BODY: RCT also gives the way to generate meta-analyses and systematic reviews giving a stronger evidence for clinical practice. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is crucial for safe, effective, and standardized patient care. Although there is an agreement on the importance of performing RCT, it can be challenging to do it efficiently including different aspects like study design, funding, randomization, blinding, follow-up, data analysis, statistics, generalization of results, and reporting of quality of the studies.

Qualitative empirical research focussing on lay understandings and experiences of healthiness, or health discourses, in South Africa is fairly limited. This article addresses this gap by critically exploring how young South African adults used discourses of balance to make sense of what it means to be a healthy person and highlights the implications of these discourses for identity. Foucault’s concepts of ‘technologies of the self’ and ‘techniques of discipline’ are discussed as a theoretical grounding for this paper. Data were collected from 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews, and analysed using Foucauldian discourse analysis. This paper will specifically explore a key discourse identified through the analysis: ‘health as balance’ and 2 interrelated sub-discourses which fall within it. Through this discourse, healthiness was constructed as requiring a broad focus on improving all aspects of one’s life (‘health as holistic’) and the avoidance of any behaviours or emotions which could be classified as extreme (‘health as moderation’). Constant, careful management of the self, or ‘calibration’, functions to both perpetuate a cycle of ‘anxiety and control’ and to obscure ways in which health discourses can be harmful or problematic.","De Jong, Michelle; Collins, Anthony; Plüg, Simóne",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8407932/,129
58340,FAPIC score predicts mortality after COVID-19 vaccine-related TTS,2021-10-02,"BACKGROUND: Chagas disease is a public health problem not only in Latin America, but also in other regions, including Spain, due to migration movements. Conventional serological diagnosis requires an invasive sample (plasma or serum) and a well-equipped laboratory. To circumvent those limitations, blood samples dried on filter paper (DBS) or Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) could be a practical alternative to reference protocol for serological screening in epidemiological studies. We evaluated the usefulness of dried blood sampling and a rapid diagnostic test (Trypanosoma Detect™) for the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi for their use in community-based screening. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 162 stored paired whole-blood and serum samples from Latin American migrants and 25 negative-control blood samples were included. Diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease was performed in serum according to WHO algorithms. Blood samples were retrospectively collected as dried spots and then analyzed using two different serological techniques, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (E-CLIA). Whole-blood samples were also used to evaluate a rapid diagnostic test based on immunochromatography. A better correlation with conventional serum was observed in dried blood elutes using E-CLIA than ELISA (97% vs. 77% sensitivity, respectively). Both assays reported 100% specificity. The median cut-off index values of E-CLIA for dried blood were significantly lower than those for serum (138.1 vs. 243.3, P<0.05). The Trypanosoma Detect™ test presented a sensitivity and specificity of 89.6% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of antibodies against T. cruzi in dried blood samples shows a higher sensitivity when using E-CLIA compared with ELISA. Trypanosoma Detect™ is easier to use but has a lower sensitivity. Hence, we propose a sequential strategy based on performing the rapid test first, and a negative result will be confirmed by DBS-ECLIA for use in community Chagas disease screening programs.","Silgado, Aroa; Gual-Gonzalez, Lídia; Sánchez-Montalvá, Adrián; Oliveira-Souto, Inés; Goterris, Lidia; Serre-Delcor, Nuria; Esperalba, Juliana; Gomez-i-Prat, Jordi; Fernández-Naval, Candela; Molina, Israel; Pumarola, Tomas; Sulleiro, Elena",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479190/,129

Autoimmunity and immunodeficiency are the two faces of a dysregulated immune tolerance and surveillance and may result, along with contributing environmental and genetic factors, in an increased incidence of both tumors and infections. The latter may fuel both autoimmunity and immune activation, triggering a vicious circle among infections, tumors and autoimmune phenomena. Additionally, alterations of the microbiota and of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) pinpoint to the importance of a permissive or hostile microenvironment for tumor growth. Finally, several therapies of myeloid neoplasms are aimed at increasing host immunity against the tumor, but at the price of increased autoimmune phenomena. In this review we will examine the epidemiological association of myeloid neoplasms with autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies, and the pivotal role of autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of MDS and BMF syndromes, including the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria conundrum. Furthermore, we will briefly examine autoimmune complications following therapy of myeloid neoplasms, as well as the role of MSCs and microbiota in these settings.","Barcellini, Wilma; Fattizzo, Bruno",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511478/,129

The main objectives of this positron emission tomography (PET) study were to investigate the serotonin transporter binding potential (SERT BPND ) in patients with ADHD and to assess associations of SERT BPND between the brain regions. 25 medication-free patients with ADHD (age ± SD; 32.39 ± 10.15; 10 females) without any psychiatric comorbidity and 25 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (33.74 ± 10.20) were measured once with PET and the highly selective and specific radioligand [11 C]DASB. SERT BPND maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BPND of the investigated ROIs (P < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BPND and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R2 = 0.284, R2 = 0.167, Ps < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling. Altered interregional coupling between brain regions might be a sensitive approach to demonstrate functional and molecular alterations in psychiatric conditions.

There are few reports comparing lobectomy and sublobectomy for pulmonary TB with cavity. To compare the advantages between lobectomy and sublobectomy for localized cavitory PTB, we performed a single-institution cross sectional cohort study of the surgical patients. METHODS We consecutively included 203 patients undergoing lobectomy or sublobectomy surgery for localized cavitary PTB. All patients were followed up, recorded and compared their surgical complication, outcome and associated characteristics. RESULTS Both groups had similar outcomes after follow up for 13.1 ± 12.1 months, however, sublobectomy group suffered fewer intraoperative blood losses, shorter length of stay, and fewer operative complications than lobectomy group (P < 0.05). Both groups obtained satisfactory outcome with postoperatively medicated for similar period of time and few relapse (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION Both sublobectomy and lobectomy resection were effective ways for cavitary PTB with surgical indications. If adequate anti-TB chemotherapy had been guaranteed, sublobectomy is able to be recommended due to more lung parenchyma retain, faster recover, and fewer postoperative complications.","Yang, Yong; Zhang, Shaojun; Dong, Zhengwei; Xu, Yong; Hu, Xuefei; Jiang, Gening; Fan, Lin; Duan, Liang",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-021-01401-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731162/,129

However, no single data type may capture influenza activity with optimal sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness, and it is unknown which data types could be most useful for surveillance. We compared the performance of 10 types of electronic clinical data for timely detection of influenza clusters throughout the 2007/08 influenza season in northern California. Kaiser Permanente Northern California generated zip code-specific daily episode counts for: influenza-like illness (ILI) diagnoses in ambulatory care (AC) and emergency departments (ED), both with and without regard to fever; hospital admissions and discharges for pneumonia and influenza; antiviral drugs dispensed (Rx); influenza laboratory tests ordered (Tests); and tests positive for influenza type A (FluA) and type B (FluB). Four credible events of localized excess illness were identified. Prospective surveillance was mimicked within each data stream using a space-time permutation scan statistic, analyzing only data available as of each day, to evaluate the ability and timeliness to detect the credible events. AC without fever and Tests signaled during all four events and, along with Rx, had the most timely signals. FluA had less timely signals. ED, hospitalizations, and FluB did not signal reliably. When fever was included in the ILI definition, signals were either delayed or missed.

Repeat CT scan showed complete tumor ablation with no signs of tumor recurrence 10 months after RFA. In conclusion, RFA may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with hepatolithiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma who are poor candidates for surgical resection. Protection of the integrity of the bile duct and diaphragm during RFA can minimize postoperative complications. In case of development of post-ablation bronchobiliary fistula, cyanoacrylate glue can be used to occlude the fistula, before surgical resection is considered.","Jiang, Kai; Su, Ming; Zhang, Wenzhi; Zhao, Xiangqian; Wang, Jing; Dong, Jiahong; Huang, Zhiqiang",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12013-013-9737-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23979984/,129
61028,Intratumoral regulatory T cells from colon cancer patients comprise several activated effector populations.,2021-08-19,"Introduction: Intravenous therapy and medicines (IVTM) are the most common invasive interventions in use in healthcare. Prescribed IVTM play an essential role in the treatment of illness, management of chronic conditions and in maintaining health and wellbeing. The intravenous (IV) route is the administration of concentrated medications (diluted or undiluted) directly into peripherally or centrally inserted vascular access devices. Medication safety is a key priority and best practice standards are required to guide the safe preparation and administration of IVTM. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines. Our search will include studies concerned with the preparation and/or administration of IVTM via peripheral or central vascular access devices. We will be guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) in this review. Literature will include all trial designs, national/international guidelines, and expert consensus opinion made available in English from 2009 to present day. Conclusions: We will synthesise the evidence concerning safe and effective preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines to inform the development of a national guideline for healthcare professionals in Ireland. The availability of up-to-date, contemporaneous evidence-based practice standards will ensure quality and safety for service-users. Registration: This study has been submitted to PROSPERO and we are awaiting confirmation of registration.","Carr, Peter J; O'Connor, Laura; Gethin, Georgina; Ivory, John D; O'Hara, Paul; O'Toole, Orla; Healy, Patricia",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13028.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34124573/,129

61193,The role of alpha defensin in prosthetic joint infection (PJI) diagnosis: a literature review.,2019,"BACKGROUND We offer some perspectives and commentary on the sedation of obese patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DISCUSSION Sedation in morbidly obese patients should conform to the same broad principles now current in ICU practice. These include a general presumption against benzodiazepines as first-line agents. Opioids should be avoided in any situation where spontaneous breathing is required. Remifentanil is the preferred agent where continuous stable opioid levels using an infusion are required, because of its lack of context-sensitive accumulation. Volatile anaesthetics may be an option for the same reason but there are no substantial, controlled demonstrations of effectiveness/safety in short-term use in the ICU setting. Propofol is a valuable resource in the morbidly obese patients but the duration of continuous sedation should not exceed 6 days, in order to avoid propofol infusion syndrome. Alpha-2 agonists offer a range of theoretically positive features for the sedation of morbidly obese patients, but at present there is a lack of pharmacokinetic data and a critical mass of high-grade clinical data. Dexmedetomidine has the attraction of not causing respiratory depression or obstructive breathing during sedation and its sympatholytic effects should help deliver stable blood pressure and heart rate. Ketamine has a poor tolerability profile in adults so its use in the ICU context is largely confined to paediatrics. CONCLUSION None of the agents currently available is ideal for every situation encountered in the management of morbidly obese patients. This article identifies additional research needed to place sedation practice of obese patients on a more systematic footing.","Aantaa, Riku; Tonner, Peter; Conti, Giorgio; Longrois, Dan; Mantz, Jean; Mulier, Jan P",Multidisciplinary respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40248-015-0007-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25883785/,129

Mining sites and their environs attract a special interest in radon studies as higher levels are frequently reported in the habitats. In the present study, radon and thoron levels were measured in the dwellings of Buddonithanda, a village in the environs of proposed uranium mining site, with pin-hole (SSNTDs) dosimeters for the period of a year. The measured radon and thoron levels were found to vary widely from 14 to 675 Bq m-3 (geometric mean = 94 Bq m-3) and from 21 to 704 Bq m-3 (geometric mean = 121 Bq m-3), respectively. An attempt was made to understand the large spatial variation of these levels. The seasonal and diurnal variation studies were used in unraveling the behavior of the radioactive isotopes in indoor environment and the same was explained with the help of a simplified mathematical model. Quantification of inhalation dose due to radon and thoron was done with suitable occupancy factors.","Suman, G; Vinay Kumar Reddy, K; Sreenath Reddy, M; Gopal Reddy, Ch; Yadagiri Reddy, P",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85698-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739021/,129

In a retrospective study of 65 patients treated with LPV/r and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for severe forms of COVID-19 (median age: 67; males: 41 [63.1%]), 33 (50.8%) displayed a grade ≥2 increase in plasma levels of hepatobiliary markers, lipase, and/or triglycerides. A causal relationship between LPV/r and the AE was suspected in 9 of the 65 patients (13.8%). At 400 mg bid, the plasma trough concentrations of LPV/r were high and showed marked inter-individual variability (median [interquartile range]: 16600 [11430-20842] ng/ml for lopinavir and 501 [247-891] ng/ml for ritonavir). The trough lopinavir concentration was negatively correlated with body mass index, while the trough ritonavir concentration was positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with prothrombin activity. However, the occurrence of abnormal laboratory values was not associated with higher trough plasma concentrations of LPV/r.

The severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic-and the urgent need for safe blood products to respond to such crises-demands an immediate reconsideration of the 3-month deferral policy for MSM.We review historical HIV testing and transmission evidence, discuss the ethical ramifications of the current deferral period, and examine the issue of noncompliance with donor deferral rules. We also propose an eligibility screening format that involves an individual risk-based screening protocol and, unlike current FDA guidelines, does not effectively exclude donors on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation. Our policy proposal would allow historically marginalized community members to participate with dignity in the blood donation process without compromising blood donation and transfusion safety outcomes.

METHODS A 3 × 3 design was used to determine the highest tolerable dose of (90)Y-DOTATOC, with administered activities of 1.11, 1.48, and 1.85 GBq/m(2)/cycle given in 3 cycles at 6-wk intervals. An amino acid infusion was coadministered with the radiopharmaceutical for renal protection. Eligibility criteria included an age of 2-25 y, progressive disease, a positive lesion on (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-D-Phe(1)-octreotide scanning, a glomerular filtration rate of 80 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or more, bone marrow cellularity of 40% or more or stored autologous hematopoietic stem cells, 60% or more on the Lansky Play Scale, and informed consent. RESULTS Seventeen subjects (age, 2-24 y) received at least 1 dose of (90)Y-DOTATOC; diagnoses included neuroblastoma, embryonal and astrocytic brain tumors, paraganglioma, multiple endocrine neoplasia IIB, and neuroendocrine tumors. No dose-limiting toxicities and no individual dose reductions due to renal or hematologic toxicity were noted. No complete responses were observed; 2 subjects experienced partial response, 5 had minor responses, 6 experienced stable disease, 2 had progressive disease, and 2 withdrew. CONCLUSION Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with (90)Y-DOTATOC is safe in children and young adults and demonstrated a 12% partial response plus 29% minor response rate in patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended phase II dosing is 3 cycles of 1.85 GBq/m(2)/dose of (90)Y-DOTATOC coadministered with amino acids.","Menda, Yusuf; O'Dorisio, M Sue; Kao, Simon; Khanna, Geetika; Michael, Stacy; Connolly, Mary; Babich, John; O'Dorisio, Thomas; Bushnell, David; Madsen, Mark","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.110.075226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20847174/,129

62420,Trying to Remember How We Saw Patients on That April Morning.,2020-06-09,"Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive method for examining the gastrointestinal tract which has been successful in small intestine studies. Recently, VCE has been attempted in the colon. However, the capsule often tumbles in the wider colonic lumen, resulting in missed regions. Self-stabilizing VCE is a novel method to visualize the colon without tumbling. The aim of the present study was to comparatively quantify the effect of stabilization of a commercially available nonmodified capsule endoscope (CE) MiroCam and its modified self-stabilizing version in acute canine experiments. Two customized MiroCam CEs were reduced in volume at the nonimaging back-end to allow the attachment of a self-expanding, biocompatible stabilizing device. Four mongrel dogs underwent laparotomy and exteriorization of a 15-cm segment of the proximal descending colon. A single CE, either self-stabilizing or nonmodified was inserted through an incision into the lumen of the colon followed by pharmacologically induced colonic peristalsis. The inserted capsule was propelled distally through the colon and expelled naturally through the anus. Novel signal processing method was developed to quantify the video stabilization based on camera tracking a predetermined target point (locale). The average locale trajectory, the average radius movement of the locale, and the maximum rate of change of the locale for sequential images were significantly lower for the stabilized capsules compared to the nonstabilized ones . The feasibility of self-stabilized capsule endoscopy has been demonstrated in acute canine experiments.","Filip, Dobromir; Yadid-Pecht, Orly; Andrews, Christopher N; Mintchev, Martin P",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2011.2163165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21803680/,129

62739,Infliximab-Associated Pneumonitis Treated With Corticosteroids.,2020-09-30,"An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.","Wang, Huwen; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Chang, Ruijie; Xu, Chen; Yu, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shuxian; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Shang, Meili; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Zhang, Xinxin; Cai, Yong",Cell discovery,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619248/,129

Among these, compounds 4d and 5c that contain about 48 ethylene oxide units in the PEG chain exhibited the most favorable physicochemical and renal clearance properties. In vitro studies show that these two compounds have low plasma protein binding, a necessary condition for renal excretion. In vivo animal model results show that 4d and 5c have a higher urine recovery of the injected dose than iothalamate (a commonly considered gold standard GFR agent). Pharmacokinetic studies show that these two compounds exhibit a plasma clearance equivalent to iothalamate, but with a faster (i.e. lower) terminal half-life than iothalamate (possibly from restricted distribution into the extracellular space due to large molecular size and hydrodynamic volume). Furthermore, the plasma clearance of 4d and 5c remained unchanged upon blockage of the tubular secretion pathway with probenecid, a necessary condition for establishment of clearance via glomerular filtration exclusively. Finally, noninvasive real-time monitoring of this class of compounds was demonstrated by pharmacokinetic clearance of 5c by optical measurements in rat model, which correlates strongly with plasma concentration of the tracer. Hence, 4d and 5c are promising candidates for translation to the clinic as exogenous fluorescent tracer agents in real-time point-of-care monitoring of GFR.","Poreddy, Amruta R; Neumann, William L; Freskos, John N; Rajagopalan, Raghavan; Asmelash, Bethel; Gaston, Kimberly R; Fitch, Richard M; Galen, Karen P; Shieh, Jeng-Jong; Dorshow, Richard B",Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459210/,129

Three experiments investigated the impact of cognitive load during learning on the effects of stimulus co-occurrence and stimulus relations. Counter to the shared prediction of competing theories suggesting that effects of stimulus relations should be reduced by cognitive load during learning, effects of stimulus relations were greater (rather than smaller) under high-load compared with low-load conditions. Effects of stimulus co-occurrence were not significantly affected by cognitive load. The results are discussed in terms of theories suggesting that cognitive load can influence behavioral outcomes via strategic shifts in resource allocation in response to task-specific affordances.","Gawronski, Bertram",Personality & social psychology bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672211044322; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496704/,129

It has not been tested in patients with COPD. OBJECTIVE To determine the reliability of the Chester step test in patients with COPD and correlation with pulmonary function test and exercise test results. METHODS Thirty-two patients (mean ± SD FEV(1) 46 ± 15% of predicted) undertook 2 Chester step tests and two 6-min walk tests, on different days, in random order. A subgroup of 11 patients performed incremental cycle ergometry. RESULTS Thirty-one patients performed stage 1 of the Chester step test. Nineteen patients performed stage 2 of the Chester step test. The number of steps was highly reproducible: 66 ± 41 steps vs 68 ± 41 steps. There was no difference in heart rate or S(pO(2)) between the 2 Chester step tests at the peak of exercise or at the end of each stage. There was a significant correlation between number of steps and FEV(1) (r = 0.43, P = .02), and 6-min walk distance (r = 0.60, P = .001). Heart rate increased according to advanced stages of the Chester step test, up to 81 ± 13% of predicted. There was a significant correlation between number of steps and peak heart rate (r = 0.55, P = .001). In the 11 patients who performed the incremental cycling test there was a significant correlation between number of steps and peak work load (r = 0.69, P = .02). In the 6 patients in whom oxygen uptake could be estimated from the Chester step test, oxygen uptake was higher than that measured at the peak of the cycling test (30.8 ± 5.1 mL/kg/min vs 17.4 ± 4.5 mL/kg/min, respectively, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS Despite being highly reproducible, the Chester step test had a very short duration in patients with COPD. The number of steps incremented in each stage seems to be too large for these patients.

METHODS A prospective observational cohort study of preterm infants with suspected or diagnosed NEC. We compared the mean eight-hour cerebral, liver, and infraumbilical rSO2 and FTOE values of infants with no NEC and definite NEC and of infants with uncomplicated and complicated NEC in the first forty-eight hours after onset of symptoms, suspicious for NEC. Furthermore, we determined cut-off values by generating receiver operating characteristics curves in case of significant differences in the first eight-hour mean values of rSO2 between infants with no NEC and definite NEC and between infants with uncomplicated and complicated NEC. RESULTS We included 33 patients: 13 no NEC, 10 with uncomplicated NEC, and 10 with complicated NEC. We found no significant differences in the first twenty-four hours after onset of symptoms in rSO2 and FTOE between infants with no NEC and definite NEC. In preterm infants with complicated NEC, we observed significantly lower cerebral, liver, and infraumbilical rSO2 and higher FTOE within twenty-four hours after onset of symptoms compared with infants with uncomplicated NEC. A continuous cerebral rSO2 ≤ 71% and liver rSO2 ≤ 59% in the first eight hours after onset of symptoms predicted the onset of complicated NEC with a sensitivity of 1.0 and specificity of 0.8, and a sensitivity of 1.0 and specificity of 1.0, respectively. CONCLUSIONS By measuring the cerebral and splanchnic oxygenation it is possible to differentiate complicated NEC from uncomplicated NEC.

The AC conductivity was measured using impedance spectroscopy, in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz, at temperatures 260 K < T < 400 K and pressures 0.1 MPa < p < 500 MPa. On the basis of the impedance spectra, carefully analyzed at different thermodynamic conditions, the p-T phase diagram of the crystal is constructed. It is found to be linear in the pressure range of the experiment, with the pressure coefficient value dTs/dp = -0.023 K MPa-1. The hydrostatic pressure effect on proton conductivity is also presented and discussed. Measurements of the electrical conductivity versus time were performed at a selected temperature T = 352.3 K and at pressures 0.1 MPa < p < 360 MPa. At fixed thermodynamic conditions (p = 302 MPa, T = 352.3 K), the sluggish solid-solid transformation from low conducting to superionic phase was induced. It is established that the kinetics of this transformation can be described by the Avrami model with an effective Avrami index value of about 4, which corresponds to the classical value associated with the homogeneous nucleation and three-dimensional growth of a new phase.","Lindner, Łukasz; Zdanowska-Frączek, Maria; Czapla, Zbigniew; Frączek, Ziemowit","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620003741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831254/,129

With a focus on the impact of COVID-19 on the NHS, we describe the frontline experience of a severely affected hospital in close proximity to London. We highlight a protocol-driven approach, incorporating the use of CT in the rapid triage, assessment and cohorting of patients, in an environment where there was a lack of readily available, onsite RT-PCR testing facilities. Furthermore, the effects of the protocol on the effective streamlining of patient flow within the hospital are discussed, as are the resultant improvements in clinical management decisions within the acute care service.

64525,Recent insights into Fc-mediated effector responses to HIV-1.,2020-07-15,"INTRODUCTION There are numerous reports in the literature documenting high recurrence rates after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. The purpose of this study was to determine the learning curve for this procedure using the Cumulative Summation (CUSUM) technique. METHODS Forty-six consecutive patients with paraesophageal hernia were evaluated prospectively after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. Upper GI series was performed 3 months postoperatively to look for recurrence. Patients were stratified based on the surgeon's early (first 20 cases) and late experience (>20 cases). The CUSUM method was then used to further analyze the learning curve. RESULTS Nine patients (21%) had anatomic recurrence. There was a trend toward a higher recurrence rate during the first 20 cases, although this did not achieve statistical significance (33% vs. 13%, p = 0.10). However, using a CUSUM analysis to plot the learning curve, we found that the recurrence rate diminishes after 18 cases and reaches an acceptable rate after 26 cases. CONCLUSIONS Surgeon experience is an important predictor of recurrence after laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair. CUSUM analysis revealed there is a significant learning curve to become proficient at this procedure, with approximately 20 cases required before a consistent decrease in hernia recurrence rate is observed.","Okrainec, Allan; Ferri, Lorenzo E; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1321-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20835725/,129

A few reports showing a positive correlation between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 mortality have ushered in some hope. BCG has been suggested to confer a broad level of nonspecific protection against several pathogens, mainly via eliciting ""trained immunity"" in innate immune cells. Secondly, BCG has also been proven to provide benefits in autoimmune diseases by inducing tolerogenicity. Being an acute inflammatory disease, COVID-19 requires a therapy that induces early priming of anti-viral immune responses and regulates aberrant hyperactivity of innate-immune cells. Here, we hypothesize that BCG can offer reliable spatiotemporal protection from COVID-19 by triggering trained immunity and tolerogenesis, through multiple cellular pathways. We propose further research on BCG-mediated immunoprotection, especially in vulnerable individuals, as a strategy to halt the progress of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

64905,Author Correction: Reversing a model of Parkinson's disease with in situ converted nigral neurons.,2020-07-29,"One in four women will experience sexual assault in their lifetime. Although less than 5% of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, one in five cases reported to police are deemed baseless (by police) and therefore coded as ""unfounded."" Police officers are in a unique position to act as gatekeepers for justice in sexual assault cases, given their responsibility to investigate sexual assault reports. However, high rates of unfounded sexual assaults reveal that dismissing sexual violence has become common practice amongst the police. Much of the research on unfounded sexual assault is based on police perceptions of the sexual assault, as indicated in police reports. Women's perspectives about their experiences with police are not represented in research. This qualitative study explored women's experiences when their sexual assault report was disbelieved by the police. Data collection included open-ended and semi-structured interviews with 23 sexual assault survivors. Interviews covered four areas including the sexual assault, the experience with the police, the experience of not being believed, and the impact on their health and well-being. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into NVIVO for analysis. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's analytic method, resulting in the identification of four themes, including, (a) vulnerability, (b) drug and alcohol use during the assault, (c) police insensitivity, and (d) police process. The women in this study who experienced a sexual assault and reported the assault to police were hopeful that police would help them and justice would be served. Instead, these women were faced with insensitivity, blaming questions, lack of investigation, and lack of follow-up from the police, all of which contributed to not being believed by the institutions designed to protect them. The findings from this research demonstrate that police officers must gain a deeper understanding of trauma and sensitive communication with survivors of sexual assault.","Murphy-Oikonen, Jodie; McQueen, Karen; Miller, Ainsley; Chambers, Lori; Hiebert, Alexa",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260520978190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305675/,129

Although vaccines are usually cost-effective, their adoption depends on a multitude of factors. Because poultry vaccines are usually given to birds with a short life span, very low production cost per dose is one important challenge. Other hurdles are to ensure a consistent and reliable supply of very large number of doses, and to have flexible production processes to accommodate a range of different pathogens and dosage requirements. Most poultry vaccines are currently being produced on primary avian cells derived from chicken or waterfowl embryos. This production system is associated with high costs, logistic complexities, rigid intervals between harvest and production, and supply limitations. We investigated whether the continuous cell lines Cairina retina and CR.pIX may provide a substrate independent of primary cell cultures or embryonated eggs. Viruses examined for replication in these cell lines are strains associated with, or contained in vaccines against egg drop syndrome, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, avian influenza, infectious bursal disease and Derzsy's disease. Each of the tested viruses required the development of unique conditions for replication that are described here and can be used to generate material for in vivo efficacy studies and to accelerate transfer of the processes to larger production volumes.","Jordan, Ingo; John, Katrin; Höwing, Kristin; Lohr, Verena; Penzes, Zoltán; Gubucz-Sombor, Erzsébet; Fu, Yan; Gao, Peng; Harder, Timm; Zádori, Zoltán; Sandig, Volker",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2016.1138280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26814192/,129
66483,Transient changes in white matter microstructure during general anesthesia.,2021,"Using spectroscopic rulers to track multiple conformations of single biomolecules and their dynamics have revolutionized the understanding of structural dynamics and its contributions to biology. While the FRET-based ruler reports on inter-dye distances in the 3-10 nm range, other spectroscopic techniques, such as protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE), report on the proximity between a dye and a protein surface in the shorter 0-3 nm range. Regardless of the method of choice, its use in measuring freely-diffusing biomolecules one at a time retrieves histograms of the experimental parameter yielding separate centrally-distributed sub-populations of biomolecules, where each sub-population represents either a single conformation that stayed unchanged within milliseconds, or multiple conformations that interconvert much faster than milliseconds, and hence an averaged-out sub-population. In single-molecule FRET, where the reported parameter in histograms is the inter-dye FRET efficiency, an intrinsically disordered protein, such as the α-Synuclein monomer in buffer, was previously reported as exhibiting a single averaged-out sub-population of multiple conformations interconverting rapidly. While these past findings depend on the 3-10 nm range of the FRET-based ruler, we sought to put this protein to the test using single-molecule PIFE, where we track the fluorescence lifetime of site-specific sCy3-labeled α-Synuclein proteins one at a time. Interestingly, using this shorter range spectroscopic proximity sensor, sCy3-labeled α-Synuclein exhibits several lifetime sub-populations with distinctly different mean lifetimes that interconvert in 10-100 ms. These results show that while α-Synuclein might be disordered globally, it nonetheless attains stable local structures. In summary, in this work we highlight the advantage of using different spectroscopic proximity sensors that track local or global structural changes one biomolecule at a time.","Zaer, Sofia; Lerner, Eitan",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125097/,129

The need for rapid treatment of this disease entity is without question; however, the best method for treatment is still undetermined. Here, we present our results using the stent-in-stent technique, without coiling, for these patients and propose that it is a viable treatment strategy. METHODS We identified in our local database for neurointerventional therapy, between 1st October 2000 and 1st January 2014, 93 patients with potential subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to vertebrobasilar pathology. After review of the clinical notes and imaging, 15 were found to have presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with stents alone. All dissections were spontaneous with no history of preceding trauma. The ages ranged between 46 and 71 years (mean 61 years). RESULTS All patients presented with Fischer grade 4 SAH and had a visible pseudoaneurysm. The pre-operative GCS varied with two patients scoring 3, one patient scoring 6 and the remaining 12 patients scoring 8 or above. All cases were subjected to stent-in-stent treatment alone. We did not experience any intra-procedural complications. In our series, eight patients had full recovery with a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 5, three had moderate disability (GOS 4), one had severe disability (GOS 3), and three patents died, one patient from stent thrombosis or re-bleeding and two from their initial SAH. CONCLUSION The stent-in-stent technique represents a viable reconstructive endovascular surgical technique with a low risk of intra-procedural complication and post-operative repeat haemorrhage.","Bhogal, Pervinder; Brouwer, Patrick A; Söderqvist, Åsa Kuntze; Ohlsson, Marcus; Andersson, Tommy; Holmin, Staffan; Söderman, Michael",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-015-1505-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25740790/,129
67088,Cross talk between COVID-19 and breast cancer.,2021-02-15,"INTRODUCTION Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign neoplasms of the female reproductive tract. Myomectomy is the preferred surgical treatment in reproductive-aged women who desire to retain their fertility. The use of a laparoscopic approach for large myomas is still controversial, although there are several compelling reasons for its use. The laparoscopic removal of giant uterine myomas is rare, and only a few cases have been published in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION We report the case of a 33-year-old white woman who was referred to our clinic with progressive abdominal distension. An ultrasonic examination revealed a markedly enlarged uterus containing a 17 cm uterine myoma. Laparoscopic myomectomy was selected as the treatment option. The laparoscopy confirmed the 17 cm fundal intramural myoma. The myoma was totally enucleated and removed without disturbing her endometrial cavity. The myometrial defect was repaired with a continuous suture using the V-loc suture in two layers. The entire myoma was removed using a tissue morcellator. The total weight of the myoma removed was 2005g, and the operation lasted for 140 minutes. Her postoperative course was unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic myomectomy offers many advantages compared with abdominal myomectomy. Although the use of a laparoscopic approach to treat very large myomas is controversial and technically demanding, we successfully performed a laparoscopic myomectomy in a patient with a giant myoma. This case confirms the efficiency, reliability, and safety of a minimally invasive surgical approach to treating a giant uterine myoma. Laparoscopic myomectomy can be performed by experienced surgeons regardless of the size of the myoma.","Aksoy, Huseyin; Aydin, Turgut; Özdamar, Özkan; Karadag, Özge Idem; Aksoy, Ulku",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-015-0771-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26674527/,129
67592,Renal Complications Related to Checkpoint Inhibitors: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies.,2021-06-30,"There are four major classes of antifungals with the predominant mechanism of action being targeting of cell wall or cell membrane. As in other drugs, low solubility of these compounds has led to low bioavailability in target tissues. Enhanced drug dosages has effects such as toxicity, drug-drug interactions and increased drug resistance by fungi. This article reviews current state-of-art of antifungals, structure, mechanism of action, other usages, and toxic side effects. The emergence of nanoformulations to transport and uniformly release cargo at the target site is a boon in antifungal treatment. The article details research that lead to the development of nanoformulations of antifungals and potential advantages and avoidance of the lacunae characterizing conventional drugs. A range of nanoformulations based on liposomes, polymers are in various stages of research and their potential advantages have been brought out. It could be observed that under similar dosages, test models and duration, nanoformulations provided enhanced activity, reduced toxicity, higher uptake and higher immunostimulatory effects. In most instances the mechanism of antifungal activity of nanoformulations were similar to that of regular antifungal. There are possibilities of coupling multiple antifungals on the same nano-platform. Increased activity coupled with multiple mechanisms of action presents for nanoformulations a tremendous opportunity to overcome antifungal resistance. In the years to come robust methods for preparation of nanoformulations taking into account the repeatability and reproducibility in action, furthering the studies on nanoformulation toxicity and studies of human models are required prior to extensive use of nanoformulations as a prescribed drug.

As progranulin undergoes secretion and endocytosis, a small number of progranulin-expressing cells can potentially supply the protein to the entire central nervous system. Thus, gene therapy is a promising treatment approach. METHODS We evaluated adeno-associated viral vector administration into the cerebrospinal fluid as a minimally invasive approach to deliver the granulin gene to the central nervous system in a murine disease model and nonhuman primates. RESULTS In progranulin-deficient mice, vector delivery into the lateral cerebral ventricles increased progranulin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and normalized histological and biochemical markers of progranulin deficiency. A single vector injection into the cisterna magna of nonhuman primates achieved CSF progranulin concentrations up to 40-fold higher than those of normal human subjects and exceeded CSF progranulin levels of successfully treated mice. Animals treated with an adeno-associated virus serotype 1 vector exhibited progranulin expression fivefold higher than those treated with an AAV5 vector or the AAV9 variant, AAVhu68, apparently due to remarkably efficient transduction of ependymal cells. Progranulin expression mediated by adeno-associated viral vectors was well tolerated in nonhuman primates with no evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, even at vector doses that induced supraphysiologic progranulin expression. INTERPRETATION These findings support the development of AAV1-based gene therapy for frontotemporal dementia caused by progranulin deficiency.","Hinderer, Christian; Miller, Rod; Dyer, Cecilia; Johansson, Julia; Bell, Peter; Buza, Elizabeth; Wilson, James M",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937039/,129

We assessed, in an interim analysis, the efficacy of a carrageenan-based gel in reducing the risk of new detections of anal HPV among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM). METHODS The LIMIT-HPV study (Lubricant Investigation in Men to Inhibit Transmission of HPV Infection) is a phase IIb, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trial conducted in Montreal, Canada. gbMSM were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a carrageenan-based or placebo gel. Participants were instructed to apply the gel to the anus, condom and/or partners' penis before and-as required-during receptive anal intercourse. Questionnaire data and anal samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. We estimated new detections of anal HPV infection(s) detected via Linear Array using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Participants recruited from February 2016 to December 2019 were randomly assigned to the carrageenan (n=127) or placebo (n=128) arm. The efficacy and safety analyses included 201 and 210 participants. The median follow-up time was 7.6 months (range: 0-28.5) in the carrageenan group and 9.3 months (range: 0-40.7) in the placebo group. The HR for new detections was 1.21 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.70): 69.4% and 65.1% new detections of HPV in the carrageenan and placebo arms, respectively. More adverse events were reported in the carrageenan (59.8%) compared with the placebo (39.8%) arm. CONCLUSIONS The interim analysis did not demonstrate a protective effect of carrageenan on the risk of new detections of anal HPV infection among gbMSM. Carrageenan gel use was associated with a higher proportion of adverse events. Given these findings and the (assumed) low probability that a beneficial effect would be found by the study's end, the trial was terminated as recommended by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board.

68588,Iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis: Percutaneous endovascular treatment options.,2015,"Individuals with low socio-economic status (SES) have a higher risk of dying following hip fracture compared with individuals with high SES. Evidence on social inequalities in non-hip fractures is lacking as well as evidence on the impact of SES on health-related quality of life post fracture. INTRODUCTION Fragility fractures, especially of the hip, cause substantial excess mortality and impairment in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between socio-economic status (SES) and post-fracture mortality and HRQoL. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to the last week of November 2018 for studies reporting an association between SES and post-fracture mortality and/or HRQoL among people aged ≥ 50 years. Risk ratios (RRs) were meta-analyzed using a standard inverse-variance-weighted random effects model. Studies using individual-level and area-based SES measures were analyzed separately. RESULTS A total of 24 studies from 15 different countries and involving more than one million patients with hip fractures were included. The overall risk of mortality within 1-year post-hip fracture in individuals with low SES was 24% higher than in individuals with high SES (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.29) for individual-level SES measures, and 14% (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.19) for area-based SES measures. The quality of the evidence for the outcome mortality was moderate. Using individual SES measures, we estimated the excess HRQoL loss to be 5% (95% CI - 1 to 10%) among hip fracture patients with low SES compared with high SES. CONCLUSIONS We found a consistently increased risk of post-hip fracture mortality with low SES across SES measures and across countries with different political structures and different health and social care infrastructures. The impact of SES on post-fracture HRQoL remains uncertain due to sparse and low-quality evidence.","Valentin, G; Pedersen, S E; Christensen, R; Friis, K; Nielsen, C P; Bhimjiyani, A; Gregson, C L; Langdahl, B L",Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-019-05143-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471664/,129

The electron-poor character of the ring and stabilization of the radical anion through all four nitrogen atoms in their metal complexes provide new aspects in molecular magnetism towards the synthesis of new high performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs). The scope of this review is to examine the role of s -tetrazine radical ligands in transition metal and lanthanide based SMMs and provide a critical overview of the progress thus far in this field. As well, general synthetic routes and new insights for the preparation of s -tetrazines are discussed, along with their redox activity and applications in various fields.

This cross-sectional study was carried out in April 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdown procedures were implemented; 86 married couples participated in this study amounting to 172 responses in total. A different questionnaire was set for women and men; the couple filled out their respective questionnaire simultaneously, but privately where one did not see the answers of the other. Inclusion criteria included married couples of all ages that are living together during the lockdown of COVID-19. The results of this study showed that a higher total abuse score was found in 39 females (45.3%; CI: 0.34 - 0.56). Being a Muslim female (Beta =24.80) and females having higher anxiety (Beta=0.97) were significantly associated with higher total abuse scores, whereas higher stress score in female (Beta=-0.61) was significantly associated with lower total abuse scores. In conclusion, this study focuses on VAW as a serious problem while demonstrating its further emergence during quarantine. This study also focused on the effects brought on by lockdown policies, including social and economic factors, and their implications in the increase of VAW during this pandemic.","Akel, Marwan; Berro, Jana; Rahme, Clara; Haddad, Chadia; Obeid, Sahar; Hallit, Souheil",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260521997953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685271/,129

METHODS A cost-effectiveness study comparing prophylaxis versus on-demand was conducted on 34 hemophilia patients (24 and 10 patients were on the prophylaxis and on-demand regimens respectively) in 2017. The Markov model was used to estimate the economic and clinical outcomes. The costs were collected from the societal perspective, and the utility criterion was the 'quality adjusted life year (QALY)' indicator. The required data were collected using a researcher-made cost checklist, the EQ5D standard questionnaire and Hemophilia Joint Health Score. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to determine the robustness of the results. RESULTS The means of costs, joint health score and QALY in the prophylaxis regimen were $478,963.1 purchasing power parity (PPP), 96.67, and 11.98 respectively, and in the on-demand regimen were $521,797.2 PPP, 93.46 and 10.99 respectively. The PSA confirmed the robustness of the model's results. The results of the scatter plots and acceptability curves showed that the prophylaxis regimen in 97% of the simulations for the thresholds below $20950 PPP was more cost-effective than on-demand regimen. CONCLUSION Prophylaxis regimen showed the lower costs and higher effectiveness and utility in comparison with the on-demand regimen. It is recommended that prophylaxis should be considered as the standard care for treatment of hemophilic patients.","Zahedi, Zohreh; Karimi, Mehran; Keshavarz, Khosro; Haghpanah, Sezaneh; Ravangard, Ramin",Hematology,https://doi.org/10.1080/16078454.2021.1885123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594948/,129
69511,The Lateral Antebrachial Neurocutaneous Flap: A Cadaveric Study and Clinical Applications.,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The diagnosis of spinal vascular malformations may be challenging on conventional MR imaging because neither the location of the signal abnormality in the spinal cord nor the level of the abnormal flow voids correlates with the level of the fistula. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the utility of using a time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics sequence in the diagnosis, characterization, and localization of spinal vascular malformations, comparing it with the criterion standard of spinal DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-five consecutive patients with a suspected diagnosis of spinal vascular malformation underwent time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics followed by spinal DSA. All scans were performed on a 1.5T scanner by using a standard 8-channel spine coil and were reported by a neuroradiologist before the DSA was performed. RESULTS Forty-seven lesions were confirmed on time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics and classified as spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (n = 33, with 1 patient having a type Ib fistula), perimedullary spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas (n = 10), and intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (n = 3). One patient had an extradural spinal vascular malformation. Time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics identified the location of the arterial feeder to within 1 vertebral level in 27/33 patients (81.8%) with spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas and correctly predicted the side in 22/33 (66.6%) patients. Perimedullary spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas were erroneously considered to represent spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas before spinal DSA. The anatomy of the arterial supply to intramedullary arteriovenous malformations was also poorly characterized on time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography. CONCLUSIONS It has been our experience that time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics is a useful confirmatory tool when a spinal vascular malformation is suspected on the basis of clinical and conventional MR imaging findings. As experience with the technique grows and sequences are refined, it may be possible to rely on time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics as a screening tool for the diagnosis of spinal vascular malformations.","Amarouche, M; Hart, J L; Siddiqui, A; Hampton, T; Walsh, D C",AJNR.

It requires in-depth understanding of the effect of congenital shunt lesions on the uptake, delivery, and equilibration of anesthetic drugs. Intracardiac shunts can alter the induction time and if delivery of anesthetic agent is not carefully titrated, can lead to overdosing and undesirable myocardial depression. AIMS To study the effect of congenital shunt lesions on the speed of inhalational induction and also the impact of inhalational induction on hemodynamics in the presence of congenital shunt lesions. SETTING Tertiary care hospital. DESIGN A prospective, single-center clinical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ninety-three pediatric patients undergoing elective surgery were segregated into three equal groups, namely, Group 1: no CHD, Group 2: acyanotic CHD, and Group 3: cyanotic CHD. General anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane in 6 L/min air-oxygen. The time to induction was noted at loss of eyelash reflex and decrease in bispectral index (BIS) value below 60. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration, minimum alveolar concentration, and BIS were recorded at 15 s intervals for the 1 st min followed by 30 s interval for another 1 min during induction. Hemodynamic data were recorded before and after induction. RESULTS Patients in Group 3 had significantly prolonged induction time (99 ± 12.3 s; P < 0.001), almost twice that of the patients in other two groups (51 ± 11.3 s in Group 1 and 53 ± 12.0 s in Group 2). Hypotension occurred after induction in Group 1. No other adverse hemodynamic perturbations were observed. CONCLUSION The time to inhalational induction of anesthesia is significantly prolonged in patients with right-to-left shunt, compared to patients without CHD or those with left-to-right shunt, in whom it is similar. Sevoflurane is safe and maintains stable hemodynamics in the presence of CHD.","Hasija, Suruchi; Chauhan, Sandeep; Jain, Pawan; Choudhury, Arin; Aggarwal, Neelam; Pandey, Ravinder Kumar",Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.4103/0971-9784.185531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27397451/,129

The present study analyzes the long-term outcomes in 13 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for SMAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study of 10 females and three males undergoing surgery between 2001 and 2013 was performed. Demographic, clinical and radiologic data and long-term surgical outcomes were recorded. In 12 patients latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy and in one patient distal laparoscopic gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction were performed. The median age was 24 years (20-28), and the median duration of symptoms was 24 months (5-24). The most frequent symptoms were abdominal pain (n = 11; 92.3%), nausea and vomiting (n = 10; 77%) and weight loss (n = 9; 69.2%). The median operating time was 98 min (86-138) and hospital stay was 3 days (1-14). RESULTS No reconversions occurred, and one patient experienced gastric emptying delay in the immediate postoperative period with spontaneous resolution. In four patients, SMAS was associated with severe stenosis of the celiac trunk which was treated in the same operation, and four patients presented stenosis of the left renal vein (the ""nutcracker"" phenomenon). With a median follow-up of 94 months (SD 65.3), eight patients (61.5%) had excellent results. One patient had a relapse of symptoms 4 years after surgery requiring distal gastrectomy, two patients presented delay in gastric emptying following temporary improvement and one patient experienced no improvement. CONCLUSIONS Latero-lateral duodenojejunostomy yields good results in SMAS although it requires other gastric motility disorders to be ruled out for appropriate treatment to be established.","Cienfuegos, Javier A; Hurtado-Pardo, Luis; Valentí, Víctor; Landecho, Manuel F; Vivas, Isabel; Estévez, Mateo G; Diez-Caballero, Alberto; Hernández-Lizoáin, José Luis; Rotellar, Fernando",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05413-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32030438/,129

Suppression of RNA silencing activities were made evident using viral infection of silenced Nicotiana benthamiana 16C, N. benthamiana agroinfiltrated with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and GF-FG hairpin triggers supplemented with viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) constructs or using complementation of a silencing-suppressor-defective BNYVV virus in Chenopodium quinoa. Northern blot analyses of small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in agroinfiltration tests revealed reduced amounts of siRNA, especially secondary siRNA, suggesting that benyvirus VSR act downstream of the siRNA production. Using confocal laser-scanning microscopy imaging of infected protoplasts expressing functional p14 protein fused to an enhanced GFP reporter, we showed that benyvirus p14 accumulated in the nucleolus and the cytoplasm independently of other viral factors. Site-directed mutagenesis showed the importance of the nucleolar localization signal embedded in a C4 zinc-finger domain in the VSR function and intrinsic stability of the p14 protein. Conversely, RNA silencing suppression appeared independent of the nucleolar localization of the protein, and a correlation between BNYVV VSR expression and long-distance movement was established.","Chiba, Sotaro; Hleibieh, Kamal; Delbianco, Alice; Klein, Elodie; Ratti, Claudio; Ziegler-Graff, Véronique; Bouzoubaa, Salah; Gilmer, David",Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,https://doi.org/10.1094/mpmi-06-12-0142-r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23013437/,129

Over one third of national COVID-19 cases are among Latinos, likely due to an increased prevalence of comorbid risk factors and social determinants of health that make following precautions difficult. DESIGN Respondents were recruited using snowball sampling as part of a previous effort to establish an academic-community partnership with Latinos in the area. In April 2020, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews in Spanish with participants over the phone. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into Spanish, and translated to English. We employed the framework approach in a thematic analysis using NVivo 12. RESULTS Common themes were a wariness of news appearing on social media, generalized worry, and the use of natural medicines to maintain health. Respondents followed recommended guidelines to protect their own health, though expressed concern that members of their community were not. CONCLUSIONS We offer insights into the perception of Latinos of the COVID-19 pandemic in a rural state. Our findings may influence communication techniques of local health departments and offer a way to understand how this often-overlooked community deals with the pandemic.","Moyce, Sally; Velazquez, Maria; Claudio, David; Thompson, Sophia; Metcalf, Madeline; Aghbashian, Elizabeth; Vanderwood, Karl; Sisson, Nathaniel",Ethnicity & health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2020.1838456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126820/,129

Morgue personnel may be at risk of contracting secondary meningococcal disease. We review the current scientific literature regarding Neisseria meningitidis infection and provide recommendations for the prevention of meningococcal disease at autopsy. Methods A PubMed search utilizing applicable medical subject heading terms was performed retrieving articles for review from the preceding two decades. Pertinent current guidelines from multiple national organizations were also retrieved. Results Invasive meningococcal disease is transmitted by direct contact with large respiratory droplets or oral secretions. While a surgical mask would normally provide adequate protection from large droplet spread, it does not prevent inhalation of smaller aerosolized particles such as those generated at autopsy. Prosectors are advised to routinely wear N-95 respirator masks or powered respirator hoods. All published cases of secondary meningococcal disease transmission to healthcare workers invariably arose in scenarios in which face masks/respirators were not employed; none of these cases involved meningococcal disease transmission to ME/C or other morgue staff. Discussion In the event that no mask-or inadequate coverage such as a surgical mask-is employed during autopsy of a decedent suspected/confirmed to have invasive meningococcal disease, antibiotic prophylaxis is advisable. Assuming appropriate personal protective equipment is utilized, chemoprophylaxis is unnecessary. Routine meningococcal vaccination is not recommended, except for ME/C with specified immunocompromising conditions or traveling to hyperendemic/endemic meningococcal regions.

70574,Audio Interview: Operation Warp Speed and Covid-19.,2020-08-27,"UNLABELLED Treatment of human excreta and animal manure (HEAM) is key in controlling the spread of persistent enteric pathogens, such as viruses. The extent of virus inactivation during HEAM storage and treatment appears to vary with virus genome type, although the reasons for this variability are not clear. Here, we investigated the inactivation of viruses of different genome types under conditions representative of HEAM storage or mesophilic digestion. The goals were to characterize the influence of HEAM solution conditions on inactivation and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. Specifically, eight viruses representing the four viral genome types (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA], double-stranded RNA [dsRNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], and double-stranded DNA [dsDNA]) were exposed to synthetic solutions with well-controlled temperature (20 to 35°C), pH (8 to 9), and ammonia (NH3) concentrations (0 to 40 mmol liter(-1)). DNA and dsRNA viruses were considerably more resistant than ssRNA viruses, resulting in up to 1,000-fold-longer treatment times to reach a 4-log inactivation. The apparently slower inactivation of DNA viruses was rationalized by the higher stability of DNA than that of ssRNA in HEAM. Pushing the system toward harsher pH (>9) and temperature (>35°C) conditions, such as those encountered in thermophilic digestion and alkaline treatments, led to more consistent inactivation kinetics among ssRNA and other viruses. This suggests that the dependence of inactivation on genome type disappeared in favor of protein-mediated inactivation mechanisms common to all viruses. Finally, we recommend the use of MS2 as a conservative indicator to assess the inactivation of ssRNA viruses and the stable ΦX174 or dsDNA phages as indicators for persistent viruses. IMPORTANCE Viruses are among the most environmentally persistent pathogens. They can be present in high concentrations in human excreta and animal manure (HEAM). Therefore, appropriate treatment of HEAM is important prior to its reuse or discharge into the environment. Here, we investigated the factors that determine the persistence of viruses in HEAM, and we determined the main mechanisms that lead to their inactivation. Unlike other organisms, viruses can have four different genome types (double- or single-stranded RNA or DNA), and the viruses studied herein represent all four types. Genome type appeared to be the major determinant for persistence. Single-stranded RNA viruses are the most labile, because this genome type is susceptible to degradation in HEAM. In contrast, the other genome types are more stable; therefore, inactivation is slower and mainly driven by the degradation of viral proteins. Overall, this study allows us to better understand the behavior of viruses in HEAM.","Decrey, Loïc; Kazama, Shinobu; Kohn, Tamar",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01106-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27260358/,129

Seven herbs of traditional Chinese medicine, namely, Ephedra sinica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Caragana korshinskii, Allium mongolicum, Thymus vulgaris, Astragalus membranaceus, and Lespedeza bicolor are commonly grazed by Tan sheep. It has been widely believed that these herbs are of high nutritive value, which may significantly contribute to the high meat quality and distinct flavor of Tan sheep. However, the nutritive values of these herbs have not been evaluated to date. In this study, samples of the seven herbs were collected from the steppe of Yanchi County of Ningxia Autonomous Region of China. The dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), ash (Ash), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) of these herbs were measured using locally cultivated alfalfa as the standard forage. Digestion of the dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and crude protein in the rumen of Tan sheep was examined using the nylon bag method, in order to evaluate their feeding nutritional value. Our results show that all the seven herbs meet the nutritional needs of ruminants based on the standard forage alfalfa. However, Ephedra, Glycyrrhiza, Caragana, Allium, Astragalus, and Lespedeza have higher nutritive value than Thymus (P < 0.05). According to the ruminal degradation rates of dry matter, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and crude protein, the nutritive value of Caragana, Allium, and Lespedeza is higher than that of Ephedra, Glycyrrhiza, Astragalus, and Thymus (P < 0.05). The overall nutritive value of Allium is the highest among the seven herbs and therefore Allium is recommended to better meet the nutritional needs of Tan sheep.","Jiang, Biwei; Zhou, Yuxiang; Wang, Tian; Li, Fei",Bioengineered,https://doi.org/10.1080/21655979.2020.1834740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084492/,129

This prospective study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of catheter removal on postoperative day (POD) 2 versus POD 4 after LRP and its impact on urinary continence outcomes. METHODS One hundred and thirteen patients underwent LRP and were prospectively randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 57) had the urinary catheter removed on POD 2 while group 2 (n = 56) had the catheter removed on POD 4. The urine loss ratio (ULR) was defined as the weight of urine loss in the pad divided by the daily micturition volume. Continence was defined as a pad-free status. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in clinical features between groups 1 and 2. Acute urinary retention (AUR) after catheter removal occurred in 21 patients (18.6%) (13 (22.8%) in group 1 and 8 (14.3%) in group 2 (p = 0.244). The first-day mean ULR values were 1.16 ± 4.95 in group 1 and 1.02 ± 3.27 in group 2 (p = 0.870). The last-day mean ULR values were 0.57 ± 1.60 in group 1 and 2.78 ± 15.49 in group 2 (p = 0.353). Continence rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 21.8, 41.1, 58.0, and 71.4% in group 1 and 34.5, 66.0, 79.2, and 83.7% in group 2 (p = 0.138, 0.009, 0.024, and 0.146, respectively). In AUR cases, continence rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 0, 23.1, 38.5, and 54.5% in group 1 and 37.5, 75.0, 87.5, and 87.5% in group 2 (p = 0.017, 0.020, 0.027, and 0.127, respectively). A multivariate analysis identified AUR after catheter removal on POD 2 as the only predictive factor for incontinence 6 and 9 months after LRP (p = 0.030 and 0.018, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrated that early catheter removal on POD 2 after LRP may increase the risk of incontinence.

72196,Barriers to Accessing Healthcare Services for People with Parkinson's Disease: A Scoping Review.,2021-07-23,"Aspiration efficiencies from nose and mouth inhalations are investigated at low and high inhalation rates by using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software CFX 11. A realistic human head with detailed facial features was constructed. Facial features were matched to represent the 50th percentile of a human male, aged between 20 and 65 years old, based on anthropometric data. The constant freestream velocity was 0.2 ms(-1), normal to the face, and inhalation rates through the mouth and nose were 15 liters per minute (LPM) for light breathing and 40 LPM for heavy breathing. It was found that the flow field in the near breathing region exhibited vertical direction caused by the presence of the torso where the airstream diverges as it flows around and over the body. The critical area concept was used as a tool to determine the aspiration efficiency of particles. Comparisons between critical areas for the nose and mouth inhalations show similar geometric properties such as the area's shape, and its vertical distance location on the x-z plane located at y = 80 cm upstream. The critical area sizes were found to be slightly larger for the mouth inhalation mainly due to the larger mouth area and also the aligned orientation of the mouth to the upstream flow, whereas the nose is perpendicular to the upstream flow. This study was undertaken to establish the flow field in the near breathing region that will help to characterize the flow and particle field for initial boundary conditions leading to a more holistic modeling approach of respiration through the internal nasal cavity and mouth.","Se, Camby Mei King; Inthavong, Kiao; Tu, Jiyuan",Inhalation toxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08958370903295204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070173/,129

72277,Gastrointestinal implications in COVID-19.,2020-09-14,"Using advanced diffusion MRI, we aimed to assess the microstructural properties of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) preceding conversion to white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) using 3-tissue diffusion signal compositions in ischemic stroke. Data were obtained from the Cognition and Neocortical Volume After Stroke (CANVAS) study. Diffusion-weighted MR and high-resolution structural brain images were acquired 3- (baseline) and 12-months (follow-up) post-stroke. WMHs were automatically segmented and longitudinal assessment at 12-months was used to retrospectively delineate NAWM voxels at baseline converting to WMHs. NAWM voxels converting to WMHs were further dichotomized into either: ""growing"" WMHs if NAWM adhered to existing WMH voxels, or ""isolated de-novo"" WMHs if NAWM was unconnected to WMH voxels identified at baseline. Microstructural properties were assessed using 3-tissue diffusion signal compositions consisting of white matter-like (WM-like: TW), grey matter-like (GM-like: TG), and cerebrospinal fluid-like (CSF-like: TC) signal fractions. Our findings showed that NAWM converting to WMHs already exhibited similar changes in tissue compositions at baseline to WMHs with lower TW and increased TC (fluid-like, i.e. free-water) and TG compared to persistent NAWM. We also found that microstructural properties of persistent NAWM were related to overall WMH burden with greater free-water content in patients with high WMH load. These findings suggest that NAWM preceding conversion to WMHs are accompanied by greater fluid-like properties indicating increased tissue water content. Increased GM-like properties may indicate a more isotropic microstructure of tissue reflecting a degree of hindered diffusion in NAWM regions vulnerable to WMH development. These results support the usefulness of microstructural compositions as a sensitive marker of NAWM vulnerability to WMH pathogenesis.","Khan, Wasim; Khlif, Mohamed Salah; Mito, Remika; Dhollander, Thijs; Brodtmann, Amy",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577935/,129

It is well known that the design of the HD catheter has a considerable effect on blood recirculation and thrombus formation around it, which may cause inefficiencies or malfunctions during HD. However, hemodynamic analyses through parametric studies of its designs have been rarely performed; moreover, only comparisons between the existing models have been reported. In this study, we numerically analyzed the design of the HD catheter's side hole and distal tip for evaluating their effects on hemodynamic factors such as recirculation rate (RR), shear stress, and blood damage index (BDI). The results indicated that a larger side hole and a nozzle-shaped distal tip can significantly reduce the RR and shear stress around the HD catheter. Furthermore, based on these hemodynamic insights, we proposed three new HD catheter designs and compared their performances with existing catheters using numerical and in vitro methods. These new designs exhibited lower RRs and BDI values, thus providing better performance than the existing models. These results can help toward commercialization of more efficient HD catheters.","Cho, Seongsu; Song, Ryungeun; Park, Sun Cheol; Park, Hoon Suk; Abbasi, Muhammad Salman; Lee, Jinkee",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181539/,129
72806,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH): novel therapies for an ancient disease.,2020-11-01,"The widespread COVID-19 pandemic has been, currently, converted to a catastrophic human health challenge. Vitamin D (VD) and its metabolites have been used as a palliative treatment for chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases from ancient times. In the current study, some molecular aspects of the potential effects of VD against COVID-19 side-effects have been discussed. An arguable role in autophagy or apoptosis control has been suggested for VD through calcium signaling at the mitochondrial and ER levels. 1,25(OH)2D3 is also an immunomodulator that affects the development of B-cells, T-cells, and NK cells in both innate and acquired immunity. The production of some anti-microbial molecules such as defensins and cathelicidins is also stimulated by VD. The overexpression of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and down-regulation of NADPH oxidase are induced by VD to reduce the oxidative stress. Moreover, the multi-organ failure due to a cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV2 in COVID-19 may be prevented by the immunomodulatory effects of VD. It can also downregulate the renin-angiotensin system which has a protective role against cardiovascular complications induced by COVID-19. Given the many experimental and molecular evidences due to the potential protective effects of VD on the prevention of the COVID-19-induced morbidities, a VD supplementation is suggested to prevent the lethal side-effects of the infection. It is particularly recommended in VD-deficient patients or those at greater risk of serious or critical effects of COVID-19, including the elderly, and patients with pre-existing chronic diseases, especially those in nursing homes, care facilities, and hospitals.","Shiravi, Amir-Abbas; Saadatkish, Milad; Abdollahi, Zeinab; Miar, Paniz; Khanahmad, Hossein; Zeinalian, Mehrdad",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

We investigated whether framing can bias these decisions and if risk preferences shift depending on the number of patients. Hypothetical information about two medicines used in clinical trials having a sure or a risky outcome was presented in either a gain frame (people would be saved) or a loss frame (people would die). The number of patients who signed up for the clinical trials was manipulated in both frames in all the experiments. Using an unnamed disease, lay participants (experiment 1) and would-be medical professionals (experiment 2) were asked to choose which medicine they would have administered. For COVID-19, lay participants were asked which medicine should medical professionals (experiment 3), artificially intelligent software (experiment 4), and they themselves (experiment 5) favor to be administered. Broadly consistent with prospect theory, people were more risk-seeking in the loss frames than the gain frames. Risk-aversion in gain frames was sensitive to the number of lives with risk-neutrality at low magnitudes and risk-aversion at high magnitudes. In the loss frame, participants were mostly risk-seeking. This pattern was consistent across laypersons and medical professionals, further extended to preferences for choices that medical professionals and artificial intelligence programs should make in the context of COVID-19. These results underscore how medical decisions can be impacted by the number of lives at stake and reveal inconsistent risk preferences for clinical trials during a real pandemic.","Mukherjee, Sumitava; Reji, Divya",Quarterly journal of experimental psychology,https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218211052037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34609226/,129

METHODS Prepare and identify AGEs. BMSCs were isolated from 16 SD rats and cultured with different concentration of AGEs. Cell viability was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). BMSCs were cultured with AGEs (0.25 mg/ml) for 30 min, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. In addition, BMSCs were cultured with AGEs, AGEs + JNK inhibitor and AGEs + P38 inhibitor for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to determine the protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. RESULTS Cell viability of BMSCs was significantly correlated with concentration and effect time of AGEs (P < 0.05), and the most appropriate concentration was 0.25 mg/ml. AGEs stimulation significantly increased the protein expression levels of NF-κB p65, JNK, p38 (P < 0.05), decreased IκB (P < 0.05), but had no effect on the protein expression of Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the mRNA level, JNK and p38 inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of NF-κB p65, p38 and JNK, increased IκB (P > 0.05), but had no effect on Akt in BMSCs (P > 0.05). At the protein level, JNK and p38 inhibitors notably decreased the expression of NF-κB p65, p38, p-JNK, P-IκB and JNK (P < 0.001), and increased IκB (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Advanced glycosylation end products can inhibit the proliferation of bone-marrow stromal cells through activating MAPK pathway.","Li, Zheng; Wang, Xiao; Hong, Tian-Pei; Wang, Hao-Jie; Gao, Zhan-Yi; Wan, Meng",European journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-021-00559-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407888/,129

RECENT FINDINGS Overdose is a major contributor to mortality and disability among people who use drugs. The increasing number of opioid overdoses in North America especially is an indication of changing drug markets and failing regional systems of care. Globally, we see three clusters of overdose prevalence: (1) a group of countries led by the United States with historically high rates of opioid overdose, (2) a group of countries with increasing rates within a concerning range, (3) a group with very low rates. The contamination of street drugs, the quality and accessibility of treatment, and the overall system of care all contribute to the prevalence of overdose. SUMMARY Drug markets and pattern of consumption in parts of the world are shifting towards contamination and opioids like fentanyl as the drug of choice, which dismantles insufficient and largely ineffective systems of care. Furthermore, outside of North America, more countries like Estonia, Lithuania, Sweden, Finland, and Norway show very concerning numbers. Without a consistent system response, effects will be devastating.","Krausz, R Michael; Westenberg, Jean Nicolas; Ziafat, Kimia",Current opinion in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901060/,129

Objective To describe case characteristics, including viral dynamics and transmission of infection, for individuals who have clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but continued to have positive test results following discontinuation of isolation precautions. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study used data collected from June 11, 2020, to October 19, 2020, as part of the National Basketball Association (NBA) closed campus occupational health program in Orlando, Florida, which required daily RT-PCR testing and ad hoc serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Nearly 4000 NBA players, staff, and vendors participated in the NBA's regular and postseason occupational health program in Orlando. Persistent positive cases were those who recovered from a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, satisfied US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for discontinuation of isolation precautions, and had at least 1 postinfection positive RT-PCR test(s) result. Exposures Person-days of participation in indoor, unmasked activities that involved direct exposure between persistent positive cases and noninfected individuals. Main Outcomes and Measures Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following interaction with persistent positive individuals, as measured by the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Orlando campus program. Results Among 3648 individuals who participated, 36 (1%) were persistent positive cases, most of whom were younger than 30 years (24 [67%]) and male (34 [94%]). Antibodies were detected in 33 individuals (91.7%); all remained asymptomatic following the index persistent positive RT-PCR result. Cycle threshold values for persistent positive RT-PCR test results were typically above the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection. Cases were monitored for up to 100 days (mean [SD], 51 [23.9] days), during which there were at least 1480 person-days of direct exposure activities, with no transmission events or secondary infections of SARS-CoV-2 detected (0 new cases). Conclusions and Relevance In this retrospective cohort study of the 2020 NBA closed campus occupational health program, recovered individuals who continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 following discontinuation of isolation were not infectious to others. These findings support time-based US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for ending isolation.","Mack, Christina D; DiFiori, John; Tai, Caroline G; Shiue, Kristin Y; Grad, Yonatan H; Anderson, Deverick J; Ho, David D; Sims, Leroy; LeMay, Christopher; Mancell, Jimmie; Maragakis, Lisa L",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885715/,129
73487,Predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in primary breast cancer using volumetric helical perfusion computed tomography: a preliminary study.,2012,"BACKGROUND Although a single incision laparoscopic (SIL) technique has been used increasingly in colorectal surgery, there are only a few reports on the clinical availability of this approach coupled with low anterior resection (SIL-LAR) for colorectal cancers. We report here 96 consecutive cases of SIL-LAR and reduced port LAR cases, of which the initial approach was SIL. METHODS This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of SIL-LAR cases performed by a single surgeon in Samsung Medical Center between June 2011 and June 2012. RESULTS Out of 96 cases, 28 were finished as 'pure' SIL-LAR. Sixty-four cases were performed with one additional port, and four needed two more ports. There was no open conversion. The median duration of operation was 165 min. Proximal and distal resection margins were negative in all cases. Circumferential resection margins were positive in four cases. The median duration of postoperative stay was 7 days and the complication rate was 20%. There were six cases of anastomosis leakage (6%). CONCLUSION The SIL-LAR technique can be applied safely with the optional use of an additional port. One additional port in the right suprapubic area is useful for obtaining a secure distal division and a safe total mesorectal excision, especially in patients with lower lesions or history of neoadjuvant chemoradiation.","Jung, Kyung Uk; Yun, Seong Hyeon; Cho, Yong Beom; Kim, Hee Cheol; Lee, Woo Yong; Chun, Ho-Kyung",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.12775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041064/,129

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of 87 patients from a prospective thrombectomy registry. Collateral status on CTA source images was categorized into good, moderate, and poor with the Tan and Miteff scores by two-blinded readers. Association between CTA collateral status and successful recanalization was investigated with univariate regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse the association between collateral score and favourable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) and death at follow-up. RESULTS Mean age was 72.5 years and baseline median NIHSS score was 15. Patients with poor collaterals on Tan score had a significant higher mortality compared with moderate or good collaterals during a mean follow-up period of 5.2 months (85.7% vs. 30.6% vs. 25.7%, P<0.001). Univariate logistic regression analysis did not show a significant association between Tan score (OR 1.681, 95% CI 0.683-4.140) and successful recanalization. Higher age (OR 1.067, 95% CI 1.013-1.124; P=0.015) and lower Tan score (OR 0.421, 95% CI 0.192-0.922; P=0.031) were independent predictors of death at follow-up on multivariate analysis. The Miteff collateral score could be assessed only in 65 of the 87 patients and the Tan collateral score had a higher interrater reliability. CONCLUSIONS Poor collaterals on CTA were associated with a very high rate of fatal outcome in anterior circulation stroke patients despite a high rate of successful recanalization with stent retrievers.","Nordmeyer, Hannes; Webering, Nadine; Chapot, Rene; Hadisurya, Jeffrie; Heddier, Markus; Stracke, Paul; Berger, Klaus; Isenmann, Stefan; Weber, Ralph",Journal of neuroradiology.

METHODS Retrospective cohort study including 400 women who underwent LH or LM for the management of uterine fibroids. RESULTS LH patients were older, with higher BMI and larger uterine size but LH was associated with shorter operative duration (80.2 vs. 115.7 min, p < 0.0001), lower blood loss (215 vs. 316 ml, p < 0.0001), and shorter hospital stay (1.81 vs. 2.12 days, p = 0.0003). Seven LM patients (3.2%) had blood loss >1000 ml compared with no LH patients and five LM patients (2.3%) required blood transfusion compared to 1 (0.5%) LH patient. Three LM patients (1.9%) and no LH patients required conversion to laparotomy. Bladder injury occurred in three LH cases (1.6%) and no LM cases. When the data was restricted only to women aged 44 years or over, LH was again associated with significantly lower operative duration and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS Particularly in perimenopausal women, the decision to perform myomectomy can be controversial. These data suggest that there are potential advantages to LH over LM, including reduced operation length, blood loss and hospital stay but increased risk of urinary tract injury.","Odejinmi, F; Maclaran, Kate; Agarwal, Nilesh",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-014-3434-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25216960/,129

74043,Highlights of the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 2020: part 2.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy has resulted in a sudden and massive flow of patients into emergency rooms, and a high number of hospitalizations with the need for respiratory isolation. Massive admission of patients to the Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"" Foundation of Rome, Italy, determined the need for reengineering the entire hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this article, we consider some of the structural and organizational changes that have been necessary to deal with the emergency, with particular reference to non-intensive medicine wards, and the preventive measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital staff and patients themselves. RESULTS 577 staff members were subjected to molecular tests in 1-month period and 3.8% of the total were positive. 636 patients admitted to the COVID-19 pathway were included and analyzed: 45.4% were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive. More SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were discharged in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (59% vs. 41%, respectively). On the other hand, more SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were transferred to ICUs in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (16% vs. 1%, respectively). Occurrence of death was similar between the two groups, 11% vs. 7%, for SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients, respectively. 25% of ≥80 years old SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died during the hospitalization, while death rate was lower in other age groups (5% in 70-79 years old patients and 0% in remaining age groups).

74474,Virtual wins.,2020-12-24,"Neuroinflammation is the inflammatory responses that are involved in the pathogenesis of most CNS disorders. Glutaminase (GLS) is the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine to produce glutamate. Besides its well-known role in cellular metabolism and excitatory neurotransmission, GLS has recently been increasingly noticed to be up-regulated in activated microglia under pathological conditions. Furthermore, GLS overexpression induces microglial activation, extracellular vesicle secretion, and neuroinflammatory microenvironment formation, which, are compromised by GLS inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that GLS has more complicated implications in brain disease etiology than what are previously known. In this review, we introduce GLS isoforms, expression patterns in the body and the brain, and expression/activities regulation. Next, we discuss the metabolic and neurotransmission functions of GLS. Afterwards, we summarize recent findings of GLS-mediated microglial activation and pro-inflammatory extracellular vesicle secretion, which, in turns, induces neuroinflammation. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive discussion for the involvement of microglial GLS in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders, indicating microglial GLS as a promising target to treat these diseases.","Ding, Lu; Xu, Xiaonan; Li, Congcong; Wang, Yi; Xia, Xiaohuan; Zheng, Jialin C","Brain, behavior, and immunity",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.11.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278560/,129
74745,Evolution of Patiromer Use: a Review.,2020-07-09,"INTRODUCTION During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 global pandemic, maternal and newborn wellbeing has received much attention. Detailed reports of infected women breastfeeding their infants are uncommon. Due to incomplete information available, full data about those infants' outcomes are lacking, and evidence of infectivity through breastfeeding has not been documented. MAIN ISSUE Here, we report about a mother who breastfed her infant until she was confirmed with the SARS-Cov-2 infection. After follow-up, we have confirmed that the infant, who was breastfed by the infected mother, was not infected. METHODS A 33-year-old woman gave birth to a full-term male infant on November 8, 2019. Since birth, she had been exclusively breastfeeding the baby until she was confirmed with the SARS-Cov-2 infection on February 8, 2020. She was hospitalized, isolated from her baby, and stopped breastfeeding. Even though she remained asymptomatic, her milk was expressed using a breast pump and discarded. The mother's milk sample was collected on February 9, 2020, and the result of the nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative. Her infant was asymptomatic and remained virus negative. Her laboratory findings and chest Computed Tomography imaging was normal. She was treated according to the national protocol with aerosolized interferon α2β, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin. Her serum SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies(IgG and IgM) tested positive when discharged. She returned to breastfeeding after discharge. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that breastfeeding may be less of a risk than anticipated. Additional research is needed to explore this possibility.","Liu, Wei; Liu, Yujie; Liu, Zhenjun; Hong, Changxin; Liu, Jian; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/0890334421991072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586488/,129

76053,Is there a light at the end of the gender inequality tunnel?,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Identification of novel biomarkers could provide prognostic information and improve risk stratification in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). YKL-40 (chitinase-3-like protein 1), a protein involved in atherogenesis, is upregulated in human calcific aortic valves. We hypothesized that circulating YKL-40 would be elevated and associated with the degree of AS severity and outcome in patients with symptomatic AS. METHODS Plasma YKL-40 was analyzed in 2 AS populations, one severe AS (n=572) with outcome measures and one with mixed severity (n=67). YKL-40 expression in calcified valves and in an experimental pressure overload model was assessed. RESULTS We found (1) patients with AS had upregulated circulating YKL-40 compared with healthy controls (median 109 versus 34 ng/mL, P<0.001), but levels were not related to the degree of AS severity. (2) High YKL-40 levels (quartile 4) were associated with long-term (median follow-up 4.7 years) all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.37-2.73], P<0.001). (3) YKL-40 protein expression in human calcific valves co-localized with its putative receptor IL-13rα2 in close proximity to valve interstitial cells. (4) Myocardial YKL-40 increased in experimental pressure overload (6-fold in decompensated versus sham mice). CONCLUSIONS YKL-40 levels were elevated in AS and associated with mortality but not with other metrics of disease severity including the degree of AS severity. Despite scientific rationale for its role in AS, the clinical utility of circulating YKL-40 as a biomarker is limited.

Bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections. METHODOLOGY Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. RESULTS A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), Escherichia coli (27.14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), Bacillus spp. (25.72%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%), Corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), Pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. CONCLUSIONS A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. Thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. If adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.","Wareth, Gamal; Murugaiyan, Jayaseelan; Khater, Dalia F; Moustafa, Shawky A",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.4810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022303/,129

77011,"""There Is No Before Cancer… There Is Only Cancer."" Perceived Late Effects of Pediatric Cancer on Survivors.",2020,"INTRODUCTION Diabetes has emerged as an important risk factor for severe illness and death from COVID-19. There is a paucity of information on glycemic control among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes and acute hyperglycemia. METHODS This retrospective observational study of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adults evaluated glycemic and clinical outcomes in patients with and without diabetes and/or acutely uncontrolled hyperglycemia hospitalized March 1 to April 6, 2020. Diabetes was defined as A1C ≥6.5%. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia was defined as ≥2 blood glucoses (BGs) > 180 mg/dL within any 24-hour period. Data were abstracted from Glytec's data warehouse. RESULTS Among 1122 patients in 88 U.S. hospitals, 451 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia spent 37.8% of patient days having a mean BG > 180 mg/dL. Among 570 patients who died or were discharged, the mortality rate was 28.8% in 184 diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients, compared with 6.2% of 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (P < .001). Among the 184 patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia who died or were discharged, 40 of 96 uncontrolled hyperglycemia patients (41.7%) died compared with 13 of 88 patients with diabetes (14.8%, P < .001). Among 493 discharged survivors, median length of stay (LOS) was longer in 184 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia compared with 386 patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (5.7 vs 4.3 days, P < .001). CONCLUSION Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia occurred frequently. These COVID-19 patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a longer LOS and markedly higher mortality than patients without diabetes or uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate. We recommend health systems which ensure that inpatient hyperglycemia is safely and effectively treated.","Bode, Bruce; Garrett, Valerie; Messler, Jordan; McFarland, Raymie; Crowe, Jennifer; Booth, Robby; Klonoff, David C",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1932296820924469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389027/,129

There are still not enough individuals being analyzed with MRI for age estimation. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of T1-weighted turbo spin echo (T1-TSE) MRI sequences in determining the degree of ossification of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses in a Turkish population. In this study, images from 649 patients (335 males and 314 females) aged 10-30 years were retrospectively evaluated with sagittal T1-weighted turbo spin echo (T1-TSE) MRI sequences of the knee. Proximal tibial and distal femoral epiphysis were scored by two different observers twice using the combined staging system described by Schmeling and Kellinghaus. Spearman's rank correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between age and ossification stages of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses (p < 0.001). The intra- and inter-observer reliabilities in evaluating the femur and tibia were separately determined and gave promising results and Cohen's kappa statistics ranged from κ = 0.886 and κ = 0.961. The minimal ages of patients with stage 4 ossification were 15.1 years for females and 15.8 years for males for the distal tibial epiphysis and 15.4 years for females and 17 years for males for the distal femoral epiphysis. This study show that (T1-TSE) MRI and the applicability and Schmeling and Kellinghaus staging method of the knee can be performed for living 14- to 17-year-old individuals in need of a supportive noninvasive method for estimating forensic age.","Ekizoglu, Oguzhan; Er, Ali; Bozdag, Mustafa; Basa, Can Doruk; Kacmaz, Ismail Eralp; Moghaddam, Negahnaz; Grabherr, Silke",International journal of legal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-020-02402-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839871/,129

While strong data regarding the transmissibility of the infection are not yet widely available, preliminary information suggests risk of transmission among asymptomatic individuals, including those within health care facilities. We believe that the presence of a tracheostomy or laryngectomy stoma poses a unique risk of droplet and aerosol spread particularly among patients with unsuspected infection.

This likely depends on the fact that tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells may play substantially different effector or regulatory functions, and correlation with patient's prognosis relies on distinct γδ T cell subsets in the context of the tumor. There is interest to exploit γδ T cells in tumor immunotherapy, but to make this approach successful there is urgent need to fully understand the biological functions of γδ T cells and of how they can be manipulated in vivo and ex vivo to safely provide benefit to the host. This review focuses on our previous and ongoing studies of tumor-infiltrating γδ T lymphocytes in different types of human cancer.

One such strategy is the expansion of routine data collection on patient Race, Ethnicity, and Language (REAL) within electronic health records (EHRs). Although previous research has examined the general views of providers and patients on REAL data, few studies consider health care workers' perceptions of this data collection directly at the point of care, including how workers understand REAL data in relation to health equity. OBJECTIVE This qualitative study examines a large integrated delivery system's implementation of REAL data collection, focusing on health care workers' understanding of REAL and its impact on data's integration within EHRs. RESULTS Providers, staff, and administrators expressed apprehension over REAL data collection due to the following: (1) disagreement over data's significance, including the expected purpose of collecting REAL items; (2) perceived barriers to data retrieval, such as the lack of standardization across providers and national tensions over race and immigration; and (3) uncertainty regarding data's use (clinical decision making vs. system research) and dissemination (with whom the data may be shared; eg, public agencies, other providers, and insurers). CONCLUSION Emerging racial disparities associated with COVID-19 highlight the high stakes of REAL data collection. However, numerous barriers to health equity remain. Health care workers need greater institutional support for REAL data and related EHR initiatives. Despite data collection's central importance to policy objectives of disparity reduction, data mandates alone may be insufficient for achieving health equity.","Cruz, Taylor M; Smith, Sheridan A",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528233/,129

79214,Historical review: a history of the British Journal of Haematology.,2020-11-01,"PURPOSE Increasing attention has been paid to low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) for its potential therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While preclinical studies have shown promising therapeutic effects of low-intensity tFUS in AD models, its efficacy and safety remain unclear in humans. In this pilot study, we investigated the effects of low-intensity tFUS on blood-brain barrier opening, the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu), and cognition in patients with AD. METHODS After receiving institutional review board approval, four patients with AD received tFUS to the hippocampus immediately after an intravenous injection of a microbubble ultrasound contrast agent. Sonication was delivered at low-intensity, at a pressure level below the threshold for blood-brain barrier opening. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and neuropsychological assessments before and after the tFUS procedure. A whole-brain voxel-wise paired t test was conducted to compare rCMRglu before and after tFUS. RESULTS The sonication, as anticipated, did not show evidence of active blood-brain barrier opening on T1 dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. rCMRglu in the superior frontal gyrus (P<0.001), middle cingulate gyrus (P<0.001), and fusiform gyrus increased after tFUS (P=0.001). Patients demonstrated mild improvement in measures of memory, executive, and global cognitive function following tFUS. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION These results suggest that hippocampal sonication with low-intensity tFUS may have beneficial effects on cerebral glucose metabolism and cognitive function in patients with AD. Further larger studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of tFUS in AD.","Jeong, Hyeonseok; Im, Jooyeon Jamie; Park, Jong-Sik; Na, Seung-Hee; Lee, Wonhye; Yoo, Seung-Schik; Song, In-Uk; Chung, Yong-An",Ultrasonography,https://doi.org/10.14366/usg.20138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730775/,129

A rapid quantitative analytical method for BCKAs using pillar array columns was developed. α-Keto acids were labeled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), followed by their separation on octadecylsilane-treated pillar array columns with MeOH/H2O as the mobile phase. Five DMB-labelled α-keto acids including the internal standard were separated in 160 s. The lower limits of quantification for DMB-α-keto acids were 2-5 μM. The intra- and interday precisions were 2.9-6.6 % and 5.2-10.7 %, respectively. The developed method was applied to BCKA quantification in human plasma samples; KIV, KIC, and KMV concentrations were determined to be 13.8, 24.2, and 15.2 μM, respectively.

Methods PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, AgeLine, and Web of Science were searched from database inception to November 22, 2017; gray literature and references were also searched. Studies including adults ≥65 years of age undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty and measuring preoperative frailty and postoperative adverse events or clinical outcomes within 90 days of surgery were included. Two investigators independently screened all abstracts and extracted data; disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials. Study quality was assessed using a 5-point scale modified from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine tool. Results Of 1913 abstracts identified, 82 full texts were reviewed, and 13 met inclusion criteria: 5 prospective cohort studies, 6 retrospective cohort studies, and 2 randomized controlled trials covering 382 763 total patients. These studies used 13 frailty instruments and assessed 32 distinct outcomes. Substantial heterogeneity precluded valid meta-analysis; results were qualitatively summarized by study design, frailty instrument, and outcome type. Of the 11 cohort studies, 10 found significant associations between frailty and poor postoperative outcomes. Trials of preoperative frailty-modifying interventions found no association between interventions and improved outcomes. Discussion Standardizing frailty measurement would improve generalizability, permitting the assessment of associations with patient-reported and functional outcome measures, as well as the efficacy of interventions to improve outcomes, in frail patients undergoing arthroplasty. Conclusions Frailty is associated with higher rates of short-term adverse events and worse clinical outcomes after elective hip and knee arthroplasty.","Schmucker, Abigail M; Hupert, Nathaniel; Mandl, Lisa A",Geriatric orthopaedic surgery & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/2151459319835109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31105984/,129

We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. The effect of fluid rheology on the shear stress distribution is also discussed. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","Patel, Maneesh; Harish Kruthiventi, S S; Kaushik, P","Colloids and surfaces.

79766,Clinical and Dynamic Computed Tomography Features of 24 Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019.,2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND Pneumonia is the leading reason for hospitalization in children. The heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in Taiwan in October 2005. There has been no comprehensive study of the etiology of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), either in the pre- or postpneumococcal conjugate vaccine era, in Taiwan. METHODS From August 2001 to July 2002, consecutive children admitted to a teaching hospital with radiologically confirmed CAP were prospectively enrolled. The following were considered indicative of infection when positive: blood or pleural effusion bacterial culture or urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test (Binax NOW), direct immunofluorescent antigen test for Chlamydia species and viruses, virus isolation and identification and viral, mycoplasmal or chlamydial serologic tests. RESULTS A total of 209 children were included, and 102 children (48.8%) were male. Patients' ages ranged from 7 months to 16 years with a median of 4 years and 3 months. The combined tests identified at least 1 etiologic agent in 85.6% of all cases, including typical bacterial pathogens in 88 cases (42.1%; 86 S. pneumoniae, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 77 cases (36.8%), Chlamydia species in 24 cases (11.5%), viral etiology in 86 cases (41.1%) and mixed viral-bacterial infections in 69 cases (33%). Children with S. pneumoniae infection were significantly younger than those with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection (P = 0.0055) or unknown etiology (P = 0.0140). CONCLUSION S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and viruses were equally common etiologic agents of childhood CAP in Taiwan. Frequent coinfection increased the difficulty of both predicting the responsible organisms and choosing empiric antibiotics for the management of pediatric CAP.","Chen, Chih-Jung; Lin, Pen-Yi; Tsai, Ming-Han; Huang, Chung-Guei; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Wong, Kin-Sun; Chang, Luan-Yin; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Huang, Yhu-Chering",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31826eb5a7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22935863/,129
79944,The century of mRNA vaccines: COVID-19 vaccines and allergy.,2021-01-04,"BACKGROUND Primary hypoadrenocorticism (or Addison's disease, AD) is an autoimmune disease that results in destruction of the adrenal cortex and consequent adrenal insufficiency. The disease has been described in purebred and mixed breed dogs, although some breeds, including the Bearded Collie, are at increased risk for AD. Candidate gene approaches have yielded few associations that appear to be breed-specific. A single other genome-wide association study reported no significant regions of association for AD in Standard Poodles. The present study aimed to identify genomic regions of association for canine AD in Bearded Collies. RESULTS Our study consists of the first genome-wide association analysis to identify a genome-wide significant region of association with canine AD (CFA18). Peaks of suggestive association were also noted on chromosomes 11, 16 and 29. Logistic regression analysis supported an additive effect of risk genotypes at these smaller effect loci on the probability of disease associated with carrying a risk genotype on CFA18. Potential candidate genes involved in adrenal steroidogenesis, regulation of immune responses and/or inflammation were identified within the associated regions of chromosomes 11 and 16. The gene-poor regions of chromosomes 18 and 29 may, however, harbor regulatory sequences that can modulate gene expression and contribute to disease susceptibility. CONCLUSION Our findings support the polygenic and complex nature of canine AD and identified a strongly associated locus on CFA18 that, when combined with three other smaller effect loci, was predictive of disease. The results offer progress in the identification of susceptibility loci for canine AD in the Bearded Collie. Further studies are needed to confirm association with the suggested candidate genes and identify actual causative mutations involved with AD susceptibility in this breed.","Gershony, Liza C; Belanger, Janelle M; Hytönen, Marjo K; Lohi, Hannes; Famula, Thomas R; Oberbauer, Anita M",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-07243-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243158/,129

Evidence on cost-effectiveness, which can help inform use of limited resources, is scarce in this area and therefore the purpose of this systematic review is to critically appraise and consolidate the current evidence on economic evaluations of ABI rehabilitation interventions. Methods: Systematic review methodology will be applied to identify, select and extract data from published economic evaluation studies (trial-based, non-trial based, simulation-based, decision model and trial-based model economic evaluations) of ABI treatment interventions in adults. A systematic literature search will be conducted on the following electronic databases: EMBASE, Econlit, CINAHL, Medline, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database and PsyclNFO. This review will only include cost-effectiveness analysis studies (e.g., cost per life year gained), cost-benefit and cost minimisation analyses in which the designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCT studies, cost-utility analyses (e.g., cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained or cost per disability-adjusted life year averted), cohort studies, and modelling studies. Only studies that were published in the english language, associated with adults who have an ABI will be included. There will be no restrictions on perspective, sample size, country, follow-up duration or setting. The search strategy terms will include the following: acquired brain injury, brain*; cost*; or cost-benefit analysis*. Following data extraction, a narrative summary and tables will be used to summarize the characteristics and results of included studies. Discussion: The findings from this review will be beneficial to health policy decision makers when examining the evidence of economic evaluations in this field. In addition, it is anticipated that this review will identify gaps in the current economic literature to inform future-related research.

In Ifanadiana District, Madagascar, a collaboration between the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and PIVOT, a non-governmental organization (NGO), fosters Networks of Care (NOC) to support high-quality, patient-centered care. The district's health system has three levels of care: community, health center, district hospital; a regional hospital is available for tertiary care services. We explore the MoPH/PIVOT collaboration through a case study which focuses on noteworthy elements of the collaboration across the four NOC domains: (I) agreement and enabling environment, (II) operational standards, (III) quality, efficiency, and responsibility, (IV) learning and adaptation. Under Domain I, we describe formal agreements between the MoPH and PIVOT and the process for engaging communities in creating effective NOC. Domain II discusses patient referral across levels of the health system and improvements to facility readiness and service availability. Under Domain III the collaboration prioritizes communication and supervision to support clinical quality, and social support for patients. Domain IV focuses on evaluation, research, and the use of data to modify programs to better meet community needs. The case study, organized by the domains of the NOC framework, demonstrates that a collaboration between the MoPH and an NGO can create effective NOC in a remote district with limited accessibility and advance the country's agenda to achieve universal health coverage.","Cordier, Laura F; Kalaris, Katherine; Rakotonanahary, Rado J L; Rakotonirina, Luc; Haruna, Justin; Mayfield, Alishya; Marovavy, Lanto; McCarty, Meg G; Tsirinomen'ny Aina, Andritiana; Ratsimbazafy, Baolova; Razafinjato, Benedicte; Loyd, Tara; Ihantamalala, Felana; Garchitorena, Andres; Bonds, Matthew H; Finnegan, Karen E",Health systems and reform,https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2020.1841437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314984/,129
80856,"Recommendations for the emergency management of complications associated with the new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.",2013,"BACKGROUND Early reports indicate that AKI is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated with worse outcomes. However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States is not well described. METHODS This retrospective, observational study involved a review of data from electronic health records of patients aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System from February 27 to May 30, 2020. We describe the frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with mortality. RESULTS Of 3993 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in 1835 (46%) patients; 347 (19%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. The proportions with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI were 39%, 19%, and 42%, respectively. A total of 976 (24%) patients were admitted to intensive care, and 745 (76%) experienced AKI. Of the 435 patients with AKI and urine studies, 84% had proteinuria, 81% had hematuria, and 60% had leukocyturia. Independent predictors of severe AKI were CKD, men, and higher serum potassium at admission. In-hospital mortality was 50% among patients with AKI versus 8% among those without AKI (aOR, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 11.3). Of survivors with AKI who were discharged, 35% had not recovered to baseline kidney function by the time of discharge. An additional 28 of 77 (36%) patients who had not recovered kidney function at discharge did so on posthospital follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AKI is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with high mortality. Of all patients with AKI, only 30% survived with recovery of kidney function by the time of discharge.","Chan, Lili; Chaudhary, Kumardeep; Saha, Aparna; Chauhan, Kinsuk; Vaid, Akhil; Zhao, Shan; Paranjpe, Ishan; Somani, Sulaiman; Richter, Felix; Miotto, Riccardo; Lala, Anuradha; Kia, Arash; Timsina, Prem; Li, Li; Freeman, Robert; Chen, Rong; Narula, Jagat; Just, Allan C; Horowitz, Carol; Fayad, Zahi; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Schadt, Eric; Levin, Matthew A; Reich, David L; Fuster, Valentin; Murphy, Barbara; He, John C; Charney, Alexander W; Böttinger, Erwin P; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Coca, Steven G; Nadkarni, Girish N; Li, Li",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2020050615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883700/,129
81032,Ethnic disparities in the e-cigarette use epidemic and childhood asthma in the US.,2020-07-27,"Background Currently there are several techniques for endoscopic diagnosis of parenchymal lung abnormalities. Electromagnetic navigation with or without endobronchial ultrasound for diagnosis of the above has been well described. Bronchoscopic Trans Bronchial Access Tool is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountryTM Transbronchial Access Tool (CovidienTM, Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved off airway device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a trans-parenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality used in the bronchoscopy suite that allows for an open working channel. All three of the above modalities can have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools we frequently found ourselves in situations where one technique was not enough, prompting the use of a combination of modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. We are reporting the feasibility and safety of utilizing these three modalities in conjunction with one another. Methods Patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography underwent a navigation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. CBCT and radial ultrasound was used in every case to confirm navigation to the target lesion. Lesions without definitive airways leading to them were accessed with the transbronchial access tool (TBAT). Results Electromagnetic bronchoscopy using CBCT and radial US was performed on 22 patients from April 2016 to September 2016. The TBAT tool was used in 7 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 77.2% (17 of 22). Diagnostic yield of with use TBAT was 100% (7 of 7). There were no complications. Average case length was 79.95 (range, 50-124) minutes and average fluoroscopy time was 10.39 (1-21.7) minutes. Conclusions TBAT is a useful and safe tool when accessing peripheral pulmonary nodules and is used in conjunctions with electromagnetic navigation and CBCT.","Sobieszczyk, Michal Jan; Yuan, Zhuhui; Li, Wei; Krimsky, William",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2018.09.16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30505506/,129
81043,"A Practical, Clinical User-Friendly Format for Breast Ultrasound Report.",2021-04-01,"Dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban have been approved for primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, questions have arisen about how to manage emergency situations, such as when thrombolysis would be required for acute ischemic stroke or for the managing intracranial or gastrointestinal bleedings. We summarize the current literature and provide recommendations for the management of these situations. Peak plasma levels of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban are observed about 2-4 h after intake. Elimination of dabigatran is mainly dependent on renal function. Consequently, if renal function is impaired, there is a risk of drug accumulation that is highest for dabigatran followed by rivaroxaban and then apixaban and thus dosing recommendations are different. To date, no bedside tests are available that reliably assess the anticoagulatory effect of DOACs, nor are specific antidotes available. We recommend performing the following tests if DOAC intake is unknown: dabigatran-associated bleeding risk is minimized or can be neglected if thrombin time, Hemoclot test, or Ecarin clotting time is normal. Apixaban and rivaroxaban effects can be ruled out if findings from the anti-factor Xa activity test are normal. High plasma levels of DOAC are also mostly excluded if PTT and PTZ are normal four or more hours after DOAC intake. However, normal values of global coagulation tests are not sufficient if thrombolysis is indicated for treating acute stroke. The decision for or against thrombolysis is an individual decision; in these cases, thrombolysis use is off-label. In case of bleeding, prothrombin complex concentrates seems to be the most plausible treatment. For severe gastrointestinal bleeding with life-threatening blood loss, the bleeding source needs to be identified and treated by invasive measures. Use of procoagulant drugs (antifibrinolytics) might also be considered. However, there is very limited clinical experience with these products in conjunction with DOAC.","Steiner, T; Böhm, M; Dichgans, M; Diener, H-C; Ell, C; Endres, M; Epple, C; Grond, M; Laufs, U; Nickenig, G; Riess, H; Röther, J; Schellinger, P D; Spannagl, M; Veltkamp, R",Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00392-013-0560-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23669868/,129
81195,Review of splanchnic oximetry in clinical medicine.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus technology (DMT) is increasingly used for routine management in developed countries, yet its uptake in developing countries is not as consistent. Multiple factors may influence this, including country specific patient perception regarding DMT. We conducted a pilot study in Pakistan to understand this important question which has not been studied yet. METHODS A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted in Pakistan. An anonymous survey exploring perceptions of diabetes technology was circulated on social media platforms, collecting responses over 2 weeks. Target population included adults (≥18 years) living in Pakistan, with DM1 or 2. RESULTS A total of 40 responses were received. The majority (36/40) reported using conventional glucometers. Nine used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Thirty-two of 40 patients believed DMT improved diabetes care, 22 felt it helped decreased risk of Diabetes-related complications. 15/40 stated that DMT results in increased cost of care. Sixteen reported their diabetes care teams had never discussed wearable DMT options whereas 11 disliked them because they did not want a device on their self. CONCLUSION In our pilot study we have identified broad themes of opportunity and challenges to DMT use in Pakistan. Patients' perceptions regarding DMT were generally positive but significant barriers to its acceptance included high cost, lack of discussion between doctor and patient about available technology and personal hesitation. Limitations of our study include sampling bias (online survey) and small sample size, but this data can help inform larger studies, to look at this important topic in greater detail.","Nadeem, Sarah; Siddiqi, Uswah; Martins, Russell Seth; Badini, Kaleemullah",Journal of diabetes science and technology,https://doi.org/10.1177/19322968211011199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33957791/,129

81925,Medical industry at tumor board: Three-years analysis of the open payments database and comparison of oncologic specialties.,2018,"BACKGROUND Most natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures to date rely on the hybrid technique with simultaneous laparoscopic access to protect against access-related complications and to achieve adequate triangulation for dissection. This is done at the cost of the potential benefits of this new minimally invasive technique. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of a transgastric (TG) pure-NOTES procedure in a diagnostic setting. METHODS A TG pure-NOTES procedure with endoscopic ultrasonograpy (EUS)-guided access and over-the-scope-clip (OTSC) closure was performed for 10 pigs in a survival and feasibility study. A full macroscopic necropsy with subsequent histologic evaluation was performed on postoperative day (POD) 14. The outcome parameters were uncomplicated follow-up assessment, survival, intraoperative complications, intraabdominal pathology, macroscopic full-thickness closure, and histology-proven full-thickness healing of the gastrotomy. RESULTS An uncomplicated postoperative course was reported for 9 of the 10 pigs, and survival was reported for all 10 pigs. For all the pigs, EUS-guided access was performed successfully with a median duration of 25 min (range, 12-62 min) and without intraoperative complications or access-related lesions at necropsy. An OTSC closure was achieved with a median duration of 11 min (range, 3-28 min). The OTSC provided immediate closure, but according to the authors' definition of a full-thickness healing evaluated by histologic examination, this was not achieved in any of the cases. Although all the animals survived until POD 14, intraabdominal chronic abscesses were present in 3 of the 10 pigs at necropsy. CONCLUSIONS The EUS-guided TG access proved to be feasible without access-related complications. Although OTSC provided an immediate closure, the histopathology raised concerns regarding the risk of perforation. Together with the high risk of intraabdominal infection, TG pure-NOTES is not yet ready for routine clinical practice.","Donatsky, Anders Meller; Andersen, Luise; Nielsen, Ole Lerberg; Holzknecht, Barbara Juliane; Vilmann, Peter; Meisner, Søren; Jørgensen, Lars Nannestad; Rosenberg, Jacob",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2135-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22237757/,129

The aim of this study was to assess the long-term outcome and toxicity of treatment with 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) of (131)I-MIBG per cycle. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 31 patients with advanced metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (20 with carcinoid tumors and 11 with other tumors) treated with (131)I-MIBG. Treatment outcome was analyzed for patients with carcinoid tumors (the most common tumors in this study), and toxicity was analyzed for the entire patient cohort (n = 31). Treatment comprised 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per course and minimum intervals of 3 mo. The radiographic response was classified according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Toxicity was determined according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) for all laboratory data at regular follow-up visits and during outpatient care, including complete blood counts and hepatic and renal function tests. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log rank test; P < 0.05). RESULTS The radiographic responses in patients with carcinoid tumors comprised a minor response in 2 patients (10%), stable disease in 16 patients (80%; median time to progression, 34 mo), and progressive disease in 2 patients (10%). The symptomatic responses in patients with functioning carcinoid tumors comprised complete resolution in 3 of the 11 evaluable symptomatic patients (27%), partial resolution in 6 patients (55%), and no significant change in 11 patients. The median overall survival in patients with carcinoid tumors was 47 mo (95% confidence interval, 32-62), and the median progression-free survival was 34 mo (95% confidence interval, 13-55). Relevant treatment toxicities were confined to transient myelosuppression of grade 3 or 4 in 15.3% (leukopenia) and 7.6% (thrombocytopenia) of applied cycles and a suspected late adverse event (3% of patients), myelodysplastic syndrome, after a cumulative administered activity of 66.6 GBq. The most frequent nonhematologic side effect was mild nausea (grade 1 or 2), which was observed in 28% of administered cycles. No hepatic or renal toxicities were noted. CONCLUSION Dose-intensified treatment with (131)I-MIBG at a fixed dose of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per cycle is safe and offers effective palliation of symptoms and disease stabilization in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. The favorable survival and limited toxicity suggest that high cycle activities are suitable and that this modality may be used for targeted carcinoid treatment--either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other existing therapeutic options.","Ezziddin, Samer; Sabet, Amir; Logvinski, Timur; Alkawaldeh, Khaled; Yong-Hing, Charlotte J; Ahmadzadehfar, Hojjat; Grünwald, Frank; Biersack, Hans-Jürgen","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.112.119313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24101685/,129

Although several studies showed that subcuticular sutures reduced incisional surgical site infection in other fields of surgery, their impact on hepatopancreatobiliary surgery remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether subcuticular sutures could reduce incisional surgical site infection in patients undergoing hepatopancreatobiliary surgery. METHODS A total of 436 consecutive patients underwent laparotomy and surgical resection for hepatopancreatobiliary tumors in our department from May 2013 to December 2015. We excluded among them, 8 patients with a follow-up period <30 days and 1 patient with unclear operative information. The incidence of incisional surgical site infection was compared between use of subcuticular sutures and of stapling, using propensity score analyses. RESULTS In the baseline cohort (n = 427), abdominal skin closure was performed by subcuticular sutures in 245 patients (57.4%) and by stapling in 182 patients (42.6%). The incidence of incisional surgical site infection was 5/245 (2.0%) in the subcuticular suture group and 21/182 (11.5%) in the stapling group (P <. 01). In the propensity score-matched cohort (n = 318), patient demographics were well balanced between the two groups, and the incidence of incisional surgical site infection was 3/159 (1.8%) in the subcuticular suture group and 16/159 (10.0%) in the stapling group (P < .01). Propensity score analyses, as well as simple regression analyses, showed subcuticular sutures could consistently reduce incisional surgical site infection (with odd ratios of about 0.20). CONCLUSION Use of subcuticular sutures is preferred to stapling for the prevention of incisional surgical site infection in hepatopancreatobiliary surgery.","Okubo, Satoshi; Gotohda, Naoto; Sugimoto, Motokazu; Nomura, Shogo; Kobayashi, Shin; Takahashi, Shinichiro; Hayashi, Ryuichi; Konishi, Masaru",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2018.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29803560/,129

Pseudouridine (Ψ) is one of the most abundant post-transcriptional RNA base modifications and has been detected at individual positions in tRNAs, rRNAs, mRNAs and snRNAs, which are referred to as Ψ-sites. By allowing formation of additional bonds with neighboring atoms, Ψ strengthens RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. Although many aspects of the underlying modification reactions remain unclear, the advent of new transcriptome-wide methods to quantitatively detect Ψ-sites has recently changed our perception of the functional roles and importance of Ψ. For instance, it is now clear that the occurrence of Ψs appears to be directly linked to the lifetime and the translation efficiency of a given mRNA molecule. Furthermore, the administration of Ψ-containing RNAs reduces innate immune responses, which appears strikingly advantageous for the development of generations of mRNA-based vaccines. In this review, we aim to comprehensively summarize recent discoveries that highlight the impact of Ψ on various types of RNAs and outline possible novel biomedical applications of Ψ.","Lin, Ting-Yu; Mehta, Rahul; Glatt, Sebastian",FEBS letters,https://doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.14188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34468991/,129
82469,Extracellular gadolinium contrast agents: differences in stability.,2008,"INTRODUCTION Globally, people with the academic and personal attributes to successfully study medicine experience disadvantages associated with sociodemographic factors. Governments have attempted to address this issue via macro-level policies aimed at widening participation (WP) to medicine. These policies differ by country, suggesting much can be learned from examining and comparing international policy discourses of WP. Our question was: how are discourses of WP to higher and medical education positioned in the UK and Australia? METHODS A systematic search strategy was guided by five a priori themes inspired by United Nations Sustainability Goals (2015). Seventeen policy documents (UK n=9, Australia n=8) published between 2008 - 2018 were identified. Analysis involved two over-arching, iterative stages: a document analysis then a Foucauldian critical discourse analysis, the latter with the aim of unveiling the power dynamics at play within policy-related discourses. RESULTS Discourses of social mobility and individual responsibility within a meritocracy are still paramount in the UK. In contrast, the dominant discourse in Australia is social accountability in achieving equity and workforce diversity, prioritising affirmative action and community values. Similarities between the two countries in terms of WP policy and policy levers have changed over time, linked to the divergence of internal drivers for societal change. Both nations recognise tensions inherent in striving to achieve both local and global goals, but Australia appears to prioritise community values in working towards 'nation building' while in the UK the focus on individuality and meritocracy at times seem at odds with achieving parity for disadvantaged individuals. DISCUSSION WP policies and practices are situated and contextual so caution must be taken when extrapolating lessons from one context to another. The history of a country and the nature of marginalisation in that country must be scrutinised when trying to understand what drives WP policy.","Coyle, M; Sandover, S; Poobalan, A; Bullen, J; Cleland, J",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346380/,129
82478,"Invited Review: APOE at the interface of inflammation, neurodegeneration and pathological protein spread in Alzheimer's disease.",2019,"BACKGROUND it is important to investigate the relationship between disordered eating in male adolescents and smoking and alcohol consumption as they are risk factors to other diseases as well. For example, high levels of alcohol accompanied by the acidic damage and nutritional deficit exhibited in people with disordered eating habits - due to induced vomiting - has been shown to increase risk of esophageal cancer. Considering the very few studies done on disordered eating prevailing in males and the prevalence of smoking and drinking habits, our study aims to investigate the correlation between inappropriate eating habits and one's dependence on cigarettes, waterpipes, and alcohol all the while focusing on male adolescents. METHODS This was a cross-sectional observational study that enrolled 389 male students (13-17 years of age) drawn from five Lebanese schools between October and December 2019. RESULTS The MANCOVA analysis was performed taking the addiction scales as the dependent variables and the EAT-26 score as an independent variable, adjusting for the covariates (age, BMI and household crowding index). Higher EAT-26 scores (more inappropriate eating attitudes) were significantly associated with higher waterpipe dependence (B = 0.11; CI 0.06-0.17) and more problematic alcohol use (B = 0.08; CI 0.04-0.12), but not cigarette dependence. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed an association between inappropriate eating and increased drinking and smoking the waterpipe, but not cigarettes. The manifestation of inappropriate eating habits was found to be significant among male adolescents; in the literature, this is also true for female adolescents. In Lebanon, the engagement of adolescents in alcohol drinking and waterpipe smoking is frequent as they are accessible due to the lack of law enforcement and supervision in the country. In addition, while this study found an association between inappropriate eating habits and dependency on smoking and drinking, further investigation should be done on the role of one's psychology in their exhibition of disordered eating as means to prevent the manifestation of these habits.","Berro, Jana; Akel, Marwan; Hallit, Souheil; Obeid, Sahar",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10184-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446162/,129

Alterations to the regulation of autophagy contribute to the progression of various rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). Implicit in the progression of these diseases are cell-type-specific responses to surrounding factors that alter autophagy: chondrocytes within articular cartilage show decreased autophagy in OA, leading to rapid cell death and cartilage degeneration; fibroblasts from patients with SSc have restricted autophagy, similar to that seen in aged dermal fibroblasts; fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA joints show altered autophagy, which contributes to synovial hyperplasia; and dysregulation of autophagy in haematopoietic lineage cells alters their function and maturation in SLE. Various upstream mechanisms also contribute to these diseases by regulating autophagy as part of their signalling cascades. In this Review, we discuss the links between autophagy, immune responses, fibrosis and cellular fates as they relate to pathologies associated with rheumatic diseases. Therapies in clinical use, and in preclinical or clinical development, are also discussed in relation to their effects on autophagy in rheumatic diseases.","Rockel, Jason S; Kapoor, Mohit",Nature reviews.

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence of orthostatic intolerance symptoms in older adults with initial orthostatic hypotension. Methods MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Cochrane were searched to December 6th, 2019 using the terms ""initial orthostatic hypotension"", ""postural hypotension"" and ""older adults"". Study selection involved the following criteria: published in English; mean or median age ≥ 65 years and diagnosis of initial orthostatic hypotension encompassed a decrease in systolic blood pressure by ≥ 40 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure by ≥ 20 mmHg within a maximum of 1 min following a postural change. Results Of 8311 articles, 12 articles reporting initial orthostatic hypotension prevalence in 3446 participants with a mean age of 75 (6 SD) years (56.5% female) were included. Five initial orthostatic hypotension definition variations were utilised and symptoms were reported in six articles (968 participants, mean age 73.4 (6.1 SD) years, 56% female). The prevalence of symptoms in older adults with initial orthostatic hypotension ranged from 24 to 100% and was dependent on variations in timing or the inclusion of symptoms in the initial orthostatic hypotension definition. Conclusions Where orthostatic intolerance symptoms were reported, a large proportion of older adults with a diagnosis of initial orthostatic hypotension were symptomatic. However, the literature on initial orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance symptoms is scarce and a variety of definitions of initial orthostatic hypotension are utilised.","Christopoulos, Elena M; Tran, Jennifer; Hillebrand, Sarah L; Lange, Peter W; Iseli, Rebecca K; Meskers, Carel G M; Maier, Andrea B",International Journal of Cardiology.

However, the effect of doxapram on the diaphragm, the main respiratory muscle, is not known. OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of doxapram on diaphragmatic activity measured with transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG). METHODS A pilot study was conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. Diaphragmatic activity was measured from 30 min before up to 3 h after the start of doxapram treatment. dEMG parameters were compared to baseline (5 min before doxapram treatment) and at 15, 60, 120 and 180 min after the start of doxapram infusion. RESULTS Eleven preterm infants were included with a mean gestational age of 25.5 ± 1.2 weeks and birth weight of 831 ± 129 g. The amplitudedEMG, peakdEMG and tonicdEMG values did not change in the 3 h after the start of doxapram infusion compared to baseline. Clinically, the number of apnea episodes in the 24 h after doxapram treatment decreased significantly. CONCLUSION Doxapram infusion does not alter diaphragmatic activity measured with transcutaneous dEMG in preterm infants with AOP, indicating that its working mechanism is primarily on respiratory drive and not on respiratory muscle activity.","de Waal, Cornelia G; Hutten, Gerard J; Kraaijenga, Juliette V; de Jongh, Frans H; van Kaam, Anton H",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000493359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352445/,129

83280,"A practical approach to adult-onset white matter diseases, with illustrative cases.",2020-08-18,"INTRODUCTION Chronic venous leg ulcer (VLU) healing is a complex clinical problem. It requires intervention from skilled, costly, multidisciplinary wound-care teams, working with patients to manage their care. Compression therapy has been shown to help heal venous ulcers and to reduce recurrence, with some evidence suggesting the value of exercise as well. These activities require health education and health literacy (HL) as patients must process, understand and consistently apply health information for successful self-management. Research suggests that those most vulnerable to VLUs also tend to have limited HL, but there have been no reviews examining the state of HL in patients with previous or active VLUs. This scoping review aims to examine the level of HL in VLU patients and how HL may link to self-management behaviours (particularly exercise and compression adherence), and their VLU healing generally. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will use Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Scoping Review guidelines and the Levac methodology framework to explore eligible papers that examine the effect of HL on their exercise and compression adherence. Electronic databases will be searched (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo and Health, OpenGray), examining for all papers on these subjects published between 2000 and 2020. All studies describing compression and or exercise during VLU management will be included. Study characteristics will be recorded; qualitative data will be extracted and evaluated. Quantitative data will be extracted and summarised. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will disseminate results through peer-reviewed publications. We will use data (ie, journal articles) from publicly available platforms; so, this study does not require ethical review. The consultation step will be carried out with patients, carers and health professionals as part of an established wound consumer group.","Weller, C D; Team, Victoria; Probst, Sebastian; Gethin, Georgina; Richards, Catelyn; Sixsmith, Jane; Turnour, Louise; Bouguettaya, Ayoub",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980525/,129
83397,Modelling of the Sedative Effects of Propofol in Patients undergoing Spinal Anaesthesia: A Pharmacodynamic Analysis.,2016,"Studies displaying the combination of mefloquine (MFL) with anti-tuberculosis (TB) substances are limited in the literature. In this work, the effect of MFL-association with two first-line anti-TB drugs and six fluoroquinolones was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistant strains. MFL showed synergistic interaction with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and several fluoroquinolones, reaching fractional inhibitory concentration indexes (FICIs) ranging from 0.03 to 0.5. In order to better understand the observed results, two approaches have been explored: (i) spectroscopic responses attributed to the effect of MFL on physicochemical properties related to a liposomal membrane model composed by soybean asolectin; (ii) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data regarding MFL interaction with a membrane model based on PIM2, a lipid constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall. FTIR and NMR data showed that MFL affects expressively the region between the phosphate and the first methylene groups of soybean asolectin membranes, disordering these regions. MD simulations results detected high MFL density in the glycolipid interface and showed that the drug increases the membrane lateral diffusion, enhancing its permeability. The obtained results suggest that synergistic activities related to MFL are attributed to its effect of lipid disorder and membrane permeability enhancement.","Dos Santos, Marinalva Cardoso; Scaini, João Luís Rheingantz; Lopes, Márcio Vinicius Costa; Rodrigues, Beatriz Gonçalves; Silva, Nichole Osti; Borges, Carla Roberta Lopes; Dos Santos, Sandra Cruz; Dos Santos Machado, Karina; Werhli, Adriano Velasque; da Silva, Pedro Eduardo Almeida; Lourenço, Maria C S; da Silva, Emerson T; de Souza, Marcus V N; de Lima, Vânia Rodrigues; Gonçalves, Raoni Schroeder B",Bioorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.104786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740676/,129

It is, therefore, of vital importance to consider when, how and in whom medical therapy may be safely de-escalated. This issue is of great potential relevance in the current SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. In this review, we first discuss the rationale for drug withdrawal in IBD, before considering the available data on withdrawal of 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA), immunomodulators (IM) and biological therapy in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). We consider how to identify patients most appropriate for drug withdrawal and outline a potential monitoring strategy for the early detection of relapse following drug withdrawal.

STUDY DESIGN The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) statement was used as the guideline for conducting this review. METHODS This review included studies assessing pediatric (0-21 years) DHH children. Seventy records underwent the initial title-abstract screening, 33 underwent full-text review, and 23 studies met inclusion criteria. During the data extraction process, an additional six were excluded, resulting in a total of 17 evaluated studies. RESULTS Of the 17 studies assessed, nine compared peer victimization of DHH children and their hearing peers. Of those, seven studies reported that hearing loss (HL) is significantly associated with increased victimization. Two studies found that HL is significantly associated with decreased bullying perpetration. Notably, bullying in DHH children was not associated with a visible sign of disability, such as a hearing assistive device. Rather, variables such as educational setting, parental, and peer support are more likely to mediate bullying in this population. CONCLUSIONS DHH children have a higher risk of peer victimization and may bully others less often than their hearing peers. Studies described the health consequences of bullying in children who are DHH, including sleep issues and anxiety. These consequences may have implications for the patients' overall HL management. Additional research regarding bullying interventions and prevention in this population should be conducted.

A Review of Alberta's Regional Cancer Centre Network from 2010-2020.,2021-01-13,"Elemental sulfur is intensively used to control weeds and rubber leaf diseases. However, the mechanisms contributing to elemental sulfur dissipation and decay (hereafter decay) in rubber agroforestry remains unclear. This study relates hydrological processes such as runoff and soil loss to the changes in soil total sulfur (Stot) and sulfate (S-SO4) in typical hillslope rubber agroforestry intercropped with cocoa in Xishuangbanna. The elemental sulfur decay kinetics were studied at two slopes (top and bottom) and three agrosystems (weed, no-weed and mixed). The results show that soil moisture and hydraulic conductivity was uniformly distributed in the experimental rubber agroforestry settings. Higher soil loss and runoff occurred in the bottom slope than the top slope, and in no-weed agrosystem than the herbaceous agrosystems (weed and mixed). The soil loss was mainly driven by runoff. Moreover, Stot and S-SO4 in runoff water were higher in weed agrosystem than no-weed agrosystems. Soil Stot best fit a two-compartments kinetics model, with lower kinetic rates in elemental sulfur applied treatments than in the no-added elemental sulfur treatments, particularly for the weed agrosystem. The soil Stot dissipation time 50% (DT50) was 10-14 times higher in top slope than bottom slope; but 4 and 20 times higher in mixed and no-weed agrosystems, respectively, compared to the weed agrosystem. The soil Stot and S-SO4 contents negatively correlated with soil microbial respiration (CO2 efflux), indicating an adverse influence of elemental sulfur on soil microbial activity. In short, elemental sulfur decay and its S-SO4 transformation depended on soil moisture, runoff, soil erosion and soil CO2, which are in turn affected by slope and agrosystem. This study not only clarifies the mechanisms of elemental sulfur dissipation and decay for its use as an environmental friendly agrochemical; but it also provides information to understand the contribution of runoff and soil loss on these mechanisms in rubber agroforestry.","Zakari, Sissou; Liu, Wenjie; Wu, Junen; Singh, Ashutosh Kumar; Jiang, Xiaojin; Yang, Bin; Chen, Chunfeng; Zhu, Xiai",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818828/,129
84869,Breast Cancer With a Poor Prognosis Diagnosed After Screening Mammography With Negative Results.,2018,"p73, along with p53 and p63, belongs to the p53 family of transcription factors. Besides the p53-like tumor suppressive activities, p73 has unique roles, namely in neuronal development and differentiation. In addition, the TP73 gene is rarely mutated in tumors. This makes p73 a highly appealing therapeutic target, particularly towards cancers with a null or disrupted p53 pathway. Distinct isoforms are transcribed from the TP73 locus either with (TAp73) and without (ΔNp73) the N-terminal transactivation domain. Conversely to TA tumor suppressors, ΔN proteins exhibit oncogenic properties by inhibiting p53 and TA protein functions. As such, p73 isoforms compose a puzzled and challenging regulatory pathway. This state-of-the-art review affords an update overview on p73 structure, biological functions and pharmacological regulation. Importantly, it addresses the relevance of p73 isoforms in carcinogenesis, highlighting their potential as drug targets in anticancer therapy.

To address these issues and optimize pediatric pulmonary training, a group of faculty from various institutions met in 2019 and proposed specific, long-term solutions to the emerging problems in the field. Input on these ideas was then solicited more broadly from faculty with relevant expertise and from recent trainees. This proposal is a synthesis of these ideas. Pediatric pulmonology was among the first pediatric specialties to be grounded deliberately in science, requiring its fellows to demonstrate expertise in scientific inquiry (1).

Our broad objectives are (a) to meet the pediatric subspecialty workforce demand by increasing interest and participation in pediatric pulmonary training; (b) to modernize training to ensure that future pediatric pulmonologists will be prepared clinically and scientifically for the future of the field; (c) to train pediatric pulmonologists who will add value in the future of pediatric healthcare, complemented by advanced practice providers and artificial intelligence systems that are well-informed to optimize quality healthcare delivery; and (d) to decrease the cost and improve the quality of care provided to children with respiratory diseases.","Gaston, Benjamin; Laguna, Theresa A; Noah, Terry L; Hagood, James; Voynow, Judith; Ferkol, Thomas; Hershenson, Marc; Boyne, Katie; Delecaris, Angela; Ross, Kristie; Gozal, David; Celedón, Juan C; Abman, Steven H; Moore, Paul; Davis, Stephanie; Cornfield, David N; Murphy, Thomas",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531116/,129
85672,COVID-19: a defining moment for clinical pharmacology?,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND Anti-embolism stockings are commonly used worldwide to prevent the development of thrombosis in hospitalised patients. Patients are typically measured for, and fitted with, anti-embolism stockings during extended periods of non-ambulation. Anti-embolism stockings must critically fit the leg to achieve optimum blood flow and thus success of prophylaxis. Therefore, hospitals endeavour to maintain stock of anti-embolism stockings that fit the majority of their patients. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to establish whether popular styles/brands of anti-embolism stockings ""fitted"" the legs of convenience sampled volunteers. DESIGN/METHODS Volunteer's legs were measured at ankle, calf and thigh following guidance from British nurses and in accordance with brand instructions. Leg measurements were subsequently compared to the size charts of 10 anti-embolism stocking styles made by 4 different manufacturers. ""Fit"" is defined as a volunteer's leg measurements matching any stocking size in a range at all measurement points. SETTINGS Volunteers were measured in different settings around Scotland, including private homes, work places and shopping centres. PARTICIPANTS A convenience sample of 471 volunteers (283 female, 188 male) were recruited on the basis of willingness to participate and being over 16 years old. Volunteers ranged from 17 years to 82 years old with an average age of 35. RESULTS The 10 different styles of anti-embolism stockings, made by 4 different brands, examined for this paper had a size match coefficient ranging from 0% to 100% for our volunteer's legs. The size match coefficient is strongly influenced by the Brand's sizing policy. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of legs that ""fit"" a particular brand of anti-embolism stockings can be increased through: (1) the reduction of the number of leg measurement points that need to be matched to the size chart of the stockings; (2) the use of open-ended size ranges; (3) the use of increased size range width and (4) the use of increased overlap between sizes. However, all but the last of these measures can have a potentially deleterious impact on the ability of the stocking to deliver the optimum graduated pressure profile to all legs that ""fit"" the stocking, resulting in important implications to the efficacy of prophylaxis.","Macintyre, Lisa; Kent, Kimberly; McPhee, Donna",International journal of nursing studies,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2013.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23433707/,129

Other effects include the potential for arrest in adolescent development, which can occur when there is disruption in expected developmental milestones. New cohorts of adolescents who may not otherwise initiate substances may now be at risk. The pandemic is also straining family systems, with potential for increased conflict and relapse that can occur in a bidirectional fashion. In parallel, the way in which we treat substance use disorders in youth has also shifted, with a dominance in digitally based platforms for delivery of most outpatient treatment. Challenges to utilizing virtual technology include fewer means of monitoring substance use remotely; privacy concerns; and ease of nonadherence with treatment by signing off the computer.

METHODS A descriptive analysis was performed on consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU at the Jewish General Hospital, a designated pandemic centre in Montréal, between Mar. 5 and May 21, 2020. Complete follow-up data corresponding to death or discharge from hospital health records were included to Aug. 4, 2020. We summarized baseline characteristics, management and outcomes, including mortality. RESULTS A total of 106 patients were included in this study. Twenty-one patients (19.8%) died during their hospital stay, and the ICU mortality was 17.0% (18/106); all patients were discharged home or died, except for 4 patients (2 awaiting a rehabilitation bed and 2 awaiting long-term care). Twelve of 65 patients (18.5%) requiring mechanical ventilation died. Prone positioning was used in 29 patients (27.4%), including in 10 patients who were spontaneously breathing; no patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High-flow nasal cannula was used in 51 patients (48.1%). Acute kidney injury was the most common complication, seen in 20 patients (18.9%), and 12 patients (11.3%) required renal replacement therapy.

Seedlings were treated with either a 2-d or 4-d supply of potassium cyanide (KCN) in the nutrient solution containing nitrate (NO3-) or ammonium (NH4+). Although a KCN-induced increase was recorded in the activity of β-cyanoalanine synthase (β-CAS) in rice tissues of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed seedlings, the former showed a significantly greater assimilation rate for CN- than the latter. The addition of KCN decreased NO3- uptake and assimilation, whereas a negligible impact was observed in NH4+ treatments. Enzymatic assays showed a marked activities enhancement of glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in NH4+-fed seedlings after KCN exposure. Similarly, the rises occurring in nitrate reductase (NR) and GDH activity in NO3--fed seedlings were also detected after 2-d exposure to KCN, whereas a significant reduction of GS and GOGAT activities was determined. The results suggest that although exogenous KCN at moderate or high concentrations caused repressively effects on biomass growth of both NH4+-fed and NO3--fed rice seedlings, the nontoxic concentration of KCN supplied can serve as a supplemental N source in plant nutrition and N metabolism.","Li, Cheng-Zhi; Yang, Li; Lin, Yu-Juan; Zhang, Hua; Rad, Saeed; Yu, Xiao-Zhang",Ecotoxicology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10646-020-02265-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803565/,129

CASE PRESENTATION A 78 years old woman was admitted to the Emergency Unit with respiratory symptoms, confusion and cyanosis at the extremity, in particular at the nose area, hands and feet fingers. A nasal swab for COVID-19 was performed, which resulted positive, and so therapy with doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine and antiviral agents was started. At admission, the patient was hemodynamically unstable requiring circulatory support with liquids and norepinephrine; laboratory tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). During hospitalization, the clinical condition worsened and the cyanosis of the nose, fingers, and toes rapidly increased and became dried gangrene in three days. Subsequently, the neurological state deteriorated into a coma and the patient died. DISCUSSION In severe cases, COVID-19 could be complicated by acute respiratory disease syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. This case report shows the quick development of dried gangrene in a non-vasculopathic patient, as a consequence of COVID-19's coagulopathy and DIC.

87710,The Promise of Personalized TCR-Based Cellular Immunotherapy for Cancer Patients.,2021,"BACKGROUND Research has shown that acute kidney injury (AKI) has a noticeable incidence in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients with prior renal insufficiency are particularly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to their immune dysfunction. However, most patients with COVID-19 do not have a history of kidney dysfunction, and few studies have focused on the incidence of AKI among COVID-19 patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of AKI in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on those without a CKD history. METHODS A single-center retrospective study of 96 patients with COVID-19 in China between February 7 and March 3, 2020 was conducted. All patients were diagnosed by nucleic acid test (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled patients were divided into the severely or critically ill group according to the defined criteria. Patients' epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, along with their treatment information, were collected from the medical history system. The occurrence of AKI was compared between the severe and critical patients, and between patients with or without a history of CKD. The diagnostic criteria for AKI included an increase in the serum creatinine level to ≥1.5-fold the level at baseline within 7 days according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Renal outcomes were defined as AKI or non-AKI. RESULTS Four patients (4.2%) developed AKI, all of whom were in the critically ill group, and 3 (75%) of whom died. Out of the 90 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD, 3 (3.3%) patients developed AKI; out of the 6 patients with CKD, 1 (16.7%) patient developed AKI. Age, disease severity, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were correlated with AKI onset in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while lymphocyte count and estimated glomerular filtration rate at admission were inversely related to the development of AKI. CONCLUSIONS Only 3.3% of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD in our research cohort developed AKI. Critically ill patients may be more susceptible to AKI than severely ill patients.","Yu, Yue; Ge, Huipeng; Wang, Xiufen; Huang, Zhonghua; Chen, Lei; Han, Yun; Jiang, Dayang; Tao, Lijian; Zhou, Qiaoling; Peng, Zhangzhe; Xiao, Xiangcheng",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044555/,129

Catalytic chemical vapor deposition grown carbon nanofibers dispersed on activated carbon fibers (Ni-ACF/CNF) having a BET specific surface area of 738 (m2/g) were for the first time evaluated as a DSPE material for sample cleanup before gas chromatographic analysis. Based on cleanup performance and recoveries, 10 mg of Ni-ACF/CNF was found optimal for the determination of twenty-seven multi-class pesticides in high fat and low water commodities/matrices (peanut, soybean, sesame, and flaxseed). The recoveries obtained for all analytes were in the range ~ 72 to ~ 117%, with relative standard deviation values ≤ 15%. The limits of detection and quantification values were 0.7-4.2 ng/g and 2.3-13.9 ng/g, respectively. The matrix match calibration curve was linear in the range 20-500 ng/g with a correlation coefficient of ≥ 0.993. The results reveal that the Ni-ACF/CNF is a competent DSPE sorbent, similar to primary secondary amines and C18 sorbent materials, for pesticide determination by QuEChERS methods in high fat and low water commodities.

Phylogenetic analyses of these coronaviruses suggest that there is a diversity of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses circulating in birds. Gammacoronaviruses were found predominantly in Anseriformes birds, whereas deltacoronaviruses could be detected in Ciconiiformes, Pelecaniformes, and Anseriformes birds in this study. We observed that there are frequent interspecies transmissions of gammacoronaviruses between duck species. In contrast, deltacoronaviruses may have more stringent host specificities. Our analysis of these avian viral and host mitochondrial DNA sequences also suggests that some, but not all, coronaviruses may have coevolved with birds from the same order.","Chu, Daniel K W; Leung, Connie Y H; Gilbert, Martin; Joyner, Priscilla H; Ng, Erica M; Tse, Tsemay M; Guan, Yi; Peiris, Joseph S M; Poon, Leo L M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05838-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21957308/,129

Though SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly via the droplets of respiratory secretions, it was also detected in stool samples of patients, indicating active infection of the gastrointestinal tract. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage samples was reported in February 2020, raising the possibility of using environmental water surveillance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 activity in infected areas. The aim of this study was to standardize the methodology for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage and explore the feasibility of establishing supplementary surveillance for COVID-19. Methods Sewage specimens were collected from six sites in Mumbai, India, using the grab sample method and processed using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran phase separation method for virus concentration. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results A total of 20 sewage samples collected from six different wards in Mumbai city, before the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and during May 11-22, 2020, were processed using the phase separation method. The WHO two-phase PEG-dextran method was modified during standardization. SARS-CoV-2 was found to concentrate in the middle phase only. All samples collected before March 16, 2020 were SARS-CoV-2 negative. Viral RNA was detected in sewage samples collected during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in all the six wards. Interpretation & conclusions PEG-dextran phase separation method was effectively used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 from domestic waste waters to detection levels. It would be feasible to initiate sewage surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 to generate data about the viral transmission in various epidemiologic settings.","Sharma, Deepa Kailash; Nalavade, Uma Prajwal; Kalgutkar, Kamlesh; Gupta, Nivedita; Deshpande, Jagadish Mohanrao",The Indian journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_3541_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318343/,129

The COVID-19 pandemic has limited the availability of medical procedures. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess if this pandemic had any impact on the treatment strategy of severe AS in a single cardiac center. Methods This study involved AS patients treated in 3-month periods (February through April) over 3 consecutive years 2018, 2019 [defined as COV(-) group] and 2020 [COV(+)]. We assessed if there were any differences regarding patients' clinical profile, applied therapeutic method, procedure complexity and early clinical outcomes. Results In the years 2018 through 2019, approximately 50% of AS patients were treated classically (SAVR) while in 2020 this rate dropped to 34%. The preoperative clinical characteristic of TAVI subjects was comparable irrespective of the year. Regarding SAVR, more patients in COV(+) underwent urgent and more complex procedures. More of them were found in NYHA class III or IV, and had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (51.9%±14.4% vs. 58.3%±8.1%; P=0.021) than in COV(-) individuals. During the pandemic, a change in applied therapeutic methods and differences in patients' clinical profile did not have an unfavorable impact on in-hospital mortality (2.0% before vs. 3.6% during pandemic) and morbidity. Of note, intubation time and in-hospital stay were significantly shorter (P<0.05) in 2020 (4.2 hours and 7.5 days) than in the previous years (7.5 hours and 9.0 days, respectively). Conclusions The coronavirus pandemic has changed substantially the management of severe AS. The shift into less invasive treatment method of AS patients resulted in shortening of in-hospital stay without compromise of short-term outcomes.","Perek, Bartlomiej; Olasinska-Wisniewska, Anna; Misterski, Marcin; Puslecki, Mateusz; Grygier, Marek; Buczkowski, Piotr; Lesiak, Maciej; Stankowski, Tomasz; Szarpak, Lukasz; Ruetzler, Kurt; Turan, Oguz; Jemielity, Marek",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-3025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717563/,129

88984,"The Evolution of Hemophilia Care: Clinical and Laboratory Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges.",2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVES Current evidence suggests that a significant amount of human milk fat is lost due to tubing adsorption. The objective was to evaluate the effect of reintroducing tubing leftover milk on the quality of macronutrient content of delivered milk. METHODS This was an in vitro study. The standard method of preparing and delivering fortified human milk includes preparing a small extra volume that would be used for priming the connection tubes. At the end of the infusion, the tubes and any milk leftover would be discarded. This method was compared to a new method where by the exact milk volume was prepared and used to prime the connection tubes. Leftover tubing milk was pushed with air. RESULTS The standard method was associated with significant losses in fat, protein, and calories of 16.7%, 3.4%, and 9.2% compared to the new method of 8.2%, 0%, and 3.3%, respectively. These losses in the standard method were predominantly explained by the significant gains in the left over milk contents of fat 6.3 ± 1.1 g/dL, protein 3.5 ± 0.4 g/dL, and calories 28 ± 2.6 kcal/oz as compared to prepared milk of 4.8 ± 0.3 g/dL, 2.9 ± 0.3 g/dL, and 24.0 ± 0.8 kcal/oz respectively, p = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS Traditional continuous delivery methods of human milk are associated with significant losses of fat and protein. By preparing the exact amount of ordered milk and then pushing through the residual milk left in the tubing with a small amount of air, this study offers a simple intervention that would significantly decrease these losses.","Davidson, Jennifer; Elabiad, Mohamad T",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1097/mpg.0000000000002609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31899735/,129

Currently, patient education is often handouts printed from the electronic medical record system; however, these pieces of paper often do not have the desired impact. Well-established advertising methods reveal that repeated exposure is key in recall and swaying consumer decisions. The Creating Health Education for Constructive Knowledge in Underserved Populations (CHECK UP) Program is a medical student-led program that aims to improve patient recall of health information, health promoting behaviors and health outcomes by applying modified advertising concepts to the delivery of health education. METHODS Patients were given large magnets containing health education information. These patients were interviewed 3-4 months afterwards to assess use and effectiveness of magnets as a means to provide health education. RESULTS In total, 25 of the 28 patients given CHECK UP magnets agreed to participate. The majority of participants (23/25) kept the magnets and reported that they, as well as others in their households, see the magnets daily. All 23 participants recalled at least 1 health tip from 1 of the magnets. CONCLUSIONS The use of non-traditional materials for patient education allowed for repeated exposure and recall of health information. Consideration for modified use of evidence-based advertising and marketing strategies for the delivery of patient education may be an easy and effective way to provide information to patients outside of the clinical setting and promote health behavioral changes.","Cory, Megan M; Osmani, Wasif A; Cory, Kevin S; Young, Staci; Lundh, Rebecca",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174211035214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313491/,129

Because of their epidemiological significance, vaccinations are considered compulsory in many countries and their evasion is penalized. Anti-vaccine movements may pose a threat to the epidemiological situation in many countries. The study presents the arguments formulated by opponents of vaccination and provides counter-arguments. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study is based on the analysis of data stored in scientific databases, information obtained from Google, Bing and Yahoo on the Internet, as well as newspapers, magazines and opinion-forming websites. RESULTS The slogans propagated by anti-vaccination movements are usually based on easily proven erroneous theories and lies, although there are also arguments expressing belief in the conspiracy of governments, politicians and vaccine manufacturers, or incompetence of scientists and practitioners. CONCLUSIONS In recent years in Poland, the activity of movements against vaccination has increased significantly, and their propaganda, through its negative impact on social attitudes, threatens to destabilize the epidemiological situation. Analysis of arguments used by the opponents of vaccination suggests a lack of reliable knowledge, religious overtones (addressed to people with fundamentalist personalities), or the ill-will attitudes of anti-vaccine individuals/groups used for their own purposes. Familiarization with the arguments of anti-vaccine propaganda is necessary in order to implement effective methods of fighting such attitudes and beliefs.","Kołłątaj, Witold Piotr; Kołłątaj, Barbara; Panasiuk, Lech; Sobieszczański, Jarosław; Karwat, Irena Dorota",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/126013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356059/,129

89886,Anesthesia for interventional radiology.,2014,"BACKGROUND In the present study we developed, evaluated in volunteers, and clinically validated an image acquisition stabilizer (IAS) for Sidestream Dark Field (SDF) imaging. METHODS The IAS is a stainless steel sterilizable ring which fits around the SDF probe tip. The IAS creates adhesion to the imaged tissue by application of negative pressure. The effects of the IAS on the sublingual microcirculatory flow velocities, the force required to induce pressure artifacts (PA), the time to acquire a stable image, and the duration of stable imaging were assessed in healthy volunteers. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of the SDF setup in combination with the IAS, simultaneous bilateral sublingual imaging of the microcirculation were performed during a lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. One SDF device was operated handheld; the second was fitted with the IAS and held in position by a mechanic arm. Lateral drift, number of losses of image stability and duration of stable imaging of the two methods were compared. RESULTS Five healthy volunteers were studied. The IAS did not affect microcirculatory flow velocities. A significantly greater force had to applied onto the tissue to induced PA with compared to without IAS (0.25 +/- 0.15 N without vs. 0.62 +/- 0.05 N with the IAS, p < 0.001). The IAS ensured an increased duration of a stable image sequence (8 +/- 2 s without vs. 42 +/- 8 s with the IAS, p < 0.001). The time required to obtain a stable image sequence was similar with and without the IAS. In eight mechanically ventilated patients undergoing a LRM the use of the IAS resulted in a significantly reduced image drifting and enabled the acquisition of significantly longer stable image sequences (24 +/- 5 s without vs. 67 +/- 14 s with the IAS, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS The present study has validated the use of an IAS for improvement of SDF imaging by demonstrating that the IAS did not affect microcirculatory perfusion in the microscopic field of view. The IAS improved both axial and lateral SDF image stability and thereby increased the critical force required to induce pressure artifacts. The IAS ensured a significantly increased duration of maintaining a stable image sequence.","Balestra, Gianmarco M; Bezemer, Rick; Boerma, E Christiaan; Yong, Ze-Yie; Sjauw, Krishan D; Engstrom, Annemarie E; Koopmans, Matty; Ince, Can",BMC medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2342-10-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20626888/,129

METHODS We immunized cats with peptides containing T-helper (Th)1 epitopes derived from the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the type I FIPV KU-2 strain (NP7 and NP8) with feline CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (fCpG-ODNs) as a vaccine adjuvant. RESULTS Prevention against type II FIPV 79-1146 strain-induced FIP was slightly better in specific pathogen-free cats treated with NP7 and NP8 with fCpG-ODNs.

90622,Breastfeeding: more than just good nutrition.,2011,"The human body is critically dependent on the ventilatory control system for adequate uptake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide (CO2). Potent opioid analgesics, through their actions on μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expressed on respiratory neurons in the brainstem, depress ventilation. Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is potentially life threatening and the cause of substantial morbidity and mortality. One possible way of prevention of OIRD is by adding a respiratory stimulant to the opioid treatment, which through activation of non-opioidergic pathways will excite breathing and consequently will offset OIRD and should not affect analgesia. Various new respiratory stimulants are currently under investigation including (a) potassium channel blockers acting at the carotid bodies, and (b) ampakines and (c) serotonin receptor agonists acting within the brainstem. (a) GAL-021 targets BKCa-channels. Initial animal and human experimental evidence indicates that this potassium channel blocker is a potent respiratory stimulant that reverses OIRD without affecting antinociception. GAL021 is safe and better tolerated than the older K(+)-channel blocker doxapram and more efficacious in its effect on respiration. (b) Ampakines modulate glutamatergic respiratory neurons in brainstem respiratory centers. Various ampakines have been studied showing their ability to increase respiratory drive during OIRD by increasing respiratory rate. Currently, CX717 is the most promising ampakine for use in humans as it is safe and does not affect opioid analgesia. (c) While animal studies show that serotonin receptor agonists increase respiratory drive via activation of serotonin receptors in brainstem respiratory centers, human studies are without success. Further clinical studies are required to improve our care of patients that are treated with potent opioid analgesics. The use of non-opioid adjuvants may reduce the probability of OIRD but does never relieve us of our duty to continuously monitor these patients, irrespective whether they are treated in-house or in an ambulatory setting.","van der Schier, Rutger; Roozekrans, Margot; van Velzen, Monique; Dahan, Albert; Niesters, Marieke",F1000prime reports,https://doi.org/10.12703/p6-79; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25343036/,129

91159,Colchicine in coronary disease: another renaissance of an ancient drug.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND In the case of a poor peripheral venous status the use of conventional approaches is associated with several failed attempts, delay of treatment, increased pain and escalation to more invasive techniques. Ultrasound-guided venous access has become increasingly popular for difficult venous access; however, in German-speaking countries it has not yet become as popular as in English-speaking countries. First attempt success rates are high, but the factors contributing to the time needed for ultrasound-guided venous access are not well investigated. It is hypothesized that body mass index (BMI), vein diameter and depth contribute to the time needed for successfully establishing a peripheral vein access in patients with a difficult venous status. METHODS This study included 68 patients with a poor venous status. After written consent was obtained patient characteristics were documented and upper extremity veins eligible for access were scanned with ultrasound with the aim of performing an ultrasound-guided venous access. The following time periods were documented: 1) first skin contact with the ultrasound probe, 2) time to identify an accessible vein, 3) time for venous access. RESULTS Of the patients 67 were successfully punctured by ultrasound-guided venous access, 65 at the first attempt and 2 at the second attempt. In one patient conventional venous access was obtained at the same time. A higher BMI was associated with a significantly shorter total puncture time (+1 BMI point ≙ -2.25 s) and a shorter vein identification time (+1 BMI point ≙ -1.82 s). A greater vein diameter correlated with a shorter total time (-14.23 s/mm) and a greater depth correlated with an increased total time (+1.65 s/mm). CONCLUSION A greater vein diameter and a higher BMI contribute to a shorter time period for ultrasound-guided venous access. Obese patients with difficult venous access may benefit from ultrasound-guided venous access, which could be explained by the imaging contrast with a higher proportion of subcutaneous fatty tissue.","Kaiser, P; Ghamari, S; Gräff, I; Ellerkmann, R; Weber, S; Hoeft, A; Kim, S-C",Der Anaesthesist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00101-020-00813-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32671428/,129
91458,Phase I study demonstrates safety and tolerability of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the anal mucosa.,2014,"BACKGROUND Surgical site infection (SSI) is an important cause of morbidity and occasionally death after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. These infections also are associated with higher costs and poorer surgical outcomes. We used a retrospective observational database to examine and quantify the effects of the topical skin adhesive 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, used as the final layer of site closure in patients undergoing CABG surgery, on the incidence of post-operative SSI. METHODS All patients in the Premier Perspective™ Comparative Database of inpatient hospitalizations who underwent CABG surgery in 2005 and 2006 were identified. Qualifying patients were classified into four groups according to the method of surgical site closure on the basis of detailed hospital billing charges: Sutures only; sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; sutures and staples; and sutures, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, and staples. Site infections were identified by a combination of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes, patterns of post-operative use of antibiotics, and All Patient Refined Diagnostic Related Group (APR-DRG) and Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) codes indicating post-operative infections at hospital re-admission. RESULTS A total of 59,006 patients qualified for the study: 38,799 who had sutures only; 10,262 having sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate; 8,180 having sutures and staples; and 1,765 having sutures, 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, and staples. The lowest unadjusted rate of post-CABG SSI was found in the sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate group (4.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-4.7), followed by sutures only (5.3%; 95% CI 5.1-5.5); sutures and staples (6.2%; 95% CI 5.7-6.8); and sutures, staples, and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (7.1%; 95% CI 6.0%-8.4%). A logistic regression model that controlled for selected baseline patient, hospital, and surgical characteristics showed significantly lower rates of post-CABG SSI (odds ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.68-0.85) in patients closed with sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate relative to patients who had only sutures. CONCLUSIONS The observed rates of post-CABG SSI were consistent with the rates observed in the literature. The SSI rate for patients who had sutures and 2-octyl cyanoacrylate used as the final layer of site closure was significantly lower than the rates for patients having other types of closure.","Fraeman, Kathy H; Reynolds, Matthew W; Vaughn, Brian B; Hart, James C",Surgical infections,https://doi.org/10.1089/sur.2010.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21859334/,129

Adherence to IPC practices has been suboptimal with limited available evidence. The study aim was to examine the impact of individual, home environment, and organizational factors on IPC practices using human factors model. METHODS 353 nurses were surveyed across two large home care agencies to examine the relationship between IPC adherence and individual, home environment, and organizational factors. RESULTS Nurses reported multiple barriers to IPC practices in patients' homes (mean=4.34, standard deviation [SD]= 2.53). Frequent barriers included clutter (reported by 74.5% of nurses) and a dirty environment (70.3%). Nurses also reported limited availability of some IPC supplies (mean=7.76, SD=2.44), including personal protective equipment. Home environment factors were significant barriers, and availability of IPC supplies were significant enablers of IPC adherence. Agency-provided training and decision-making resources were not significant factors for IPC adherence in the presence of home environment barriers and IPC supplies. CONCLUSION This study findings suggest that IPC adherence strategies point to addressing barriers in the home environment and increasing availability of IPC supplies. The relationship between the patient's home environment, organizational factors, and IPC practices among home health care nurses warrants further study.","Adams, Victoria; Song, Jiyoun; Shang, Jingjing; McDonald, Margaret; Dowding, Dawn; Ojo, Marietta; Russell, Dr David",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.10.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33157183/,129

91895,Blood transfusion during the COVID-19 outbreak.,2020-03-01,"UNLABELLED The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) represent highly pathogenic human CoVs that share a property to inhibit host gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Similar to the nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of SARS-CoV that inhibits host gene expression at the translational level, we report that MERS-CoV nsp1 also exhibits a conserved function to negatively regulate host gene expression by inhibiting host mRNA translation and inducing the degradation of host mRNAs. Furthermore, like SARS-CoV nsp1, the mRNA degradation activity of MERS-CoV nsp1, most probably triggered by its ability to induce an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage, was separable from its translation inhibitory function. Despite these functional similarities, MERS-CoV nsp1 used a strikingly different strategy that selectively targeted translationally competent host mRNAs for inhibition. While SARS-CoV nsp1 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm and binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit to gain access to translating mRNAs, MERS-CoV nsp1 was distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm and did not bind stably to the 40S subunit, suggesting a distinctly different mode of targeting translating mRNAs. Interestingly, consistent with this notion, MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targeted mRNAs, which are transcribed in the nucleus and transported to the cytoplasm, for translation inhibition and mRNA degradation but spared exogenous mRNAs introduced directly into the cytoplasm or virus-like mRNAs that originate in the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data point toward a novel viral strategy wherein the cytoplasmic origin of MERS-CoV mRNAs facilitates their escape from the inhibitory effects of MERS-CoV nsp1. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic human CoV that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS-CoV has a zoonotic origin and poses a major threat to public health. However, little is known about the viral factors contributing to the high virulence of MERS-CoV. Many animal viruses, including CoVs, encode proteins that interfere with host gene expression, including those involved in antiviral immune responses, and these viral proteins are often major virulence factors. The nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of CoVs is one such protein that inhibits host gene expression and is a major virulence factor. This study presents evidence for a strategy used by MERS-CoV nsp1 to inhibit host gene expression that has not been described previously for any viral protein. The present study represents a meaningful step toward a better understanding of the factors and molecular mechanisms governing the virulence and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV.","Lokugamage, Kumari G; Narayanan, Krishna; Nakagawa, Keisuke; Terasaki, Kaori; Ramirez, Sydney I; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01352-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26311885/,129
92033,Aberrant Expression of Syndecan-1 in Cervical Cancers.,2020-05-10,"BACKGROUND Complications increase the costs of care of surgical patients. We studied the Premier database to determine the incidence and direct medical costs related to pulmonary complications and compared it to cardiac complications in the same cohort. METHODS We identified 45,969 discharges in patients undergoing major bowel procedures. Postoperative pulmonary and cardiac complications were identified through the use of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and through the use of daily resource use data. Pulmonary complications included pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pleural effusion, pulmonary failure, and mechanical ventilation more than 48 h after surgery. Cardiac complications included ventricular fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, transient ischemia, premature ventricular contraction, and acute congestive heart failure. RESULTS Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) or postoperative cardiac complications (PCC) were present in 22% of cases; PPC alone was most common (19.0%), followed by PPC and PCC (1.8%) and PCC alone (1.2%). The incremental cost of PPC is large ($25,498). In comparison, PCC alone only added $7,307 to the total cost. CONCLUSIONS The current study demonstrates that postoperative pulmonary complications represent a significant source of morbidity and incremental cost after major small intestinal and colon surgery and have greater incidence and costs than cardiac complications alone. Therefore, strategies to reduce the incidence of these complications should be targeted as means of improving health and bending the cost curve in health care.","Fleisher, Lee A; Linde-Zwirble, Walter T",Perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-0525-3-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25313335/,129

Blood alcohol concentration, urine toxicology results, demographics, and injury characteristics were collected. Patients were grouped based on injury date - before SAH (PRE-SAH), immediately after SAH (POST-SAH), and a historical comparison (3/19/2019-6/30/2019) (CONTROL) - and compared in separate analyses. Groups were compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables.Results: 20,448 trauma patients (13,634 male, 6,814 female) were identified across three time-periods.

Although Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is an effective weight loss procedure, there is a plateau in weight loss and most individuals remain obese. This plateau may be partly due to the decline in leptin resulting in a state of relative leptin insufficiency. The main objective of this study was to determine whether leptin administration to post-RYGB patients would promote further weight reduction. DESIGN AND METHODS This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study of 27 women who were at least 18 months post-RYGB and lost on average 30.8% of their presurgical body weight. Subjects received either leptin or placebo via subcutaneous injection twice daily for 16 weeks, then crossed over to receive the alternate treatment for 16 weeks. RESULTS Weight change after 16 weeks of placebo was not significantly different from that after 16 weeks of leptin. No changes were observed in percent fat mass, resting energy expenditure, thyroid hormones, or cortisol levels. CONCLUSION Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe a significant effect of leptin treatment on body weight in women with relative hypoleptinemia after RYGB.","Korner, Judith; Conroy, Rushika; Febres, Gerardo; McMahon, Donald J; Conwell, Irene; Karmally, Wahida; Aronne, Louis J",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23512892/,129

The main drawbacks of this laparoscopic approach include the clashing of the instruments and/or the crossing of the surgeon's hands due to the single-access site and an increase in the cost of the procedures due to the use of disposable materials. Furthermore, one of the rules of laparoscopy, which is to maintain the surgeon's two effectors at the right angle using the optical system as the bisector of this angle, is frequently lost during SAL. To solve these problems, curved reusable instruments for basic and advanced procedures in SAL have been developed based on this laparoscopic principle. The technique consists of the placement of a standard 11-mm reusable trocar, a 10-mm standard rigid scope, and the insertion of curved reusable instruments transabdominally without trocars.

Sixteen multiparous organically certified Jersey cows averaging (mean ± standard deviation) 101 ± 45 d in milk, 462 ± 38 kg of body weight, and 19.8 ± 3.90 kg/d of milk in the beginning of the study were randomly assigned to treatment sequences in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design, with 14 d for diet adaptation and 7 d for data and sample collection. Diets were fed as total mixed rations consisting (dry matter basis) of 52% grass-legume baleage, 8% grass hay, 8.5% soyhulls, 2.5% roasted soybean, 15% flaxseed meal, and 2% minerals-vitamins premix. The GRC-to-LM dietary ratios (dry matter basis) were 12:0, 8:4, 4:8, and 0:12. Orthogonal polynomials were used to test linear, quadratic, and cubic effects using the MIXED procedure of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The milk concentration of enterolactone tended to respond cubically, thus suggesting that replacing GRC with LM did not affect this lignan in milk. The plasma activities of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and catalase did not differ, but superoxide dismutase activity tended to respond cubically with feeding increasing amounts of LM. Dry matter intake and yields of milk and milk fat, true protein, and lactose decreased linearly with substituting GRC for LM. Whereas the concentrations of milk fat and milk true protein did not differ across treatments, milk lactose content decreased linearly. Feeding incremental levels of LM reduced linearly the milk concentration of urea N and the amount of N excreted in urine, and tended to decrease linearly the concentration of plasma urea N. Apparent total-tract digestibilities of dry matter, organic matter, and neutral and acid detergent fiber did not differ across treatments, whereas digestibility of crude protein decreased linearly. Digestibility of starch responded linearly and quadratically, but the actual differences between treatments were too small to be biologically significant. Milk FA profile was substantially changed most notably by linear increases in cis-9,trans-11 18:2, cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3, Σ odd-chain FA, and the trans-11-to-trans-10 ratio, and linear decreases in cis-9 18:1 and cis-9,cis-12 18:2 when replacing GRC by incremental amounts of LM.","Ghedini, C P; Moura, D C; Santana, R A V; Oliveira, A S; Brito, A F",Journal of dairy science,https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-13689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29274976/,129

METHODS We conducted a comparative model-based analysis using three independent NCI Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network cervical models to quantify the impact of eight alternative COVID-19-related screening disruption scenarios compared to a scenario of no disruptions. Scenarios varied by the duration of the disruption (6 or 24 months), steps in the screening process being disrupted (primary screening, surveillance, colposcopy, excisional treatment), and primary screening modality (cytology alone or cytology plus human papillomavirus ""cotesting""). RESULTS The models consistently showed that COVID-19-related disruptions yield small net increases in cervical cancer cases by 2027, which are greater for women previously screened with cytology compared with cotesting. When disruptions affected all four steps in the screening process under cytology-based screening, there were an additional 5-7 and 38-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. In contrast, under cotesting, there were additional 4-5 and 35-45 cases per one million screened for 6- and 24-month disruptions, respectively. The majority (58-79%) of the projected increases in cases under cotesting were due to disruptions to surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, rather than to primary screening. CONCLUSIONS Women in need of surveillance, colposcopies, or excisional treatment, or whose last primary screen did not involve human papillomavirus testing, may comprise priority groups for reintroductions.","Burger, Emily A; Jansen, Erik El; Killen, James; Kok, Inge McM de; Smith, Megan A; Sy, Stephen; Dunnewind, Niels; G Campos, Nicole; Haas, Jennifer S; Kobrin, Sarah; Kamineni, Aruna; Canfell, Karen; Kim, Jane J",Journal of medical screening,https://doi.org/10.1177/09691413211001097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730899/,129
93680,[A complex approach to the differential diagnosis of chronic parenchymal parotitis in children].,2021,"Purpose As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been growing recognition of risks to frontline health care workers. When caring for patients with tracheostomy, speech-language pathologists have significant exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This tutorial provides guidance on practices for safely performing patient evaluation and procedures, thereby reducing risk of infection. Method Data were collated through review of literature, guidelines, and consensus statements relating to COVID-19 and similar high-consequent infections, with a focus on mitigating risk of transmission to health care workers. Particular emphasis was placed on speech-language pathologists, nurses, and other allied health professionals. A multinational interdisciplinary team then analyzed findings, arriving at recommendations through consensus via electronic communications and video conference. Results Reports of transmission of infection to health care workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic and previous outbreaks substantiate the need for safe practices. Many procedures routinely performed by speech-language pathologists have a significant risk of infection due to aerosol generation. COVID-19 testing can inform level of protective equipment, and meticulous hygiene can stem spread of nosocomial infection. Modifications to standard clinical practice in tracheostomy are often required. Personal protective equipment, including either powered air-purifying respirator or N95 mask, gloves, goggles, and gown, are needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures in patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Speech-language pathologists are often called on to assist in the care of patients with tracheostomy and known or suspected COVID-19 infection. Appropriate care of these patients is predicated on maintaining the health and safety of the health care team. Careful adherence to best practices can significantly reduce risk of infectious transmission.","Zaga, Charissa J; Pandian, Vinciya; Brodsky, Martin B; Wallace, Sarah; Cameron, Tanis S; Chao, Caroline; Orloff, Lisa Ann; Atkins, Naomi E; McGrath, Brendan A; Lazarus, Cathy L; Vogel, Adam P; Brenner, Michael J",American journal of speech-language pathology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_ajslp-20-00089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32525695/,129
93721,Dual effects of active ERK in cancer: A potential target for enhancing radiosensitivity.,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Mid-regional proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), a novel biomarker, recently gained interest particularly with regards to its potential in assisting clinicians' decision making in patients with suspicion of infection in the emergency department (ED). A group of international experts, with research and experience in MR-proADM applications, produced this review based on their own experience and the currently available literature. AREAS COVERED The review provides evidence related to MR-proADM as a triaging tool in avoiding unnecessary admissions to hospital and/or inadequate discharge, and identifying patients most at risk of deterioration. It also covers the use of MR-proADM in the context of COVID- 19. Moreover, the authors provide a proposal on how to incorporate MR-proADM into patients' clinical pathways in an ED setting. EXPERT OPINION The data we have so far on the application of MR-proADM in the ED is promising.

The current perineal approaches available involve mucosal or full thickness resection. There are currently no accepted procedures combining rectal fixation without resection using the perineal approach. We present our initial report of transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy for the treatment of rectal prolapse. METHODS A longitudinal incision was made in the posterior wall of the vagina. The rectum and sacrospinous ligament were identified. Two sutures were placed in the sacrospinous ligament and brought through a piece of Surgisis mesh previously anchored to the anterior surface of the rectum. This was performed bilaterally. These sutures were tied to complete the rectal suspension, and the posterior wall of the vagina was closed. RESULTS Transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy was performed in all seven cases. In the first two cases, a Delorme procedure was performed concurrently. Two patients had rubber band ligation for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids, one patient had a sphincter plication, and one patient had an anal encirclement procedure with Surgisis. Six of the seven patients had concomitant urologic procedures. The average operative time was 163 min, and the average blood loss was 107 mL. None of the cases required conversion to an open procedure. There was one full thickness recurrence at 18 weeks. CONCLUSION Transvaginal sacrospinous rectopexy is a safe, minimally invasive, technically feasible technique for the treatment of rectal prolapse.","Gurland, B; Garrett, K A; Firoozi, F; Goldman, H B",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-010-0567-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20309717/,129

Current computational fluid dynamics findings correlating both high and low wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture puzzle researchers and clinicians alike. These conflicting findings may stem from inconsistent parameter definitions, small datasets, and intrinsic complexities in intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture. In Part 1 of this 2-part review, we proposed a unifying hypothesis: both high and low wall shear stress drive intracranial aneurysm growth and rupture through mural cell-mediated and inflammatory cell-mediated destructive remodeling pathways, respectively. In the present report, Part 2, we delineate different wall shear stress parameter definitions and survey recent computational fluid dynamics studies, in light of this mechanistic heterogeneity. In the future, we expect that larger datasets, better analyses, and increased understanding of hemodynamic-biologic mechanisms will lead to more accurate predictive models for intracranial aneurysm risk assessment from computational fluid dynamics.","Xiang, J; Tutino, V M; Snyder, K V; Meng, H",AJNR.

Periodontitis, one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, leads to alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth loss, and develops due to pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontopathic bacteria are involved in respiratory diseases, including aspiration pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other systemic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Patients with these diseases have an increased COVID-19 aggravation rate and mortality. Because aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene can lead to COVID-19 aggravation. Conversely, oral care, including periodontal treatment, prevents the onset of pneumonia and influenza and the exacerbation of COPD. The reduced chance of receiving professional oral care owing to long-term hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 may increase the aggravation risk of infection in the lower respiratory tract. It can be hypothesized that periodontopathic bacteria are involved in the COVID-19 aggravation and therefore, the management of good oral hygiene potentially contributes to its prevention.","Takahashi, Yuwa; Watanabe, Norihisa; Kamio, Noriaki; Kobayashi, Ryutaro; Iinuma, Toshimitsu; Imai, Kenichi",Journal of oral science,https://doi.org/10.2334/josnusd.20-0388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177276/,129

Accordingly, a global movement of 'One-Health/One-Medicine' has been launched to foster collaborative efforts amongst animal and human health officials and researchers to address these problems. Historical evidence points to the fact that pandemics caused by influenza A viruses remain a major zoonotic threat to mankind. Recently, a range of mathematical and computer simulation modelling methods and tools have increasingly been applied to improve our understanding of disease transmission dynamics, contingency planning and to support policy decisions on disease outbreak management. This review provides an overview of methods, approaches and software used for modelling the spread of zoonotic influenza viruses in animals and humans, particularly those related to the animal-human interface. Modelling parameters used in these studies are summarized to provide references for future work. This review highlights the limited application of modelling research to influenza in animals and at the animal-human interface, in marked contrast to the large volume of its research in human populations. Although swine are widely recognized as a potential host for generating novel influenza viruses, and that some of these viruses, including pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009, have been shown to be readily transmissible between humans and swine, only one study was found related to the modelling of influenza spread at the swine-human interface. Significant gaps in the knowledge of frequency of novel viral strains evolution in pigs, farm-level natural history of influenza infection, incidences of influenza transmission between farms and between swine and humans are clearly evident. Therefore, there is a need to direct additional research to the study of influenza transmission dynamics in animals and at the animal-human interface.","Dorjee, S; Poljak, Z; Revie, C W; Bridgland, J; McNab, B; Leger, E; Sanchez, J",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22937896/,129

However, since its existence, the symptoms of the disease have been varying widely; thus, developing an urgent need to stratify high-risk categories of people who show more propensity to be affected by this deadly virus will be beneficial for health care. Using the open-access data and machine learning algorithms, this paper aims to cluster countries in groups with similar profiles with respect to the country level pre COVID-19 pandemic parameters. The purpose of performing the data analysis is to measure the extent to which these major risk factors determine the mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease 2019. An unsupervised machine learning model (k-means) was employed for two hundred and eight countries to define data-driven clusters based on thirteen country-level parameters. After performing the one-way ANOVA for comparing the clusters in terms of total cases, total deaths, total cases per population, total deaths per population, and death rate, the paradigm with four and seven clusters showed the best ability to stratify the countries according to total cases per population and death rate with p-values of less than 0.05 and 0.001, respectively. However, the model could not stratify countries in total deaths/cases and total deaths per population.","Garg, Poojita; Joshi, Deepak",Journal of medical engineering & technology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03091902.2021.1893398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750249/,129

The aim of this study was to assess factorsavailable before LTxto identify predictors of prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) after LTx. METHODS All bilateral LTx recipients excluding re-transplantation and multi-organ transplantation at Oslo University Hospitalfrom 2000-2013 were included (n=277). Predictive factors for ICULOS were identifiedusing pre- and perioperative variables. RESULTS Univariate analyses showed that recipients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, young age, female gender, low body height, low pretransplant actual total lung capacity (aTLC), and recipients who received an oversized donor lung were at risk for long ICU LOS. Patients with emphysema had lower risk of long ICU LOS. In multivariate analyses, a lower aTLC (P< 0.001) anda higher mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) (P = 0.004)predicted prolonged ICU LOS. CONCLUSIONS We found that small recipient lung volume andhigh mPAP were predictors for prolonged ICU LOS.Our observations may be useful in planning use of resources in LTx, particularly in times of limited intensive care resources.","Eirik Olsen, Jul; Auråen, Henrik; T Durheim, Michael; E Fiane, Arnt; M Holm, Are",Clinical transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185913/,129

VISITECT®CD4 is an instrument-free, low-cost point-of-care CD4 test with a cut-off of 350 CD4 cells/μL. This study aimed to evaluate VISITECT®CD4 test's diagnostic accuracy. METHODS Two hundred HIV-positive patients attending a tertiary HIV centre in South India were recruited. Patients provided venous blood for reference and VISITECT®CD4 tests. An additional finger-prick blood sample was obtained for VISITECT®CD4. VISITECT®CD4's diagnostic performance in identifying individuals with CD4 counts ≤350 cells/μL was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) taking flow cytometry as the reference. RESULTS The overall agreement between VISITECT®CD4 and flow cytometry was 89.5% using venous blood and 81.5% using finger-prick blood. VISITECT®CD4 showed better performance using venous blood [sensitivity: 96.6% (95% confidence interval: 92.1%-98.9%), specificity: 70.9% (57.1%-82.4%), PPV: 89.7% (83.9%-94.0%) and NPV: 88.6% (75.4%-96.2%)] than using finger-prick blood [sensitivity: 84.8% (77.9%-90.2%), specificity: 72.7% (59.0%-83.9%), PPV: 89.1% (82.7%-93.8%) and NPV: 64.5% (51.3%-76.3%)].

94929,Moving through cancer: Setting the agenda to make exercise standard in oncology practice.,2020-10-22,"Piperacillin/tazobactam has long been a broad-spectrum 'workhorse' antibiotic but is compromised by resistance. One response is to re-partner tazobactam with cefepime, which is easier to protect, being less β-lactamase labile and to use a high dose and prolonged infusion. On this basis, Wockhardt are developing cefepime/tazobactam (WCK 4282) as a 2+2g q8h combination with 90 min infusion. We assessed the activity of this combination, with other tazobactam combinations as comparators, against 1632 Enterobacterales, 745 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 450 other non-fermenters, as submitted to the UK national reference laboratory. These were categorised by carbapenemase-gene detection and interpretive reading of phenotypes, with MICs determined by BSAC agar dilution. Although higher values may be justifiable, based on the pharmacodynamics, we reviewed results against current cefepime breakpoints. On this basis, cefepime/tazobactam was broadly active against Enterobacterales with AmpC enzymes and ESBLs, even when these had ertapenem resistance suggesting porin loss. At 8+8 mg/L, activity extended to >90% of Enterobacterales with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemases, although MICs for KPC producers belonging to the international Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 lineage were higher; MBL producers remained resistant. Cefepime/tazobactam was less active than ceftolozane/tazobactam against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with AmpC derepression or high-level efflux but achieved wider antipseudomonal coverage than piperacillin/tazobactam. Activity against other non-fermenters was species-specific. Overall, cefepime/tazobactam has a spectrum exceeding those of piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam and resembling or exceeding that of carbapenems. Used as a 'new-combination of old-agents' it has genuine potential to be 'carbapenem-sparing'.","Mushtaq, Shazad; Garello, Paolo; Vickers, Anna; Woodford, Neil; Livermore, David M",International journal of antimicrobial agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.106318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716176/,129

We aimed to identify international perceptions, attitudes, behaviours and barriers to effective obesity care in people with obesity (PwO) and healthcare professionals (HCPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS An online survey was conducted in 11 countries. Participants were adults with obesity and HCPs who were primarily concerned with direct patient care. RESULTS A total of 14 502 PwO and 2785 HCPs completed the survey. Most PwO (68%) and HCPs (88%) agreed that obesity is a disease. However, 81% of PwO assumed complete responsibility for their own weight loss and only 44% of HCPs agreed that genetics were a barrier. There was a median of three (mean, six) years between the time PwO began struggling with excess weight or obesity and when they first discussed their weight with an HCP. Many PwO were concerned about the impact of excess weight on health (46%) and were motivated to lose weight (48%). Most PwO (68%) would like their HCP to initiate a conversation about weight and only 3% were offended by such a conversation. Among HCPs, belief that patients have little interest in or motivation for weight management may constitute a barrier for weight management conversations. When discussed, HCPs typically recommended lifestyle changes; however, more referrals and follow-up appointments are required. CONCLUSIONS Our international dataset reveals a need to increase understanding of obesity and improve education concerning its physiological basis and clinical management. Realization that PwO are motivated to lose weight offers an opportunity for HCPs to initiate earlier weight management conversations.","Caterson, Ian D; Alfadda, Assim A; Auerbach, Pernille; Coutinho, Walmir; Cuevas, Ada; Dicker, Dror; Hughes, Carly; Iwabu, Masato; Kang, Jae-Heon; Nawar, Rita; Reynoso, Ricardo; Rhee, Nicolai; Rigas, Georgia; Salvador, Javier; Sbraccia, Paolo; Vázquez-Velázquez, Verónica; Halford, Jason C G","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.13752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31032548/,129

RECENT FINDINGS Minimally invasive surgery has become a standard of care for the treatment of many benign and malignant gynaecological conditions. Recent advances in conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery have favorably impacted the entire spectrum of gynaecological surgery. With the goal of improving morbidity and cosmesis, continued efforts towards refinement of laparoscopic techniques have lead to minimization of size and number of ports required for these procedures. LESS surgery is a recently proposed surgical term used to describe various techniques that aim at performing laparoscopic surgery through a single, small-skin incision concealed within the umbilicus. In the last 5 years, there has been a surge in the developments in surgical technology and techniques for LESS surgery, which have resulted in a significant increase in utilisation of LESS across many surgical subspecialties. Recently published outcomes data demonstrate feasibility, safety and reproducibility for LESS in gynaecology. The contemporary LESS literature, extent of gynaecological procedures utilising these techniques and limitations of current technology will be reviewed in this manuscript. CONCLUSIONS LESS surgery represents the newest frontier in minimally invasive surgery.

96122,Common systemic medications that every optometrist should know.,2021-08-18,"BACKGROUND Anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation can lead to impaired lung. Intraoperative positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should prevent intratidal recruitment/derecruitment without causing overdistension. The intratidal compliance profile indicates both unwanted phenomena. We hypothesized that a higher than usual PEEP improves the intratidal compliance and the regional lung ventilation of patients with healthy lungs. METHODS After ethics approval, 30 adult patients scheduled for limb surgery were investigated at PEEP 5, 7 and 9 cm H2 O during mechanical ventilation. We calculated the dynamic compliance of the respiratory system (CRS ) and the intratidal volume-dependent CRS curve. The CRS curve indicated intratidal recruitment/derecruitment and/or overdistension. Regional ventilation was measured using electrical impedance tomography. RESULTS At PEEP 5, 7 and 9 cm H2 O, intratidal recruitment/derecruitment was observed in 92%, 84% and 46% (P < 0.05) of the patients respectively. Increasing PEEP was associated with recruitment in the dorsal regions of the lungs (P < 0.001). At PEEP 9 cm H2 O, lung overdistension was indicated in two patients. With PEEP levels up to 9 cm H2 O, no significant effects on haemodynamic variables were found. CONCLUSION We conclude that in most patients, the often applied PEEP of 5 cm H2 O is insufficient to prevent intratidal recruitment/derecruitment and that few patients show overdistension at high PEEP levels. To establish optimal pressure-volume relationships in the respiratory system, the analysis of the individual intratidal compliance profiles could be a means for individualized perioperative PEEP titration.","Wirth, S; Kreysing, M; Spaeth, J; Schumann, S",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.12767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27405798/,129

The present study aimed to investigate unique expression profiles of circRNAs in colon tissues of Crohn's disease (CD) and search novel biomarkers for the diagnosis. METHODS Differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs in biopsies from four CD patients, four ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and four healthy controls (HC) were screened by microarray. Hsa_circ_0062142 and hsa_circ_0001666 were verified in another expanded validation cohort. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to predict the function of two DE circRNAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of CD.

96563,Factor and Cluster Analysis for TCM Syndromes of Real-World Metabolic Syndrome at Different Age Stage.,2020,"Carers of veterans tend to put their own physical and psychological well-being needs behind the needs of the person they are caring for and often do not seek assistance for their own physical and psychological well-being. Combined, these factors lead to increased risk of acute and chronic illness and mental health issues. It is acknowledged that physical activity independently contributes to improved physical and mental health and may be a driver for mental well-being in carers. The aim of this pilot research was to understand how movement behaviour and health behaviours of carers of veterans in Australia relate to carers' physical and psychological well-being. Assessment occurred between February and July 2019 and included objective, validated measures to examine physical and psychological well-being. To assess the association between physical and psychological factors, correlational analyses were performed. Twenty-eight carers participated in the pilot study (96% female, mean age 61.6 years). Exercise capacity varied, and 84% of carers met the recommended 150 min of physical activity per week, with carers spending 8.6% of their time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; and 37.9% of the day sedentary. Psychological health outcomes reflect a population with high distress levels and lower than average mental well-being, but with normal resilience scores. Carers with higher levels of resilience had greater exercise capacity, covering further distance in the 6-min walk test, and as resilience increased, number of sedentary bouts decreased. This research demonstrates that there is a relationship between health behaviours and psychological well-being in carers of veterans and serving personnel. Based on the findings of this pilot study, programmes to support family carers should include information about physical activity, reducing sedentary time, and increasing resilience. Interventions designed to improve physical and psychological well-being should be trialled and evaluated for effectiveness.","Post, Dannielle; van Agteren, Joep; Kasai, Daiki; Barrett, Alison; Doyle, Matthew; Kernot, Jocelyn; Baker, Amy; Parfitt, Gaynor",Health & social care in the community,https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046983/,129

HS GAGs display a wide range of critical biological functions, particularly in cell signaling. HS is composed of repeating units of 1 → 4 glucosidically linked uronic acid and glucosamine residues. Heparin, a pharmacologically important version of HS, having higher sulfation and a higher content of iduronic acid than HS, is a widely used clinical anticoagulant. However, due to their heterogeneity and complex structure, HS and heparin are very challenging to analyze, limiting biological studies and even resulting in safety concerns in their therapeutic application. Therefore, reliable methods of structural analysis of HS and heparin are critically needed. In addition to the structural analysis of heparin, its concentration in blood needs to be closely monitored to avoid complications such as thrombocytopenia or hemorrhage caused by heparin overdose.

However, in many developing countries, nutritional and epidemiological transitions are contributing to surging overnutrition, which, together with prevalent undernutrition, is resulting in the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) among adolescents. Schools as social systems have tremendous but mostly underutilized capacity to facilitate change and address a range of nutritional and associated educational concerns of adolescents and young people. The main objective of this systematic review will be to describe school-based interventions that address the multiple forms of malnutrition, and synthesize their effects on nutrition and educational outcomes among adolescents (10 - 19 - years - old) from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS Comprehensive literature searches will be conducted in multiple electronic databases, including Medline (through PubMed), Embase, CENTRAL (through Cochrane Library), CINAHL, and Google Scholar. We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs including controlled before-after studies, examining the effects of nutrition interventions on nutrition and educational outcomes among adolescents in LMICs. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations and full-text articles and abstract data. The quality of the included studies will be assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's revised tool for assessing the risk of bias for RCTs and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool for controlled before-after studies and non-randomized controlled trials. DISCUSSION To maximize the power of schools as a platform to reinforce the mutually beneficial relationship between adolescent nutrition and education, it is imperative to develop and implement integrated interventions connecting schools, adolescents, parents, communities, and the health care system. The results of this systematic review may provide a comprehensive state of current knowledge on the effectiveness of school-based interventions to enable future research that maximizes the impact and efficiency of integrated approaches to tackle multiple forms of malnutrition among school-going and out-of-school adolescents.

96727,Delayed complications after flow-diverter stenting: reactive in-stent stenosis and creeping stents.,2014,"BACKGROUND Telemedicine is widely used but has uncertain value. We assessed telemedicine to further improve outcomes and reduce costs of comprehensive care (CC) for medically complex children. METHODS We conducted a single-center randomized clinical trial comparing telemedicine with CC relative to CC alone for medically complex children in reducing care days outside the home (clinic, emergency department, or hospital; primary outcome), rate of children developing serious illnesses (causing death, ICU admission, or hospital stay >7 days), and health system costs. We used intent-to-treat Bayesian analyses with neutral prior assuming no benefit. All participants received CC, which included 24/7 phone access to primary care providers (PCPs), low patient-to-PCP ratio, and hospital consultation from PCPs. The telemedicine group also received remote audiovisual communication with the PCPs. RESULTS Between August 22, 2018, and March 23, 2020, we randomly assigned 422 medically complex children (209 to CC with telemedicine and 213 to CC alone) before meeting predefined stopping rules. The probability of a reduction with CC with telemedicine versus CC alone was 99% for care days outside the home (12.94 vs 16.94 per child-year; Bayesian rate ratio, 0.80 [95% credible interval, 0.66-0.98]), 95% for rate of children with a serious illness (0.29 vs 0.62 per child-year; rate ratio, 0.68 [0.43-1.07]) and 91% for mean total health system costs (US$33 718 vs US$41 281 per child-year; Bayesian cost ratio, 0.85 [0.67-1.08]). CONCLUSION The addition of telemedicine to CC likely reduced care days outside the home, serious illnesses, other adverse outcomes, and health care costs for medically complex children.","Mosquera, Ricardo A; Avritscher, Elenir B C; Pedroza, Claudia; Lee, Kyung Hyun; Ramanathan, Supriya; Harris, Tomika S; Eapen, Julie C; Yadav, Aravind; Caldas-Vasquez, Maria; Poe, Michelle; Martinez Castillo, Diana J; Harting, Matthew T; Ottosen, Madelene J; Gonzalez, Teddy; Tyson, Jon E",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-050400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462343/,129

97217,Clinical outcomes of transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery for hypopharyngeal and supraglottic cancer.,2017,"Introduction Ginsenoside Rh2, purified from the Panax ginseng root, has been demonstrated to possess anticancer properties against various cancerous cells including colorectal, breast, skin, ovarian, prostate, and liver cancerous cells. However, the poor bioavailability, low stability on gastrointestinal systems, and fast plasma elimination limit further clinical applications of Ginsenoside Rh2 for cancer treatments. In this study, a novel formulation of niosomal Ginsenoside Rh2 was prepared using the thin film hydration technique. Methods The niosomal formulation contained Span 60 and cholesterol, and cationic lipid DOTAP was evaluated by determining particle size distribution, encapsulation efficiency, the polydispersity index (PDI), and surface morphology. The cytotoxic effects of free Ginsenoside Rh2 and Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomes were determined using the MTT method in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. For the investigation of the in vitro cellular uptake of Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosome, two formulations were prepared: the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula containing 5% DOTAP and the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded niosomal formula without DOTAP. Results The mean size, DPI, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency of the Ginsenoside Rh2-loaded nanoniosomal formulation containing DOTAP were 93.5±2.1 nm, 0.203±0.01, +4.65±0.65, and 98.32% ±2.4, respectively. The niosomal vesicles were found to be round and have a smooth surface. The release profile of Ginsenoside Rh2 from niosome was biphasic. Furthermore, a two-fold reduction in the Ginsenoside Rh2 concentration was measured when Ginsenoside Rh2 was administered in a nanoniosomal form compared to free Ginsenoside Rh2 solutions in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line. After storage for 90 days, the encapsulation efficiency, vesicle size, PDI, and zeta potential of the optimized formulation did not significantly change compared to the freshly prepared samples. The cellular uptake experiments of the niosomal formulation demonstrated that by adding DOTAP to the niosomal formulation, the cellular uptake was enhanced. Discussion The enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxic activity of the Ginsenoside Rh2 nanoniosomal formulation on the PC3 cell make it an attractive candidate for application as a nano-sized delivery vehicle to transfer Ginsenoside Rh2 to cancer cells.","Zare-Zardini, Hadi; Alemi, Ashraf; Taheri-Kafrani, Asghar; Hosseini, Seyed Ahmad; Soltaninejad, Hossein; Hamidieh, Amir Ali; Haghi Karamallah, Mojtaba; Farrokhifar, Majid; Farrokhifar, Mohammad","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s261027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884236/,129

97470,Suppression of somatosensory stimuli during motor planning may explain levels of balance and mobility after stroke.,2018,"In response to good-intentioned efforts to correct the traditional undertreatment of pain, opioid prescribing experienced a dramatic increase over the past decade. But there is now concern that the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction, with a rise in morbidity and mortality associated with prescription opioid misuse and abuse. Yet despite potential problems, opioids are a mainstay for the treatment of pain and are an important component of a comprehensive pain management strategy. Therefore, the overall goal of pain management is to decrease pain and to improve patient functioning and quality of life, while monitoring for adverse effects or aberrant behaviors. That is, to balance effective chronic pain management with appropriate use of opioids. Toward this end, several abuse deterrent strategies (formulations) have been, and continue to be, developed. Several major ones are reviewed here. These products should be a first step in trying to address diversion and abuse in a manner that does not discriminate against any particular patient and aligns with universal prescribing precautions. They should also comprise only one aspect of an overall opioid risk management plan.","Taylor, Robert; Raffa, Robert B; Pergolizzi, Joseph V",Therapeutic advances in drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1177/2042098614526769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083268/,129

Few techniques have been described to guide operators in these particular situations. In this case report of a 56-year-old woman with a 16 mm ophthalmic artery aneurysm, the microcatheter continually snagged the distal aneurysm lip, preventing delivery of a flow diverter into the distal parent vessel. In troubleshooting this obstacle, a second microguidewire was introduced alongside the microcatheter and was used to cover the distal lip of the aneurysm to prevent further snagging. The second guidewire successfully deflected the microcatheter into the distal vessel, a technique that we have aptly dubbed the 'bumper technique'.","Kellner, Christopher P; Chartrain, Alexander G; Schwegel, Claire; Oxley, Thomas J; Shoirah, Hazem; Mocco, J",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2016-012872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249880/,129
98178,The Raven.,2018,"BACKGROUND This randomized clinical trial compared early outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and conventional surgery for varicose veins. METHODS Consecutive patients with symptomatic varicose veins due to isolated great saphenous vein (GSV) incompetence and suitable for RFA were randomized to either RFA or conventional surgery (saphenofemoral disconnection and stripping). Clinical, radiological and patient-based outcomes were recorded at 1 and 5 weeks after intervention. RESULTS RFA resulted in successful obliteration of the GSV in all 47 patients. Complete above-knee stripping was unsuccessful in seven of 41 patients. RFA took longer than conventional surgery: median interquartile range 76 (67-84) versus 48 (39-54) min; P < 0.001. Patients returned to their normal activities significantly earlier after RFA (median 3 (2-5) versus 12.5 (4-21) days; P < 0.001). Postoperative pain was significantly less after RFA (median score on visual analogue scale 1.70 (0.50-4.30) versus 4.0 (2.35-6.05); P = 0.001). Patient satisfaction, quality of life improvement and analgesic requirements significantly favoured RFA. CONCLUSION RFA took longer to perform but resulted in a significantly better early outcome than conventional surgery in suitable patients with great saphenous varicose veins.","Subramonia, S; Lees, T",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.6867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20035541/,129

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in 2003 in Southeast Asia and rapidly spread around the world before it was controlled by public health intervention strategies. The 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak represents another prime example of virus emergence from a zoonotic reservoir. Here, we review the current knowledge of coronavirus cross-species transmission, with particular focus on MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is still circulating in the human population, and the mechanisms governing its cross-species transmission have been only partially elucidated, highlighting a need for further investigation. We discuss biochemical determinants mediating MERS-CoV host cell permissivity, including virus spike interactions with the MERS-CoV cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and evolutionary mechanisms that may facilitate host range expansion, including recombination, mutator alleles, and mutational robustness. Understanding these mechanisms can help us better recognize the threat of emergence for currently circulating zoonotic strains.","Peck, Kayla M; Burch, Christina L; Heise, Mark T; Baric, Ralph S",Annual review of virology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-100114-055029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958908/,129

A complete energy framework analysis using the HF/3-21G energy model was performed which found that dispersion forces and C-H...O interactions are responsible for the crystal structure features. The magnetic properties of the complexes show a weak magnetic exchange between spins, resulting in low exchange constants of -2.72 (1) cm-1 and -1.10 (1) cm-1 for complexes (2) and (3), respectively. This results from the low overlap between magnetic orbitals induced by 3,5-dinitrobenzoate bridges and the arrangement of the magnetic orbitals. Consequently, the dinuclear complexes (2) and (3) behave as spin-isolated multinuclear CuII species in contrast to the trinuclear complex with similar ligands.","Torres, Juan F; Bello-Vieda, Nestor J; Macías, Mario A; Rabelo, Renato; Lloret, Francisco; Muñoz-Castro, Alvaro; Hurtado, John J","Acta crystallographica Section B, Structural science, crystal engineering and materials",https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052520620001225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831220/,129
98880,Countermeasures for preventing and treating opioid overdose.,2020-10-28,"OBJECTIVE Existing simulators for off-pump coronary artery (CA) bypass grafting training are unable to provide cardiac surgery residents all necessary skills they need entering the operation room. In this study, we introduced a secure and high-fidelity live animal model to supplement the in vitro simulators for off-pump CA bypass grafting training. DESIGN The left internal thoracic artery (ITA) of 3 Chinese miniature pigs was grafted to the left anterior descending CA using an end-to-side anastomosis. The free segment of the ITA was fixed on the ventricle surface, making it a simulative CA beating in synchrony with the heart. A total of 6 to 8 training anastomoses were made on each ITA. SETTING Animal Experiment Center in Fuwai Hospital. PARTICIPANTS In total, 19 resident surgeons with at least 3 years of cardiac surgery work experience were trained using the new model. Their performances were recorded and reviewed. RESULTS Simulative coronary arteries were successfully constructed in all 3 animals with no adverse event observed. A total of 19 anastomoses were then completed, 1 pig of 7 anastomoses and the other 2 animals of 6 anastomoses. Time consumption for the anastomosis was 782 ± 107 seconds. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 10/19 procedures. The most frequency site (7/10) was at the toe of the anastomosis. Further, the most common cause was uneven spacing or small margin of the stitches or both. Emergencies occurred during the training process included hypotension (7 procedures), tachyarrhythmia (4 procedures), and low blood oxygen saturation (1 procedure). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of our new live pig model in training resident surgeons. The simulative arteries can be easily accomplished and were long enough to place at least 6 anastomoses. Both on lumen diameter and motion status, they were proven to be a good substitution of the CA.","Liu, Xiaopeng; Yang, Yan; Meng, Qiang; Sun, Jiakang; Luo, Fuliang; Cui, Yongchun; Zhang, Hong; Zhang, Dong; Tang, Yue",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2016.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27168385/,129

The self-administered Italian version questionnaire was created using Google Forms and posted on chats and social networks.The mood of participants before and during the quarantine was assessed using a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = no wellbeing; 10 = total wellbeing). Couples' quality of life and their reproductive desire were evaluated.Results: 1482 respondents were included: 944 women (63.7%) and 538 men (36.3%). A significant trend toward reduced mean wellbeing scores during the quarantine, compared to before, was found (p < .01). From 18.1% participants who were planning to have a child before the pandemic, 37.3% abandoned the intention, related to worries of future economic difficulties (58%) and consequences on pregnancy (58%). Of 81.9% who did not intend to conceive, 11.5% revealed a desire for parenthood during quarantine than before (p < .01), related to will for change (50%) and need for positivity (40%). 4.3% of these actually tried to get pregnant. Stratifying by age, a trend toward older ages was found in the desire for parenthood before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .05).Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic is impacting on the desire for parenthood. It is unknown whether these findings will result in a substantial modification of birth rate in the near future.","Micelli, Elisabetta; Cito, Gianmartin; Cocci, Andrea; Polloni, Gaia; Russo, Giorgio Ivan; Minervini, Andrea; Carini, Marco; Natali, Alessandro; Coccia, Maria Elisabetta",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1080/0167482x.2020.1759545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32379999/,129
99145,Immune responses in COVID-19 and potential vaccines: Lessons learned from SARS and MERS epidemic.,2020-02-27,"PURPOSE To determine if a polyester cuff offered benefit in jugular small-bore central catheters (SBCCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive a 5-F single- or 6-F dual-lumen SBCC with (n = 42) or without (n = 42) a polyester cuff. Follow-up was performed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months or at catheter removal, whichever came first. At scheduled follow-up, catheter function, patient satisfaction, and infection were determined. At catheter removal, tip culture was performed to determine colonization and jugular vein patency was determined with ultrasonography (US). RESULTS The overall infection rate was 0.4 per 1,000 catheter days. There was one clinical infection (noncuffed catheter). Colonization occurred in two noncuffed catheters and one cuffed catheter. There was one catheter dislodgment in the noncuffed group and none in the cuffed group. Cuffed catheters were no more difficult to insert but took slightly longer to remove (6 minutes +/- 4.7 vs 5 minutes +/- 3, P = .39) and often required local anesthesia for removal, whereas noncuffed catheters did not (41% vs 0%, P = .001). Partial (two cuffed, 0 noncuffed) or complete (two cuffed, one noncuffed) jugular thrombosis was seen on five of 58 completion US studies (8.6%). CONCLUSIONS A polyester cuff on a SBCC confers no significant benefit in short-term colonization rates. Infection in SBCCs is uncommon. Despite their small diameters, SBCCs can result in jugular thrombosis, an important consideration in any patient requiring long-term venous access.","Trerotola, Scott O; Patel, Aalpen A; Shlansky-Goldberg, Richard D; Solomon, Jeffrey A; Mondschein, Jeffrey I; Stavropoulos, S William; Soulen, Michael C; Itkin, Maxim; Chittams, Jesse",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2009.10.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20036147/,129

99438,Phrenic nerve study as outcome in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,2021-03-08,"INTRODUCTION Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) are two key populations (KPs) in Thailand at high risk for HIV. Uptake and scale-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among them has been slow. We used data from Princess PrEP, Thailand's largest KP-led PrEP programme, to operationalize PrEP service cascades. We identified gaps and pointed out where additional data are needed to inform a larger HIV prevention cascade. METHODS Numbers of people tested for HIV, tested HIV negative, eligible for PrEP (defined as any of the following in the past three months: condomless sex with partners of unknown/uncertain HIV status or antiretroviral treatment or viral load status, multiple partners, engaging in sex work, sexually transmitted infections, injecting drugs, using amphetamine-type stimulants, or repeated use of post-exposure prophylaxis), offered PrEP and accepted PrEP during January to November 2019 were retrieved from Princess PrEP database to inform PrEP service cascades for MSM and TGW. Reasons for not accepting PrEP were documented. RESULTS Of 6287 MSM who received HIV testing in Princess PrEP, 92.3% were HIV negative and 70.2% of them were eligible for PrEP. PrEP was offered to 94.7% of those eligible and 48.0% of those offered accepted it. Among 900 TGW who had HIV testing, 95.3% tested HIV negative and 64.8% of them met PrEP eligibility criteria. Of these, 95.0% were offered PrEP and 43.9% of them accepted it. Among MSM and TGW who met PrEP eligibility criteria, no or low-HIV-risk perception was the most common reason provided (46.7% of 2007 MSM and 41.9% of 296 TGW) for not accepting PrEP. CONCLUSIONS PrEP service cascades from the Princess PrEP programme identified no or low-risk perception as key barrier to PrEP acceptance among MSM and TGW who met PrEP eligibility criteria. More implementation research studies are needed to explore PrEP motivation and access in larger communities outside of clinical services. This is to identify gaps and strategies to address them within motivation, access and effective use domains of the HIV prevention cascade.","Ramautarsing, Reshmie A; Meksena, Ratchadaporn; Sungsing, Thanthip; Chinbunchorn, Tanat; Sangprasert, Theeranat; Fungfoosri, Orawan; Meekrua, Dusita; Sumalu, Saman; Pasansai, Thapana; Bunainso, Witwasin; Wongsri, Tashada; Mainoy, Nuttakrit; Colby, Donn; Avery, Matthew; Mills, Stephen; Vannakit, Ravipa; Phanuphak, Praphan; Phanuphak, Nittaya",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602660/,129

METHODS The authors searched the published literature from different databases (PubMed, Ovid SP and EMBASE) and also tried to acquire information from the unpublished literature about the prevalence of cerebral palsy. They screened prospective/retrospective, cross-sectional, and cohort studies of children with cerebral palsy in the Indian population. Data were extracted from the included studies, and quality assessment was performed. Data were analysed using STATA MP12 (Texas, College Station). RESULTS Of the 862 publications searched, eight studies were qualified and included for quantitative analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of cerebral palsy per 1000 children surveyed was 2.95 (95% CI 2.03-3.88). Sub-group analysis for rural, urban and mixed rural-urban study population demonstrated the pooled prevalence as 1.83 (95% CI 0.41-3.25), 2.29 (95% CI 1.43-3.16) and 4.37 (95% CI 2.24-6.51) respectively. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review observed a paucity of high-quality, prevalence studies of cerebral palsy in India, which is a limitation to estimate the inferences for a national estimate. The observed prevalence of cerebral palsy in India is near similar to global estimates. There is a need to re-allocate resources and revisit the implementation of the existing policies for the prevention and management of cerebral palsy, taking into account the current disease burden.","Chauhan, Anil; Singh, Manvi; Jaiswal, Nishant; Agarwal, Amit; Sahu, Jitendra Kumar; Singh, Meenu",Indian journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-019-03024-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31300955/,129

Psychological support.,2020-06-30,"OBJECTIVE To study the pharmacological mechanism of Guanxin II formula (II) for treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OB⩾30%, DL⩾0.18, and HL ⩾4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD.

We analyse the critical challenges remaining in using LCA and propose improvements needed to resolve future development challenges. Biobased systems are often complex combinations of technologies and practices that are geographically dispersed over long distances and with heterogeneous and uncertain sets of indicators and impacts. Recent studies have provided methodological suggestions on how LCA can be improved for evaluating the sustainability of biobased systems with a new focus on emerging systems, helping to identify environmental and social opportunities prior to large R&D investments. However, accessing economies of scale and improved conversion efficiencies while maintaining compatibility across broad ranges of sustainability indicators and public acceptability remain key challenges for the bioeconomy. LCA can inform, but not by itself resolve this complex dimension of sustainability. Future policy interventions that aim to promote the bioeconomy and support strategic value chains will benefit from the systematic use of LCA. However, the LCA community needs to develop the mechanisms and tools needed to generate agreement and coordinate the standards and incentives that will underpin a successful biobased transition. Systematic stakeholder engagement and the use of multidisciplinary analysis in combination with LCA are essential components of emergent LCA methods.

Mortality is reduced by 26%. VKA have a number of well-documented shortcomings which were overcome by non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Areas covered: Results of randomized trials for four NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) have been published (ARISTOTLE, RE-LY, ENGAGE, ROCKET-AF). In this review, the authors discuss the results in subgroups of patients with prior transient ischemic attacks or ischemic stroke. In aggregate, the NOACs are superior to warfarin for secondary prevention and result in a 50% reduction in intracerebral hemorrhage. Apixaban was superior to aspirin in the AVERROES trial and had a similar rate of major bleeding complications. Expert opinion: NOACs add to the therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF and offer advantages over warfarin including a favorable bleeding profile and convenience of use. Aspirin should no longer be used for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF.","Diener, Hans-Christoph; Ntaios, George; O'Donnell, Martin; Easton, J Donald",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2018.1515913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30152249/,129

The known data of oxytocin receptor presence in endometrioid heterotopy smooth muscle cells give some grounds to assume oxytocin participation in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The present study objective was to evaluate oxytocin level in peripheral blood (PB) in patients with endometriosis associated pain syndrome and to estimate the efficacy of oxytocin receptor inhibitors (IOXTR) administration based on animal endometriosis model. MATERIALS AND METHODS The basic group comprised 61 patients with endometriosis associated pain syndrome, while 21 patients formed the control group. VAS, MPQ, and BBS objective tests were applied for pain syndrome evaluation. Oxytocin level in PB was measured by immunoenzyme method. After confirmation of endometriosis experimental model formation in rats and further randomization, a daily IOXTR intra-abdominal injection was performed in a dose of 0.35 mg/kg/24 h in the basic group (n = 12) or saline solution administration in the control (n = 12). On the final stage, endometrioid heterotopy size measuring was performed along with histological examination. RESULTS Oxytocin level in PB was authentically higher in patients with GE compared to the control: 51.45 (35.54-62.76) pg/mL and 27.64 (23.23-34.12) pg/mL, respectively (p<.001). Positive correlation between oxytocin PB level and pain syndrome expression was established in patients with GE: VAS (r = 0.76; p<.001), MPQ (r = 0.52; p<.001), and BBS (r = 0.57; p<.001). Based on the experimental disease model authentical decrease of endometrioid heterotopy average area was observed after IOXTR therapy compared to the control (7.3 ± 1.8 mm2 and 22.2 ± 1.2 mm2, respectively, p<.05). CONCLUSIONS The obtained results confirm the oxytocin role in the pathogenesis of endometrioid associated pain syndrome. The high efficacy of IOXTR administration based on animal model of surgically induced endometriosis allows viewing this method as a perspective therapy.","Yarmolinskaya, Maria; Khobets, Vladislav; Tral, Tatyana; Tkachenko, Natalia",Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09513590.2020.1816722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305665/,129

100748,Cytoplasmic DDX3 as prognosticator in male breast cancer.,2021-05-11,"Background Defense policy planners and countermeasure developers are often faced with vexing problems involving the prioritization of resources and efforts. This is especially true in the area of Biodefense, where each new emerging infectious disease outbreak brings with it questions regarding the causative agent's potential for weaponization. Recent experience with West Nile Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Monkeypox, and H1N1 Influenza highlights this problem. Appropriately, in each of these cases, the possibility of bioterrorism was raised, although each outbreak ultimately proved to have a natural origin. In fact, determining whether an outbreak has an unnatural origin can be quite difficult. Thus, the questions remain: could the causative agents of these and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks pose a future weaponization threat? And how great is that threat? Should precious resources be diverted from other defense efforts in order to prepare for possible hostile employment of novel diseases by belligerents? Answering such critical questions requires some form of systematic threat assessment. Methods Through extensive collaborative work conducted within NATO's Biomedical Advisory Council, we developed a scoring matrix for evaluating the weaponization potential of the causative agents of such diseases and attempted to validate our matrix by examining the reproducibility of data using known threat agents. Our matrix included 12 attributes of a potential weapon and was provided, along with detailed scoring instructions, to 12 groups of biodefense experts in 6 NATO nations. Study participants were asked to score each of these 12 attributes on a scale of 0-3: Infectivity, Infection-to-Disease Ratio (Reliability), Predictability (& Incubation Period), Morbidity & Mortality (Virulence), Ease of Large-Scale Production & Storage, Aerosol Stability, Atmospheric Stability, Ease of Dispersal, Communicability, Prophylactic Countermeasure Availability, Therapeutic Countermeasure Availability, and Ease of Detection. Reproducibility of scoring data was assessed by examining the standard deviations (SD) of mean scores. Results Our results were unexpected. Several familiar biothreat diseases such as anthrax and tularemia were judged, by our experts, to be less threatening than many others owing to a number of factors including ease of detection, lack of communicability, and the ready availability of countermeasures. Conversely, several toxins were judged by experts to have very high potential as threat agents owing, in part, to their reliability, virulence, and a lack of available countermeasures. Agreement among experts, as determined by lower SD about a mean score, was greater for more familiar threats. Discussion Our study was designed to provide a concise and east-to-apply set of criteria that could be used by NATO nations to evaluate emerging infectious disease threats with respect to their weaponization potential. Our results were unexpected. We believe that a lack of appropriate weighting factors may explain these results and suggest that future studies weigh each of the 12 proposed criteria based on the intended use of the assessment data and other situational factors. We believe that the greatest value of our study lies in a codification of the attributes of a biological weapon.","Cieslak, Theodore J; Kortepeter, Mark G; Wojtyk, Ronald J; Jansen, Hugo-Jan; Reyes, Ricardo A; Smith, James O",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usx004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29401327/,129

While most of the studies focus on respiratory outcome, the impact of SLI on the brain hasn't been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE Do SLI affect cerebral blood volume (CBV) in preterm infants? METHODS Preterm infants of gestation 28 weeks 0 days to 33 weeks 6 days with requirement for respiratory support (RS) were included in this randomized controlled pilot trial. Within the first 15 minutes after birth near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements using 'NIRO-200-NX' (Hamamatsu, Japan) were performed to evaluate changes in CBV and cerebral tissue oxygenation. Two groups were compared based on RS: In SLI group RS was given by applying 1-3 SLI (30 cmH2O for 15 s) continued by respiratory standard care. Control group received respiratory standard care only. RESULTS 40 infants (20 in each group) with mean gestational age of 32 weeks one day (±2 days) and birth weight of 1707 (±470) g were included. In the control group ΔCBV was significantly decreasing, whereas in SLI group ΔCBV showed similar values during the whole period of 15 minutes. Comparing both groups within the first 15 minutes ΔCBV showed a tendency toward different overall courses (p = 0.051). CONCLUSION This is the first study demonstrating an impact of SLI on CBV. Further studies are warranted including reconfirmation of the present findings in infants with lower gestational age. Future investigations on SLI should not only focus on respiratory outcome but also on the consequences on the developing brain.

METHODS Adult patients (≥18 years) tested positive for COVID-19 via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and admitted in Hospital Tuanku Ja'afar Seremban, Malaysia, were recruited in this study. Patients completed a questionnaire via telephone interview comprising the following details: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, general and otorhinolaryngological symptoms, onset and duration of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Patients with persistent olfactory and gustatory dysfunction at the time of the initial interview were followed-up every 3 to 5 days till resolution. RESULTS A total of 145 patients were included in our study. The mean age of patients was 43.0 ± 17.7 (range: 18-86). Fever (44.1%) and cough (39.3%) were the most prevalent general symptoms. Thirty-one patients (21.4%) reported olfactory dysfunction and 34 (23.4%) reported dysgeusia. There was a significant association between both olfactory and gustatory dysfunction (P < .001). Altered sense of smell or taste occurred before other symptoms in 7 (15.9%); concomitant in 16 (36.4%) and after in 15 (34.1%). Six patients (13.6%) reported isolated sudden-onset anosmia. The median duration of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions was 7 days. Complete recovery was achieved for 70.5% of the patients within 7 days of symptom onset. Only 6 (19.4%) of the 31 patients with olfactory dysfunction experienced nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Olfactory dysfunction was not significantly associated with nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea. Olfactory dysfunction was significantly associated with younger age (P = .002), female (P = .011), and hyperlipidemia (P = .012).

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that likely contributes to the pathogenesis of cytokine release syndrome. It is hypothesized that modulating IL-6 levels or its effects with tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, may alter the course of disease. METHODS We examined the association between tocilizumab use and intubation or death at a community hospital in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received tocilizumab with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this single-centre retrospective cohort study involving 1225 hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the probability to respiratory failure, which was measured as intubation or death, was less frequent in patients who received tocilizumab.

Additionally, the contributions of the librarians raised awareness of the roles they can take in EBP and Magnet efforts.","Willis, Christine; Daniels, Kate; Gettis, Margaret",Medical reference services quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1080/02763869.2021.1912574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970821/,129
103447,Evolving standards of care and new challenges in the management of HER2-positive breast cancer.,2020-08-19,"Bevacizumab (antivascular endothelial growth factor [anti-VEGF]) and cetuximab (antiepidermal growth factor receptor [anti-EGFR]) are approved antibodies for treatment of cancer. However, in advanced colorectal cancer, the combination fails to improve survival. As the reason for the lack of activity is unknown, our study aims to determine the effect of bevacizumab on targeting of anti-EGFR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibodies in tumors with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT imaging. Mice with subcutaneous EGFR and IGF-1R-expressing SUM149 xenografts received a single dose of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) or saline. After 4 days, mice were injected with radiolabeled cetuximab or R1507, an anti-IGF-1R antibody. A control group received a radiolabeled irrelevant IgG (hLL2). Three days later, SPECT/CT images were acquired and mice were dissected to determine the concentration of antibodies in the tissues. Tumors were analyzed immunohistochemically to determine vascular density (CD34), VEGF, EGFR and IGF-1R expression. SPECT/CT imaging revealed that bevacizumab treatment significantly reduced tumor targeting of radiolabeled cetuximab by 40% from 33.1 ± 1.1 %ID/g to 19.8 ± 5.7 %ID/g (p = 0.009) for untreated and bevacizumab-treated tumors, respectively. A similar effect was found for (111) In-R1507: tumor targeting of R1507 decreased by 35%. No significant differences in tumor uptake were observed in mice that received an irrelevant IgG. Uptake in normal organs was not altered by bevacizumab. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that vascular density decreased with 43%, whereas EGFR and IGF-1R expression was unaltered. In conclusion, bevacizumab treatment significantly reduces tumor targeting of anti-EGFR and anti-IGF-1R antibodies. This emphasizes the importance of timing and sequencing of bevacizumab in combination with other antibodies.","Heskamp, Sandra; Boerman, Otto C; Molkenboer-Kuenen, Janneke D M; Oyen, Wim J G; van der Graaf, Winette T A; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M",International journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.28046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23335047/,129
103664,Identification of Key Genes Involved in Acute Myocardial Infarction by Comparative Transcriptome Analysis.,2020,"Following abdominal wall surgery, incisions are commonly sutured, stapled, or glued together by primary intention. Developments within the field of tissue engineering have led to the use of prosthetic meshes, with over 20 million meshes implanted each year worldwide. The function of the mesh is to hold together abdominal wall incisions and repair abdominal hernias. This has been demonstrated to be highly effective in some individuals; however, some patients have experienced postoperative complications, including dehiscence with further abdominal herniation (viscera protruding through the abdominal wall). Little is currently known about why these complications occur in a subset of patients who have had prosthetic mesh implants in abdominal wall repairs; therefore, this literature review examined existing studies identified via six electronic databases. A total of 463 studies were identified, of which 13 were included in this review. The results identified that the prosthetic mesh is highly successful in a large proportion of patients who have had a had a hernia repair in a range of locations; however, the prosthetic mesh has long-term complications, with rejection being observed in a subset of patients. The reason why the prosthetic is being rejected is still largely unknown, and therefore, further investigation needs to be carried out.","Wales, Emily; Holloway, Samantha",International wound journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.12977; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30156377/,129

However, it has been associated with a high incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Because the incidence of ICH and prognostic impact of ICH were not scrutinized in general patients, we investigated the impact of ICH after EVT on functional outcome at 90 days in patients with acute LVO. METHODS RESCUE-Japan Registry 2 was a multicenter registry that enrolled 2,420 consecutive patients with acute LVO within 24 h of onset. We analyzed 1,281 patients who received EVT and compared the functional outcomes between those with and without ICH (ICH and no-ICH groups, respectively) within 24 h after EVT. We explored the factors associated with ICH and prognostic impact of symptomatic ICH (SICH) among patients with ICH. We estimated the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for good functional outcome as modified Rankin Scale scores 0-2 and mortality. We also explored the prognostic impact of symptomatic ICH (SICH) among patients with ICH. RESULTS ICH occurred in 333 patients (26.0%). Several factors such as perioperative edaravone, stent retriever, and baseline glucose were associated with development of ICH within 24 h. A good outcome was observed in 80 (24.0%) and 454 (47.9%) patients in the ICH and no-ICH groups, respectively, and the adjusted OR was 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2-0.5, p < 0.0001). Incidence of mortality within 90 days was not significantly different between the groups (adjusted OR 1.2; 95% CI: 0.7-1.9, p = 0.5). SICH was observed in 36 (10.8%) of 333 patients with ICH, and the good outcomes were 8.3 and 25.9% in patients with SICH and asymptomatic ICH (AICH), respectively (p = 0.02). Mortality at 90 days was 30.6 and 7.1% in patients with SICH and AICH, respectively (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The functional outcomes at 90 days were significantly worse in patients who developed ICH after receiving EVT for acute LVO, but the mortality was generally similar.","Kinjo, Norito; Yoshimura, Shinichi; Uchida, Kazutaka; Sakai, Nobuyuki; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Morimoto, Takeshi",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080610/,129

Approximately one third of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have neurological disorders, especially those classified as severe cases and that require mechanical ventilation. On the other hand, almost nine out of 10 patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit could not breathe spontaneously, thus requiring invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support. So far, whether early neurological disorders such as hyposmia or anosmia, dysgeusia or ageusia, headache and vertigo are significant in the progression to the severe form of the disease or whether they are related to entry to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves has not been determined. Considering the great similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and that the severity of the condition that leads to death cannot be explained solely by lung involvement, it is important to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 potential invasion to the central nervous system is partially responsible for the severe respiratory component observed in patients with COVID-19.","Grijalva-Otero, Israel",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/gmm.20000307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831327/,129
104354,Hot Topics in Safety for Pediatric Anesthesia.,2020-11-20,"The role of cilostazol after endovascular therapy (EVT) of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis for all studies reporting the outcomes of cilostazol after EVT of PAD from January 2000 through November 2018 with the outcomes of interest including primary patency, major adverse limb events (MALE), target lesion revascularization (TLR), and major amputation. We included eight studies (three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five observational studies) with a total of 3846 patients (4713 lesions). During a mean follow-up duration of 12.5 ± 5 months, the use of cilostazol was associated with higher primary patency (OR 2.28, 95% CI (1.77, 2.94), p < 0.001, I2 = 24%), lower risk of TLR (OR 0.37, 95% CI (0.26, 0.52), p < 0.001, I2 = 0%), and lower risk of major amputation (OR 0.15, 95% CI (0.04, 0.62), p = 0.008, I2 = 0%). The use of cilostazol in RCTs was associated with significantly higher odds of primary patency compared with observational studies (OR 3.37 vs 2.28, p-interaction = 0.03). After further subgroup analysis, cilostazol remained associated with higher primary patency regardless of the use of anticoagulants (warfarin) ( p-interaction = 0.49). We conclude that the use of cilostazol after EVT of femoropopliteal and iliac lesions is associated with improved primary patency and lower risk of major amputation and TLR. The favorable impact of cilostazol is independent of the use of warfarin.","Megaly, Michael; Abraham, Bishoy; Saad, Marwan; Mekaiel, Andrew; Soukas, Peter; Banerjee, Subhash; Shishehbor, Mehdi H",Vascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x19838327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31023156/,129

Furthermore, abrupt short-term fluctuations in seawater pCO2 characteristic of near-shore coastal regions and high-density aquaculture sites currently have the potential to influence organismal and community functioning by altering animal behaviour. While anti-predator responses in fishes exposed to elevated pCO2 are well documented, such responses in benthic marine invertebrates are poorly studied. We used high frequency, non-invasive biosensors to test whether or not short term (3-week) exposure to elevated pCO2 could impact behavioural responses to the threat of predation in adult Mediterranean mussels from Galicia on the northwestern coast of Spain. Predator alarm cues (crushed conspecifics) resulted in a prolonged (1 h) reduction in the degree of valve opening (-20%) but had no clear effect on overall valve movement activity, while elevated pCO2 did not affect either response. Our results add to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that the effects of end-of-century pCO2 levels on marine animal behaviour are likely weak. Nonetheless, longer-term exposures spanning multiple generations are needed to better understand how ocean acidification might impact behavioural responses to predation in marine bivalves.","Clements, Jeff C; Poirier, Luke A; Pérez, Fiz F; Comeau, Luc A; Babarro, José M F",Marine environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.105148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942209/,129

Here, we report on a novel system of cerebral perfusion targeted resuscitation. DESIGN An observational study evaluating the role of cerebral oximetry (Equanox; Nonin, Plymouth, MI, and Invos; Covidien, Mansfield, MA) as a real-time marker of cerebral perfusion and oxygen delivery together with the impact of an automated mechanical chest compression system (Life Stat; Michigan Instruments, Grand Rapids, MI) on oxygen delivery and return of spontaneous circulation following in-hospital cardiac arrest. SETTING Tertiary medical center. PATIENTS In-hospital cardiac arrest patients (n = 34). MAIN RESULTS Cerebral oximetry provided real-time information regarding the quality of perfusion and oxygen delivery. The use of automated mechanical chest compression device (n = 12) was associated with higher regional cerebral oxygen saturation compared with manual chest compression device (n = 22) (53.1% ± 23.4% vs 24% ± 25%, p = 0.002). There was a significant difference in mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation (median % ± interquartile range) in patients who achieved return of spontaneous circulation (n = 15) compared with those without return of spontaneous circulation (n = 19) (47.4% ± 21.4% vs 23% ± 18.42%, p < 0.001). After controlling for patients achieving return of spontaneous circulation or not, significantly higher mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation levels during cardiopulmonary resuscitation were observed in patients who were resuscitated using automated mechanical chest compression device (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The integration of cerebral oximetry into cardiac arrest resuscitation provides a novel noninvasive method to determine the quality of cerebral perfusion and oxygen delivery to the brain. The use of automated mechanical chest compression device during in-hospital cardiac arrest may lead to improved oxygen delivery and organ perfusion.","Parnia, Sam; Nasir, Asad; Ahn, Anna; Malik, Hanan; Yang, Jie; Zhu, Jiawen; Dorazi, Francis; Richman, Paul",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24247475/,129

It quickly spread and emerged as a global pandemic with far-reaching impacts on society. As clinical research on this novel virus emerges, there is a limited amount of data that review clinical and laboratory predictors of severe disease. We present a case of a patient with severely elevated inflammatory markers who remained clinically stable during his hospital course. CASE DISCUSSION A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency room with 11 days of persistent fevers and new-onset anterior chest tightness. He was admitted to the hospital due to a reported oxygen desaturation at home to 87% (taken by his spouse, a healthcare professional) and ambulatory oxygen desaturation down to 87%. He was noted to have severely elevated inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, and computed tomography pulmonary angiograph findings consistent with COVID-19. He remained on room air and clinically stable throughout his 3-day hospital course. While his C-reactive protein levels improved, his ferritin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate continued to elevate. He was discharged home and was symptom-free within 4 days of hospital discharge. DISCUSSION COVID-19 has proven to be a viral disease with a high transmission rate, that has caused over 100,000 deaths in the United States, thus far. The decision to admit a patient must balance the risks of transmission with the benefit of being readily available to provide urgent supportive care should the patient develop complications. Thus, there is a significant benefit to being able to predict poor outcomes. We performed a targeted review of the literature, focusing on clinical and laboratory predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19. Our case report and narrative review outline these findings within the context of our case.","Kwon, Edward; Whitlow, Nathan; Reed, Alexander",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622836/,129

SUBJECTS AND METHODS One hundred and twenty thyroid tumor patients with a difficult airway, who were undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia, were enrolled in the study. They were randomly allocated to 3 groups (n = 40 each) who underwent direct laryngoscopy (DL), SOS or GVL. The outcomes recorded were time to intubation, first-attempt success rate, mean artery pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and incidence of complications. RESULTS The mean time to intubation in the SOS group (group S; 42.4 ± 24.1 s) and the GLV group (group G; 29.8 ± 22.3 s) was significantly less than that in the DL group (group D) (68.8 ± 26.6 s). The first-attempt success rate in group S (90.0%) and group G (97.5%) was significantly higher than that in group D (75.0%; all p < 0.05). The HR and MAP at 1 min after intubation were lowest in group S (76.4 ± 9.2 beats/min and 12.9 ± 1.1 kPa), followed by group G (79.9 ± 9.3 beats/min and 13.0 ± 0.9 kPa) and then group D (90.4 ± 8.1 beats/min and 16.6 ± 1.2 kPa). The difference was statistically significant (all p < 0.05). The incidence of lip or mucosal trauma was lowest in group S, followed by group G and then group D. CONCLUSION The SOS and the GLV had advantages over the DL in the management of thyroid tumor patients with a difficult airway in terms of a shorter time to intubation, a higher first-attempt success rate and a reduced incidence of complications. Thus, a rational choice of one of these techniques may be better for the perioperative safety of thyroid tumor patients with a difficult airway.","Liu, Ling; Yue, Hui; Li, Jincheng","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",https://doi.org/10.1159/000364875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25171459/,129
105563,Monoclonal Antibody for Patients with Covid-19. Reply.,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND Between May and July 2018, four invasive Haemophilus influenzae serotype a (iHia) infections occurred in a remote Alaska community. We performed a public health response to prevent further illness and understand Hia carriage in the community. METHODS We collected oropharyngeal (OP) samples community-wide from untreated individuals to evaluate baseline carriage. Risk factor data was collected by interview. To prevent additional illness, we offered prophylactic rifampin to individuals in contact with iHia patients (contacts) and to all children aged <10 years. OP samples were collected again eight weeks post-rifampin distribution. Samples were tested using real-time PCR and culture. RESULTS At baseline, Hia was carried by 4/27 (14.8%) contacts and 7/364 (1.9%) non-contacts (p<0.01). Contacts aged <10 years were more likely to carry Hia at any timepoint (11/18, 61%) than contacts aged ≥10 years (3/34, 8.8%) or non-contacts aged <10 years (2/139, 1.4%) and ≥10 years (6/276, 2.2%)(p<0.001 for all). Hia carriers were clustered in nine households (7% of total households). At the household level, carriage was associated with households with ≥1 contact (PR=5.6, CI:1.3-21.6), crowding (PR=7.7, CI:1.1-199.5) and ≥3 tobacco users (PR=5.0, CI:1.2-19.6). Sixty-six percent (40/61) of contacts and 90% (111/124) of non-contacts aged <10 years received rifampin. Elevated carriage prevalence persisted in contacts when retested eight weeks after rifampin distribution (contacts 6/25 (24%), non-contacts 2/114 (1.8%), p<0.001).

105621,Stethoscope - An essential diagnostic tool or a relic of the past?,2021-06-26,"Ibuprofen is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, which has recently been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but its electrophysiological effects have not yet been properly studied in isolated cardiac preparations. We studied the effects of ibuprofen on action potential characteristics and several transmembrane ionic currents using the conventional microelectrode technique and the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique on cardiac preparations and enzymatically isolated ventricular myocytes. In dog (200 µM; n=6) and rabbit (100 µM; n=7) papillary muscles, ibuprofen moderately but significantly prolonged repolarization at 1 Hz stimulation frequency. In dog Purkinje fibers, repolarization was abbreviated, and maximal rate of depolarization was depressed in a frequency-dependent manner. Levofloxacin (40 µM) alone did not alter repolarization, but augmented the ibuprofen-evoked repolarization lengthening in rabbit preparations (n=7). In dog myocytes, ibuprofen (250 µM) did not significantly influence IK1, but decreased the amplitude of Ito and IKr potassium currents by 28.2% (60 mV) and 15.2% (20 mV) respectively. Ibuprofen also depressed INaL and ICa currents by 19.9% and 16.4%. We conclude that ibuprofen seems to be free from effects on AP parameters at lower concentrations. However, at higher concentrations it may alter repolarization reserve, contributing to the observed proarrhythmic risk in patients.","Pászti, Bence József; Prorok, Janos; Magyar, Tibor; Árpádffy-Lovas, Tamás; Györe, Balázs; Topál, Leila; Gazdag, Péter; Szlovák, Jozefina; Naveed, Muhammad; Jost, Norbert; Nagy, Norbert; Varró, András; Virág, László; Koncz, Istvan",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2020-0386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937079/,129
105721,Stroke: Highlights of Selected Articles.,2020-01-01,"Over the past few years, a number of new nucleic acid extraction methods and extraction platforms using chemistry combined with magnetic or silica particles have been developed, in combination with instruments to facilitate the extraction procedure. The objective of the present study was to investigate the suitability of these automated methods for the isolation of Toxoplasma gondii DNA from amniotic fluid (AF). Therefore, three automated procedures were compared to two commercialized manual extraction methods. The MagNA Pure Compact (Roche), BioRobot EZ1 (Qiagen), and easyMAG (bioMérieux) automated procedures were compared to two manual DNA extraction kits, the QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen) and the High Pure PCR template preparation kit (Roche). Evaluation was carried out with two specific Toxoplasma PCRs (targeting the 529-bp repeat element), inhibitor search PCRs, and human beta-globin PCRs. The samples each consisted of 4 ml of AF with or without a calibrated Toxoplasma gondii RH strain suspension (0, 1, 2.5, 5, and 25 tachyzoites/ml). All PCR assays were laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays, using either TaqMan or fluorescent resonance energy transfer probes. A total of 1,178 PCRs were performed, including 978 Toxoplasma PCRs. The automated and manual methods were similar in sensitivity for DNA extraction from T. gondii at the highest concentration (25 Toxoplasma gondii cells/ml). However, our results showed that the DNA extraction procedures led to variable efficacy in isolating low concentrations of tachyzoites in AF samples (<5 Toxoplasma gondii cells/ml), a difference that might have repercussions since low parasite concentrations in AF exist and can lead to congenital toxoplasmosis.","Yera, H; Filisetti, D; Bastien, P; Ancelle, T; Thulliez, P; Delhaes, L",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01164-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19846633/,129

106280,The prognostic significance of the treatment response of regional lymph nodes and the refinement of the current TNM staging system in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND Butorphanol, a synthetic opioid partial agonist analgesic, has been widely used to control perioperative pain. However, the ideal dose and availability of butorphanol for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy are not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluated the 95% effective dose (ED95) of butorphanol and sufentanil in GI endoscopy and compared their clinical efficacy, especially regarding the recovery time. METHODS The study was divided into two parts. For the first part, voluntary patients who needed GI endoscopy anesthesia were recruited to measure the ED95 of butorphanol and sufentanil needed to achieve successful sedation before GI endoscopy using the sequential method (the Dixon up-and-down method). The second part was a double-blind, randomized study. Two hundred cases of painless GI endoscopy patients were randomly divided into two groups (n = 100), including group B (butorphanol at the ED95 dose) and group S (sufentanil at the ED95 dose). Propofol was infused intravenously as the sedative in both groups. The recovery time, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, hand grip strength, fatigue severity scores, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and incidence of dizziness were recorded. RESULTS The ED95 of butorphanol for painless GI endoscopy was 9.07 μg/kg (95% confidence interval: 7.81-19.66 μg/kg). The ED95 of sufentanil was 0.1 μg/kg (95% CI, 0.079-0.422 μg/kg). Both butorphanol and sufentanil provided a good analgesic effect for GI endoscopy. However, the recovery time for butorphanol was significantly shorter than that for sufentanil (P < 0.05, group B vs. group S:21.26 ± 7.70 vs. 24.03 ± 7.80 min). CONCLUSIONS Butorphanol at 9.07 μg/kg was more effective than sufentanil for GI endoscopy sedation and notably reduced the recovery time.

106360,Laparoscopic gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer: initial Egyptian experience at the National Cancer Institute.,2020-02-18,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Despite its crucial role in protection against viral infections, mucosal immunity has been largely understudied in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review outlines the current evidence about the role of mucosal immune responses in the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as well as potential mucosal mechanisms of protection against (re-)infection. RECENT FINDINGS The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is most highly expressed in the upper respiratory tract and most SARS-CoV-2 shedding occurs from the upper respiratory tract. Viral shedding peaks early during infection around the onset of symptoms, before dropping rapidly in most individuals within 7 days of symptom onset, suggesting mucosal inhibition of viral infection. Serum and mucosal immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M responses were found to be strongly correlated in infected patients, whereas correlations were much weaker for immunoglobulin A (IgA). Mucosal IgA responses have been detected in infected cases in the absence of serum antibody responses, with mucosal antibody levels correlating strongly with virus neutralization. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of COVID-19 patients revealed the induction of mucosal chemokine and cytokine genes, complement pathways, Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription signaling and cytotoxic T cells. SUMMARY Although most clinical studies focus on antibodies and cellular immunity in peripheral blood, mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract play a key role in the early restriction of viral replication and the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Identification of mucosal biomarkers associated with viral clearance will allow monitoring of infection-induced immunity. Further studies are needed to understand how the systemic immunological endpoints measured in vaccination studies translate to mucosal protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Fröberg, Janeri; Diavatopoulos, Dimitri A",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899752/,129
106396,Clinical Practice Update: Expert Review on Endoscopic Bariatric Therapies.,2017,"BACKGROUND Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive monitoring technique that measures regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). OBJECTIVES The primary aim was to compare the output of 2 NIRS-based cerebral oximetry devices, FORESIGHT (CAS Medical Systems Inc, Branford, Connecticut) and INVOS (Covidien, Boulder, Colorado), to venous oxygen saturations from the jugular venous bulb at cannulation and decannulation of the superior vena cava (SVC). Secondary objectives included evaluating correlations of cerebral saturation, as measured by the NIRS devices, with mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), measured by an invasive arterial line, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). METHODS Near-infrared spectroscopy, MAP, and ETCO2 data were collected at 13 defined events during each case when hemodynamic instability was expected. At SVC cannulation and decannulation, a 0.1 mL sample of blood was collected from the jugular bulb by the surgeon using a long angiocatheter. The oxygen saturation of these blood samples was measured using an AVOX device and compared with contemporaneous readings from the NIRS probes. Mixed-effects linear regression was used to correlate MAP or ETCO2 with cerebral oxygen saturation (by NIRS) at each time point. RESULTS Children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital heart surgery (n = 34) were enrolled in the study. At SVC cannulation, both INVOS ( r = .78) and FORESIGHT ( r = .59) were correlated with AVOX data at P < .001, although the correlation with INVOS was significantly stronger ( P = .003). At SVC decannulation, INVOS ( r = .68; P < .001) and FORESIGHT ( r = .60; P < .001) were similarly correlated with jugular venous rSO2. Correlations of rSO2 (by NIRS) with MAP and ETCO2 levels were stronger than correlations between rSO2 change and change in MAP or ETCO2. CONCLUSION INVOS correlated more strongly than FORESIGHT with the jugular bulb rSO2 at SVC cannulation but may have underestimated oxygen saturation at low rSO2 values. Data from both NIRS devices were correlated with MAP and ETCO2 over the case duration.","Naguib, Aymen N; Winch, Peter D; Sebastian, Roby; Gomez, Daniel; Guzman, Luisa; Rice, Julie; Tumin, Dmitry; Galantowicz, Mark; Tobias, Joseph D",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066616663649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530512/,129

This study aimed to explore the material basis and molecular mechanism of Shenfu Decoction through network pharmacology and molecular mechanisms, to provide a research basis for clinical medication and clues for subsequent research. METHODS The active components and targets of Shenfu decoction were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), and the COVID-19-associated genes were collected using the GeneCards platform. The target protein-protein interaction network map was constructed by mapping two genes, and the ""drug-active ingredient-target"" network was constructed using Cytoscape software. The Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment of the mapping targets were analyzed. RESULT Based on Traditional Chinese medicine, Shenfu Decoction can take effect in the lung, spleen, kidney and heart. Considering oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30% and drug-like (DL) ≥ 0.18 as the standard, 43 active compounds were screened and 114 Shenfu decoction action targets were collected. The key targets were CASP3, MAPK8, PTGS2, IL1B, PPARG, ICAM1, IFNG, RELA, NOS2, NOS3, HMOX1, CASP8, STAT1, and TGFB1. According to the standard of P < 0.05, GO function was enriched in 108 biological processes, 16 cell processes and 27 molecular processes. Sixty-three signaling pathways were enriched by KEGG, which can be divided into four types: viral infection pathways, signal pathways, biological process pathways and different disease pathways. The comparison of negative and positive prescriptions further reflects the positive effect of Shenfu decoction against COVID-19. Finally, the effective ingredients with the high degree were molecular docked with Mpro, Rdrp and Spro proteins to further confirm the intervention effect of Shenfu Decoction on COVID-19. CONCLUSION Shenfu decoction played an important role in regulating the anti-virus process, regulating immunity, inhibiting inflammation and regulating apoptosis through the interrelated regulation mechanism of multi-components and multi-targets, to treat patients with severe COVID-19.","Li, Xiaoling; Lin, Haowen; Wang, Qu; Cui, Liao; Luo, Hui; Luo, Lianxiang",Drug development and industrial pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.1080/03639045.2020.1826510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054436/,129

Thanks to the large number of published data, we are beginning to understand the logic of the human response to a virus adapted to bat immunity. RECENT FINDINGS Impairment of types I and III interferon responses may facilitate the occurrence of severe COVID-19 with reduced antiviral activity associated to potent inflammation. The human T and B-cell germline repertoire contain the specificities able to react against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Although inflammation disrupts the structure of germinal centers, memory T and B cells can be found in the blood of patients after mild and severe COVID 19. SUMMARY Further studies are indispensable to better understand the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The diversity of the individual reaction may contribute to explain the clinical manifestation spectrum. Immunological memory can be demonstrated in patients, convalescent from mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19, but we do not know whether asymptomatic individuals have memory of the virus.

We developed a process including acid leaching, solvent extraction and stripping in order to recycle spent catalyst. In this study, we conducted selective recovery of molybdenum through focus on finding an optimized extraction and stripping process by comparing different extractants and stripping agents. To separate molybdenum from other metals efficiently and figure out the mechanism of extraction process, the five different extractants of methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride, tri-n-octylamine, tris(2-ethylhexyl) amine, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate and tributyl phosphate with different functional groups were examined, the extraction ability and extraction mechanism of these five extractants were systematically studied under the same system for the first time. It was found that more than 98% of the molybdenum could be extracted with an organic phase consisting of tri-n-octylamine or methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride under the optimal conditions. The result indicated that the tri-n-octylamine and methyl trioctyl ammonium chloride possess excellent molybdenum extraction ability, the extraction capacity of the rest extractants was in the order of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate > tris(2-ethylhexyl) amine > tributyl phosphate. In the stripping process, NH4OH, NaOH and H2SO4 were chosen as stripping agent to strip the molybdenum from the loaded tri-n-octylamine organic phase. the stripping ability of the three studied stripping agent were in the order NaOH > NH4OH > H2SO4. The FTIR spectra showed that the structure of tri-n-octylamine organic phase was stable during the extraction and stripping process.

108810,Major Trends in Gastroenterology and Hepatology Between 2010 and 2019: An Overview of Advances From the Past Decade Selected by the Editorial Board of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.,2020-06-23,"Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), a relative of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), causes respiratory disease in mice. There is serologic evidence suggesting widespread exposure of humans to PVM. To investigate replication in primates, African green monkeys (AGM) and rhesus macaques (n = 4) were inoculated with PVM by the respiratory route. Virus was shed intermittently at low levels by a subset of animals, suggesting poor permissiveness. PVM efficiently replicated in cultured human cells and inhibited the type I interferon (IFN) response in these cells. This suggests that poor replication in nonhuman primates was not due to a general nonpermissiveness of primate cells or poor control of the IFN response. Seroprevalence in humans was examined by screening sera from 30 adults and 17 young children for PVM-neutralizing activity. Sera from a single child (6%) and 40% of adults had low neutralizing activity against PVM, which could be consistent with increasing incidence of exposure following early childhood. There was no cross-reaction of human or AGM sera between RSV and PVM and no cross-protection in the mouse model. In native Western blots, human sera reacted with RSV but not PVM proteins under conditions in which AGM immune sera reacted strongly. Serum reactivity was further evaluated by flow cytometry using unfixed Vero cells infected with PVM or RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a measure of viral gene expression. The reactivity of human sera against RSV-infected cells correlated with GFP expression, whereas reactivity against PVM-infected cells was low and uncorrelated with GFP expression. Thus, PVM specificity was not evident. Our results indicate that the PVM-neutralizing activity of human sera is not due to RSV- or PVM-specific antibodies but may be due to low-affinity, polyreactive natural antibodies of the IgG subclass. The absence of PVM-specific antibodies and restriction in nonhuman primates makes PVM unlikely to be a human pathogen.","Brock, Linda G; Karron, Ruth A; Krempl, Christine D; Collins, Peter L; Buchholz, Ursula J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00163-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438539/,129

Although previous research indicates that food labels impact on product choice and healthiness perception, their impact on portion sizes consumed is less clear. Objective This systematic review examined whether food label information influenced portion size consumption. Data sources A search of 7 major electronic databases for studies published from 1980 to April 2016 was conducted. Data extraction Two reviewers independently screened 11 128 abstracts. Data were extracted from 32 articles (comprising 36 studies). Results Based on the test food used, the overall effects were found to be: no effect, a positive effect, or a negative effect. Labels displaying energy content (n = 15 studies, 17 effects) and fat content information (n = 13 studies, 14 effects) were evaluated most commonly, with exercise equivalent labels evaluated least (n = 2 studies, 2 effects). Conclusions Nutrition and health information presented on food labels has varying impacts on portion sizes consumed, from increased to decreased intake. Recommendations for future research include evaluating more recent food label types and achieving more consistent reporting standards.","Brown, Hannah M; Rollo, Megan E; de Vlieger, Nienke M; Collins, Clare E; Bucher, Tamara",Nutrition reviews,https://doi.org/10.1093/nutrit/nuy019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29767760/,129

Although HRSV was first identified in 1956, a preventative vaccine has yet to be developed. Here we report the results of the first study to investigate the circulation and genetic diversity of HRSV in Cambodia among an all-ages population over 5 consecutive years. The incidences of HRSV infection among all-ages outpatient and hospitalized populations were equivalent, at 9.5% and 8.2%, respectively. Infection was most prevalent among children aged <5 years, with bronchiolitis being the most frequently observed clinical syndrome in the same age group. Circulation of HRSV was seasonal, typically coinciding with the rainy season between July and November annually. Strains belonging to HRSV groups A and B were detected with equivalent frequencies; however, we observed a potentially biennial shift in the predominant circulating HRSV genotype. The majority of HRSV group B strains belonged to the recently described BA genotype, with the exception of 10 strains classified as belonging to a novel HRSV group B genotype, SAB4, first reported here.","Arnott, Alicia; Vong, Sirenda; Mardy, Sek; Chu, Simon; Naughtin, Monica; Sovann, Ly; Buecher, Carole; Beauté, Julien; Rith, Sareth; Borand, Laurence; Asgari, Nima; Frutos, Roger; Guillard, Bertrand; Touch, Sok; Deubel, Vincent; Buchy, Philippe",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01131-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21865418/,129

OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to compare the effects of Walkbot locomotor training (WLT) with conventional locomotor training (CLT) on balance and gait, cardiopulmonary and psychological functions and fall confidence in acute hemiparetic stroke. METHODS Fourteen patients with acute hemiparetic stroke were randomized into either the WLT (60-minute physical therapy +30-minute Walkbot-assisted gait training) or CLT (60 min physical therapy +30 min gait training) groups, 7 days/week over 2 weeks. Clinical outcomes included the Berg balance scale (BBS), functional ambulation category (FAC), heart rate (HR) and Borg rating of perceived exertion (BRPE), Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II), and the activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted at P < 0.05. RESULTS ANCOVA showed that WLT showed superior effects, compared to CLT, on FAC, HR, BRPE, BDI-II, and ABC scale (P < 0.05), but not on BBS (P = 0.061). CONCLUSIONS Our results provide novel, promising clinical evidence that WLT improved balance and gait function as well as cardiopulmonary and psychological functions, and fall confidence in acute stroke survivors who were unable to ambulate independently.","Park, Chanhee; Oh-Park, Mooyeon; Dohle, Carolin; Bialek, Amy; Friel, Kathleen; Edwards, Dylan; Krebs, Hermano Igo; You, Joshua Sung H",NeuroRehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.3233/nre-203086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538882/,129

METHODS Between May, 2007 and May, 2010, a total of 28 patients who had undergone elective distal pancreatectomy were evaluated for this study. Perioperative factors and the occurrence of pancreatic fistula were analyzed on the basis of International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) criteria. RESULTS There were sixteen cases of benign neoplasms and twelve cases of malignant tumors. The remnant pancreas was manually sutured with ligation of the pancreatic duct (n=14), auto-suture stapling along with manual sutures (n=12), or stapling alone (n=2). According to the ISGPF classification, morbidity and mortality associated with pancreatic fistulas was 42.9% (n=12) and 0%, respectively. These pancreatic fistulae were classified as grade A in 8 cases (28.6%), grade B in 3 cases (10.7%), and grade C in one case (3.6%). All patients with pancreatic fistula were treated conservatively. CONCLUSIONS Perioperative factors do not affect the risk of pancreatic fistula.

However, it is not clear how children's real-time interactions with peers affect their language development; nor is it clear whether these processes differ between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and two other groups of children, those with general developmental delays (DD) and typically developing (TD) children. We used objective measures of movement and vocalizations to quantify children's real-time dyadic vocal interactions and quantify classroom social networks. Participants included 56 preschoolers (22 female; M = 50.14 months) in five inclusive classrooms for children with ASD or DD and their TD peers. Each class was observed monthly on two to five occasions. Overall, children vocalized more to peers who had vocalized more to them in the previous observation. These dyadic vocalization patterns were associated with group differences in social network analyses. Modularity, the cohesiveness of group ties, was lower among children with ASD than it was among TD children or children with DD. Individually, children with ASD exhibited lower total levels of vocalizations with peers (lower degree centrality) than TD children and children with DD. In an exploratory analysis with a subset of the participants, children's degree centrality was strongly associated with their end-of-year assessed language abilities, even when accounting for mean differences between groups. Findings highlight the impact peers and social networks play in real-time language use and in the developing language abilities of children with ASD in inclusion classrooms. LAY SUMMARY: This study objectively measured associations between children's peer vocal interactions and assessed language abilities in inclusion classrooms for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their peers. All children benefited from peers talking to them, but children with ASD were less central to classroom speech networks than were typically developing children. Children's centrality to social speech networks, regardless of ASD status, was associated with assessed language abilities.","Fasano, Regina M; Perry, Lynn K; Zhang, Yi; Vitale, Laura; Wang, Jue; Song, Chaoming; Messinger, Daniel S",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938641/,129

News reports and information about the virus are rapidly changing. We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who had a seizure-like spell for which an EEG was performed. In early to mid-March, there were no clear guidelines or recommendations available from neurodiagnostic-related organizations or hospitals on how to adapt procedure workflow to those with COVID-19. When caring for COVID-19 patients, as when caring for any patient with an infectious disease, it is hospital protocol to follow contact, droplet/airborne precautions by wearing appropriate PPE. However, because we knew very little about the coronavirus, this case was different. In this article, we discuss our experience with our EEG workflow and concerns for staff exposure. We then discuss our adaptations and modifications to our standard procedures and protocols. A time analysis comparing our standard EEG protocol with our modified COVID-19 protocol revealed a significant decrease in technologist exposure time (99 minutes versus 51 minutes), which theoretically would reduce the chance of virus transmission to our technologist. At this critical moment in time, we hope such modifications will allow us to continue delivering high quality patient care while optimizing resource utilization and above all keeping our technologists safe.","Haines, Seline; Caccamo, Amy; Chan, Fonda; Galaso, German; Catinchi, Alexis; Gupta, Puneet K",The Neurodiagnostic journal,https://doi.org/10.1080/21646821.2020.1756132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32374647/,129

In addition, new developments in energy devices have significantly improved efficacy in achieving hemostasis in thyroid surgery. Few studies focused on the complication rates in energy device-assisted sutureless neuro-monitored thyroidectomy. This study investigates a novel LigaSure Small Jaw (LSJ) technique for sutureless thyroidectomy and compares the surgical complication rates between LSJ and conventional clamp-and-tie technique in one thousand consecutive neuro-monitored thyroidectomy patients. Five hundred patients received sutureless thyroidectomy performed with LSJ (Group L), and 500 patients received surgery performed with conventional clamp-and-tie technique (Group C). Complication rates of postoperative hematoma, hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy were compared between groups. The overall complication rates of hematoma, hypocalcemia (temporary/ permanent), and RLN (temporary/ permanent) palsy were 0.9%, 24.9% (24.6%/0.3%), and 1.7% (1.5%/0.2%), respectively. Group L and Group C significantly differed in postoperative hematoma rate (0.0% vs. 1.8%, respectively; p = 0.0026) and in postoperative hypocalcemia rate (20.1% vs. 30.0%, respectively; p = 0.0032). The incidence of RLN palsy did not significantly differ between Group L and Group C (1.38% vs. 2.08%; p = 0.2652). The overall surgical complication rates are low in neuro-monitored thyroidectomy. The LSJ is feasible for performing completely sutureless thyroidectomy and obtains superior outcomes of postoperative hematoma and hypocalcemia in comparison with clamp-and-tie hemostatic technique. The novel LSJ technique using double or overlapped sealing is useful for sutureless thyroidectomy. However, surgeons must carefully observe the tissue contraction that may reduce the LSJ-RLN distance and increase the risk of thermal injury during the LSJ activation.","Liu, Cheng-Hsin; Wang, Chih-Chun; Wu, Che-Wei; Lin, Yi-Chu; Lu, I-Cheng; Chang, Pi-Ying; Lien, Ching-Feng; Wang, Chien-Chung; Hwang, Tzer-Zen; Huang, Tzu-Yen; Chiang, Feng-Yu",Frontiers in endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.638608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897619/,129

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic search was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CCTR, CDSR, CINAHL and PubMed on June 7, 2017. Search terms included 3 themes: (1) robotics; (2) SCI; (3) upper extremity. Studies using robots for upper extremity rehabilitation among individuals with cervical SCI were included. Identified articles were independently reviewed by two researchers and compared to pre-specified criteria. Disagreements regarding article inclusion were resolved through discussion. The modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess article quality. Participant characteristics, study and intervention details, training outcomes, robot features, study limitations and recommendations for future studies were abstracted from included articles. RESULTS Twelve articles (one randomized clinical trial, six case series, five case studies) met the inclusion criteria. Five robots were exoskeletons and three were end-effectors. Sample sizes ranged from 1 to 17 subjects. Articles had variable quality, with quality scores ranging from 8 to 20. Studies had a low internal validity primarily from lack of blinding or a control group. Individuals with mild-moderate impairments showed the greatest improvements on body structure/function and performance-level measures. This review is limited by the small number of articles, low-sample sizes and the diversity of devices and their associated training protocols, and outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence suggests robot-assisted interventions are safe, feasible and can reduce active assistance provided by therapists. Implications for rehabilitation Robot-assisted upper extremity training for individuals with cervical spinal cord injury is safe, feasible and can reduce hands-on assistance provided by therapists.

METHODS All PD patients who had undergone QSM MRI for presurgical deep brain stimulation (DBS) planning were eligible for inclusion in this study. The entire STN and its three functional subdivisions, as well as the adjacent white matter (WM), were segmented and measured. The QSM value difference between the entire STN and adjacent WM (STN-WM), between the limbic and associative regions of the STN (L-A), and between the associative and motor regions of the STN (A-M) were obtained as measures of gradient and were input into an unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm to automatically categorize the overall boundary distinctness between the STN and adjacent WM and between STN subdivisions (gradient blur [GB] and gradient sharp [GS] groups). Statistical tests were performed to compare clinical and image measurements for discrimination between GB and GS groups. RESULTS Of the 39 study patients, 19 were categorized into the GB group and 20 into the GS group, based on quantitative cluster analysis. The GB group had a significantly higher presurgical off-medication Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III score (51.289 ± 20.741) than the GS group (38.5 ± 16.028; p = 0.037). The GB group had significantly higher QSM values for the STN and its three subdivisions and adjacent WM than those for the GS group (p < 0.01). The GB group also demonstrated a significantly higher STN-WM gradient in the right STN (p = 0.01). The GB group demonstrated a significantly lower L-A gradient in both the left and the right STN (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Advancing PD with more severe motor impairment leads to more iron deposition in the STN and adjacent WM, as shown in the QSM signal. Loss of the STN inner QSM signal gradient should be considered as an image marker for more severe motor impairment in PD patients.","Huang, Weiyuan; Ogbuji, Richard; Zhou, Liangdong; Guo, Lingfei; Wang, Yi; Kopell, Brian H",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.5.jns201163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764171/,129
111233,Academic collaborations with industry: lessons for the future.,2020-11-09,"The UK government has put lateral flow antigen tests (LFATs) at the forefront of its strategy to scale-up testing in the coronavirus pandemic. However, evidence from a pilot trial using an LFAT to identify asymptomatic infections in the community suggested that the test missed over half of the positive cases in the tested population. This raises the question of whether it can be ethical to use an inaccurate test to guide public health measures. We begin by explicating different dimensions of test accuracy (sensitivity, specificity and predictive value), and why they matter morally, before highlighting key data from the Liverpool pilot. We argue that the poor sensitivity of the LFAT in this pilot trial suggests that there are important limitations to what we can expect these tests to achieve. A test with low sensitivity will provide false-negative results, and in doing so generate the risk of false assurance and its attendant moral costs. However, we also suggest that the deployment of an insensitive but specific test could identify many asymptomatic carriers of the virus who are currently being missed under existing arrangements. Having outlined ways in which the costs of false reassurance could potentially be mitigated, we conclude that the use of an insensitive LFAT in mass testing may be ethical if (1) it is used predominantly to identify positive cases, (2) it is a cost-effective method of achieving that goal and (3) if other public health tools can effectively prevent widespread false reassurance.","Pugh, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Dominic; Savulescu, Julian",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820853/,129

A total of 5,089 patients (median age 36 years, 52% female) underwent surgery (total follow-up 19,404 patient-years). The annual rate of the composite outcome was 4.2% (95% CI 2.9 to 5.7; 46 cohorts; I2 = 93%), which was higher in cohorts reporting exclusively brainstem CCM (6.0%, 95% CI 4.1-8.3; 25 cohorts, I2 = 92%) versus predominantly supratentorial CCM (2.4%, 95% CI 1.3-3.8, 21 cohorts, I2 = 86%, phet = 0.001). The annual rate of the composite outcome was higher in cohorts with > 95% presenting with ICH (6.1%, 95% CI 4.2-8.4; 23 cohorts, I2 = 93%) versus others (2.3%, 95% CI 1.2-3.7; 23 cohorts, I2 = 83%, phet = 0.001). The incidence of the composite outcome did not change over time in cohorts of exclusively brainstem CCM (p = 0.7) or predominantly supratentorial CCM (p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS The risk of death, ICH, or FND after CCM excision is ~ 4%. This risk is higher for brainstem CCM and CCM that have caused ICH but has not changed over time.

An expert consensus paper from the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO).,2016,"Persistent atrial flutter (AFL) in left ventricular assist device (LVAD) recipients can result in loss of AV synchrony, impaired ventricular filling and right heart failure (RHF). The authors report the largest series of HeartMate II (HMII) patients who developed AFL with decompensated RHF, which successfully resolved with AFL ablation. Eight patients with HMII LVAD (mean age, 57±12 years) had medically refractory AFL, with 7 developing de novo AFL after LVAD implant (onset range, 2 days-22 months post-implant). Three patients developed recurrent syncope, 2 had inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, and 6 had new or escalating need for inotropes. All had features of decompensated RHF. Seven patients underwent electrophysiology testing where mapping confirmed typical counterclockwise AFL (mean AFL cycle length, 252±49 ms) and radiofrequency ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus restored sinus rhythm in all patients. Complete resolution of symptoms and signs of RHF with improved quality of life were noted in all. No procedural complications were noted. During a mean follow-up of 9±5 months, all patients remained free of atrial flutter. Catheter ablation of AFL in LVAD patients is safe and highly effective, resulting in immediate and significant improvement in symptoms of RHF, and should be considered first-line therapy for AFL in these patients.","Hottigoudar, Rashmi U; Deam, Allen G; Birks, Emma J; McCants, Kelly C; Slaughter, Mark S; Gopinathannair, Rakesh",Congestive heart failure,https://doi.org/10.1111/chf.12034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910701/,129
112537,Technical Considerations in Pedicle Management in Upper and Midfacial Free Flap Reconstruction.,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND Elective freezing of all good quality embryos and transfer in subsequent cycles, i.e. elective frozen embryo transfer (eFET), has recently increased significantly with the introduction of the GnRH agonist trigger protocol and improvements in cryo-techniques. The ongoing discussion focuses on whether eFET should be offered to the overall IVF population or only to specific subsets of patients. Until recently, the clinical usage of eFET was supported by only a few randomized controlled trials (RCT) and meta-analyses, suggesting that the eFET not only reduced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), but also improved reproductive outcomes. However, the evidence is not unequivocal, and recent RCTs challenge the use of eFET for the general IVF population. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at evaluating whether eFET is advantageous for reproductive, obstetric and perinatal outcomes compared with fresh embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI cycles. Additionally, we evaluated the effectiveness of eFET in comparison to fresh embryo transfer in different subgroups of patients undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles. SEARCH METHODS We conducted a systematic review, using PubMed/Medline and EMBASE to identify all relevant RCTs published until March 2018. The participants included infertile couples undergoing IVF/ICSI with or without preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A). The primary outcome was the live birth rate (LBR), whereas secondary outcomes were cumulative LBR, implantation rate, miscarriage, OHSS, ectopic pregnancy, preterm birth, pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, mean birthweight and congenital anomalies. Subgroup analyses included normal and hyper-responder patients, embryo developmental stage on the day of embryo transfer, freezing method and the route of progesterone administration for luteal phase support in eFET cycles. OUTCOMES Eleven studies, including 5379 patients, fulfilling the inclusion criteria were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. A significant increase in LBR was noted with eFET compared with fresh embryo transfer in the overall IVF/ICSI population [risk ratio (RR) = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.24]. Subgroup analyses indicated higher LBRs by eFET than by fresh embryo transfer in hyper-responders (RR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05-1.28) and in PGT-A cycles (RR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.14-2.10). However, no differences were observed for LBR in normo-responders (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.91-1.17); moreover, the cumulative LBR was not significantly different in the overall population (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.97-1.11). Regarding safety, the risk of moderate/severe OHSS was significantly lower with eFET than with fresh embryo transfer (RR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.19-0.96). In contrast, the risk of pre-eclampsia increased with eFET (RR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.03-3.09). No statistical differences were noted in the remaining secondary outcomes. WIDER IMPLICATIONS Although the use of eFET has steadily increased in recent years, a significant increase in LBR with eFET was solely noted in hyper-responders and in patients undergoing PGT-A. Concerning safety, eFET significantly decreases the risk of moderate and severe OHSS, albeit at the expense of an increased risk of pre-eclampsia.","Roque, Matheus; Haahr, Thor; Geber, Selmo; Esteves, Sandro C; Humaidan, Peter",Human reproduction update,https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmy033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30388233/,129

113094,Is albuminuria related to later cancer in subjects with diabetes ?,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND Chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) each have characteristic advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered in clinical decision-making. This point is discussed in reference to the main types of lung disease that are encountered in practice. METHOD A selective literature search was performed in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Existing clinical guidelines on the main types of lung disease and studies concerning radiological diagnosis were also con - sidered in this review. RESULTS There have been no more than a few large-scale, controlled comparative trials of different radiological techniques. Chest X-ray provides general orientation as an initial diagnostic study and is especially useful in the diagnosis of pneumonia, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Multi-detector CT affords nearly isotropic spatial resolution at a radiation dose of only 0.2-5 mSv, much lower than before. Its main indications, according to current guidelines, are tumors, acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, advanced COPD, and pneumonia in a high-risk patient. MRI is used in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and bronchial carcinoma. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a chest X-ray in outpatients with pneumonia is only 27% (gold standard, CT); in contrast, an initial, non-randomized trial of MRI in nosocomial pneumonia revealed a PPV of 95%. For the staging of mediastinal lymph nodes in bronchial carcinoma, MRI has a PPV of 88% and positron emission tomography with CT (PET/CT) has a PPV of 79%, while CT alone has a PPV of 41% (gold standard, histology). CONCLUSION The choice of radiologicalal technique for the detection, staging, follow-up, and quantification of lung disease should be based on the individual clinical options, so that appropriate treatment can be provided without excessive use of diagnostic testing.","Wielpütz, Mark O; Heußel, Claus P; Herth, Felix J F; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2014.0181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24698073/,129

Among them, pathogens such as coronaviruses [including the current pandemic agent known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] and the one causing influenza A (IAV) are highly contagious and deadly. These can evade the immune system defenses while causing a hyperinflammatory response that can damage different tissues/organs. Simultaneously targeting immunomodulatory proteins is a plausible antiviral strategy since it could lead to the discovery of indirect-acting pan-antiviral (IAPA) agents for the treatment of diseases caused by respiratory viruses. In this context, computational approaches, which are an essential part of the modern drug discovery campaigns, could accelerate the identification of multi-target immunomodulators. This perspective discusses the usefulness of computational multi-target drug discovery for the virtual screening (drug repurposing) of IAPA agents capable of boosting the immune system through the activation of the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and/or the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) while inhibiting key pro-inflammatory proteins, such as caspase-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).","Kleandrova, Valeria V; Scotti, Marcus T; Speck-Planche, Alejandro",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.2174/1568026621666211012110819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636311/,129

Photoplethysmography respiratory rate (RRp) monitoring may provide a useful alternative, but the level of agreement with capnography during PSA is unknown. We therefore investigated the level of agreement between the RRp and capnography-based RR (RRc) during PSA for UGI endoscopy. This study included patients undergoing PSA for UGI endoscopy procedures. Pulse oximetry (SpO2) and RRc were recorded in combination with Nellcor 2.0 (RRp) monitoring (Covidien, USA). Bland-Altman analysis was used to evaluate the level of agreement between RRc and RRp. Episodes of apnoea, defined as no detection of exhaled CO2 for minimal 36 s, and hypoxaemia, defined as an SpO2 < 92 %, were registered. A total of 1054 min of data from 26 patients were analysed. Bland-Altman analysis between the RRc and RRp revealed a bias of 2.25 ± 5.41 breath rate per minute (brpm), with limits of agreement from -8.35 to 12.84 brpm for an RR ≥ 4 brpm. A total of 67 apnoea events were detected. In 21 % of all apnoea events, the patient became hypoxaemic. Hypoxaemia occurred 42 times with a median length of 34 (19-141) s, and was preceded in 34 % of the cases by apnoea and in 64 % by an RRc ≥ 8 brpm. In 81 % of all apnoea events, photoplethysmography registered an RRp ≥ 4 brpm. We found a low level of agreement between capnography and the plethysmography respiratory rate during procedural sedation for UGI endoscopy. Moreover, respiratory rate derived from both the capnogram and photoplethysmogram showed a limited ability to provide warning signs for a hypoxaemic event during the sedation procedure.","Touw, Hugo R W; Verheul, Milou H; Tuinman, Pieter R; Smit, Jeroen; Thöne, Deirdre; Schober, Patrick; Boer, Christa",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-016-9890-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27236561/,129

Aims The aim of the study was to see if there is any correlation between the planning target volume (PTV) and mucositis. Settings and Design This was a single-arm prospective study. Subjects and Methods A total of forty head-and-neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation were assessed for mucositis at the 5th week. The grades of mucositis were correlated with PTVs of low risk (54 Gy) and high risk (60-66 Gy). Statistical Analysis Used The data were analyzed using the statistical software, SPSS Inc.

Independent t-test was used to compare between the two grades of toxicity. P <0.01 was considered for statistical significance. Results The mean PTVlow risk was 522cc (228-771) and PTVhigh risk was 254cc (20-780). Grade II mucositis was seen in 27 (67%) patients and Grade III in 11 (28%) patients. The mean PTVlow risk was higher for patients, who had Grade III compared to Grade II mucositis (571 vs. 517 cc, P = 0.052). Conclusions The same was seen for PTVhigh risk(367 vs. 222 cc, P = 0.017). PTV is a better predictor of mucositis, and those patients with larger PTV require close monitoring and early intervention of mucositis.","Manur, Janaki Gururajachar; Vidyasagar, Nishant",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_511_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719268/,129

DESIGN This is an institutional review board approved cohort study in patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients admitted and requiring oxygen supplementation were treated with no steroids, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. SETTING This study takes place in the ICU's at a large, tertiary, public teaching hospital serving a primarily low-income community in urban Los Angeles. PATIENTS All eligible patients admitted to the ICU for COVID-19 respiratory failure from March 1 to July 31, 2020 were included in this study. INTERVENTIONS A total of 262 patients were grouped as receiving usual care (n = 75), methylprednisolone dosed at least at 1mg/kg/day for ≥ 3 days (n = 104), or dexamethasone dosed at least at 6 mg for ≥7 days (n = 83). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS All-cause mortality within 50 days of initial corticosteroid treatment as compared to usual care was calculated. The mortality effect was then stratified based on levels of respiratory support received by the patient. In this cohort of 262 patients with severe COVID-19, all-cause mortalities in the usual care, methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone groups were 41.3%, 16.4% and 26.5% at 50 days (P < 0.01) respectively. In patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 42% lower in the methylprednisolone group than in the dexamethasone group (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI: 0.235-0.956, P = 0.0385).

115714,Is telerehabilitation effective and safe for individuals with chronic respiratory disease? - A Cochrane Review summary with commentary.,2021-08-07,"The occurrence of seizures at specific times of the day has been consistently observed for centuries in individuals with epilepsy. Electrophysiological recordings provide evidence that seizures have a higher probability of occurring at a given time during the night and day cycle in individuals with epilepsy here referred to as the seizure rush hour. Which mechanisms underlie such circadian rhythmicity of seizures? Why don't they occur every day at the same time? Which mechanisms may underlie their occurrence outside the rush hour? In this commentary, I present a hypothesis: MORE - Molecular Oscillations and Rhythmicity of Epilepsy, a conceptual framework to study and understand the mechanisms underlying the circadian rhythmicity of seizures and their probabilistic nature. The core of the hypothesis is the existence of ~24-hour oscillations of gene and protein expression throughout the body in different cells and organs. The orchestrated molecular oscillations control the rhythmicity of numerous body events, such as feeding and sleep. The concept developed here is that molecular oscillations may favor seizure genesis at preferred times, generating the condition for a seizure rush hour. However, the condition is not sufficient, as other factors are necessary for a seizure to occur. Studying these molecular oscillations may help us understand seizure genesis mechanisms and find new therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers. The MORE hypothesis can be generalized to comorbidities and the slower multidien (week/month period) rhythmicity of seizures, a phenomenon addressed in another article in this issue of Epilepsia.","Bernard, Christophe",Epilepsia,https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063860/,129

The H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A virus cause most of the seasonal epidemics observed in humans and are the major drivers of influenza A virus-associated mortality. The consequences of pandemic spread of COVID-19 underscore the public health importance of prospective vaccine development. Here, we show that headless hemagglutinin (HA) stabilized-stem immunogens presented on ferritin nanoparticles elicit broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) responses to diverse H1 and H3 viruses in nonhuman primates (NHPs) when delivered with a squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, AF03. The neutralization potency and breadth of antibodies isolated from NHPs were comparable to human bnAbs and extended to mismatched heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Although NHPs lack the immunoglobulin germline VH1-69 residues associated with the most prevalent human stem-directed bnAbs, other gene families compensated to generate bnAbs. Isolation and structural analyses of vaccine-induced bnAbs revealed extensive interaction with the fusion peptide on the HA stem, which is essential for viral entry. Antibodies elicited by these headless HA stabilized-stem vaccines neutralized diverse H1 and H3 influenza viruses and shared a mode of recognition analogous to human bnAbs, suggesting that these vaccines have the potential to confer broadly protective immunity against diverse viruses responsible for seasonal and pandemic influenza infections in humans.","Darricarrère, Nicole; Qiu, Yu; Kanekiyo, Masaru; Creanga, Adrian; Gillespie, Rebecca A; Moin, Syed M; Saleh, Jacqueline; Sancho, Jose; Chou, Te-Hui; Zhou, Yanfeng; Zhang, Ruijun; Dai, Shujia; Moody, Anthony; Saunders, Kevin O; Crank, Michelle C; Mascola, John R; Graham, Barney S; Wei, Chih-Jen; Nabel, Gary J",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abe5449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658355/,129

Overall, 41% cesarean sections were performed with one mortality and one COVID-19-positive neonate. The challenges faced by HCPs regarding delivery of care and collective successive measures taken to overcome those challenges as well as challenges faced by patients related to healthcare provision are also addressed. Strategies adopted for timely intervention to overcome those challenges were implemented for smooth and safe care to all patients and staff. We believe that planning and preparing proactively is the key to address any pandemic like COVID-19.

116250,Delta power robustly predicts cognitive function in Angelman syndrome.,2021-05-28,"Medical care in resource-limited environments (austere settings) can occur in the context of a disaster, wilderness, or a tactical field operation. Regardless of the type of environment, there are common organizational themes in most successful humanitarian missions that occur in harsh natural or manmade environmental conditions. These principles prioritize the initiation and execution of any given deployment in austere or remote settings, diverging from priorities that would occur in a situation in which change to the existing medical structure is intact and operating well. Attention to these priorities not only helps providers to deliver medical care to people in need during a period of resource limitations but it also can keep providers, teams, the public, and patients safe during and after a deployment.","Macias, Darryl J; Williams, Jason",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/smj.0b013e31827c5a2e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23263320/,129

It can treat dysentery, relieve heat, remove dampness, and regulate the intestines and stomach. The objective of this study is to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. We used high performance liquid chromatography to analyze the extract of Liupao tea and establish its fingerprint. The main index components of the fingerprint were determined using SARS-COV-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro ), and an in vitro drug screening model based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to evaluate its inhibitory activity in vitro. The fingerprint results showed that the alcohol extract of Liupao tea contained gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, epicatechin gallate, rutin, and ellagic acid. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol and showed strong binding affinity. The results of in vitro activity showed that the IC50 of EGCG was 8.84 μmol/L, which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3Clpro to a certain extent. This study unleashed that EGCG has a certain inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro , and Liupao tea has a certain significance as a tea drink for the prevention of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The objective of this study was to explore the material basis and mechanism of Liupao tea intervention in COVID-19 and to provide a new prevention and treatment programme for COVID-19. The molecular docking binding energies of the six index components of Liupao tea with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro were all less than -5.0 kJ/mol, among them, the enzyme activity experiment shows that EGCG has a certain inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro , it can be used as a potential SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor.

116497,Why cancer control is fundamental during a pandemic.,2020-12-28,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major disruptions to many aspects of life in Australia and globally. This includes actual and potential future impacts on Australia's three national screening programs for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. These programs aim to improve cancer outcomes through an organised approach to the early detection of cancer and precancer in asymptomatic populations. The design of each program varies according to biological differences in the three cancers, the available screening technology, the target population, and variations in their administration of Australia's federal, state and territory jurisdictions. The observed and potential impacts of COVID-19 on these programs, and on related activities such as the current national enquiry into lung cancer screening feasibility, therefore vary significantly. This article focuses on observed short-term impacts, adaptations and the longer-term outlook for cancer screening in relation to COVID-19. It summarises potential responses to minimise the harms of disruptions caused by COVID-19, and highlights research and policy opportunities in the pandemic response and recovery which could inform and accelerate optimisation of cancer screening in the long term.","Feletto, Eleonora; Grogan, Paul; Dickson, Carolyn; Smith, Megan; Canfell, Karen",Public health research & practice,https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3042026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294902/,129

However, to advance research gaps in low-income settings, we need valid measures of common mental health disorders. Using primary data collected in five countries (Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), this study aims to assess the psychometric properties of the commonly used 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D 10) scale among poor, disadvantaged youth populations in sub-Saharan African (SSA). METHODS Youth samples from each country (sample sizes ranging from 651 to 2098) come from large household surveys with youth modules, collected for impact evaluations of cash transfer programs targeted to poor families. For each sample, we assessed internal consistency (alpha), conducted factor analysis, and then examined construct validity and measurement invariance. We performed both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine and confirm the structure of the CES-D 10 for each country and then used multigroup CFA to assess measurement invariance across gender and age. Multivariate analyses were conducted to assess construct validity via test of the relationship between CES-D 10 and background characteristics. RESULTS Results show the CES-D 10 had strong psychometric properties and was a reliable measure of depressive symptoms among disadvantaged youth in SSA. Across countries, there was high internal consistency (Cronbach alphas = 0.70-0.76) and the traditional two-factor solution showed good model fit. Full measurement invariance of the CES-D 10 was supported across gender. Consistent with previous literature on risk factors for depressive symptoms, the CES-D 10 was associated with increasing age, and female gender and being out of school in some locations. CONCLUSIONS Results from this study support broad use of the CES-D 10 among poor youth populations in SSA. Between one-third and two-thirds of our samples demonstrated depressive symptoms as classified by recommended cut-offs for the CES-D 10, indicating a high burden of mental illness in disadvantaged youth populations. This tool can be used in future efforts to study prevalence and dynamics of depressive symptoms in this population, as well as effectiveness of policies and interventions to improve the mental health of youth in SSA.","Kilburn, Kelly; Prencipe, Leah; Hjelm, Lisa; Peterman, Amber; Handa, Sudhanshu; Palermo, Tia",BMC psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-018-1774-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29914413/,129

This affected all aspects of society including health care. In the field of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), teleneurology is employed in scenarios where face-to-face interactions are not possible. A growing number of clinicians and institutions are turning to teleneurology in order to providing medical care. AIMS OF THE ARTICLE In this manuscript, we present a practical, 'how we do it in real life', example of a teleneurology appointment with a person with PD (PwP). METHODS We elaborated a step-by-step approach of the main aspects of a consultation with a PwP and provide video illustration. RESULTS The key aspects of a teleneurology appointment were separated into: (1) In the office, before the appointment; (2) History taking; (3) Examination; and (4) Finishing up.

Outbreaks of COVID-19 have not previously been described in Norway, and it is important to identify mechanisms for spread of the infection and course of disease for nursing home residents with this pandemic disease. MATERIAL AND METHOD We included residents from three nursing homes with outbreaks of COVID-19 in a retrospective observational study, and we retrieved information on the number of staff for whom SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed or who were placed in quarantine. We present resident characteristics, course of disease and mortality associated with COVID-19 in the nursing homes, as well as providing a brief description of the outbreaks. RESULTS Forty residents were included, 26 of whom were women. The average age was 86.2 years. Thirty-seven of the residents had atypical symptoms, nine of them were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and 21 died during the coronavirus infection. Contact tracing indicated that the outbreaks may have originated from staff in the pre-symptomatic or early and mild phase of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in forty-two staff members, and a further 115 were placed in quarantine. INTERPRETATION Many residents had atypical disease presentation, and the mortality from COVID-19 was high. Spread of infection may have originated from staff, also before they displayed obvious symptoms, and contributed to extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the three nursing homes.","Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Hofacker, Sebastian von; Solheim, Sabine Piepenstock; Krüger, Kjell; Løland, Karina Koller; Jansen, Kristian","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32815356/,129

METHODS Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we have systematically reviewed published literature on the association of birth seasonality with risk of central nervous system tumors in children and adults. RESULTS Seventeen eligible studies using various methodologies were identified, encompassing 20,523 cases. Eight of 10 studies in children versus four of eight in adults showed some statistically significant associations between birth seasonality and central nervous system tumor or tumor subtype occurrence, pointing to a clustering of births mostly in fall and winter months, albeit no consistent pattern was identified by histologic subtype. A plethora of perinatal factors might underlie or confound the associations, such as variations in birth weight, maternal diet during pregnancy, perinatal vitamin D levels, pesticides, infectious agents, immune system maturity, and epigenetic modifications. CONCLUSIONS Inherent methodological weaknesses of to-date published individual investigations, including mainly underpowered size to explore the hypothesis by histological subtype, call for more elegant concerted actions using primary data of large datasets taking also into account the interplay between the potential underlying etiologic factors.","Georgakis, Marios K; Ntinopoulou, Erato; Chatzopoulou, Despoina; Petridou, Eleni Th",Annals of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2017.08.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28888834/,129

In China, transmission route of SARS-COV-2 has been contained so effectively that COVID-19 has been well controlled due to the proactive national prevention and control strategy. However, not only does it bring a huge impact on the existing medical structure model, but also an objective impact on the treatment of patients with chronic diseases such as malignant tumors. Based on the progress reported in the domestic and international literatures and the actual management experience of our team, this paper reflects on the treatment strategies for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) during the epidemic period of COVID-19. We focus on risk stratification for primary GIST and forming treatment strategies accordingly. Major considerations include the impact of delayed operation, the burden of medical resources, the waiting time for elective operation, and the principle of emergency operation. In addition, we focus on the level of evidence for non-surgical approaches with a view to developing a holistic strategy of ""priority management principles"" to guide clinical treatment in the context of limited resources and different GIST priorities.","Wang, X R; Hu, X H; Li, Z; Li, B K; Niu, W B; Zhou, C X; Yu, B; Zhang, Z Y; Zhang, X N; Gao, Y; Wang, G Y",Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20210213-00064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530566/,129

Herein, we investigated the effect of OTR4120 on the healing of normal colonic anastomoses. METHODS We evaluated the following two treatment groups of male Sprague Dawley rats (220-256 g): control-treated colonic anastomoses (n = 25) and OTR4120-treated colonic anastomoses (n = 25). We resected 10 mm of the left colon and then applied either saline alone (control) or OTR4120 (100 μg/mL) in saline to the colonic ends before an end-to-end single-layer anastomosis was constructed and again on the anastomosis before the abdomen and skin were closed. RESULTS On postoperative day 3, the anastomotic breaking strengths were 1.47 ± 0.32 N (mean ± SD) in the control group and 1.52 ± 0.27 N in the OTR4120-treated animals (P = 0.622). We also found that the hydroxyproline concentration (indicator of collagen) in the anastomotic wounds did not differ (P = 0.571) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that a single local application of OTR4120 intraoperatively did not increase the biomechanical strength of colonic anastomoses at the critical postoperative day 3 when the anastomoses are the weakest.","Nerstrøm, Malene; Krarup, Peter-Martin; Jorgensen, Lars Nannestad; Ågren, Magnus S",Gastroenterology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/1078062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28620413/,129
118313,Pre-hospital hypothermia is associated with transfusion risk after traumatic injury.,2020-09-01,"Although the degree of dispersion in Poincaré plots of electroencephalograms (EEG), termed the Poincaré-index, detects the depth of anaesthesia, the Poincaré-index becomes estranged from the bispectral index (BIS) at lighter anaesthesia levels. The present study introduces Poincaré-index20-30 Hz, targeting the 20- to 30-Hz frequency, as the frequency range reported to contain large electromyogram (EMG) portions in frontal EEG. We combined Poincaré-index20-30 Hz with the conventional Poincaré-index0.5-47 Hz using a deep learning technique to adjust to BIS values, and examined whether this layered Poincaré analysis can provide an index of anaesthesia level like BIS. A total of 83,867 datasets of these two Poincaré-indices and BIS-monitor-derived parameters were continuously obtained every 3 s from 30 patients throughout general anaesthesia, and were randomly divided into 75% for a training dataset and 25% for a test dataset. Two Poincaré-indices and two supplemental EEG parameters (EMG70-110 Hz, suppression ratio) in the training dataset were trained in a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), with reference to BIS as supervisor. We then evaluated the trained MLPNN model using the test dataset, by comparing the measured BIS (mBIS) with BIS predicted from the model (PredBIS). The relationship between mBIS and PredBIS using the two Poincaré-indices showed a tight linear regression equation: mBIS = 1.00 × PredBIS + 0.15, R = 0.87, p < 0.0001, root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.09, while the relationship between mBIS and PredBIS simply using the original Poincaré-index0.5-47 Hz was weaker (R = 0.82, p < 0.0001, RMSE = 7.32). This suggests the 20- to 30-Hz hierarchical Poincaré analysis has potential to improve on anaesthesia depth monitoring constructed by simple Poincaré analysis.","Hayase, Kazuma; Hayashi, Kazuko; Sawa, Teiji",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-019-00447-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31863245/,129

Platelets play a vital part in evading immune surveillance and angiogenesis in the case of tumor metastasis. The study aimed to analyze the predictive and prognostic effects of platelet count on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed the prognostic effects of platelets on 52 NSCLC patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant following EGFR-TKI treatment. Related data, together with the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were collected before and after 2 cycles of treatments (60 days). RESULTS The anti-EGFR treatment markedly reduced the platelet count in 33 (63.5%) patients after 2 cycles of treatment. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that, the decreased platelet count was closely correlated with the longer OS (HR = 0.293; 95%CI: 0.107-0.799; p = 0.017). Besides, the median OS was 326 days in the decreased platelet count group and 241 days in the increased platelet count group (HR = 0.311; 95%CI: 0.118-0.818; P = 0.018), as obtained from the independent baseline platelet levels and other clinical features. CONCLUSIONS The platelet count may predict the prognosis for EGFR-TKI treatment without additional costs. Besides, changes in platelet count may serve as a meaningful parameter to establish the prognostic model for NSCLC patients receiving anti-EGFR targeted therapy.","Xu, Lu; Xu, Fangzhou; Kong, Haobo; Zhao, Meiling; Ye, Yuanzi; Zhang, Yanbei",BMC cancer,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-020-07650-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243184/,129

To extend its application to cancer cell-targeting drug delivery, we created three different types of chimeric MrNV virus-like particles (VLPs) (R-MrNV, I-MrNV, and E-MrNV) that have specificity toward the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cancer cell biomarker, by incorporating the EGFR-specific GE11 peptide at 3 different locations within the host cell recognition site of the capsid. All three chimeric MrNV-VLPs preserved the ability to form a mulberry-like VLP structure and to encapsulate EGFP DNA plasmid with an efficiency comparable to that previously reported for normal MrNV (N-MrNV). Compared to N-MrNV, the chimeric R-MrNV and E-MrNV carrying the exposed GE-11 peptide showed a significantly enhanced binding and internalization abilities that were specific towards EGFR expression in colorectal cancer cells (SW480). Specific targeting of chimeric MrNV to EGFR was proven by both EGFR silencing with siRNA vector and a competition with excess GE-11 peptide as well as the use of EGFR-negative colorectal cells (SW620) and breast cancer cells (MCF7). We demonstrated here that both chimeric R-MrNV and E-MrNV could be used to encapsulate cargo such as exogenous DNA and deliver it specifically to EGFR-positive cells.

119851,Prospects for rapid advances in the development of new medicines for special medical needs.,2014,"BACKGROUND Otoplasty for prominent ears is a routine procedure that is generally met with satisfaction by patients and family members. A significant percentage of patients requesting otoplasty, however, have some degree of macrotia in addition to protruding ears. Combining ear reduction with traditional otoplasty allows correction of these deformities. There are few studies in the literature that describe ear reduction, and those that do, describe small subsets of patients. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of the senior author's (C.H.T.) otoplasty procedures from 2010 to 2013. Charts were reviewed for patient demographics, preoperative assessment, surgical technique used, complications, and need for revision. All otoplasty procedures, primary or secondary, were included in the series. RESULTS Over a 3-year period, 84 total otoplasty procedures were performed. Of these, 30 patients had some degree of scaphal reduction as a component of the procedure. Five patients (6 percent) also had shortening of the earlobes in addition to the scaphal reduction. Nineteen of the patients (23 percent) had an otoplasty previously (none performed by the senior author) but were not completely satisfied. Complications of reduction otoplasty were limited to a single patient with a suture protrusion behind the ear. None of the patients in this series have required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Scaphal reduction to modify the contour of the upper auricle and/or decrease the overall size of the ear can be a valuable adjunct to otoplasty and may be indicated in a larger than expected percentage of patients presenting for otoplasty.

120525,Contemporary Concise Review 2020: Sleep.,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND The signaling pathways of the intracellular second messengers cAMP and Ca2+ play a crucial role in numerous physiological processes in human sperm. One such process is the acrosome reaction (AR), which is necessary for sperm to traverse the egg envelope and to expose a fusogenic membrane allowing the egg-sperm fusion. Progesterone and zona pellucida elicit an intracellular Ca2+ increase that is needed for the AR in the mammalian sperm. This increase is mediated by an initial Ca2+ influx but also by a release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. It is known that intracellular Ca2+ stores play a central role in the regulation of [Ca2+ ]i and in the generation of complex Ca2+ signals such as oscillations and waves. In the human sperm it has been proposed that the cAMP analog and specific agonist of Epac 8-(p-chlorophenylthio)-2'-O-methyladenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (2'-O-Me-cAMP) elicits an intracellular Ca2+ release involved in the AR. OBJECTIVE To identify the molecular entities involved in the Ca2+ mobilization triggered by 2'-O-Me-cAMP in human sperm. MATERIALS AND METHODS In capacitated human sperm, we monitored Ca2+ dynamics and the occurrence of the AR in real time using Fluo 3-AM and FM4-64 in a Ca2+ -free medium. RESULTS Epac activation by 2'-O-Me-cAMP induced a Ca2+ wave that started in the mid piece and propagated to the acrosome region. This Ca2+ response was sensitive to rotenone, CGP, xestospongin, NED-19 and thapsigargin, suggesting the participation of different ion transporters (mitochondrial complex I and Na+ /Ca2+ exchanger, inositol 3-phosphate receptors, two-pore channels and internal store Ca2+ -ATPases). DISCUSSION Our results suggest that Epac activation promotes a dynamic crosstalk between three different intracellular Ca2+ stores: the mitochondria, the redundant nuclear envelope and the acrosome. CONCLUSION The Ca2+ wave triggered by Epac activation is necessary to induce the AR and to enhance the flagellar beat.","Mata-Martínez, Esperanza; Sánchez-Tusie, Ana Alicia; Darszon, Alberto; Mayorga, Luis S; Treviño, Claudia L; De Blas, Gerardo A",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609309/,129

This statistical association has led to numerous highly problematic policy suggestions and comments revealing underlying ageist attitudes and promoting age discrimination. Such attitudes are based on negative stereotypes on the health and functioning of older adults. As a result, the lives of older people are disvalued, including in possible triage situations and in the potential limitation of some measures against the spread of the pandemic to older adults. These outcomes are unjustified and unethical.

121034,Gender differences in remission of esophageal intestinal metaplasia after radiofrequency ablation.,2014,"Pulmonary mycoses are difficult to treat and detrimental to patients. Fungal infections modulate the lung immune response, and induce goblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia, and mucus hypersecretion in the airways. Excessive mucus clogs small airways and reduces pulmonary function by decreasing oxygen exchange, leading to respiratory distress. The Forkhead box protein, FOXA2, is a transcription factor that regulates mucus homeostasis in the airways. However, little is known whether pulmonary mycosis modulates FOXA2 function. Here, we investigated whether Blastomyces dermatitidis and Histoplasma capsulatum-infected canine and feline lungs and airway epithelial cells could serve as higher animal models to examine the relationships between fungal pneumonia and FOXA2-regulated airway mucus homeostasis. The results indicated that fungal infection downregulated FOXA2 expression in airway epithelial cells, with concomitant overexpression of MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins. Mechanistic studies revealed that B. dermatitidis infection, as well as β-glucan exposure, activated the Dectin-1-SYK-EGFR-AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway that inhibits the expression of FOXA2, resulting in overexpression of MUC5AC and MUC5B in canine airway cells. Further understanding of the role of FOXA2 in mucus hypersecretion may lead to novel therapeutics against excessive mucus in both human and veterinary patients with pulmonary mycosis.","Choi, Woosuk; Yang, Alina Xiaoyu; Sieve, Aaron; Kuo, Shanny Hsuan; Mudalagiriyappa, Srinivasu; Vieson, Miranda; Maddox, Carol W; Nanjappa, Som G; Lau, Gee W",The American journal of pathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069717/,129

Outcomes of interest included healing time, wound size and appearance, bacterial burden, and infection. DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION Comparative and noncomparative clinical studies were considered, including observational cohort, retrospective, and randomized controlled studies. They addressed the research question: ""Does the use of UV light as an adjunct to conventional treatment help improve healing and reduce infection in wounds?"" Selection criteria included any English language study in adults who used UV light to improve wound healing and prevent or treat wound infection. DATA EXTRACTION Authors extracted information pertaining to patient demographics, treatment protocols, and the following wound outcomes: appearance, healing time, infection, and bacterial burden. DATA SYNTHESIS The search yielded 30,986 articles, and screening resulted in 11 studies that underwent final analysis. Of these (N = 27,833), seven (64%) demonstrated an improvement in healing outcomes with adjunctive UV therapy, and the results of four (36%) achieved statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS There is limited research on the utility of adjunctive UV therapy to improve wound healing outcomes in humans. The majority of literature included in this review supported improved wound healing outcomes with adjuvant UV therapy. Future well-designed randomized controlled trials will be essential in further determining the benefit and utility of UV therapy in wound healing.","Inkaran, Jeyanth; Tenn, Adam; Martyniuk, Amanda; Farrokhyar, Forough; Cenic, Aleksa",Advances in skin & wound care,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000734384.52295.92; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739951/,129

Some studies have also found decreased longevity in left-handed individuals. We therefore aimed to determine whether handedness independently affects the relationship between volatile anaesthetic concentration and the bispectral index, the incidence of definite or possible intra-operative awareness with explicit recall, or postoperative mortality. We studied 5585 patients in this secondary analysis of data collected in a multicentre clinical trial. There were 4992 (89.4%) right-handed and 593 (10.6%) non-right-handed patients. Handedness was not associated with (a) an alteration in anaesthetic sensitivity in terms of the relationship between the bispectral index and volatile anaesthetic concentration (estimated effect on the regression relationship -0.52 parallel shift; 95% CI -1.27 to 0.23, p = 0.17); (b) the incidence of intra-operative awareness with 26/4992 (0.52%) right-handed vs 1/593 (0.17%) non-right-handed (difference = 0.35%; 95% CI -0.45 to 0.63%; p = 0.35); or (c) postoperative mortality rates (90-day relative risk for non-right-handedness 1.19, 95% CI 0.76-1.86; p = 0.45). Thus, no change in anaesthetic management is indicated for non-right-handed patients.","Rao, S; Huverserian, A R; Ben Abdallah, A; Lees, K; Willingham, M D; Burnside, B A; Villafranca, A J; Glick, D B; Jacobsohn, E; Avidan, M S",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.12676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819930/,129

Hearing levels, tumor size, and location of the tumor have been known to be candidates of predictors. We used a machine learning approach to predict hearing outcomes in vestibular schwannoma patients who underwent hearing preservation surgery: middle cranial fossa, or retrosigmoid approach. After reviewing the medical records of 52 patients with a pathologically confirmed vestibular schwannoma, we included 50 patient's records in the study. Hearing preservation was regarded as positive if the postoperative hearing was within serviceable hearing (50/50 rule). The categorical variable included the surgical approach, and the continuous variable covered audiometric and vestibular function tests, and the largest diameter of the tumor. Four different algorithms were lined up for comparison of accuracy: support vector machine(SVM), gradient boosting machine(GBM), deep neural network(DNN), and diffuse random forest(DRF). The average accuracy of predicting hearing preservation ranged from 62% (SVM) to 90% (DNN). The current study is the first to incorporate machine learning methodology into a prediction of successful hearing preservation surgery. Although a larger population may be needed for better generalization, this study could aid the surgeon's decision to perform a hearing preservation approach for vestibular schwannoma surgery.","Cha, Dongchul; Shin, Seung Ho; Kim, Sung Huhn; Choi, Jae Young; Moon, In Seok",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64175-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346085/,129

METHODS PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science were searched from inception up to and including 5 October 2017 to identify RCTs of vitamin D supplementation in patients with COPD that reported incidence of acute exacerbations. Individual participant data meta-analysis was performed using fixed effects models adjusting for age, sex, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometric grade and trial. RESULTS Four eligible RCTs (total 560 participants) were identified; individual participant data were obtained for 469/472 (99.4%) participants in three RCTs. Supplementation did not influence overall rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13). Prespecified subgroup analysis revealed that protective effects were seen in participants with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L (aIRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84) but not in those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≥25 nmol/L (aIRR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.27; p for interaction=0.015). Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (adjusted OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.75). CONCLUSIONS Vitamin D supplementation safely and substantially reduced the rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations in patients with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 nmol/L but not in those with higher levels.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the short-term effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, staging, and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden on newly diagnosed PCa cases and on the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed between 18 March 2020 and 2 June 2020 were compared with those in the corresponding time periods in 2017-2019, as reported until January 31 of the year after each study period. RESULTS During the study period in 2020, 36% fewer PCa cases were registered in NPCR compared with the corresponding time period in previous years: 1458 cases in 2020 vs a mean of 2285 cases in 2017-2019. The decrease in new PCa registrations was more pronounced in men above age 75 years, down 51%, than in men aged 70-75, down 37%, and in men below age 70, down 28%. There was no decrease in the number of radical prostatectomies and number of radical radiotherapy courses increased by 32%. CONCLUSIONS During the peak of the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of men diagnosed with PCa in Sweden decreased by one third compared with previous years, whereas there was no decrease in the number of curative treatments.","Fallara, Giuseppe; Sandin, Fredrik; Styrke, Johan; Carlsson, Stefan; Lissbrant, Ingela Franck; Ahlgren, Johan; Bratt, Ola; Lambe, Mats; Stattin, Pär",Scandinavian journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1080/21681805.2021.1910341; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33913376/,129

We also have a strong unpleasant feeling toward moving objects such as swarming worms, but it is poorly understood how motion information relates to a feeling of unpleasantness. The present study investigated spatiotemporal frequency characteristics that cause visual unpleasantness using bandpass noise with variable spatial frequencies, temporal frequencies, temporal frequency bandwidths, and orientation bandwidths. Results show that dynamic noise with relatively low temporal frequencies (0.5-2 Hz) was markedly more unpleasant than static noise, including that judged as the most unpleasant in a previous study. Remarkably, translational motion of the noise did not increase the feeling of unpleasantness. A subsequent experiment using a dynamic texture in which elements moved in a variable range of random directions showed that the variegated motion direction plays a critical role in promoting visual unpleasantness. Natural scenes have regularity in that features inside an object usually move in the same direction and rarely at random, and the present results further support the notion that deviation from the statistical regularity of natural scenes in images and movies induces negative emotions.","Ogawa, Narumi; Motoyoshi, Isamu",Vision research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2021.03.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845251/,129

We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programmes for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. Material and methods An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Results Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. Conclusions Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention.

122173,Audio Interview: Operation Warp Speed and Covid-19 Therapeutics.,2020-09-17,"BACKGROUND Chronic primary musculoskeletal pain (CPMP) is one subcategory of the new classification of chronic primary pain for the upcoming ICD-11, defined as chronic pain in the muscles, bones, joints, or tendons that persists or recurs for more than 3 months and is associated with significant emotional distress or functional disability. An array of pharmacological, psychological, physical, complementary, and rehabilitative interventions is available for CPMP, for which previous research has demonstrated varying effect sizes with regard to effectiveness in pain reduction and other main outcomes. This highlights the need for the synthesis of all available evidence. The proposed network meta-analysis will compare all available interventions for CPMP to determine the best treatment option(s) with a focus on efficacy and safety of interventions. METHODS We are interested in comparing interventions of the following types: psychological, pharmacological, physical, complementary, and rehabilitative interventions. We will include all randomized controlled trials that compare one intervention with another, or with a control group, in the treatment of CPMP. Primary efficacy outcomes will be pain intensity, emotional distress, and functional disability. Safety outcomes extracted will include proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events, unwanted events, or drop-out rates due to side effects. Published and unpublished trials will be sought through the search of all relevant databases and trial registries. At least two independent reviewers of the team will select the references and extract data independently. We will assess the risk of bias of each individual study using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We will conduct a network meta-analysis to synthesize all evidence for each outcome. We will fit our model primarily within a Bayesian framework. DISCUSSION CPMP is a disabling condition for which several interventions exist. To our knowledge, this is the first network meta-analysis to systematically compare all available evidence. This is required by national health institutions to inform their decisions about the best available treatment option(s) with regard to efficacy and safety outcomes.

The first is to explicate the cognitive mechanism underlying the process through which exposure to risk information on social media shapes people's behavioral intentions. The second is to determine whether exposures to risk information on two different types of social media-content-oriented social media focusing on shared interests versus user-oriented social media focusing on social relationships-have different effects on people's risk perceptions and behavioral intentions. Analyzing survey data from 688 adults from the general population of South Korea in the context of carcinogenic hazards, we found that self-reported content-oriented social media exposure (to risk information) was significantly related to both personal-level and societal-level risk perceptions. In addition, content-oriented social media exposure was associated with behavioral intentions indirectly through risk perceptions. However, user-oriented social media exposure had no impact on risk perceptions and behavioral intentions, either directly or indirectly through risk perceptions.","Yoo, Woohyun; Paek, Hye-Jin; Hove, Thomas",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2018.1545169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427203/,129

A single virus was found in 30.4%, with RSV being the most frequent. Viral coinfections were detected in 8%. Children with viral infection were more likely to be febrile upon enrollment and to present with lower respiratory signs/symptoms. They had longer duration of illness and they were more likely to receive antibiotics/antifungals. Only 22% of children with influenza received oseltamivir. Mortality was low (2.7%), however, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission and death were correlated with virus detection. In our study mortality was low and PICU admission was related to virus identification. Further research is needed to clarify whether antibiotics in virus-proven infection are of value and underline the importance of oseltamivir's timely administration in influenza.","Vliora, Christianna; Papadakis, Vassilios; Doganis, Dimitrios; Tourkantoni, Natalia; Paisiou, Anna; Kottaridi, Christine; Kourlamba, Georgia; Zaoutis, Theoklis; Kosmidis, Helen; Kattamis, Antonis; Polychronopoulou, Sophia; Goussetis, Evgenios; Giannouli, Georgia; Syridou, Garyfallia; Priftis, Kostas; Papaevangelou, Vassiliki",Pediatric hematology and oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08880018.2019.1613462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215284/,129

METHODS A cross-sectional self-reported QOL assessment was undertaken between July and September 2020 using the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument sent out to hHCWs. Factors that predicted a poorer QOL were identified using regression models and mediation analysis. RESULTS Responses from 979 individuals across 53 countries were analyzed with 62.4% participation from low- and middle-income countries. The physical domain had the highest mean scores of 15 ± 2.51, while the environmental domain was the lowest (14.17 ± 2.42). Participants from low- and middle-income countries had a significantly worse physical (p < 0.001) and environmental (p < 0.001) domains, while a low coronavirus disease 2019-related mortality significantly impacted the environmental domain (p-0.034). CONCLUSION QOL-related issues among hHCWs are a vexing problem and need intervention at an individual and systems level in all parts of the world.","Singh, Arjun; Garg, Apurva; Mandlik, Dushyant; Vander Poorten, Vincent; Patel, Snehal G; O'Neill, James Paul; Spirano, Giuseppe; Shaha, Ashok; Chaturvedi, Pankaj; Cernea, Claudio; Shah, Jatin",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.26571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109640/,129

123458,Dawn of telemedicine.,2020,"BACKGROUND Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified in infants <12 months old. Clinical characteristics and follow-up data of MIS-C in infants have not been well described. We sought to describe the clinical course, laboratory findings, therapeutics and outcomes among infants diagnosed with MIS-C. METHODS Infants of age <12 months with MIS-C were identified by reports to the CDC's MIS-C national surveillance system. Data were obtained on clinical signs and symptoms, complications, treatment, laboratory and imaging findings, and diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing. Jurisdictions that reported 2 or more infants were approached to participate in evaluation of outcomes of MIS-C. RESULTS Eighty-five infants with MIS-C were identified and 83 (97.6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection; median age was 7.7 months. Rash (62.4%), diarrhea (55.3%) and vomiting (55.3%) were the most common signs and symptoms reported. Other clinical findings included hypotension (21.2%), pneumonia (21.2%) and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (13.9%). Laboratory abnormalities included elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin, d-dimer and fibrinogen. Twenty-three infants had follow-up data; 3 of the 14 patients who received a follow-up echocardiogram had cardiac abnormalities during or after hospitalization. Nine infants had elevated inflammatory markers up to 98 days postdischarge. One infant (1.2%) died after experiencing multisystem organ failure secondary to MIS-C. CONCLUSIONS Infants appear to have a milder course of MIS-C than older children with resolution of their illness after hospital discharge. The full clinical picture of MIS-C across the pediatric age spectrum is evolving.","Godfred-Cato, Shana; Tsang, Clarisse A; Giovanni, Jennifer; Abrams, Joseph; Oster, Matthew E; Lee, Ellen H; Lash, Maura K; Le Marchand, Chloe; Liu, Caterina Y; Newhouse, Caitlin N; Richardson, Gillian; Murray, Meghan T; Lim, Sarah; Haupt, Thomas E; Hartley, Amanda; Sosa, Lynn E; Ngamsnga, Kompan; Garcia, Ali; Datta, Deblina; Belay, Ermias D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872279/,129

124032,Welcome to the ninth international conference on pediatric mechanical circulatory support systems and pediatric cardiopulmonary perfusion.,2013,"The tachykinin family of peptides has emerged as a critical component of the central control of the reproductive axis. Mounting evidence suggests that neurokinin B (NKB) plays an essential role in sexual maturation and fertility by directly stimulating the release of kisspeptin, with the contribution of additional tachykinins (neurokinin A [NKA] and substance P [SP]) in the fine tuning of the activity of Kiss1 neurons. The expression of tachykinins increases in the hypothalamus before puberty and, therefore, they are considered as initiators of pubertal development by stimulating the awakening of Kiss1 neurons. This is supported by studies showing delayed or absent puberty onset in humans and mice devoid of tachykinin signaling, and the advancement of puberty onset in rodents subjected to chronic activation of tachykinin receptors. This review compiles the current knowledge on the role of tachykinins in the control of puberty onset.","Navarro, Víctor M",Current opinion in endocrine and metabolic research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coemr.2020.06.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832725/,129

We map discrete, complex, and biomolecular traits and contrast two quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approaches. Analysis based on inferred haplotypes improves power, reduces false discovery, and provides information to identify and prioritize candidate genes that is unique to multifounder crosses like the CC. The number of expression QTLs discovered here exceeds all previous efforts at eQTL mapping in mice, and we map local eQTL at 1-Mb resolution. We demonstrate that the genetic diversity of the CC, which derives from random mixing of eight founder strains, results in high phenotypic diversity and enhances our ability to map causative loci underlying complex disease-related traits.","Aylor, David L; Valdar, William; Foulds-Mathes, Wendy; Buus, Ryan J; Verdugo, Ricardo A; Baric, Ralph S; Ferris, Martin T; Frelinger, Jeff A; Heise, Mark; Frieman, Matt B; Gralinski, Lisa E; Bell, Timothy A; Didion, John D; Hua, Kunjie; Nehrenberg, Derrick L; Powell, Christine L; Steigerwalt, Jill; Xie, Yuying; Kelada, Samir N P; Collins, Francis S; Yang, Ivana V; Schwartz, David A; Branstetter, Lisa A; Chesler, Elissa J; Miller, Darla R; Spence, Jason; Liu, Eric Yi; McMillan, Leonard; Sarkar, Abhishek; Wang, Jeremy; Wang, Wei; Zhang, Qi; Broman, Karl W; Korstanje, Ron; Durrant, Caroline; Mott, Richard; Iraqi, Fuad A; Pomp, Daniel; Threadgill, David; de Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel; Churchill, Gary A",Genome research,https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.111310.110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406540/,129

Only NiV RNA was detected in a liver homogenate of P. giganteus captured in Myanaguri, West Bengal. Partial sequence analysis of nucleocapsid, glycoprotein, fusion, and phosphoprotein genes showed similarity with the NiV sequences from earlier outbreaks in India. A serum sample of this bat was also positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for NiV-specific IgG.

As healthcare system performance and medical education are directly and reciprocally linked, a substantial part of healthcare services' dysfunctions could be partially attributed to the training of the young doctors. Thus, in order to improve the performance of the healthcare system in the best interest of patients and communities, the education of healthcare personnel should be a priority. By reviewing the existing literature in combination with our experience we attempt to delineate the weak points of the undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Greece. Additionally, based on medical curricula from other countries, we suggest reforms in order to achieve a uniform, clinically oriented, emphasis on training in public health issues in undergraduate medical education. Reforms are also suggested for postgraduate training with regard not only to specialization curricula, but also to the accredited institutions which provide specialty training. Finally, the necessity for Continuing Medical Education (CME) is underlined; medical education must have a continuum that begins with undergraduate training but does not end there; it is life-long learning.","Cinoku, Ilir I; Zampeli, Evangelia; Moutsopoulos, Haralampos M",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1832651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284722/,129

This study aimed to analyze the clinical and chest CT features of 15 COVID-19 patients with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) retest results after discharge. Patients who met the current standards of discharge could still carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Methods Clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and chest CT images were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results The most common symptoms at Covid-19COVID-19 initial onset were fever (12/15, 80%) and cough (11/15, 73.3%). Most of the patients had a normal white blood cells (12/15, 80%), neutrophils (12/15, 80%), and lymphocytes count (13/15, 86.7%); some patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (5/15, 33.3%), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (4/15, 26.7%) during first admission. Five patients (33.3%) had a cough before their first discharge. The average interval from the first discharge to re-admission was 17 days (range, 9-30 days). At re-admission, two (13.3%) patients presented with cough, and one (6.6%) had chest pain with anxiety. At re-admission, all patients had normal clinical results except five (33.3%) patients had increased CRP compared with first discharging, two (13.3%) patients had increased neutrophils count, and one (6.6%) had increased CRP. The majority of patients had normal procalcitonin. Ground glass opacities (GGOs) and reticulation in the peripheral and subpleural areas were the most common CT manifestations, and six patients (40%) showed a transformation from reticulation to GGOs when re-admitted. Conclusions There may be no specific clinical characteristics to predict the re-detectability of the virus.

METHODS All femoral tunneled catheter insertions from 1996 to 2006 were reviewed, during which time 123 catheters were inserted. Of these, 66 were exchanges. Patients with femoral catheter failure versus those with femoral catheter patency were compared. Confounding factors, such as demographic and procedural factors, were incorporated and assessed using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS Mean catheter primary patency failure time was 96.3 days (SE 17.9 days). Primary patency at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days was 53.8%, 45.4%, 32.1%, and 27.1% respectively. Crude rates of risk of catheter failure did not suggest a benefit for patients receiving catheters introduced from one side versus the other, but more cephalad location of catheter tip was associated with improved patency. Multivariate analysis showed that patients whose catheters were on the left side (p = 0.009), were of increasing age at the time of insertion (p = 0.002) and that those who had diabetes (p = 0.001) were at significantly greater risk of catheter failure. The catheter infection rate was 1.4/1000 catheter days. CONCLUSION Patients who were of a more advanced age and had diabetes were at greater risk of femoral catheter failure, whereas those who received femoral catheters from the right side were less at risk of catheter failure.","Burton, Kirsteen R; Guo, Lancia L Q; Tan, Kong T; Simons, Martin E; Sniderman, Kenneth W; Kachura, John R; Beecroft, John R; Rajan, Dheeraj K",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-011-0316-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22139368/,129

Facing this lethal disease, there is an urgent need to develop potent therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically and symptomatically resembles SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Numerous agents have been utilised during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics, which may show some benefit against SARS-CoV-2. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CBM Disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and the China Science and Technology Journal Database will be searched. Manual searches will be conducted by searching pre-printing websites, clinical trial registers, and screening the reference lists of inclusive studies. The screening of all citations and the selection of inclusive articles will be conducted by two reviewers. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled cohort studies reporting antiviral therapies, including ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon, for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 will be included. The primary outcomes will be mortality, incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and utilisation of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission. The secondary outcomes will be improvement in symptoms and chest radiography results, virus clearance, changes in blood test results, and serum tests. The quality of the retrieved RCTs and observational studies will be appraised according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. If feasible, we will perform a fixed- or random-effects meta-analysis. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will summarise all the available evidence for the efficacy and safety of current therapeutic options in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

125647,Faecal calprotectin and gut microbiota do not predict enteropathy in very preterm infants.,2020-05-17,"Despite identification of several cellular mechanisms being thought to underlie the development of septic acute kidney injury (AKI), the pathophysiology of the occurrence of AKI is still poorly understood. It is clear, however, that instead of a single mechanism being responsible for its aetiology, an orchestra of cellular mechanisms failing is associated with AKI. The integrative physiological compartment where these mechanisms come together and exert their integrative deleterious action is the renal microcirculation (MC). This is why it is opportune to review the response of the renal MC to sepsis and discuss the determinants of its (dys)function and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of renal failure. A main determinant of adequate organ function is the adequate supply and utilization of oxygen at the microcirculatory and cellular level to perform organ function. The highly complex architecture of the renal microvasculature, the need to meet a high energy demand and the fact that the kidney is borderline ischaemic makes the kidney a highly vulnerable organ to hypoxaemic injury. Under normal, steady-state conditions, oxygen (O2) supply to the renal tissues is well regulated; however, under septic conditions the delicate balance of oxygen supply versus demand is disturbed due to renal microvasculature dysfunction. This dysfunction is largely due to the interaction of renal oxygen handling, nitric oxide metabolism and radical formation. Renal tissue oxygenation is highly heterogeneous not only between the cortex and medulla but also within these renal compartments. Integrative evaluation of the different determinants of tissue oxygen in sepsis models has identified the deterioration of microcirculatory oxygenation as a key component in the development AKI. It is becoming clear that resuscitation of the failing kidney needs to integratively correct the homeostasis between oxygen, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Several experimental therapeutic modalities have been found to be effective in restoring microcirculatory oxygenation in parallel to improving renal function following septic AKI. However, these have to be verified in clinical studies. The development of clinical physiological biomarkers of AKI specifically aimed at the MC should form a valuable contribution to monitoring such new therapeutic modalities.","Ergin, Bulent; Kapucu, Aysegul; Demirci-Tansel, Cihan; Ince, Can","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfu105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24848133/,129

Multilevel urine pregnancy tests (MLPTs), which provide accurate results in one week, are a promising alternative, but their use has not been evaluated within telemedicine services. METHODS From November 2017 to May 2018, 165 eligible and consenting pregnant people who contacted safe2choose-an organization providing telemedicine abortion services internationally-for medication abortion were enrolled in a pilot study and mailed a package containing medication abortion drugs, two MLPTs and instructions. Data on 118 participants who completed a web-based evaluation survey two weeks after the package was sent were analyzed to examine participant experiences and satisfaction with the service. RESULTS Responding participants were from 11 countries, including Mexico, the Philippines and Singapore. Ninety-three percent used both MLPTs, and 91% of those who used both tests used them at the correct time intervals. Among the 95% of participants whose MLPT results indicated that their pregnancy hormone levels decreased from before to after medication abortion, 86% correctly interpreted the results to mean that they were no longer pregnant. Satisfaction was high, with all indicating that the supplied information was helpful; more than nine out of 10 noted that they would want to use the MLPTs again. CONCLUSIONS Incorporating MLPTs into telemedicine abortion services is feasible and associated with high client satisfaction.

Our aim was to assess the impact of pretreatment DWI lesion volume on outcomes after endovascular therapy, with a special emphasis on patients with complete recanalization. METHODS We analyzed data collected between April 2007 and November 2011 in a prospective clinical registry. All acute ischemic stroke patients with complete occlusion of internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery treated by endovascular therapy were included. DWI lesion volumes were measured by the RAPID software. Favorable outcome was defined by modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 at 90 days. RESULTS A total of 139 acute ischemic stroke patients were included. Median DWI lesion volume was 14 cc (interquartile range, 5-43) after a median onset time to imaging of 110 minutes (interquartile range, 77-178). Higher volume was associated with less favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.96). A complete recanalization was achieved in 65 (47%) patients after a median onset time of 238 minutes (interquartile range, 206-285). After adjustment for volume, complete recanalization was associated with more favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio, 6.32; 95% confidence interval, 2.90-13.78). After stratification of volume by tertiles, complete recanalization was similarly associated with favorable outcome in the upper 2 tertiles (P<0.005). CONCLUSIONS Our results emphasize the importance of initial DWI volume and recanalization on clinical outcome after endovascular treatment. Large DWI lesions may still benefit from recanalization in selected patients.","Olivot, Jean-Marc; Mosimann, Pascal J; Labreuche, Julien; Inoue, Manabu; Meseguer, Elena; Desilles, Jean-Philippe; Rouchaud, Aymeric; Klein, Isabelle F; Straka, Matus; Bammer, Roland; Mlynash, Michael; Amarenco, Pierre; Albers, Gregory W; Mazighi, Mikael",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.000911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760215/,129

127625,Incentive salience: novel treatment strategies for major depression.,2013,"BACKGROUND Whether heart failure (HF) increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not well established. In the phase III MAGELLAN (Multicenter, rAndomized, parallel Group Efficacy and safety study for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medically iLL patients comparing rivaroxabAN with enoxaparin) trial, extended-duration rivaroxaban was compared with standard-duration enoxaparin followed by placebo for VTE prevention in 8101 hospitalized acutely ill patients with or without HF. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between HF severity and the risk of VTE in MAGELLAN patients. METHODS AND RESULTS Hospitalized patients diagnosed with HF were included according to New York Heart Association class III or IV at admission (n=2593). HF severity was determined by N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) plasma concentrations (median 1904 pg/mL). Baseline plasma D-dimer concentrations ranged from 0.6 to 1.7 μg/L for the less and more severe HF subgroups. Patients with more severe HF had a greater incidence of VTE versus patients with less severe HF, with a significant trend up to Day 10 (4.3% versus 2.2%; P=0.0108) and Day 35 (7.2% versus 4.1%; P=0.0150). Multivariable analysis confirmed that NT-proBNP concentration was associated with VTE risk up to Day 10 (P=0.017) and D-dimer concentration with VTE risk up to Day 35 (P=0.005). The association between VTE risk and HF severity that was observed in the enoxaparin/placebo group was not seen in the extended-duration rivaroxaban group. CONCLUSIONS Patients with more severe HF, as defined by high NT-proBNP plasma concentration, were at increased risk of VTE. NT-proBNP may be useful to identify high short-term risk, whereas elevated D-dimer may be suggestive of high midterm risk. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

127762,Treatment variation in early breast cancer in the UK.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal and other systemic diseases of Equidae are often characterised by partial or complete inappetence. The catabolic processes may lead to lipid mobilisation and other metabolic disturbances. Evidence from earlier studies has revealed that during feed deprivation/inappetence, the conjugation of bilirubin is reduced causing a substantial rise of the total bilirubin and its unconjugated fraction. OBJECTIVES We hypothesised that during feed deprivation, the serum concentration of free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), total bilirubin (tBIL), total bile acids (tBA) and activity of GGT and GLDH increases, while the concentration of insulin and direct bilirubin (dBIL) decreases. STUDY DESIGN Observational experiment. METHODS Eleven horses were feed deprived for 96 h. Animals were closely monitored while blood samples were taken at the beginning, and then at 72, 84 and 96 h later. Variables of interest included serum FFA, TG, insulin, GGT, GLDH, total and direct BIL (t&dBIL), tBA and BUN. The data were analysed by descriptive statistics, paired t-test and one-way repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc HSD test, and P≤0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Horses tolerated feed restriction without complications. During this time, the concentration of TG, FFA, BUN, dBIL and insulin significantly increased (P≤0.05), as well as the activity of serum GGT, while the concentration of tBIL, tBA and the activity of GLDH did not change significantly (P>0.05). MAIN LIMITATIONS Sample size, lack of serum volatile fatty acid, cortisol and blood glucose measurements may have limited the value of the study. CONCLUSIONS Healthy Akhal Teke horses did not develop a catabolic crisis following 4 days of feed restriction and hyperlipaemia did not occur. Total BIL and tBA did not increase, thus were not useful indicators of inappetence in this group of horses.","Tóth, B; Auth, A; Rompos, L; Bakos, Z",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/evj.12730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28776730/,129
127902,Remarkable Healthy Cohort of Patients With Cancer.,2021-01-26,"INTRODUCTION Type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) of the human respiratory tract generate high interest owing to their ability, among other roles, to cleave surface proteins of respiratory viruses. This step is critical in the viral invasion of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, but also influenza viruses and reoviruses. Accordingly, these cell surface enzymes constitute appealing therapeutic targets for the development of host-based therapeutics against respiratory viral diseases. Additionally, their deregulated levels or activity has been described in non-viral diseases such as fibrosis, cancer and osteoarthritis, making them potential targets in these indications as well. AREAS COVERED This review includes WIPO-listed patents reporting small molecules and peptide-based inhibitors of type II transmembrane serine proteases of the respiratory tract. EXPERT OPINION Several TTSPs of the respiratory tract represent attractive pharmacological targets in the treatment of respiratory infectious diseases (notably COVID-19 and influenza), but also against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer. The current emphasis is primarily on TMPRSS2, matriptase and hepsin, yet other TTSPs await validation. Compounds listed herein are predominantly peptidomimetic inhibitors, some with covalent reversible mechanisms of action and high potencies. Their selectivity profile, however, are often only partially characterized. Preclinical data are promising and warrant further advancement in the above diseases.","Murza, Alexandre; Dion, Sébastien P; Boudreault, Pierre-Luc; Désilets, Antoine; Leduc, Richard; Marsault, Éric",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2020.1817390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887532/,129
127908,Role of phosphatase and tensin homolog in pathogenesis of ameloblastoma: An immunohistochemical study.,2020,"Virus-induced oral abnormalities, occurring especially in severe COVID-19 cases of hospitalized patients, have various characteristics and clinical features being, either directly or indirectly, related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Deregulation of the immune system as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to the impairment of the normal defense pathway in the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. This scoping mini-review is aimed to critically appraise the existing evidence concerning the potential link between COVID-19 condition and abnormal manifestations within oral cavity, affecting oral mucosa, salivary glands and sensory elements. COVID-induced oral mucosa manifestations, with various clinical aspects, are likely to occur as coinfections and secondary symptoms, as immune system imbalance is per se a causative factor of secondary manifestations. Oral mucosal lesions related to SARS-CoV-2 infection do not seem to demonstrate gender predilection, with the average reported age around 50 years of age. They include mainly white and erythematous plaques, ulcers, blisters, petechiae. The affected intraoral areas were mainly: tongue, palate, lips, gingiva, and buccal mucosa. The ""aggressive"" therapies utilized to treat COVID-19, including drug interactions may aggravate or initiate OMLs pathologies. Neglected oral hygiene or partial or complete abandonment of oral hygiene during intensive hospitalization constitutes an independent factor promoting a wide range of oral pathologies. In addition, stress factor indirectly impairs functioning of the immune system. Oral mucosa lesions occurring in COVID-19 cases present with a wide variation of non-characteristic features. These intraoral, soft tissues abnormalities seem to be reversible and transient. A potential impact of severe oral pathologies to systemic health resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with associated poor oral hygiene should not be ignored, predominantly in seriously ill patients hospitalized in intensive care units.

It explores the opinions of tunnellers and their managers about how fatigue influences or is influenced by tunnelling, and how this is managed. Fatigue and sleepiness were discussed in six focus groups with frontline workers (n = 42) and 10 manager interviews. Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all participants having experienced, or recognised in others, the feeling of sleepiness whilst at work. Fatigue and sleepiness are not commonly discussed between tunnelling workers and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue. The research shows that workers in the tunnelling construction sector are exposed to a wide range of occupational factors that potentially increase their vulnerability to fatigue, including the physical environment, repetitive and monotonous tasks, variable shift patterns and manual work. Additionally, personal factors such as social and family demands, long commute times and living away from home, can increase the risk of fatigue. The construction industry in general has gone some way to address fatigue and there is opportunity to further improve fatigue management. However, a major shift is needed before workers will feel able to openly discuss fatigue with their employer.","Maynard, Sally; Jones, Wendy; Filtness, Ashleigh; Gibb, Alistair; Haslam, Roger",Applied ergonomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818839/,129
128532,Use of MELD scores in alcoholic hepatitis.,2020-08-01,"PURPOSE Leakage of oral secretions past endotracheal tubes (ETT) has been implicated in ventilator associated pneumonia. The aim of this bench study was to compare the ability of current generation ETT cuffs to prevent fluid leakage and to determine the specific mechanical ventilator settings that affect movement of fluid across an inflated ETT cuff. METHODS Using a 2.3-cm internal diameter (ID) tracheal model and simulated ventilatory support, we evaluated the impact of cuff pressure (20 and 30 cmH(2)O), positive end-expiratory pressure/continuous positive airway pressure (PEEP/CPAP, 0-15 cmH(2)O), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP, 15-45 cmH(2)O), and mode of ventilation (volume control, volume assist/control, pressure control, pressure assist/control, and CPAP) on leakage of fluid past the ETT cuffs of 16 ETTs. The tracheal model was configured in the vertical position with 35 ml of vitaminwater(®) on top of the inflated ETT cuff and mechanically ventilated. Fluid leakage past the cuff was determined by calculating the volume change in the tracheal model after each 30-min ventilation period. Initially five 8.0-mm-ID ETTs of each manufacturer type were evaluated at baseline ventilator settings. Tubes allowing a consistent leak within two SD of the mean leakage for the five tubes were numbered in consecutive order. A single tube from this group was then randomly selected for detailed evaluation. RESULTS Cuff leakage varied among ETT types (p < 0.0001); median leak volume 6.0 ml (0.6-15.1) across all tubes under all conditions. Cuff leakage was inversely related to PEEP level, cuff pressure, and PIP except when PEEP was set at 15 cmH(2)O (all p < 0.0001). In addition, cuff leak varied among modes (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION Cuff leakage varies greatly among ETT types and is affected by cuff pressure, PEEP, PIP, and mode.","Pitts, Renée; Fisher, Daniel; Sulemanji, Demet; Kratohvil, Joseph; Jiang, Yandong; Kacmarek, Robert",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-010-2048-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20852839/,129
128554,A genetic risk score for glioblastoma multiforme based on copy number variations.,2021-03-16,"In fragment-based drug discovery, hundreds or often thousands of compounds smaller than ~300 Da are tested against the protein of interest to identify chemical entities that can be developed into potent drug candidates. Since the compounds are small, interactions are weak, and the screening method must therefore be highly sensitive; moreover, structural information tends to be crucial for elaborating these hits into lead-like compounds. Therefore, protein crystallography has always been a gold-standard technique, yet historically too challenging to find widespread use as a primary screen. Initial XChem experiments were demonstrated in 2014 and then trialed with academic and industrial collaborators to validate the process. Since then, a large research effort and significant beamtime have streamlined sample preparation, developed a fragment library with rapid follow-up possibilities, automated and improved the capability of I04-1 beamline for unattended data collection, and implemented new tools for data management, analysis and hit identification. XChem is now a facility for large-scale crystallographic fragment screening, supporting the entire crystals-to-deposition process, and accessible to academic and industrial users worldwide. The peer-reviewed academic user program has been actively developed since 2016, to accommodate projects from as broad a scientific scope as possible, including well-validated as well as exploratory projects. Academic access is allocated through biannual calls for peer-reviewed proposals, and proprietary work is arranged by Diamond's Industrial Liaison group. This workflow has already been routinely applied to over a hundred targets from diverse therapeutic areas, and effectively identifies weak binders (1%-30% hit rate), which both serve as high-quality starting points for compound design and provide extensive structural information on binding sites. The resilience of the process was demonstrated by continued screening of SARS-CoV-2 targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a 3-week turn-around for the main protease.","Douangamath, Alice; Powell, Ailsa; Fearon, Daren; Collins, Patrick M; Talon, Romain; Krojer, Tobias; Skyner, Rachael; Brandao-Neto, Jose; Dunnett, Louise; Dias, Alexandre; Aimon, Anthony; Pearce, Nicholas M; Wild, Conor; Gorrie-Stone, Tyler; von Delft, Frank",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125095/,129

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was based on a retrospective analysis of the treatment results in 50 patients with large (15-25 mm) and giant (more than 25 mm) intracranial aneurysms, aged from 18 to 75 years, who were treated at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in 2002-2014. The patients underwent a balloon occlusion test (BOT) in various modifications before stationary occlusion of the carrier artery. For vascular occlusion, we used detachable latex balloon catheters (33 cases) and microcoils (17 cases). The condition of patients in the pre- and postoperative period was assessed by using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS There were no deaths due to occlusion of the internal carotid artery (37 patients). Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients. On the basis of BOT, revascularization surgery involving placement of an extra-intracranial microanastomosis (EICMA) was performed in 6 cases. In more 4 cases, EICMA was placed in the early postoperative period due to developing signs of ischemia. Two of 7 patients underwent occlusion of both vertebral arteries (VAs) in the vertebrobasilar basin, which led to fatal outcomes. One more patient died of aggravation of brainstem compression after VA occlusion. There was no worsening of neurological symptoms among survivors. There were no deaths and persistent neurological disorders upon occlusion of branches of the main cerebral arteries, starting with the first order arteries (6 patients). Thirty one patients (66%) were followed-up in the period from 1 to 104 months. There were no deaths associated with artery occlusion. Two patients experienced delayed ischemic disorders. CONCLUSION Occlusion of the carrier artery should be performed in a carefully selected group of BOT-negative patients. This surgery can be indicated for aneurysms with a complicated configuration, the topographic and anatomical features of which exclude reconstructive surgery.","Arustamyan, S R; Yakovlev, S B; Shakhnovich, A R; Krasnoperov, I V; Sazonova, O B; Bocharov, A V; Bukharin, E Yu; Belousova, O B; Kaftanov, A N",Zhurnal voprosy neirokhirurgii imeni N.

129380,Audio Interview: Emerging Tools in the Fight against Covid-19.,2020-04-09,"The pathogen exposure history of an individual is recorded in their T-cell repertoire and can be accessed through the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs) if the tools to identify them were available. For each T-cell, the TCR loci undergoes genetic rearrangement that creates a unique DNA sequence. In theory these unique sequences can be used as biomarkers for tracking T-cell responses and cataloging immunological history. We developed the immune Cell Analysis Tool (iCAT), an R software package that analyzes TCR sequencing data from exposed (positive) and unexposed (negative) samples to identify TCR sequences statistically associated with positive samples. The presence and absence of associated sequences in samples trains a classifier to diagnose pathogen-specific exposure. We demonstrate the high accuracy of iCAT by testing on three TCR sequencing datasets. First, iCAT successfully diagnosed smallpox vaccinated versus naïve samples in an independent cohort of mice with 95% accuracy. Second, iCAT displayed 100% accuracy classifying naïve and monkeypox vaccinated mice. Finally, we demonstrate the use of iCAT on human samples before and after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the COVID-19 global pandemic. We were able to correctly classify the exposed samples with perfect accuracy. These experimental results show that iCAT capitalizes on the power of TCR sequencing to simplify infection diagnostics. iCAT provides the option of a graphical, user-friendly interface on top of usual R interface allowing it to reach a wider audience.","Rajeh, Ahmad; Wolf, Kyle; Schiebout, Courtney; Sait, Nabeel; Kosfeld, Tim; DiPaolo, Richard J; Ahn, Tae-Hyuk",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27214.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316355/,129
129495,Optical Coherence Tomography in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: What Can It Tell Us?,2021,"BACKGROUND BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN) is responsible for significant percentage of transplanted kidneys prematurely terminating their function. Its occurrence is closely related to the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS In a group of 161 newly transplanted patients we prospectively evaluated 457 protocol renal biopsies performed within the first year after transplantation. Using the calcineurin inhibitors nephrotoxicity score, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was monitored as a manifestation of excessive immunosuppression. Findings were correlated with clinical evidence of active BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) replication and PyVAN. RESULTS Compared to the normal histology, nephrotoxicity was associated with more frequent BKPyV viraemia and viruria (P = 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) and more common occurrence of PyVAN. The persistence of toxicity in the subsequent biopsy proved to be a negative risk factor of viraemia and viruria (P = 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively), independently of the initial BKPyV status. Toxicity could also be used as a predictor of viraemia and viruria (P = 0.04 and P < 0.01, respectively) even in the absence of viral replication at the time of initial biopsy. CONCLUSIONS Early histological manifestation of calcineurin inhibitors nephrotoxicity was associated with significant BKPyV reactivation in the risky first posttransplant year.

129713,Stenting as a treatment for exercise-induced intracranial hypertension from bilateral jugular vein obstruction.,2016,"BACKGROUND Diffuse intracranial susceptibility abnormalities have recently been described among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although prior studies have consisted of case reports and/or series. This brief literature review seeks to compile and catalogue the available data to elucidate characteristic features of such findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS Scientific articles and studies on intracranial microhemorrhages in the setting of COVID-19 were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. Included studies described intracranial microbleed(s) on magnetic resonance imaging in patients with COVID-19. If multiple patients were described, only patients with intracranial microhemorrhage on magnetic resonance imaging were included for analysis. Patient demographics, severity of illness (e.g. intensive care unit admission and/or intubation), time from diagnosis of COVID-19 to magnetic resonance imaging, and location(s) of any observed microhemorrhages were noted. RESULTS A total of 39 patients with suspected intracranial microhemorrhages have been described in prior studies. The average age of patients was 64.7 years; 21.9% were women. The average time between COVID-19 diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging was 31.7 days. All patients in the cohort were admitted to critical care and were either intubated or treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during their clinical course. Microhemorrhages were most commonly located in the subcortical/juxtacortical white matter and corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS Intracranial microbleeds are a well-documented finding in patients with severe COVID-19, and are most commonly callosal and subcortical/juxtacortical in location.","Benson, John C; Hunt, Christopher H; Klaas, James P; Kallmes, David F",The neuroradiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/19714009211004144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765876/,129

130022,Inflammation Modulation by Vitamin D and Calcium in the Morphologically Normal Colorectal Mucosa of Colorectal Adenoma Patients in a Clinical Trial.,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND Intra-abdominal adhesions arise after more than 50% of all abdominal operations and are an important source of postoperative complications. They attach normally separated organs to each other and can cause major problems for the affected patients by giving rise to small bowel obstruction, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, infertility, and higher complication rates in subsequent operations. They are also a frequent source of medicolegal conflict. Thus, every physician should be familiar with their mechanism of origin, their consequences, and the methods by which they can be prevented. METHODS A selective PubMed/Medline search from 1960 onward as well as articles to which these publications referred. The expert consensus position of the European Society for Gynaecological Surgery is also taken into consideration. RESULTS Adhesions arise through aberrant wound healing after peritoneal injury with further influence from a variety of other factors. Preventive measures include minimizing peritoneal injury intraoperatively through the meticulous observance of basic surgical principles, moistening the mesothelium to keep it from drying out, irrigating the peritoneal cavity to remove blood and clot, and keeping the use of intra-abdominal foreign material to a minimum. CONCLUSION Adhesions are an inevitable consequence of intra-abdominal surgery. They can be prevented to some extent with meticulous surgical technique and certain other measures. For operations carrying a high risk of postoperative adhesions, e.g., surgery on the adnexa or bowel, commercially available peritoneal instillates or barrier methods can be used to limit adhesion formation.","Brüggmann, Dörthe; Tchartchian, Garri; Wallwiener, Markus; Münstedt, Karsten; Tinneberg, Hans-Rudolf; Hackethal, Andreas",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2010.0769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21116396/,129

In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus emerged and has been classified as a pandemic. In contrast to seasonal influenza, severe disease from pandemic H1N1 seems concentrated in older children and young adults, with almost no cases reported in patients older than 60 yrs. Although patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease remain at risk, most complications have occurred among previously healthy individuals, with obesity and respiratory disease as the strongest risk factors. Pulmonary complications are common. Primary influenza pneumonia occurs most commonly in adults and may progress rapidly to acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation. Secondary bacterial infection is more common in children. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with a high mortality rate. Treatment of pneumonia should include empirical coverage for this pathogen. Neuromuscular and cardiac complications are unusual but may occur.","Rothberg, Michael B; Haessler, Sarah D",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181c92eeb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19935413/,129

Poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) is a naturally derived, absorbable polymer. P4HB has been manufactured into PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug designs for soft tissue repair. The objective of this study was to evaluate mechanical strength, resorption properties, and histologic characteristics in a porcine model. Methods. Bilateral defects were created in the abdominal wall of n = 20 Yucatan minipigs and repaired in a bridged fashion with PHASIX Mesh or P4HB Plug fixated with SorbaFix or permanent suture, respectively. Mechanical strength, resorption properties, and histologic characteristics were evaluated at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks (n = 5 each). Results. PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug repairs exhibited similar burst strength, stiffness, and molecular weight at all time points, with no significant differences detected between the two devices (P > 0.05). PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug repairs also demonstrated significantly greater burst strength and stiffness than native abdominal wall at all time points (P < 0.05), and material resorption increased significantly over time (P < 0.001). Inflammatory infiltrates were mononuclear, and both devices exhibited mild to moderate granulation tissue/vascularization. Conclusions. PHASIX Mesh and P4HB Plug demonstrated significant mechanical strength compared to native abdominal wall, despite significant material resorption over time. Histological assessment revealed a comparable mild inflammatory response and mild to moderate granulation tissue/vascularization.","Deeken, Corey R; Matthews, Brent D",ISRN surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/238067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23781348/,129

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and the rate of seroconversion in an environment with high exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: 131 health-care workers at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Västerås, Sweden, were included in the study. Abbott's SARS-COV-2 IgG immunoassay was used with a signal cut-off ratio of ≥1.4. Every third week from the beginning of May, blood samples were drawn, and the participants completed a questionnaire regarding symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and the result of any SARS-CoV-2 PCR performed since the last sampling occasion. Participants with IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were re-sampled only on the sixth and last occasion. Results: At the start of the study, 18 (15%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. At the end, 25 (19%) of 131 participants were seropositive. One case of asymptomatic infection was detected, and two cases with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 did not develop IgG antibodies. Conclusion: The low rate of seroconversion during the study suggests that it is possible to prevent transmission of SARS-COV-2 in a high-exposure environment.

More than ever, national immunization programs must be equipped to contextualize global guidance and make choices that are best suited to their setting. The CAPACITI decision-support tool has been developed in collaboration with national immunization program decision makers in LMICs to structure and document an evidence-based, context-specific process for prioritizing or selecting among multiple vaccination products, services, or strategies. METHODS The CAPACITI decision-support tool is based on multi-criteria decision analysis, as a structured way to incorporate multiple sources of evidence and stakeholder perspectives. The tool has been developed iteratively in consultation with 12 countries across Africa, Asia, and the Americas. RESULTS The tool is flexible to existing country processes and can follow any type of multi-criteria decision analysis or a hybrid approach. It is structured into 5 sections: decision question, criteria for decision making, evidence assessment, appraisal, and recommendation. The Excel-based tool guides the user through the steps and document discussions in a transparent manner, with an emphasis on stakeholder engagement and country ownership. CONCLUSIONS Pilot countries valued the CAPACITI decision-support tool as a means to consider multiple criteria and stakeholder perspectives and to evaluate trade-offs and the impact of data quality. With use, it is expected that LMICs will tailor steps to their context and streamline the tool for decision making.","Botwright, Siobhan; Giersing, Birgitte K; Meltzer, Martin I; Kahn, Anna-Lea; Jit, Mark; Baltussen, Rob; El Omeiri, Nathalie; Biey, Joseph N-M; Moore, Kelly L; Thokala, Praveen; Mwenda, Jason M; Bertram, Melanie; Hutubessy, Raymond C W",Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.04.1273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372981/,129

AREAS COVERED Four databases, the methodological quality and the risk of bias in selected publications were investigated. Seven thousand and fifty-one individuals from Italy, Saudi Arabia, China, and Vietnam. Online system and printed questionnaires were used to assess the QoL, as patients affected by primary antibody deﬁciencies, residents, people from endemic and no endemic regions and individuals with COVID-19. Different types of questionnaires utilized to evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The methodological quality of three papers was good with low risk of bias and a decrease in the QoL. EXPERT OPINION The QoL of studies populations in where COVID-19 was reported, worsened. Nevertheless, considering some indicators (infant mortality, average income, life expectancy, health coverage and average schooling years), the standard of life and subsequently the quality of life among the presented countries (China, Vietnam, Italy, and Saudi Arabia) are different.

This acute phase is followed by a chronic, refractory epilepsy and cognitive deficit, that persist for the rest of the patient's life. Still to this day no definite cause has been described. In this study we review the current finding in FIRES and describe a case of a 4-year-old patient with a dramatic course of the acute phase in FIRES and unusual presentation of the chronic phase, which is dominated by extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia.

In Denmark, it is not routine to biopsy during self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement as a treatment option for acute colorectal obstruction of unknown etiology. This is due to lack of knowledge about the risks of hemorrhage, and thus the risk to aggravate the deteriorating overview conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether there is evidence to avoid biopsy sampling during acute SEMS placement. METHODS The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies. Studies were included if they described biopsy sampling in relation to SEMS placement. Additionally, national and international guidelines were scrutinized on Google and by visiting the websites of national and international gastrointestinal societies. RESULTS In total, 43 studies were included in the review. Among these, one recommended biopsy during SEMS placement, three advised against biopsy, 23 just reported biopsy was performed during the procedure, and 16 reported biopsy before or after the procedure, or the timing was not specified. Among the 12 included guidelines, only two described biopsy during SEMS placement. CONCLUSION The literature on the subject is limited. In 24 of the 43 included studies, biopsy sampling was done during SEMS placement without reporting a decrease in the technical success rate. The included guidelines were characterized by a general lack of description of whether biopsy during SEMS placement should be performed or not.

132151,Estimates of Population-Based Incidence of Malignant Arrhythmias Associated with Medication Use - a Narrative Review.,2020-06-22,"BACKGROUND Occlusion pressure at 100 ms (P0.1), defined as the negative pressure measured 100 ms after the initiation of an inspiratory effort performed against a closed respiratory circuit, has been shown to be well correlated with central respiratory drive and respiratory effort. Automated P0.1 measurement is available on modern ventilators. However, the reliability of this measurement has never been studied. This bench study aimed at assessing the accuracy of P0.1 measurements automatically performed by different ICU ventilators. METHODS Five ventilators set in pressure support mode were tested using a two-chamber test lung model simulating spontaneous breathing. P0.1 automatically displayed on the ventilator screen (P0.1vent) was recorded at three levels of simulated inspiratory effort corresponding to P0.1 of 2.5, 5 and 10 cm H2O measured directly at the test lung and considered as the reference values of P0.1 (P0.1ref). The pressure drop after 100 ms was measured offline on the airway pressure-time curves recorded during the automated P0.1 measurements (P0.1aw). P0.1vent was compared to P0.1ref and to P0.1aw. To assess the potential impact of the circuit length, P0.1 were also measured with circuits of different lengths (P0.1circuit). RESULTS Variations of P0.1vent correlated well with variations of P0.1ref. Overall, P0.1vent underestimated P0.1ref except for the Löwenstein® ventilator at P0.1ref 2.5 cm H2O and for the Getinge group® ventilator at P0.1ref 10 cm H2O. The agreement between P0.1vent and P0.1ref assessed with the Bland-Altman method gave a mean bias of - 1.3 cm H2O (limits of agreement: 1 and - 3.7 cm H2O). Analysis of airway pressure-time and flow-time curves showed that all the tested ventilators except the Getinge group® ventilator performed an occlusion of at least 100 ms to measure P0.1. The agreement between P0.1vent and P0.1aw assessed with the Bland-Altman method gave a mean bias of 0.5 cm H2O (limits of agreement: 2.4 and - 1.4 cm H2O). The circuit's length impacted P0.1 measurements' values. A longer circuit was associated with lower P0.1circuit values. CONCLUSION P0.1vent relative changes are well correlated to P0.1ref changes in all the tested ventilators. Accuracy of absolute values of P0.1vent varies according to the ventilator model. Overall, P0.1vent underestimates P0.1ref. The length of the circuit may partially explain P0.1vent underestimation.","Beloncle, François; Piquilloud, Lise; Olivier, Pierre-Yves; Vuillermoz, Alice; Yvin, Elise; Mercat, Alain; Richard, Jean-Christophe",Annals of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-019-0576-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31520230/,129

An inspiratory pause maneuver is needed if the zero end-inspiratory flow condition cannot be satisfied under normal ventilation. We proposed a method to measure the quasi-static respiratory compliance (Cqstat) under pressure control ventilation mode without the inspiratory pause maneuver. First, a screening strategy was applied to filter out the breaths affected strongly by the spontaneous breathing efforts or artefacts. Then, we performed a virtual extrapolation of flow-time waveform when the end-inspiration flow is not zero, to allow for the calculation of Cqstatfor each kept cycle. Finally, the output Cqstatwas obtained as the average of the smallest 40 Cqstatmeasurements. The proposed method was validated against golden standard Cstat measured from real ventilated patients, and compared with two reported algorithms. The golden standard Cstat was obtained by applying end-inspiratory pause maneuver under the volume-control mode. Sixty-nine measurements from 36 patients were analyzed. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that the bias of agreement for Cqstat versus the golden standard measurement was -0.267 mL/cmH2O (95% limits of agreement -4.279 to 4.844 mL/cmH2O). The linear regression analysis indicated a strong correlation (R2= 0.90) between the Cqstatand golden standard. The results showed that the Cqstatcan be well estimated from continuous ventilator waveforms including spontaneous breathing without inspiratory pause maneuver. The method is promising to provide continuous measurement for compliance of mechanical ventilation.","Pan, Qing; Pan, Jie; Zhang, Zhongheng; Fang, Luping; Ge, Huiqing",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ac1d3b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34384069/,129

METHODS All patients who underwent elective LLR between January 1999 and December 2012 were included. Demographic data, preoperative risk factors, operative variables, histological analysis, and postoperative course were recorded. Multivariate analysis was carried out using an unconditional logistic regression model. RESULTS Between January 1999 and December 2012, 140 patients underwent LLR. There were 56 male patients (40%) and mean age was 57.8 ± 17 years. Postoperative complications were recorded in 30 patients (21.4%). Postoperative morbidity was significantly higher after LLR of malignant tumors [n = 26 (41.3%)] when compared to LLR of benign lesions [n = 4 (5.2%) (P < 0.0001)]. By multivariate analysis, operative time [OR = 1.008 (1.003-1.01), P = 0.001] and LLR performed for malignancy [OR = 9.8 (2.5-37.6); P = 0.01] were independent predictors of postoperative morbidity. In the subgroup of patients that underwent LLR for malignancy using the same multivariate model, operative time was the sole independent predictor of postoperative morbidity [OR = 1.008 (1.002-1.013); P = 0.004]. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative complication rate increases by 60% with each additional operative hour during LLR. Therefore, expected operative time should be assessed before and during LLR, especially when dealing with malignant tumor.","Tranchart, Hadrien; Gaillard, Martin; Chirica, Mircea; Ferretti, Stefano; Perlemuter, Gabriel; Naveau, Sylvie; Dagher, Ibrahim",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3965-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25472746/,129

132403,Authors' reply.,2019,"Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are well-studied and widely-applied technologies in underground water remediation. However, the releasing of chemical substances cannot be avoided during the PRBs operation. In this study, a novel permeable electrochemical reactive barrier (PERB) was fabricated for underground water remediation using a TiO2/graphite composite (TiO2/C) as the heterogeneous electrocatalyst. TiO2/C performed an electro-Fenton-like reaction on cathode and an anodic oxidation on anode respectively, along with the variety of the TiO2 lattice. The performance of this PERB system was evaluated using tetracycline hydrochloride (TTC) degradation. TTC could be degraded at a low applied potential and a wide range of pH. The degradation rate of about 60% was obtained at the optimized reaction condition: the interelectrode potential difference of 1.2 V, pH 3.0, the anode 10 cm above cathode. The relative position and spacing of the electrodes effected the mass transfer equilibrium of TTC. During the 25-day persistent degradation of TTC, the PERB system shown a perfect stability with rarely leaching of Ti. This work explored the potential for underground water remediation by the electrocatalysis with the goal of establishing a clean and eco-friendly PERB system.","Zhang, Wen; Gao, Mingming; Miao, Fei; Wu, Xiaoyan; Wang, Shuguang; Wang, Xinhua",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118548/,129

METHODS We recruited three volunteer systematic reviewers and asked them to use allocated software packages during citation screening. They then completed a 12-item online questionnaire which was tailored to capture data for the software packages used. FINDINGS All four software packages were reported to be easy or very easy to learn and use. SRA-Helper for EndNote was most favoured by participants for screening citations and Covidence for resolving conflicts. Overall, participants reported that SRA-Helper for EndNote would be their software package of choice, primarily due to its efficiency.

132919,[Umifenovir and coronavirus infections: a review of research results and clinical practice].,2020-12-26,"This biographical account summarizes the professional career and scientific contributions of John Paul Richard Thomas, a contemporary leading figure in the systematics of West Indian amphibians and non-avian reptiles, especially of blind snakes of the families Typhlopidae and Leptotyphlopidae. Since his first expedition to the West Indies in 1957, Richard's vast field experience (including three trips to Peru between 1968 and 1974), impressive collecting skills, and remarkable ability to detect phenotypic variation among natural populations have resulted in the description of more than 70 species of snakes (24 typhlopids, 4 leptotyphlopids), lizards, and frogs in 16 genera and 11 taxonomic families. Richard joined the faculty of the Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras, in 1976 and ever since his efforts significantly advanced organismal biology research at the institution. Although primarily a systematist, his desire to understand multiple aspects of an organism's biology and contagious passion for becoming intimately familiar with animals in their natural environments provided his students the opportunity to conduct research in fields such as behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Richard's mentoring fostered the scientific interests of his graduate students, who were exposed first-hand to every aspect of research, an invaluable experience that served as a springboard for the development of their professional careers inside and outside academia.

The aim of this study was to compare short- and mid-term results between laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and LSG. METHODS Observational retrospective study from a prospective database of patients undergoing LRYGB and LSG between 2004 and 2011, where 249 patients (mean age 44.7 years) were included. Patients were followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, and annually thereafter. Short- and mid-term weight loss, comorbidity improvement or resolution, postoperative complications, re-interventions, and mortality were evaluated. RESULTS One hundred thirty-five LRYGB and 114 LSG were included. Significant statistical differences between LRYGB and LSG were found in operative time (153 vs. 93 min. p < 0.001), minor postoperative complications (21.5 % vs. 4.4 %, p = 0.005), blood transfusions (8.8 % vs. 1.7 %, p = 0.015), and length of hospital stay (4 vs. 3 days, p < 0.001). There were no differences regarding major complications and re-interventions. There was no surgery-related mortality. The percentage of excess weight loss up to 4 years was similar in both groups (66 ± 13.7 vs. 65 ± 14.9 %). Both techniques showed similar results in comorbidities improvement or resolution at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS There is a similar short- and mid-term weight loss and 1-year comorbidity improvement or resolution between LRYGB and LSG, although minor complication rate is higher for LRYGB. Results of LSG as a single procedure need to be confirmed after a long-term follow-up.","Vidal, Pablo; Ramón, José M; Goday, Albert; Benaiges, David; Trillo, Lourdes; Parri, Alejandra; González, Susana; Pera, Manuel; Grande, Luís",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0828-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196992/,129

The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between blood groups and the course of COVID-19 in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 18 and over (n=39.850) were randomized in age and gender-matched groups according to blood groups Results: Advanced age, male gender and blood group A were found to be related with increased rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR =1.089, 95% CI: 1.085-1.093 for age; OR=1.963, 95% CI: 1.737-2.218 for male gender; OR=1.216, 95% CI: 1.023-1.446 for blood group A). When blood group O individuals were compared to non-O individuals, no significant difference was observed regarding the rate of hospital and ICU admission, mechanical ventilation (MV) support, length of hospital and ICU stay, and case fatality rate (CFR). The CFR in patients with blood group A, B, O, and AB were 2.6%, 2.2%, 3.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. There were no significant differences between Rh-negative and positive patients regarding the rate of hospital and ICU admission (p=0.280 and p=0.741, respectively), also the rate of MV support and CFR was similar (p=0.933 and p= 0.417).

PAP-1 (5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen), a potent small-molecule blocker of the voltage-gated potassium Kv1.3 channel, is currently in preclinical development for psoriasis. This study was undertaken to identify the major phase I metabolites of PAP-1 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 2. Five phase I metabolites, that is 5-(oxybutyric-acid)psoralen (M1), 5-[4-(4-hydroxybutoxy)]psoralen (M2), 5-[4-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)butoxy]psoralen (M3), 5-[4-(3-hydroxyphenoxy)butoxy]psoralen (M4), and 8-hydroxyl-5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (M5), were isolated from the bile of rats and identified by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The last four metabolites are new compounds. 3. Incubation of PAP-1 with SD rat liver microsomes rendered the same five major metabolites in a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent manner suggesting that cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in PAP-1 metabolism. Inhibitors of rat CYP1A1/2 (alpha-naphthoflavone) and CYP3A (ketoconazole) but not CYP2D6 (quinidine), CYP2E (diethyldithiocarbamate), or CYP2C9 (sulphaphenazole) blocked the metabolism of PAP-1 in rat microsomes. 4. Of the five metabolites M3, M4, and M5 were found to inhibit Kv1.3 currents with nanomolar IC50s, while M1 and M2 were inactive. Our results identified the Kv1.3-inactive M1 as the major phase I metabolite, and suggest that hydroxylation and O-dealkylation are the major pathways of PAP-1 metabolism. 5. We further conducted a 6-month repeat-dose toxicity study with PAP-1 at 50 mg/kg in both male and female Lewis rats and did not observe any toxic effects.","Hao, B; Chen, Z-W; Zhou, X-J; Zimin, P I; Miljanich, G P; Wulff, H; Wang, Y-X",Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,https://doi.org/10.3109/00498254.2010.532886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21070145/,129

IFN-λ4 can be generated only by individuals who carry the IFNL4-ΔG allele (rs368234815), which is the strongest known host factor for predicting clearance of HCV. The ancestral IFNL4-ΔG allele is the major variant in Africans while the minor variant in Asians, suggesting very strong negative genetic selection for this allele-most likely driven by an infectious agent other than HCV. IFN-λ4 most closely resembles IFN-λ3, but these proteins share only 29% amino-acid identity, and, in contrast to IFN-λ3, IFN-λ4 is only weakly secreted. Nevertheless, IFN-λ4 signals through the IFN-λ receptor complex and induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway. Although the IFNL4-ΔG variant is strongly associated with the failure to clear HCV infection, HCV-infected patients who carry this allele have lower baseline HCV RNA levels in the absence of treatment. Resolving the paradoxical functions of IFN-λ4, which appears to induce antiviral activity yet impair effective clearance of HCV, may yield critical new insights into the immunologic response to HCV infection and IFN biology.","O'Brien, Thomas R; Prokunina-Olsson, Ludmila; Donnelly, Raymond P",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.2013.0136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24786669/,129
134027,Characteristic neuroradiologic features in hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome.,2015,"Rationale: Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are key regulators of sodium channel inactivation. Mutations in these critical proteins have been implicated in human diseases including Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias, and epileptic encephalopathy. The underlying ionic mechanisms by which reduced sodium channel availability in Fhf2 knockout mice predisposes to abnormal excitability at the tissue level are not well defined. Objective: Using animal models and theoretical multicellular linear strands, we examined how FHF2 orchestrates the interdependency of sodium, calcium, and gap junctional conductances to safeguard cardiac conduction. Methods and Results: Fhf2KO mice were challenged by reducing calcium conductance using verapamil or by reducing gap junctional conductance using carbenoxolone or by backcrossing into a connexin 43 heterozygous (Cx43+/-) background. All conditions produced conduction block in Fhf2KO mice, with Fhf2WT showing normal impulse propagation. To explore the ionic mechanisms of block in Fhf2KO hearts, multicellular linear strand models incorporating FHF2-deficient sodium channel inactivation properties were constructed and faithfully recapitulated conduction abnormalities seen in mutant hearts. The mechanisms of conduction block in mutant strands with reduced calcium conductance or gap junction uncoupling are very different. Enhanced sodium channel inactivation due to FHF2 deficiency shifts dependence onto calcium current to sustain electrotonic driving force, axial current flow, and action potential generation from cell-to-cell. In the setting of gap junction uncoupling, slower charging time from upstream cells conspires with accelerated sodium channel inactivation in mutant strands to prevent sufficient downstream cell charging for action potential propagation. Conclusions: FHF2-dependent effects on sodium channel inactivation ensure adequate sodium current reserve to safeguard against numerous threats to reliable cardiac impulse propagation.","Park, David S; Shekhar, Akshay; Santucci Iii, John; Redel-Traub, Gabriel; Solinas, Sergio Mg; Mintz, Shana; Lin, Xianming; Chang, Ernest W; Narke, Deven; Xia, Yuhe; Goldfarb, Mitchell; Fishman, Glenn I",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.120.317349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962518/,129

We evaluated that optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement, which can reflect intracranial pressure, may be a criterion for decision of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) success. METHODS 28 adult patients suffering long overt standing ventriculomegaly (LOVA) who performed ETV were included in this retrospective study. The patients were divided into two groups as successful (group A) and failed ETV group (group B) according to their postoperative evaluation. ONSD was measured on pre- and post-operative computed tomography (CT) and Evan's index (EI), diameter of third ventricule (V3), the patency of ETV stoma and periventricular edema were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS The mean ONSD was measured as 6.39±0.92mm for the right eye, 6.50±0.91mm for the left eye on preoperative CT. The mean ONSD by CT (after surgery) was 4.89±0.87mm for the right eye, 5.02±0.1mm for the left eye (p<0.05). Postoperative group A and group B were compared according to ONSD measurement; mean ONSD in group A was 4.52±0.69mm for the right and 4.59±0.9mm for the left, mean ONSD in group B was 5.82±0.51mm for the right and 6.1±0.32mm for the left (p<0.05). The best ONSD value for detecting failed ETV was 5.40mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.938) for right and 5.91mm (sensitivity 90%, specifity 75%, AUROC 0.950) for left. EE was measured as 0.39±0.12mm on preoperative MRI and 0.39±0.12mm on postoperative MRI (p=0.3). V3 was measured as 14.7±2.47mm on preoperative MRI and 10.47±1.99mm on postoperative MRI (p<0.05). CONCLUSION The statistical values obtained from study show that the ONSD measurement can help in the postoperative evaluation of patients, who had a ETV surgery.","Akyüz, Mehmet Emin; Kadıoğlu, Hakan Hadi",Neurocirugia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucir.2021.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140223/,129

This paper reviews production processes in different medical isotope facilities during which radioxenon is produced. Radioxenon activity concentrations and isotopic compositions are calculated for six large facilities. The results are compared with calculated signals from nuclear explosions. Further, the outcome is compared and found to be consistent with radioxenon measurements recently performed in and around three of these facilities. Some anomalies in measurements in which (131m)Xe was detected were found and a possible explanation is proposed.

134454,New stent retriever devices.,2013,"PURPOSE A simple, patient-specific biomechanical model (PSBM) is proposed in which the main surgical tools and actions can be simulated, which enables clinicians to evaluate different strategies for an optimal surgical planning. A prospective and comparative clinical study was performed to assess early clinical and radiological results. METHODS From January 2019 to July 2019, a PSBM was created for every operated acetabular fracture (simulation group). DICOM data were extracted from the pre-operative high-resolution CT scans to build a 3D model of the fracture using segmentation methods. A PSBM was implemented in a custom software allowing a biomechanical simulation of the surgery in terms of reduction sequences. From July 2019 to December 2019, every patient with an operated for acetabular fracture without PSBM was included in the standard group. Surgery duration, blood loss, radiological results and per-operative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. RESULTS Twenty-two patients were included, 10 in the simulation group and 12 in the standard group. The two groups were comparable regarding age, time to surgery, fracture pattern distribution and surgical approaches. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the simulation group: 113 min ± 33 (60-180) versus 184 ± 58 (90-260), p = 0.04. The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the simulation group, p = 0.01. No statistical significant differences were found regarding radiological results (p = 0.16). No per-operative complications were recorded. CONCLUSION This study confirms that pre-operative planning in acetabular surgery based on a PSBM results in a shorter operative time and a reduction of blood loss during surgery. This study also confirms the feasibility of PSBM planning in daily clinical routine.

Numerous studies have been conducted to clarify the risk factors for POPF after DP, and to also determine effective prophylactic treatments. In this article, we review the current evidence on the risk factors for POPF after DP, and also provide new evidence to support the currently implemented prophylactic measures against POPF after DP. The patient-related and surgery-related risk factors and risk factors specific to staplers are discussed. Several studies have suggested that a thick pancreas is a risk factor for POPF using a stapler and that a higher stapler height or pancreatoenteric anastomosis might be useful for preventing POPF when transecting a thick pancreas. Various methods, such as stapler closure, procedures that may be performed in addition to stapler closure, pancreatoenteric anastomosis, pancreatic transection devices, laparoscopic surgery, pancreatic stenting, stump coverage, and somatostatin analogs, have been tested and in comparison with conventional procedures in case-control studies and randomized, controlled trials. Although some studies have shown the superiority of these methods to the conventional procedures, a consensus on precautionary measures that can be taken against POPF remains to be established.

METHODS Comatose survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (n=82) were randomised to standard (24h) or prolonged (48h) duration of TTM at 33±1°C. Blood samples were drawn 22, 46 and 70h after attaining the target temperature. Samples were analysed for rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM® (EXTEM®, INTEM®, FIBTEM® and HEPTEM®)) and thrombin generation using the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram® assay. RESULTS With the 22-h sample, we revealed no difference between groups in the ROTEM® and thrombin generation results beside a slightly higher EXTEM® and INTEM® maximum velocity in the prolonged group (p-values≤0.04). With the 46-h sample, ROTEM® showed no differences when using EXTEM®; however, 11% (p<0.01) longer clotting time and 12% (p<0.01) longer time to maximum velocity were evident in the prolonged group than in the standard group when using INTEM®. The prolonged group had reduced thrombin generation compared with the standard group as indicated by 30% longer lag time (p=0.04), 106nM decreased peak concentration (p<0.001), 36% longer time to peak (p=0.01) and 411 nM*minute decreased endogenous thrombin potential (p<0.001). With the 70-h sample, no differences in ROTEM® results were found between groups. However, the prolonged group had reduced thrombin generation indicated by longer lag time, decreased peak concentration and longer time to peak (all p-values≤0.02) compared with the standard group.

135228,Vaccination Compliance and the US Measles Epidemic--Reply.,2015,"The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presents a global health emergency in urgent need of interventions1-3. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the target cells depends on binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein and the ACE2 cell receptor2,4-6. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of 206 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from single B cells of eight SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We identified antibodies with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity that correlates with their competitive capacity with ACE2 for RBD binding. Surprisingly, neither the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies nor the infected plasma cross-reacted with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV RBDs, although substantial plasma cross-reactivity to their trimeric Spike proteins was found. Crystal structure analysis of RBD-bound antibody revealed steric hindrance that inhibits viral engagement with ACE2 and thereby blocks viral entry. These findings suggest that anti-RBD antibodies are viral species-specific inhibitors. The antibodies identified here may be candidates for the development of SARS-CoV-2 clinical interventions.","Ju, Bin; Zhang, Qi; Ge, Jiwan; Wang, Ruoke; Sun, Jing; Ge, Xiangyang; Yu, Jiazhen; Shan, Sisi; Zhou, Bing; Song, Shuo; Tang, Xian; Yu, Jinfang; Lan, Jun; Yuan, Jing; Wang, Haiyan; Zhao, Juanjuan; Zhang, Shuye; Wang, Youchun; Shi, Xuanling; Liu, Lei; Zhao, Jincun; Wang, Xinquan; Zhang, Zheng; Zhang, Linqi",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2380-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32454513/,129
135460,"Update on Journal of Investigative Medicine-yes, we are on the right road!",2021-03-01,"Accurate diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is critical to effective management and intervention, but can be challenging in patients with mild TBI. A substantial number of studies have reported the use of circulating biomarkers as signatures for TBI, capable of improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision making beyond current practice standards. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively and critically evaluate the existing body of evidence for the use of blood protein biomarkers (S100 calcium binding protein B [S100B], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], neuron specific enolase [NSE], ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 [UCH-L1]. tau, and neurofilament proteins) for diagnosis of intracranial lesions on CT following mild TBI. Effects of potential confounding factors and differential diagnostic performance of the included markers were explored. Further, appropriateness of study design, analysis, quality, and demonstration of clinical utility were assessed. Studies published up to October 2016 were identified through a MEDLINE®, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) search. Following screening of the identified articles, 26 were selected as relevant. We found that measurement of S100B can help informed decision making in the emergency department, possibly reducing resource use; however, there is insufficient evidence that any of the other markers is ready for clinical application. Our work pointed out serious problems in the design, analysis, and reporting of many of the studies, and identified substantial heterogeneity and research gaps. These findings emphasize the importance of methodologically rigorous studies focused on a biomarker's intended use, and defining standardized, validated, and reproducible approaches. The living nature of this systematic review, which will summarize key updated information as it becomes available, can inform and guide future implementation of biomarkers in the clinical arena.","Mondello, Stefania; Sorinola, Abayomi; Czeiter, Endre; Vámos, Zoltán; Amrein, Krisztina; Synnot, Anneliese; Donoghue, Emma; Sándor, János; Wang, Kevin K W; Diaz-Arrastia, Ramon; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Menon, David K; Maas, Andrew I R; Buki, Andras",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2017.5182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29020853/,129
135510,The effect of graduated compression stockings on long-term outcomes after stroke: the CLOTS trials 1 and 2.,2013,"BACKGROUND Concerns have been raised regarding the toxicity of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for esophageal cancer that could contribute to an increased risk of postoperative complications. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the radiation dose to the gastric fundus on the risk of postoperative anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing nCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy. METHODS Between January 2012 and July 2015, 97 consecutive patients who underwent nCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy were included in this single-center cohort study. The gastric fundus was contoured on the pretreatment planning computed tomography. Within this contour, dose-volume histogram variables were calculated, and logistic regression analysis was used to determine their influence on the risk of anastomotic leakage. RESULTS In 25 of 97 patients (26%) anastomotic leakage occurred. The mean radiation dose to the gastric fundus was significantly higher in patients with than without leakage (median 35.6 Gy versus 24.9 Gy, respectively, p = 0.047). A mean dose more than versus less than 31.4 Gy was associated with leakage rates of 43% versus 15%, respectively. Adjusted for tumor location, clinical T stage, and radiation method, the mean radiation dose to the gastric fundus remained significantly and independently associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage (adjusted odds ratio 1.05 per 1-Gy increase, 95% confidence interval: 1.002 to 1.10, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS Efforts should be made to minimize the radiation dose to the gastric fundus when planning nCRT for esophageal cancer, because higher dose levels to the gastric fundus are associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage after subsequent transthoracic esophagectomy and cervical anastomosis.","Goense, Lucas; van Rossum, Peter S N; Ruurda, Jelle P; van Vulpen, Marco; Mook, Stella; Meijer, Gert J; van Hillegersberg, Richard",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.08.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27765168/,129
135682,Robotic Cardiac Surgery: What the Young Surgeon Should Know.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Primary endovascular reconstruction with flow diversion represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the technique of endovascular aneurysm treatment. Unlike coil embolization, often there remains residual post-procedural filling within the aneurysm with flow diverters, the curative reconstruction presumably occurring over a period of weeks. Thus, conventional grading scales for post-procedural aneurysm occlusion and recanalization are inadequate. The aim of this paper is to propose a new angiographic grading scale that addresses this fundamentally new treatment option. METHOD A five-point grading scale describes the location of residual flow within the aneurysm in the venous phase [grade 1: patent aneurysm with diffuse inflow; grade 2: residual filling of the aneurysm dome (saccular) or wall (fusiform); grade 3: only residual neck (saccular) or only intra-aneurysmal filling with former boundaries covered (fusiform); grade 4: complete occlusion]. FINDINGS Grade 0 represents any aneurysm, regardless of occlusion rate with early phase, coherent inflow jet. Intra-aneurysmal flow stagnation is categorized into: (a) none, (b) capillary phase, and (c) venous phase. Prevailing parent vessel hemodynamics with in-stent stenosis (ISS) are divided into none (ISS0), mild (ISS1), moderate (ISS2), severe (ISS3), and total (ISS4) occlusion. The proposed grading scales allow assessment of the hemodynamic consequences of stent placement on endosaccular in-flow, stasis, and location of stasis as well as parent vessel hemodynamics. CONCLUSIONS Further studies need to show the applicability and possible predictive value of this new grading scale on the efficacy of the stent in promoting intra-aneurysmal flow stagnation, thus creating the potential to harmonize the results of future papers. This may help to optimize treatment and future device design.","Grunwald, Iris Quasar; Kamran, M; Corkill, R A; Kühn, A L; Choi, I S; Turnbull, S; Dobson, D; Fassbender, K; Watson, D; Gounis, M J",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-011-1177-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22002552/,129
135707,Postictal serotonin levels are associated with peri-ictal apnea.,2019,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies - such as smartphone apps, vir-tual reality, chatbots, and social media - have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for ""digital phenotyping"" and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions - including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders - as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.","Torous, John; Bucci, Sandra; Bell, Imogen H; Kessing, Lars V; Faurholt-Jepsen, Maria; Whelan, Pauline; Carvalho, Andre F; Keshavan, Matcheri; Linardon, Jake; Firth, Joseph",World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association,https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505369/,129

We report our outcomes of a standardized 25 mm circular-stapled anastomosis using a trans-orally placed anvil (Orvil™). The objective of this study is to report the initial experience of introducing two-stage MIO to an Australian tertiary health service. METHODS We describe our consecutive case series of all MIOs performed from a prospectively maintained database. We assessed the morbidity and mortality of MIO at our institution. We compared our first 30 cases to the second cohort of 32 cases. RESULTS There were 62 two-stage MIOs performed from 2011 to 2015. The average age was 65 years. Median length of stay was 13 days (5-72 days). Median number of total lymph nodes was 14. Conversion occurred in three patients (5%). Major morbidity was 45%. Delayed gastric emptying 6% (n = 4), pneumonia 6% (n = 4), chyle leak 6% (n = 4), pulmonary embolus 2% (n = 1) and grade II or III anastomotic leak 5% (n = 4). One conduit ischaemia (2%) required reoperation and formation of oesophagostomy. There was one post-operative death within 30 days. There were five post-oesophagectomy hiatal hernias requiring re-operation (8%). There was a significant improvement in operative time (minutes) from the first to second cohort 588 versus 464 (P-value 0.01). CONCLUSION The introduction of two-stage MIO to the Australian setting can be safely instituted. Our unit was still within a learning curve after 30 cases.","Johnson, Mary A; Kariyawasam, Sanjeeva; Epari, Krishna; Ballal, Mohammed",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.14740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30117626/,129
136080,IQGAP3 promotes cancer proliferation and metastasis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.,2020-08-01,"During physiological stress (e.g., exercise, hypoxia), blood flow is shunted to specific anatomical regions to protect critical organs; yet, splenic blood flow in these circumstances remains to be investigated. Despite being classically viewed as a non-critical organ, recent experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests the spleen plays a significant role in cardiovascular pathophysiology. We hypothesized that splenic blood flow is prioritized in the development of heart failure (i.e., chronic state of reduced cardiac output). Five-week-old male Wistar rats were randomized for either myocardial infarction (MI; n = 58) or sham (n = 56) surgery. At 2, 5, and 9 weeks post-surgery, Doppler ultrasound measurements of the splenic, left renal, left common carotid, and left femoral arteries were performed. Cardiac function was assessed at all time points using echocardiography and at 9 weeks post-surgery using invasive hemodynamic analysis. Splenic and cerebral blood flow was preferentially maintained at 9 weeks post-MI, whereas blood flow to the lower limb and kidney were reduced. Spleen size increased by 5 weeks post-MI and remained elevated. Splenic blood flow was maintained in conditions of decreased cardiac output, when other tissues showed decreased blood flow. The maintenance of blood flow in the face of decreased cardiac output indicates that splenic function is being prioritized during heart failure.","Ruggiero, Sara A; Huber, Jason S; Murrant, Coral L; Brunt, Keith R; Simpson, Jeremy A",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2018-0134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102865/,129

136425,Response to letter on endoscopic ultrasound-guided thrombin injection a management approach for visceral artery pseudoaneurysm: case series.,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVE Non-medical antenatal care (ANC) refers to a range of non-medical services available to women during pregnancy aiming at supporting women and prepare them for the birth and the postpartum period. In Germany, they include antenatal classes, breastfeeding classes and pregnancy-specific yoga or gymnastics courses. Studies suggest that various types of non-medical ANC carry benefits for both the women and their babies. Little is known about the uptake of non-medical ANC among different socioeconomic population subgroups, but one may expect lower utilization among socio-economically disadvantaged women. We analyzed factors contributing to the utilization of non-medical ANC in general and antenatal classes in particular. METHODS Baseline data of the Bielefeld BaBi birth cohort (2013-2016) and the Berlin perinatal study (2011-2012) were analyzed. Comparing the two cohorts allowed to increase the socio-economic and migration background variance of the study population and to capture the effect of the local context on uptake of services. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study associations between the uptake of non-medical ANC and socio-economic and migration status. RESULTS In Berlin and Bielefeld, being a first generation migrant and having lower levels of education were associated with lower non-medical ANC uptake. In Berlin, being a 2nd generation woman or having a low income was also associated with lower uptake. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE Our study suggests that non-medical ANC remains in some part the prerogative of non-migrant, well-educated and economically privileged women. Since differences in non-medical ANC have the potential to create inequalities in terms of birth outcomes and maternal health during pregnancy and post-partum, more efforts are needed to promote the use of non-medical ANC by all population groups.","Ludwig, Angelique; Miani, Céline; Breckenkamp, Jürgen; Sauzet, Odile; Borde, Theda; Doyle, Ina-Merle; Brenne, Silke; Höller-Holtrichter, Chantal; David, Matthias; Spallek, Jacob; Razum, Oliver",Maternal and child health journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-02937-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388767/,129

The authors aimed to evaluate the results of LVMR in patients with internal rectal prolapse (IRP) external rectal prolapse (ERP). MATERIALS AND METHODS From September 2013 to January 2019, 122 patients with IRP (n=48) or ERP (n=74) underwent LVMR. Constipation and fecal incontinence (FI) scores were evaluated using the Cleveland Clinic Florida score preoperatively and postoperatively. The questionnaire for the change of obstructed defecation or FI symptoms after surgery was also administered to grade the results as cured, improved, unchanged, or worsened for each survey. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 61.9 years. The mean operation time was 116.5 minutes, and the mean hospital stay was 5.1 days. The mean follow-up was 42.1 months. There were no mesh-related complications. Eight patients (10.7%) among the ERP group required additional surgery for recurrent full-thickness prolapse. Eleven patients (14.7%) who had mucosal prolapse within 2 cm underwent stapled hemorrhoidopexy after LVMR. In the postoperative 6-month period, the overall constipation score (7.12) significantly improved compared with the preoperative score (13.03) (P<0.001), whereas the FI score significantly improved after surgery (12.16 to 8.92; P<0.001). CONCLUSION LVMR is a feasible and safe technique and favorable recurrence for ERP. Functional outcomes of obstructed defecation and FI were improved and the satisfaction of LVMR was high after the surgery.

Travel restrictions and limits on large public gatherings have necessitated the cancelling of numerous regional and national conferences as well as local grand rounds at many academic centers. Podcasting provides a potential solution for providing CME in a safe, socially distant way as an alternative to these more traditional CME sources for health care professionals. Using a popular CME podcast for pediatric hospitalists as an example, this article describes the many advantages that podcasting poses over more traditional CME methods, outlines some of the methodological and technological considerations that go into creating a high-quality podcast, and describes how podcasting can be leveraged during a global pandemic. Finally, we identify areas for further research regarding podcasting, including effective ways to virtually replace the more social and community building aspects of traditional conferences and grand rounds.","Tarchichi, Tony R; Szymusiak, John",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,https://doi.org/10.1097/ceh.0000000000000324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346569/,129

The aims of this study were to explore the impacts of COVID 19 on the students' perceptions of readiness for practice and their preparation for the NCLEX exam and initial clinical practice. METHODS A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on senior BSN students' preparation for NCLEX and future careers. The Casey-Fink Readiness for Practice Survey was used to investigate the perceptions of the BSN students' clinical confidence and readiness for practice. RESULTS Students reported substantial impacts of COVID-19 on their clinical experiences, their ability to practice skills and procedures, their preparations for NCLEX exam, and their nursing career. The most significant confidence concerns noted from this study seemed to center on handling multiple patient assignments, calling the physician, responding to a change in patient condition, and treating a dying patient. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare experts expect that the impact of COVID-19 may last until 2022. More research is needed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on nursing education and transition to nursing practice.

137177,The delicate topic of mentorship.,2019-11-27,"Background Varicocele is abnormal dilation of testis veins. The precise mechanism of varicocele is not fully understood despite some hypothesis were suggested in the literature. Disequilibrium between constrictor and dilatator mechanism of the veins have been shown to cause varicocele. High-grade varicoceles have been also linked to endothelial dysfunction and increased vasoconstriction. Objectives We hypothesized that epicardial fat thickness (EFT), flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and aortic stiffness (AS) could be associated with varicocele. In the present study, we aimed to compare vascular parameters such as FMD, EFT and AS in healthy subjects and high-grade varicocele patients. Methods The study population consisted of 35 men with high-grade varicocele and 32 age- and sex-matched control subjects younger than 45 years old. This is a cross-sectional study conducted at Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University Hospital between May to October 2018. Results EFT, aortic diastolic diameters (AoDD) and EFT/BMI ratio were significantly higher in control group than in patients with high-grade (p=0.012, p=0.044, p=0.026, respectively). EFT and EFT /BMI ratio were significantly and inversely correlated with presence of varicocele (r=-0.422, p=0.009; r=-0.38, p=0.026, respectively). Conclusion The present study suggests that high-grade varicocele may be associated with decreased echocardiographic EFT but not with aortic stiffness and FMD.","Sincer, Isa; Erdal, Emrah; Gucuk, Adnan; Bostancı, Emre; Gunes, Yilmaz",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394236/,129

In adults, CIMT is predictive of myocardial infarction and stroke. In children and adolescents, CIMT is used to assess vascular changes in the presence of CVD risk factors (obesity, hypertension, smoking, etc) or clinical conditions associated with a high risk for premature CVD. However, there is no comprehensive overview, in a life-course epidemiology perspective, of the risk factors and determinants of CIMT in children. It is also important to evaluate between-study differences in CIMT measurement methods and take them into consideration when drawing conclusions. Our objective is to systematically review the evidence on the relationship between CIMT and prenatal and postnatal exposures or interventions in children, as well as documenting and discussing the CIMT measurement methods. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Systematic searches of the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica (EMBASE)and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases will be conducted. The reference lists and other literatures sources will be browsed. Observational and experimental studies in children from birth up to 18 years will be included. Prenatal and postnatal exposures or interventions assessed in relationship with CIMT will be considered for inclusion. Examples might include gestational age, obesity, hypertension, tobacco exposure, specific at-risk conditions (chronic kidney disease, diabetes, etc) or statin treatment. The outcome will be CIMT assessed by ultrasonography. The setting, scanning and measurement methods for each included study will be described in detail. Results will be synthesised descriptively and, if appropriate, will be pooled across studies to perform meta-analyses. Separate meta-analyses for each exposure or intervention type will be conducted.

137756,Audio Interview: Eight Months of Action and Inaction against Covid-19.,2020-09-24,"AIM To determine the relationship between obstructed defaecation syndrome (ODS) and rectoceles. METHOD From December 2007 to November 2011, all female patients with ODS were prospectively evaluated with full interview, clinical examination and anorectal physiology testing. The characteristics of patients with and without rectoceles were compared, and logistic regression was utilized to identify factors predictive of patients having a rectocele beyond the introitus. RESULTS Of 239 patients with ODS, 90 (mean age: 52.3 ± 1.7 years) had a rectocele. Patients with rectoceles (R+) had a similar prevalence of incomplete emptying compared with patients with no rectocele (R-) (P ≥ 0.21), but only R+ patients reported splinting with defaecation (36.7% vs 0%; P < 0.0001). Anorectal manometry measurements, including mean resting pressure, maximum resting pressure and maximum squeeze pressure, were similar between groups (P ≥ 0.12). There were also no significant differences in rectal compliance (maximum tolerated volume) or rectal sensitivity (volume of first sensation) (P ≥ 0.65). R+ patients had greater difficulty expelling a 60 cm(3) balloon (70.1% R+ patients vs 57.5% R- patients; P = 0.05), but the prevalence of pelvic floor dyssynergia, as quantified by nonrelaxation on electromyography (EMG) testing, was similar to that of R- patients (P = 0.49). Logistic regression suggested that only difficulty with balloon expulsion was associated with higher odds of having a rectocele (OR = 3.00; P = 0.002), whereas mean resting pressure, EMG nonrelaxation and symptoms of incomplete emptying were not (P ≥ 0.12). CONCLUSION Rectoceles are not associated with an increased severity of ODS-type symptoms, anorectal abnormalities or pelvic floor dyssynergia in patients with ODS. This suggests that rectoceles may be the result, rather than the cause, of ODS.","Hicks, C W; Weinstein, M; Wakamatsu, M; Pulliam, S; Savitt, L; Bordeianou, L",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.12213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23527537/,129
138305,tPA for stroke: important progress in achieving faster treatment.,2014,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVE This systematic literature review explores and maps what we know about survivorship to understand how survivorship can be theoretically defined. BACKGROUND Survivorship of critical illness has been identified as a challenge for the 21st Century. Whilst the use of the term 'survivorship' is now common in critical care, it has been borrowed from the cancer literature where the discourse on what survivorship means in a cancer context is ongoing and remains largely descriptive. In the absence of a theoretical understanding, the term 'survivorship' is often used in critical illness in a generic way, limiting our understanding of what survivorship is. The current COVID-19 pandemic adds to an urgency of understanding what intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship might mean, given the emerging long-term consequences of this patient cohort. We set out to explore how survivorship after critical illness is being conceptualised and what the implications might be for clinical practice and research. DESIGN Integrated systematic literature review. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. PRISMA guidelines were followed and a PRISMA checklist for reporting systematic reviews completed. RESULTS The three main themes around which the reviewed studies were organised are: (a) healthcare system; (b) ICU survivors' families; and (c) ICU survivor's identity. These three themes feed into an overarching core theme of 'ICU Survivorship Experiences'. These themes map our current knowledge of what happens when a patient survives a critical illness and where we are in understanding ICU survivorship. CONCLUSION We mapped in this systematic review the different pieces of the jigsaw that emerge following critical illness to understand and see the bigger picture of what happens after patients survive critical illness. It is evident that existing research has mapped these connections, but what we have not managed to do yet is defining what survivorship is theoretically. We offer a preliminary definition of survivorship as a process but are aware that this definition needs to be developed further with patients and families.","Kean, Susanne; Donaghy, Eddie; Bancroft, Angus; Clegg, Gareth; Rodgers, Sheila",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829568/,129

This requires primary-level palliative care capacity, but many healthcare professionals lack core competencies in this area. Pallium Canada, a non-profit organisation, has been building primary-level palliative care at a national level since 2000, largely through its Learning Essential Approaches to Palliative Care (LEAP) education programme and its compassionate communities efforts. From 2015 to 2019, 1603 LEAP course sessions were delivered across Canada, reaching 28 123 learners from different professions, including nurses, physicians, social workers and pharmacists. This paper describes the factors that have accelerated and impeded spread and scale-up of these programmes. The need for partnerships with local, provincial and federal governments and organisations is highlighted. A social enterprise model, that involves diversifying sources of revenue to augment government funding, enhances long-term sustainability. Barriers have included Canada's geopolitical realities, including large geographical area and thirteen different healthcare systems. Some of the lessons learned and strategies that have evolved are potentially transferrable to other jurisdictions.","Pereira, Jose; Chary, Srini; Faulkner, Jonathan; Tompkins, Bonnie; Moat, Jeffrey B",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2021-003036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315718/,129
138512,Exploring the Therapeutic Potentials of Highly Selective Oxygenated Chalcone Based MAO-B Inhibitors in a Haloperidol-Induced Murine Model of Parkinson's Disease.,2020-09-16,"Parasitism is arguably the most commonly occurring consumer strategy. However, only a few food web studies assess how well stable isotopes reflect the trophic position of parasitic consumers and results are variable. Even fewer studies have measured the nutrient transfer by parasitic consumers, hindering an assessment of their role in nutrient transfer through food webs. Here we used a food chain consisting of a diatom as host, a chytrid as its parasitic consumer and a rotifer as the predatory consumer of the chytrid, to assess the trophic position of all three food-chain components using their natural 13C and 15N isotope signatures, and to measure the nitrogen transfer from the host via the chytrid to the rotifer by tracing 15N of a labelled host up the food chain. Additionally, we measured the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios of all food-chain components. Natural isotope abundance results showed no clear 15N enrichment in the chytrid or rotifer relative to the primary producer. However, estimates of nitrogen transfer indicated that about 14% of host nitrogen was transferred per day from host to chytrid during infection epidemics and that some of this nitrogen was also transferred onward to the rotifer. Moreover, C:N ratios decreased with trophic level, suggesting that the chytrid provided a high-quality food source to the rotifer. In conclusion, our results support the ""mycoloop"". The mycooloop proposes that chytrid infections allow the transfer of nutrients bound in large, inedible phytoplankton to zooplankton through the production of edible transmission spores, thereby rerouting nutrients back into the food web.","Sánchez Barranco, Virginia; Van der Meer, Marcel T J; Kagami, Maiko; Van den Wyngaert, Silke; Van de Waal, Dedmer B; Van Donk, Ellen; Gsell, Alena S",Oecologia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04721-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803339/,129
138572,Safety Profile and Adverse Events of Special Interest for Fruquintinib in Chinese Patients with Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: Analysis of the Phase 3 FRESCO Trial.,2020-09-08,"As older adults have frequently been portrayed as one homogeneous and vulnerable risk group in public debates and in the media immediately after the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, a general shift toward less favorable attitude toward own aging (ATOA) might have resulted. In contrast, individuals may feel younger than before the pandemic, reflecting a psychological mechanism to avoid identifying themselves with the old age ""risk group."" We investigate 12-year trajectories of ATOA and subjective age among middle-aged and older German adults based on assessments between 2008 and Summer 2020 (N = 7,730; age in 2008: 40-93 years, M = 62.41). Based on longitudinal multilevel regression models, we found that for ATOA, a model including a potentially ""pandemic-driven"" change component between 2017 and 2020 in addition to an overall linear change between 2008 and 2020 revealed a better fit than a linear change model without that additional change component. Mean-level decline in ATOA between 2017 and 2020 was five times steeper in such a model than in a linear change model that did not include an additional 2017-2020 change component. The extent of intraindividual ATOA change between 2017 and 2020 varied interindividually, but for more than 99% of the sample, particularly among those with poorer self-rated health, ATOA became less favorable. There was very limited evidence for a pandemic-specific change in subjective age. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the early phase of the pandemic might have caused a change toward less favorable ATOA, whereas it did not affect subjective age.

138638,"Impact of recanalization, reperfusion, and collateral flow on clinical efficacy.",2013,"INTRODUCTION Failure to rescue is defined as mortality after complications during hospital care. Incidence ranges 10.9%-13.3% and several national reports such as National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcomes and Death and National Institute of Clinical Excellence CG 50 highlight failure to rescue as a significant problem for safe patient care.To avoid failure to rescue events, there must be successful escalation of care. Studies indicate that human factors such as situational awareness, team working, communication and a culture promoting safety contribute to avoidance of failure to rescue events. Understanding human factors is essential to developing work systems that mitigate barriers and facilitate prompt escalation of care. This qualitative evidence synthesis will identify and synthesise what is known about the human factors that affect escalation of care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and CINAHL, between database inception and 2018, for studies describing human factors affecting failure to rescue and/or care escalation. A search strategy was developed by two researchers and a medical librarian. Only studies exploring in-hospital (ward) populations using qualitative data collection methods will be included. Screening will be conducted by two researchers. We are likely to undertake a thematic synthesis, using the Thomas and Harden framework. Selected studies will be assessed for quality, rigour and limitations. Two researchers will extract and thematically synthesise codes using a piloted data extraction tool to develop analytical themes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The qualitative evidence synthesis will use available published literature and no ethical approval is required.

138965,Executive Summary of the Early-Onset Breast Cancer Evidence Review Conference: Correction.,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND In laparoscopic anterior resection, minilaparotomy still is required. Recently, transvaginal hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) techniques for cholecystectomy have been described. Reports on operations that require removal of larger specimens, as in anterior resection, are scarce and limited primarily to small case series and case reports. The current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of transvaginal rigid-hybrid NOTES anterior resection (tvAR) for symptomatic diverticular disease. METHODS All female patients presenting with symptomatic diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon were candidates for inclusion in the study. The exclusion criteria specified failure to sign informed consent, previous colorectal resection, anesthesiologic contraindication for pneumoperitoneum, liver failure and coagulopathy, severe acute diverticular bleeding, internal fistula with abscess (Hinchey 2b), perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis (Hinchey 3 or 4), gynecologic or urologic contraindications, and absence of preoperative gynecologic examination. A preoperative and 2-week postoperative gynecologic examination was performed. Quality of life and sexual function were assessed preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Of 70 patients, 45 (64.3%) were scheduled for tvAR. Five patients were withdrawn at the beginning of laparoscopy with no transvaginal access performed. Of the remaining 40 patients with attempted tvAR, 4 patients underwent conversion to a minilaparotomy (Pfannenstiel incision) and 2 patients were converted to a total median laparotomy. For 34 patients (85%), the operation was completed transvaginally. A total of 2 major complications and 10 minor complications occurred. No serious postoperative gynecologic morbidity was experienced. At 6 weeks postoperatively, sexual function did not differ significantly from preoperative status. CONCLUSIONS For symptomatic diverticular disease, TvAR is feasible, although the presented technique requires laparoscopic expertise and further refinement.","Tarantino, Ignazio; Linke, Georg R; Lange, Jochen; Siercks, Ikbale; Warschkow, René; Zerz, Andreas",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1666-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21487875/,129
139082,The Role of Imaging in Current Treatment Strategies for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,2020-08-28,"OBJECTIVES Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak, different strategies have been explored to stem the spread of the disease and appropriately manage patient flow. Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. Methods. In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Liège University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","Gilbert, Allison; Brasseur, Edmond; Petit, Mérédith; Donneau, Anne Françoise; Diep, AnhNguyet; Hetzel Campbell, Suzanne; Servotte, Jean-Christophe; Piazza, Justine; Ancion, Aurore; Gensburger, Mathieu; D'Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2020.1778348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531181/,129

Stroke occurrence after TAVR, both periprocedure and at follow-up, has not been well described. We sought to review incidence, pathophysiology, predictors, prognosis, and current preventive strategies of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) after TAVR. Studies were selected from a Medline search if they contained clinical outcomes data after TAVR. Acute and subacute CVAs after TAVR have been reported in 3% to 6% of patients. Approximately 45% of CVAs occur within 2 days after TAVR; 28% between 3 and 10 days; 4% between 10 and 30 days; and 10.5% occur from 1 month to 2 years. Clinically silent cerebral embolisms have been reported, with an incidence greatly exceeding that of overt CVAs. Underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms for CVAs can be broadly categorized into embolic and nonembolic causes, as well as procedural and postprocedural (early and late). Important predictors of early CVAs are small aortic valve area, atrial fibrillation, and balloon postdilation, whereas late CVAs are mostly influenced by chronic atrial fibrillation, prior cerebrovascular disease, and transapical approach. Following stroke, patients exhibit increased morbidity and mortality. A multilevel approach for the prevention of CVAs includes improved interventional techniques, embolic protection devices, antithrombotic treatment, close monitoring, and aggressive management of modifiable risk factors. Technology advances notwithstanding stroke morbidity and mortality remains steady. The significance of silent cerebral embolism on prognosis remains uncertain, and optimal medical treatment during and after TAVR should be further investigated.","Mastoris, Ioannis; Schoos, Mikkel M; Dangas, George D; Mehran, Roxana",Clinical cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.22328; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403514/,129
139570,Mediastinal Fat Necrosis.,2020-05-13,"Segmentation of pneumonia lesions from CT scans of COVID-19 patients is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up. Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation.","Wang, Guotai; Liu, Xinglong; Li, Chaoping; Xu, Zhiyong; Ruan, Jiugen; Zhu, Haifeng; Meng, Tao; Li, Kang; Huang, Ning; Zhang, Shaoting",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.3000314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730215/,129

It has been reported in humans, cattle, buffaloes and dogs, but so far not in cats. In humans, EBS is most frequently caused by variants in the KRT5 or KRT14 genes. Here, we report a case of feline epidermolysis bullosa simplex and describe the causative genetic variant. An 11-month-old male domestic shorthair cat presented with a history of sloughed paw pads and ulcerations in the oral cavity and inner aspect of the pinnae, starting a few weeks after birth. Clinical and histopathological findings suggested a congenital blistering disease with a split formation within the basal cell layer of the epidermis and oral mucous epithelium. The genetic investigation revealed a homozygous nonsense variant in the KRT14 gene (c.979C>T, p.Gln327*). Immunohistochemistry showed a complete absence of keratin 14 staining in all epithelia present in the biopsy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of feline EBS, and the first report of a spontaneous pathogenic KRT14 variant in a non-human species.

140747,Breast contrast-enhanced MR imaging: semiautomatic detection of vascular map.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The advent of modern neuroendovascular techniques has highlighted the need for a simple, effective, and reliable brain arteriovenous malformation endovascular grading scale. A novel scale of this type has recently been described. It incorporates the number of feeding arteries, eloquence, and the presence of an arteriovenous fistula component. Our aim is to assess the validity of this grading scale. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all suspected brain arteriovenous malformations at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2005 to 2013, identifying 126 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Spearman correlations between endovascular and Spetzler-Martin grading scales and long-term outcomes were performed. Median endovascular grades were compared between treatment modalities and endovascular outcomes. Binary regression analysis was performed with major endovascular complications as a dichotomized dependent variable. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for interobserver reliability of the endovascular grading scale. RESULTS A significant Spearman correlation between the endovascular grade and the Spetzler-Martin grade was demonstrated (ρ = 0.5, P < .01). Differences in the median endovascular grades between the endovascular cure (median = 2) and endovascular complication groups (median = 4) (P < .05) and between the endovascular cure and successful multimodal treatment groups (median = 3) (P < .05) were demonstrated. The endovascular grade was the only independent predictor of complications (OR = 0.5, P < .01). The intraclass correlation coefficient of the endovascular grade was 0.71 (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS Validation of a brain arteriovenous malformation endovascular grading scale demonstrated that endovascular grades of ≤II were associated with endovascular cure, while endovascular grades of ≤III were associated with multimodal cure or significant lesion reduction and favorable outcome. The endovascular grade provides useful information to refine risk stratification for endovascular and multimodal treatment.","Bell, D L; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Yoo, A J; Rabinov, J D; Butler, W E; Bell, J E; Hirsch, J A",AJNR.

140943,Pursuing Data Modernization in Cancer Surveillance by Developing a Cloud-Based Computing Platform: Real-Time Cancer Case Collection.,2021-01-01,"Profound type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent attrition of memory CD8 and CD4 T cells occurs early during many infections. It is dramatic at 2 to 4 days following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of mice and can be elicited by the IFN-inducing Toll receptor agonist poly(I:C). We show that this attrition occurs in many organs, indicating that it is due to T cell loss rather than redistribution. This loss correlated with elevated intracellular staining of T cells ex vivo for activated caspases but with only low levels of ex vivo staining with annexin V, probably due to the rapid clearance of apoptotic cells in vivo. Instead, a high frequency of annexin V-reactive CD8alpha(+) dendritic cells (DCs), which are known to be highly phagocytic, accumulated in the spleen as the memory T cell populations disappeared. After short in vitro incubation, memory phenotype T cells isolated from LCMV-infected mice (day 3) or mice treated with poly(I:C) (12 h) displayed substantial DNA fragmentation, as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, compared to T cells isolated from uninfected mice, indicating a role for apoptosis in the memory T cell attrition. This apoptosis of memory CD8 T cells early during LCMV infection was reduced in mice lacking the proapoptotic molecule Bim. Evidence is presented showing that high levels of T cell attrition, as found in young mice, correlate with reduced immunodomination by cross-reactive memory cells.","Bahl, Kapil; Hüebner, Anette; Davis, Roger J; Welsh, Raymond M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02571-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200235/,129

In patients with IBD who are unresponsive to their first induction dose, the implementation of an 'accelerated' induction dose schedule (doses more frequent than recommended in product monographs) is becoming increasingly common. It is unclear whether this practice results in favourable patient outcomes, such as avoidance of surgery and disease remission. As such, there is a need to identify and map the current evidence base on accelerated induction schedules of these medications in the treatment of IBD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A scoping review will be employed to systematically identify and characterise the nature of scientific literature on accelerated induction regimens of TNF-alpha inhibitors.

141099,"The ""new normality"" in research? What message are we conveying our medical students?",2021-05-01,"People altered the biophysical environment upon which they depend through the overexploitation of resources and growing waste generation. Action is urgently needed to return the resource economy within planetary boundaries and safeguard human well-being, by realising an increasingly closed-loop system that maintains values of materials and products within a sustainable circular economy. Innovative technologies and business models must be developed and implemented, requiring convincing ""business cases"" for industry and government; why should they be interested in adopting circular, resource recovery practices? Despite multi-dimensional challenges facing people and their environment, and the ability of resource recovery to contribute to restoring environment, society and economy, arguments for circular practices are often overly focused on economic aspects. Economic growth is not a panacea and this article supports the preparation of better arguments by presenting expert insights on 37 themes to consider for a resource recovery business case. The most important themes cover 1) Economic, social, environmental and technical value of resources and 2) Regulatory change; focusing business cases on these is likely to deliver positive impacts regarding all identified themes. The article synthesises the old ""growth will solve it-"" with a new ""multi-dimensional challenges and solutions"" paradigm, suggesting that resource recovery should support multi-dimensional growth to partly redistribute economic benefits to social and environmental values through the preservation of technical, functional value of materials and products. Writing successful business cases for resource recovery requires inter-disciplinary collaboration, and sustained effort to complete and translate business cases into measurable impacts through changed practices outside academia.","Velenturf, Anne P M; Jopson, Juliet S",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340251/,129

METHODS ASOPRS fellows and program directors were asked to complete an anonymous survey regarding their perceived impact of the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS Forty ASOPRS fellows (70.2%) participated, including 20 first-year and 20 second-year trainees, from all country regions. During the social distancing restrictions, 100% of fellows continued to participate in surgical procedures, including orbital biopsy (77.5%), abscess drainage (55.0%), fracture repair (45.6%), eyelid lesion excision (70.0%) and temporal artery biopsy (57.5%). ASOPRS fellows evaluated patients, including in emergency room (84.6%) and inpatient hospital (76.9%) settings, wearing surgical (85.0%) or N-95 (40.0%) masks, gloves (80.0%) and eye protection (62.5%). Most ASOPRS fellows (87.5%) participated in virtual interinstitutional education sessions and indicated a desire to continue this curriculum. Fellows also used available time for research (85.0%), independent study (77.5%), personal health (70.0%) and social interaction (60.0%). ASOPRS fellows reported COVID-19 restrictions to have a mild (72.5%) to moderate (27.5%) impact on their overall training, and most (75.0%) felt their surgical confidence to decline. Fellowship program directors also asserted a mild (72.2%), moderate (19.4%) or significant (5.6%) impact on subspecialty training, and 94.4% predict adverse effects on graduation case logs. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 restrictions most ASOPRS fellows participated in emergent clinical activities and novel telemedicine curriculum. Most fellows and program directors expressed concern regarding a negative impact on overall subspecialty education and surgical confidence.","Homer, Natalie A; Epstein, Aliza; Somogyi, Marie; Shore, John W",Orbit,https://doi.org/10.1080/01676830.2020.1839919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33121312/,129
141945,53BP1 expression is a modifier of the prognostic value of lymph node ratio and CA 19-9 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,2013,"Purpose To assess the efficacy of placing a polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacing hydrogel in patients undergoing proton beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This study also aims to assess the effect on rectal radiation dose of prostate-rectum separation in various anatomic planes. Methods and Materials Seventy-two consecutive prostate cancer patients undergoing conventionally fractionated pencil beam scanning proton radiation therapy with and without hydrogel placement were compared. Magnetic resonance images taken after hydrogel placement measured prostate-rectum separation and were correlated to rectal dosing and rectal toxicity. Univariate analysis of clinical variables and radiation dosing was conducted using nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test with continuity correction between groups (hydrogel spacer vs controls). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assessed relationships between the various anatomic dimensions of perirectal space and rectal radiation dosing. Results Fifty-one patients had hydrogel placement before therapy and 21 did not. There was a 42.2% reduction in rectal dosing (mL3 rectum) in hydrogel patients (P < .001). Increasing midline sagittal lift resulted in a greater mitigation of total rectal dose (P = .031). The degree of prostate surface area coverage on coronal plane did not correlate with further reductions in rectal radiation dose (P = .673). Patients who had PEG hydrogels placed reported more rectal side effects during treatment compared with those patients who did not (35.3% vs 9.5%, P = .061). At median 9.5-month follow-up, there was no difference in reporting of grade ≤2 rectal toxicity between the 2 groups (7.7% vs 7.1%, P = .145). Conclusions Polyethylene glycol hydrogel placement before pencil proton beam radiation therapy for prostate cancer reduced rectal radiation dose. The most important factor reducing total rectal dose was the degree of sagittal midline separation created by the PEG hydrogel. This is the largest study with the longest follow-up to investigate hydrogel placement in the proton beam radiation setting.","Navaratnam, Anojan; Cumsky, Jameson; Abdul-Muhsin, Haidar; Gagneur, Justin; Shen, Jiajian; Kosiorek, Heidi; Golafshar, Michael; Kawashima, Akira; Wong, William; Ferrigni, Robert; Humphreys, Mitchell R",Advances in radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adro.2019.08.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051895/,129

Although the majority of children with adenovirus disease develop mild upper respiratory tract disease, more severe disease may occur with involvement of the lower respiratory tract characterized by pneumonitis and/or small airways disease. The authors present a case series of 3 high-risk children with severe lower respiratory tract adenoviral infections. These cases demonstrate the potential for the development of severe respiratory involvement from adenovirus in infants and children with comorbid conditions and illustrate that there may be a rapid progression of the disease as well as the need, in selected circumstances, for prolonged mechanical support. We review the role of adenovirus in lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children, its potential to result in life-threatening complications in pediatric patients with comorbid conditions, and the potential life-saving role of mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in these children.","Gupta, Punkaj; Tobias, Joseph D; Goyal, Sunali; Hervie, Peter; Harris, Jason B; Sadot, Efraim; Noviski, Natan",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066610389963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21320864/,129

METHODS This was a prospective study of 10-15-week-old kittens (n = 10) diagnosed with moderate/severe PE. RESULTS CT provides additional information that is useful for selecting patients for surgical correction and for planning the surgery. Traditional radiographic indices (vertebral, frontosagittal) provide reasonable approximations of the CT-determined dimensions but these seem to correlate poorly with the severity of clinical signs. Kittens commonly have lateralised deformities, which are associated with less severe clinical signs, while those with midline deformities are associated with more severe clinical signs. Six of seven kittens with severe PE that had a ventral splint applied for 4 weeks had excellent medium-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Restriction of diastolic filling by midline sternal deviation may be an important cause of exercise intolerance in cats with PE.

143146,Soluble interleukin-2 receptor as a predictive and prognostic marker for patients with familial breast cancer.,2021,"Diabetes increases the risk for developing cardiovascular, neurologic, kidney, eye, and other complications. Diabetes and related complications also pose a huge economic cost to society: in 2017, the estimated total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes was $327 billion in the United States (1). Diabetes complications can be prevented or delayed through the management of blood glucose (measured by hemoglobin A1C), blood pressure (BP), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, and by avoiding smoking; these are collectively known as the ABCS goals (hemoglobin A1C, Blood pressure, Cholesterol, Smoking) (2-5). Assessments of achieving ABCS goals among adults with diabetes are available at the national level (4,6); however, studies that assess state-level prevalence of meeting ABCS goals have been lacking. This report provides imputed state-level proportions of adults with self-reported diabetes meeting ABCS goals in each of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (DC). State-level estimates were created by raking and multiple imputation methods (7,8) using data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2017-2018 American Community Survey (ACS), and 2017-2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Among U.S. adults with diabetes, an estimated 26.4% met combined ABCS goals, and 75.4%, 70.4%, 55.8%, and 86.0% met A1C <8%, BP <140/90 mmHg, non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL and nonsmoking goals, respectively.

143254,Sex differences in remifentanil requirements for preventing cough during anesthetic emergence.,2014,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with several adverse outcomes, including new or progressive chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and mortality. Epidemiological studies have reported an association between AKI and dementia as a long-term adverse outcome. This meta-analysis was aimed to understand the association between AKI and dementia risk. A literature search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase databases, from inception to July 2021, to identify epidemiological studies reporting the association between AKI and dementia risk. Title and abstract followed by the full-text of retrieved articles were screened, data were extracted, and quality was assessed, using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale by two investigators independently. The primary outcome was to compute the pooled risk of dementia in AKI patients. Subgroup analysis was also performed based on age and co-morbidities. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 software. Four studies (cohort (n = 3) and case-control (n = 1)) with a total of 429,211 patients, of which 211,749 had AKI, were identified. The mean age of the patients and the follow-up period were 64.15 ± 16.09 years and 8.9 years, respectively. Included studies were of moderate to high quality. The pooled estimate revealed a significantly higher risk of dementia in AKI patients with an overall relative risk/risk ratio (RR) of 1.92 (95% CI: 1.52-2.43), p ≤ 0.00001. Dementia risk increases by 10% with one year increase in age with an RR of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.09-1.11), p < 0.00001. Subgroup analysis based on stroke as a co-morbid condition also revealed significantly higher dementia risk in AKI patients (RR 2.30 (95% CI: 1.62-3.28), p = 0.009). All-cause mortality risk was also significantly higher in AKI patients with dementia with a pooled RR of 2.11 (95% CI: 1.20-3.70), p = 0.009. The strength of the evidence was of very low certainty as per the GRADE assessment. Patients with AKI have a higher risk of dementia.

This radiopeptide is made by labelling the ligand octreotate with Lutetium-177 using the linker DOTA. After labelling, and before clinical application quality control of the radiopeptide is needed and the radiochemical purity is assessed. Acceptance limits for radiochemical purity should be within 90-110% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic use and within 95-105% of the label claim for radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic use. Moreover, the amount of unlabelled [177Lu]LuCl3 cannot exceed 2% of the radioactive dose. Since no monograph is available for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph Eur), this article describes the development and validation of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet (UV) detection and radiodetection. A Waters Acquity Arc UHPLC system equipped with a Waters 2998 photodiode array (PDA) detector was used coupled to a Berthold Lb 514 Flowstar detector equipped with a BGO-X gamma measuring cell. A reversed phase Symmetry Shield C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 µm) was used for chromatographic separation. A flow of 1.5 mL/min was maintained during analysis, using 0.1% TFA in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% TFA in ACN as mobile phase B. The retention time was around 1.7 min and 13.5 min for [177Lu]LuCl3 and [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE, respectively. Stock solutions of [177Lu]LuCl3 were made by serial dilution and were injected to test for linearity, accuracy and precision, carry over and signal-to-noise ratio. A [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE sample was prepared and injected to determine the carry over. The results showed that the method is linear over a range of 0.300-130 MBq/mL, which covers the range for clinical samples, provided that the clinical sample is diluted ten times before analysis. The LLOQ can be measured accurately even after dilution, with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 5. In short, the method is accurate, precise and sensitive and can be implemented as part of the quality control of [177Lu]Lu-HA-DOTA-TATE.","van Andel, L; Aalbersberg, E A; Geluk-Jonker, M M; Stokkel, M P M; Beijnen, J H; Hendrikx, J J M A","Journal of chromatography.

The Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial can provide the first evidence of the effect of intentional weight loss on mortality in an obese population at high risk. METHODS SCOUT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing sibutramine vs. placebo. Eligibility for the trial required both men and women aged at least 55 years, with BMI of at least 27 kg/m and 45 kg/m or less. Study participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) only should have at least one other risk factor defined as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, or diabetic nephropathy, and/or they had a history of cardiovascular disease. Study participants were stratified in three groups: patients with T2DM, patients with a prior cardiovascular event but without diabetes, and patients with both T2DM and a prior cardiovascular event.The relationship between weight loss and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular) was investigated with Cox regression models. RESULTS The main study showed that all-cause mortality was not different in patients allocated to sibutramine or placebo. This ancillary analysis demonstrates that there is a general trend showing higher mortality in patients with the greatest weight loss (weight reduction >10 kg) and in those with increasing weight (>1 kg). If integrated weight loss (area under the curve from baseline to 12 months) is used, these observations are confirmed. The impact of substantial weight loss on mortality is marked in those dying of noncardiovascular causes, specifically cancer.

Not infrequently, the DNA yield from small biopsies/cytological samples is insufficient for the assessment of genomic biomarkers that inform personalised therapies. The Idylla EGFR mutation test (IEMT) has been specifically designed to process formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections without requiring preliminary DNA extraction.This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IEMT when used to analyse archival histopathology material. More specifically, our objective was to establish whether or not different staining procedures could affect assay performance. METHODS Twenty NSCLC samples were selected accordingly to EGFR mutational status. To mimic archived stained material, sections were subjected to H&E staining, fluorescent in situ hybridisation analyses or immunodetection by immunohistochemistry before being processed for IEMT. RESULTS Parallel assessment of EGFR mutational status by IEMT on stained sections and next-generation sequencing on DNA yielded a concordant result in 50 out of 60 tests (83.3%). The discoloration of H&E of the archived sample was found to be the optimal procedure to highlight all the actionable alterations of EGFR. CONCLUSIONS IEMT can provide remarkable diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of EGFR mutational status also when the only source of pathological material available for molecular analyses is represented by H&E stained sections.

With no current vaccine, treatment is still a critical intervention for minimizing morbidity and preventing disease-specific mortality. This study aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients using Tocilizumab treatment to provide recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with severe disease. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of medical records of six critically ill patients admitted to the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, China, from January 11 to February 26, 2020. Patient-related outcomes, including demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics before and after the initiation of Tocilizumab, were descriptively analyzed. Four to eight milligrams (mg)/kilogram (kg) of Tocilizumab was prescribed, with Chinese treatment guidelines. Results By the end of the last follow-up, Patient 1 and Patient 2 developed complications and died after using Tocilizumab for three to four days. Patient 4 died of multiple organ failure caused by cerebral infarction after using Tocilizumab for 39 days. Patient 3 and Patient 6 were discharged after 29 days and 33 days on Tocilizumab, respectively. Clinical symptoms, including fever, heart rate, and oxygen levels, improved after Tocilizumab use. Two patients appeared transient abnormal of liver or renal function indicator, and they can gradually recover. All elevated serum levels of inflammatory factors gradually decreased, except in Patient 2. Patient 3 and Patient 6's inflammatory lesions also significantly improved after initiating Tocilizumab. Conclusions Anti-inflammatory treatment with Tocilizumab was found to improve inflammatory responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Although some side reactions will occur, patients can gradually recover without affecting the efficacy of the therapy. However, the proper timing to start patients on Tocilizumab patients should be explored.

RECENT FINDINGS Disrupted or disordered sleep can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, the risk of cardiovascular events, increased seizure frequency, and altered immune responses. Studies have implicated disrupted sleep and circadian rhythm dysfunction with both amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and tau deposition. A bidirectional relationship exists between disrupted sleep and the progression of Alzheimer disease pathology. Insomnia has been reported as a prodromal symptom in autoimmune encephalitis. Primary sleep disorders have now been increasingly recognized as a common comorbid condition in multiple sclerosis, making it imperative that neurologists feel comfortable differentiating multiple sclerosis fatigue from excessive daytime sleepiness caused by primary sleep disorders to optimally treat their patients. SUMMARY Sleep disorders are common across the population. By recognizing sleep disorders in patients with neurologic conditions, neurologists can provide comprehensive care and, in some cases, reduce neurologic disease burden.","Benjamin, Sara E",Continuum,https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000000887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756234/,129

However, challenges related to the culture, long-term storage, and long-distance transport of such implants currently limit the widespread use of adherent RPE cells as therapeutics. Here we report a xeno-free protocol to cryopreserve a confluent monolayer of clinical-grade, human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cells on a parylene scaffold (REPS) that yields viable, polarized, and functional RPE cells post-thaw. Thawed cells exhibit ≥ 95% viability, have morphology, pigmentation, and gene expression characteristic of mature RPE cells, and secrete the neuroprotective protein, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). Stability under liquid nitrogen (LN2) storage has been confirmed through one year. REPS were administered immediately post-thaw into the subretinal space of a mammalian model, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS)/nude rat. Implanted REPS were assessed at 30, 60, and 90 days post-implantation, and thawed cells demonstrate survival as an intact monolayer on the parylene scaffold. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for the maturation marker, RPE65, significantly increased over the post-implantation period in vivo, and cells demonstrated functional attributes similar to non-cryopreserved controls. The capacity to cryopreserve adherent cellular therapeutics permits extended storage and stable transport to surgical sites, enabling broad distribution for the treatment of prevalent diseases such as AMD.","Pennington, Britney O; Bailey, Jeffrey K; Faynus, Mohamed A; Hinman, Cassidy; Hee, Mitchell N; Ritts, Rory; Nadar, Vignesh; Zhu, Danhong; Mitra, Debbie; Martinez-Camarillo, Juan Carlos; Lin, Tai-Chi; Thomas, Biju B; Hinton, David R; Humayun, Mark S; Lebkowski, Jane; Johnson, Lincoln V; Clegg, Dennis O",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85631-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737600/,129

The purpose of this study is to identify the level of awareness, attitudes and practices among healthcare workers in relation to precautionary measures to EVD. METHODOLOGY A total of 177 physicians and 545 nurses participated in a descriptive cross-sectional study from a tertiary government hospital in Saudi Arabia. All subjects answered a self-administered questionnaire focusing on their level of awareness, concerns, and clinical practice related to EVD. RESULTS Majority of the participants were knowledgeable about the etiology, mode of transmission, signs and symptoms, and treatment of EVD. All of the participants had high levels of concern about EVD (p=0.001) and about the implementation of strict standard infection control precautionary measures. The study found that greater infection control measures were taken by the participants including frequent hand washing, use of personal protective equipment, and avoiding normal activities such as going to work, school, travel, etc. if fever symptoms appear. CONCLUSION A combination of evidence based knowledge about EVD and high levels of concern of healthcare providers in relation to precautionary measures to EVD are the main factors leading to strict compliance with the infection control measures recommended in this study. Additionally, healthcare providers must be trained in infection control and adhere to the universal infection control standard guidelines to facilitate prevention and precaution.","Almutairi, Khalid M; Alodhayani, Abdulaziz Alhomaidi; Moussa, Mahaman; Aboshaiqah, Ahmad E; Tumala, Regie B; Vinluan, Jason M",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.6941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580328/,129

METHODS Patients with SLE and RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were identified through an established New York University lupus cohort, query of two hospital systems, and referrals from rheumatologists. Data were prospectively collected via a web-based questionnaire and review of medical records. Baseline characteristics were obtained for all patients with COVID-19 to analyze risk factors for hospitalization. Data were also collected from asymptomatic patients and those with COVID-19-like symptoms who tested negative or were not tested. Statistical analyses were limited to confirmed COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS A total of 226 SLE patients were included: 41 patients with confirmed COVID-19; 19 patients who tested negative for COVID-19; 42 patients with COVID-19-like symptoms who did not get tested; and 124 patients who remained asymptomatic without testing. Of those SLE patients with COVID-19, 24 (59%) required hospitalization, four required intensive care unit-level of care, and four died. Hospitalized patients tended to be older, non-white, Hispanic, have higher BMI, history of nephritis, and at least one comorbidity. An exploratory (due to limited sample size) logistic regression analysis identified race, presence of at least one comorbidity, and BMI as independent predictors of hospitalization. CONCLUSION In general, the variables predictive of hospitalization in our SLE patients were similar to those identified in the general population. Further studies are needed to understand additional risk factors for poor COVID-19 outcomes in patients with SLE.","Fernandez-Ruiz, Ruth; Masson, Mala; Kim, Mimi Y; Myers, Benjamin; Haberman, Rebecca H; Castillo, Rochelle; Scher, Jose U; Guttmann, Allison; Carlucci, Philip M; Deonaraine, Kristina K; Golpanian, Michael; Robins, Kimberly; Chang, Miao; Belmont, H Michael; Buyon, Jill P; Blazer, Ashira D; Saxena, Amit; Izmirly, Peter M",Arthritis & rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32715660/,129

Since the recognition of a link between gadolinium chelates (GCs) used as contrast agents for MR imaging and NSF by two independent European teams in 2006, numerous studies have described the clinical issues and investigated the mechanism of this disease. So far the most commonly reported hypothesis is based on the in vivo dechelation of GCs. The physicochemical properties of GCs, especially their thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities, are described in the present article. High kinetic stability provided by the macrocyclic structure, combined with high thermodynamic stability, minimizes the amount of free gadolinium released in the body. The current hypotheses regarding the pathophysiologic mechanism are critically discussed.","Idée, Jean-Marc; Port, Marc; Dencausse, Anne; Lancelot, Eric; Corot, Claire",Radiologic clinics of North America,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcl.2009.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19744600/,129

Yet few stigma measures consider how cultural capabilities that signify ""full personhood"" could be engaged to resist stigma. By applying a theory conceptualizing how culturally-salient mechanisms can worsen or mitigate HIV stigma in relation to ""what matters most"" (WMM), we developed the WMM Cultural Stigma Scale for Women Living with HIV in Botswana (WMM-WLHIV-BW) and psychometrically evaluated it among 201 respondents with known and unknown HIV status. The two subscales, Cultural Factors Shape Stigma (CFSS) and Cultural Capabilities Protect against Stigma (CCPS) were reliable (both [Formula: see text]). Among WLHIV, the CFSS Subscale showed initial construct validity with depressive symptoms (r = .39, p = .005), similar to an established HIV stigma scale, whereas the CCPS Subscale showed initial construct validity with self-esteem (r = .32, p = .026) and social support number (r = .29, p = .047), suggesting that achieving local cultural capabilities mitigates stigma and is linked with positive psychosocial outcomes. This culturally-derived scale could help WLHIV in Botswana experience improved stigma-related outcomes.","Yang, Lawrence H; Ho-Foster, Ari R; Becker, Timothy D; Misra, Supriya; Rampa, Shathani; Poku, Ohemaa B; Entaile, Patlo; Goodman, Melody; Blank, Michael B",AIDS and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-03012-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839870/,129

Although overtreatment results in serious waste, inappropriate laboratory use is widespread, and overuse of tumour markers (TMs) has attracted increasing attention. DESIGN Retrospective study. SETTING The respiratory, thoracic surgery and oncology departments of three hospitals in Shanghai from 2014 to 2015. PARTICIPANTS Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and primary bronchogenic lung cancer (PLC). Based on clinical guidelines and physician experience, the criteria of suitability of TM examinations were determined, and the number, cost and proportion of inappropriate TM requests were analysed. RESULTS The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for carcinoembryonic antigen+cytokeratin fragment 21-1+squamous cell carcinoma antigen+neuron-specific enolase in patients with COPD and PLC was 0.813, in accordance with the cost-effectiveness principle, indicating good clinical and health economics values. In the 2706 patients, 12 496-16 956 (58.27%-79.06%) of TM requests were inappropriate. Furthermore, the involved expense was 650 200-1 014 156 yuan, accounting for 7.69%-12.00% of examination expenses and 1.35%-2.11% of hospitalisation costs. CONCLUSIONS We found that the inappropriate use of TMs was widespread for patients with pulmonary disease. Clinicians should use TMs strictly according to the guidelines to effectively manage laboratory resources and control costs.","Zhang, Haichen; Song, Yunxiao; Zhang, Xiong; Hu, Jun; Yuan, Suwei; Ma, Jin",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490961/,129

The anoxic water was collected from a perennially sealed (~100 millennia) glacial ice lake. Gram-stain-negative cells were 0.18-0.3×8.0-25.0 µm in size, straight, slender rods with unusual gliding motility by external, not previously reported, organelles named here as antiae. At the end of stationary phase of growth, spheroplasts were terminally formed and the cells resembled dandelions. After death, cells were helical. The isolate was an athalassic, strictly anaerobic and catalase-negative proteolytic chemoorganotroph. It was moderately psychrophilic with a temperature range for growth of 3-26 °C and an optimum at 22-23 °C. The pH range for growth was 5.5-7.8 with an optimum at 6.9. Major cellular fatty acids were branched pentadecanoic and tridecanoic acids, and saturated tetradecanoic acids. The quinone system comprised menaquinone MK-7. The strain was sensitive to all checked antibiotics and ascorbic acid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 42.6 mol%. Based on average nucleotide identity, average amino acid identity and phylogenetic analyses, the novel isolate was placed within a unique phylogenetic cluster distant from all eight families in the order Bacteroidales and formed a novel family with the proposed name Williamwhitmaniaceae fam. nov. The description of the order Bacteroidales was emended accordingly. The name Williamwhitmania taraxaci gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for the new genus and novel species with the type strain A7P-90mT (=DSM 100563T=JCM 30888T).

We propose to analyze the performance of attendants in a specific LESS training course. METHODS Following the LESSCAR 2010 guidelines, we focused on level 1 hands-on simulator tasks and level 2 hands-on training on animal model for skills acquisition during a LESS-specific training course. Each attendant completed coordination and cut tasks on simulator, followed by a cholecystectomy on an ex vivo porcine liver. Hands-on animal model each trainee performed 1 cholecystectomy and at least 2 nephrectomies (N1, N2). Performance was analyzed through video recording and reviewed by 3 independent observers. Each result was registered according to a modified objective structured assessment of technical skills. Total task or procedure completion time was also determined. RESULTS Regarding coordination and cut tasks, attendants improved on their performance from first to third attempts with an accompanying decrease in completion time. Surgeons completed the cholecystectomy on animal model significantly faster than on simulator, although with lower performance quality. Regarding N1 and N2, attendants showed improvement both in quality and total completion time. CONCLUSIONS A gradual and positive evolution of attendants was observed throughout the training course. Thus, we believe a structured program for the acquisition of basic skills in new minimally invasive surgical approaches should be recommended. Considering that this is a small study, it would be advisable to increase the number of study subjects on future opportunities.","Sánchez-Margallo, Francisco M; Pérez, Francisco J; Azevedo, Ana M; Sánchez-Margallo, Juan A; Sánchez, Miguel A; Díaz-Güemes, Idoia",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350613510611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24297782/,129

Robotics continues to demonstrate increased utility and expansion in medicine, particularly surgery. When coupled with the imminent expiry of Intuitive patents in the next few years, it is timely to consider what we can expect to see from new platforms; what new features might we anticipate and what technology will be available to enhance and improve patient care. RECENT FINDINGS There really are no limits with the anticipated developments in the field of medical robotics. Multiple large companies and academic institutions continue to invest in design and production with the release of a number of platforms already having occurred, whereas others are to come in the near future. The main anticipated advances will be haptic feedback, decreased cost, improved theatre assimilation with open consoles permitting free communication and lower theatre footprint. The robot patient interface is to be enhanced with single port platforms in production with a better interface including haptic feedback. The addition of NOTES and smarter flexible robotics is the next key area of interest, whereas the introduction of technology with image guidance and networking where large data sets or connectivity permit increased clinical acumen to enhance decision making. SUMMARY We are at the cusp of a tipping point as the intellectual property for the first major robotic system in surgery comes to an end. It is likely to be a period of great opportunity with enhanced surgery and patient outcomes through significant innovation, multiple platforms nearing dissemination, with various technological advances. We anticipate this will yield a great period of innovation and diversity. Will we see a truly automated robot soon; the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robots are the limit.","Namdarian, Benjamin; Dasgupta, Prokar",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29303916/,129

147062,A case of delayed inflammatory filler reaction following vaccination with succesful response to colchicine.,2021-08-18,"OBJECTIVES Breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) is associated with decreased satisfaction with around-the-clock opioid therapy. This analysis examined patient satisfaction with fentanyl sublingual spray for BTCP during the open-label titration period of a randomized, placebo-controlled study. METHODS Opioid-tolerant patients with 1 to 4 daily BTCP episodes were included. During a 26-day, open-label titration phase, a successful dose (100 to 1600 mcg) of fentanyl sublingual spray was established that provided effective analgesia for 2 consecutive BTCP episodes with tolerable side effects. The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) was administered at baseline to assess satisfaction with previous BTCP medication and at the end of the titration to assess satisfaction with fentanyl sublingual spray. RESULTS Of 130 enrolled patients, 115 (88.5%) had a TSQM measure at baseline and at the end of their titration period. Scores on all 4 TSQM domains increased from baseline to end of the titration, with mean (standard error [SE]) improvements of 22.3 (2.3) for effectiveness, 7.7 (3.2) for side effects, 6.8 (2.2) for convenience, and 12.9 (2.8) for global satisfaction (P < 0.05 for all). Satisfaction with symptom relief (26.1% to 77.4%) and onset of action (21.7% to 82.6%) also improved from baseline to end of titration. At least one adverse event (AE) was reported by 78 patients (60.0%). The most common AEs considered possibly or probably related to study medication were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea (n = 10 [7.7%] each). DISCUSSION These data indicate markedly improved satisfaction among patients receiving fentanyl sublingual spray relative to previous BTCP medications.","Rauck, Richard; Parikh, Neha; Dillaha, Larry; Barker, Jerry; Stearns, Lisa",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25060406/,129
147107,The laboratory's role in combating COVID-19.,2020-06-17,"Providing simple information that identifies healthier/less healthy products at the point-of-sale has been increasingly recognized as a potential strategy for improving population diet. This review evaluated the effect on healthiness of food purchasing/intake of interventions that identify specific products as healthier/less healthy at the point-of-sale in food retail settings. Five databases were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled or quasi-experimental trials published 2000-2020. Effects on primary outcomes of the 26 eligible studies (322 stores and 19,002 participants) were positive (n = 14), promising (effective under certain conditions; n = 3), mixed (different effect across treatment arms/outcomes; n = 4), null (n = 3), negative (n = 1), or unclear (n = 1). Shelf-label studies (three studies of two rating systems across all products) were positive. Technology-delivered (mobile applications/podcast/kiosk) interventions were positive (n = 3/5) or promising/mixed (n = 2/5). In-store displays (n = 16) had mixed effectiveness. Interventions provided information on targeted healthier products only (n = 17), unhealthy products only (n = 1), both healthy and unhealthy (n = 2), and across all products (n = 5). No patterns were found between behavior change technique used and effectiveness. Study quality was mixed. These findings indicate that point-of-sale interventions identifying healthy/unhealthy options can lead to healthier customer purchasing behavior, particularly those delivered using shelf-labels or technology. Further research on discouraging unhealthy foods is needed.","Chan, Jasmine; McMahon, Emma; Brimblecombe, Julie",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34254422/,129

METHODS We reviewed demographic, clinical, procedural (GA versus local anesthesia [LA], etc), and site-adjudicated angiographic and clinical outcomes data from consecutive patients treated with the Solitaire FR device in the investigator-initiated North American SOLITAIRE Stent-Retriever Acute Stroke (NASA) Registry. The primary outcomes were 90-day modified Rankin Scale, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS A total of 281 patients from 18 centers were enrolled. GA was used in 69.8% (196/281) of patients. Baseline demographic and procedural factors were comparable between the LA and GA groups, except the former demonstrated longer time-to-groin puncture (395.4±254 versus 337.4±208 min; P=0.04), lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; 16.2±5.8 versus 18.8±6.9; P=0.002), lower balloon-guide catheter usage (22.4% versus 49.2%; P=0.0001), and longer fluoroscopy times (39.5±33 versus 28±22.8 min; P=0.008). Recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥2b; 72.94% versus 73.6%; P=0.9) and rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.1% versus 11.2%; P=0.4) were similar but modified Rankin Scale ≤2 was achieved in more LA patients, 52.6% versus 35.6% (odds ratio, 1.4 [1.1-1.8]; P=0.01). In multivariate analysis, hypertension, NIHSS, unsuccessful revascularization, and GA use (odds ratio, 3.3 [1.6-7.1]; P=0.001) were associated with death. When only anterior circulation and elective GA patients were included, there was a persistent difference in good outcomes in favor of LA patients (50.7% versus 35.5%; odds ratio, 1.3 [1.01-1.6]; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS The NASA Registry has demonstrated that clinical outcomes and survival are significantly better in patients treated with LA, without increased symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage risk.

148044,Thoughtful selection and use of scientific terms in clinical research: the case of 'pragmatic' trials.,2021-03-22,"Head motion is a major confounding factor impairing the quality of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In particular, head motion can reduce analytical efficiency, and its effects are still present even after preprocessing. To examine the validity of motion removal and to evaluate the remaining effects of motion on the quality of the preprocessed fMRI data, a new metric of group quality control (QC), dissimilarity of functional connectivity, is introduced. Here, we investigate the association between head motion, represented by mean framewise displacement, and dissimilarity of functional connectivity by applying four preprocessing methods in two independent resting-state fMRI datasets: one consisting of healthy participants (N = 167) scanned in a 3T GE-Discovery 750 with longer TR (2.5 s), and the other of chronic back pain patients (N = 143) in a 3T Siemens Magnetom Prisma scanner with shorter TR (0.555 s). We found that dissimilarity of functional connectivity uncovers the influence of participant's motion, and this relationship is independent of population, scanner, and preprocessing method. The association between motion and dissimilarity of functional connectivity, and how the removal of high-motion participants affects this association, is a new strategy for group-level QC following preprocessing.","Yang, Lili; Wu, Bo; Fan, Linyu; Huang, Shishi; Vigotsky, Andrew D; Baliki, Marwan N; Yan, Zhihan; Apkarian, A Vania; Huang, Lejian",Human brain mapping,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079467/,129

148607,Recurrent stroke in a patient with vitamin B12 deficiency and MTHFR mutation.,2017,"Purpose This article aimed to document longitudinal changes in auditory function, including measures of temporal processing, and to examine the associations between observed changes in auditory and cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. Method This was a prospective longitudinal study of 98 adults (66 women) with baseline ages ranging from 40 to 85 years. The mean interval between T1 baseline and T2 follow-up measurements was 8.8 years with a range of 7-11 years. Measures of hearing threshold, gap detection, and auditory temporal-order identification were completed at T1 and T2. Cognitive measures completed at T1 and T2 were the 13 scales of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. Three approaches were taken to analyze these data: (a) examination of changes over time in group performance, (b) correlations and slopes between auditory and cognitive measures to examine concomitant rates of decline over the 9-year T1-to-T2 period, and (c) regression analyses examining associations between auditory performance at T1 and cognitive performance 9 years later at T2. Results For the group data, there were significant declines in hearing loss, gap-detection thresholds at one frequency, and process-type measures of cognitive function from T1 to T2 matching the trends in the baseline cross-sectional data. Regression analyses of the longitudinal data revealed the strongest connection between auditory temporal-order processing and cognitive processing typically explaining 10%-15% of the variance. Conclusions A significant amount of variance in rates of cognitive decline, T1 to T2, and subsequent cognitive performance (T2) was explained by measures of auditory function. Although hearing loss occasionally emerged as a significant factor, auditory temporal-order identification emerged much more frequently as the auditory measure most strongly associated with cognitive function.","Humes, Larry E","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR",https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_jslhr-20-00274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400551/,129

DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS Study conducted at the ICU of a Navy's hospital, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from January 2016 to September 2018. PATIENTS Tracheostomized patients (18-86 yr) on prolonged weaning. INTERVENTIONS Participants were assigned to inspiratory muscle training (intervention group) or a traditional T-piece protocol (control group). In the inspiratory muscle training group, participants underwent training with an electronic inspiratory training device (POWERbreathe K-5; Technologies Ltd, Birmingham, United Kingdom). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Changes in respiratory muscle strength and rates of ICU survival and weaning success were compared between groups. Forty-eight participants in the inspiratory muscle training group and 53 ones in the control group were included in the final analysis. The inspiratory muscle training was associated with a substantially higher gain on muscle strength as assessed by the maximal inspiratory pressure (70.5 [51.0-82.5] vs -48.0 cm H2O [36.0-72.0 cm H2O]; p = 0.003) and the timed inspiratory effort index (1.56 [1.25-2.08] vs 0.99 cm H2O/s [0.65-1.71 cm H2O/s]; p = 0.001). Outcomes at the 60th day of ICU were significantly better in the intervention group regarding both survival (71.1% vs 48.9%; p = 0.030) and weaning success (74.8% vs 44.5%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The use of an inspiratory muscle training program with an electronic resistive loading device was associated with substantial muscle strength gain and positive impacts in two very relevant clinical outcomes: the rates of ICU survival and successful weaning.","Guimarães, Bruno da Silva; de Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro; Cordeiro, Hebe Faria; Regis, Thiago Loureiro; Leite, Cristiane Almeida; Puga, Fernanda Patricio; Alvim, Sergio Hernando; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332819/,129

A 2010 UK review reported growing awareness of telehealth in palliative care but a lack of evidence-based research to support its use. The primary aim of this review was to describe the current use of telehealth in palliative care in the UK and evaluate telehealth initiatives against a digital service standard. The secondary aim was to explore whether telehealth results in a reduction in emergency care access. METHODS Systematic review of the literature with thematic synthesis. Records were screened and data extracted by two reviewers. EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psychinfo and Cochrane central register for controlled trials were searched using pre-defined terms. Hand searching of conference literature, thesis databases and citation tracking was also conducted. The protocol for this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO and can be found at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42017080038. RESULTS The search identified 3807 titles and 30 studies were included in the review. Telehealth was used to support patients and carers, electronic record keeping and professional education. Notably, the number of home telemonitoring initiatives for patients had increased from the 2010 review. Despite this variety, many studies were small scale, descriptive and provided little evidence of evaluation of the service. Ten papers were sufficiently detailed to allow appraisal against the digital service standard and only one of these met all of the criteria to some extent. Seven studies made reference to emergency care access. CONCLUSIONS Although there is growth of telehealth services, there remains a lack of evaluation and robust study design meaning conclusions regarding the clinical application of telehealth in palliative care cannot be drawn. There is insufficient evidence to appreciate any benefit of telehealth on access to emergency care. Future work is needed to evaluate the use of telehealth in palliative care and improve telehealth design in line with digital service standards.","Hancock, Sophie; Preston, Nancy; Jones, Helen; Gadoud, Amy",BMC palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12904-019-0495-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31835998/,129

149771,A Bitter Elixir: Palliative Chemotherapy During a Pandemic.,2020-05-28,"Background: The COVID-19 crisis presents new challenges and opportunities in managing alcohol use disorders, particularly for people unable to shelter in place due to homelessness or other reasons. Requiring abstinence for shelter engagement is impractical for many with severe alcohol use disorders and poses a modifiable barrier to self-isolation orders. Managed alcohol programs (MAPs) have successfully increased housing adherence for those with physical alcohol dependence in Canada, but to our knowledge, they have not been implemented in the United States. To avoid life-threatening alcohol withdrawal syndromes and to support adherence to COVID-19 self-isolation and quarantine orders, MAPs were piloted by the public health departments of San Francisco and Alameda counties. Development of MAPs: We describe implementation of a first-in-the-nation alcohol use disorder intervention of a MAP that emerged at three public health isolation settings within San Francisco and Alameda counties in California. All three interventions utilized a similar process to develop the protocol and implement the MAP that included identification of champions for system-level advocacy and engagement of stakeholders. Implementation of MAPs: We describe the creation and implementation of the distinct protocols. We provide examples of iterative changes to workflow processes and key lessons learned pertaining to protocol development, acceptability by stakeholders, alcohol procurement, documentation, and assessment. We discuss safety considerations, noting that there were no deaths or serious adverse events in any of the patients of the MAP during the 2-month implementation period. Conclusions: MAP pilots have been implemented in the US to aid adherence to isolation and quarantine setting guidelines. Lessons learned provide a foundation for their expansion as a recognized public health intervention for individuals with severe alcohol use disorders who are unable to stabilize within existing care systems. Based on the success of MAP implementation, efforts are under way to investigate alcohol management in homeless populations more broadly.","Ristau, Jessica; Mehtani, Nicky; Gomez, Seth; Nance, Michelle; Keller, Devora; Surlyn, Colleen; Eveland, Joanna; Smith-Bernardin, Shannon",Substance abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.1892012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848451/,129
149858,Cerebral autoregulation index at high altitude assessed by thigh-cuff and transfer function analysis techniques.,2015,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are two of the most significant trade-limiting pathogens affecting swine worldwide. Both viruses are endemic to China where millions of kilograms of feed ingredients are manufactured and subsequently imported into the United States. Although stability and oral transmission of both viruses through contaminated pork products has been demonstrated as a risk factor for transboundary spread, stability in animal feed ingredients had yet to be investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the survival of CSFV and variant PRV in 12 animal feeds and ingredients exposed to environmental conditions simulating a 37-day transpacific shipment. Virus was detected by PCR, virus isolation, and nursery pig bioassay. CSFV and PRV nucleic acids were stable throughout the 37-day period in all feed matrices. Infectious CSFV was detected in 2 ingredients (conventional soybean meal and pork sausage casings) at 37 days post-contamination, whereas infectious PRV was detected in 9 ingredients (conventional and organic soybean meal, lysine, choline, vitamin D, moist cat and dog food, dry dog food and pork sausage casings). This study demonstrates the relative stability of CSFV and PRV in different feed ingredients under shipment conditions and provides evidence that feed ingredients may represent important risk factors for the transboundary spread of these viruses.","Stoian, Ana M M; Petrovan, Vlad; Constance, Laura A; Olcha, Matthew; Dee, Scott; Diel, Diego G; Sheahan, Maureen A; Rowland, Raymond R R; Patterson, Gilbert; Niederwerder, Megan C",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31999072/,129

The primordium of the adenohypophysis as well as the primordium of the hypothalamus in amphibians is of neural origin as shown in other vertebrates, and both are closely associated with each other at the earliest stage of development. Metamorphosis progresses via the interaction of thyroid hormone and adrenal corticosteroids, of which secretion is enhanced by thyrotropin and corticotropin, respectively. However, unlike in mammals, the hypothalamic releasing factor for thyrotropin is not thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), but corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the major releasing factor for corticotropin is arginine vasotocin (AVT). Prolactin, the release of which is profoundly enhanced by TRH at the metamorphic climax, is another pituitary hormone involved in metamorphosis. Prolactin has a dual role: modulation of the metamorphic speed and the development of organs for adult life. The secretory activities of the pituitary cells containing the three above-mentioned pituitary hormones are elevated toward the metamorphic climax in parallel with the activities of the CRF, AVT, and TRH neurons.","Kikuyama, Sakae; Hasunuma, Itaru; Okada, Reiko",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2020.111143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385474/,129

We aimed to assess feasibility and reliability of 2 central adjudication methods of mRS in the setting of a randomized endovascular stroke trial. METHODS This is a secondary analysis derived from the Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within Eight Hours of Symptom Onset (REVASCAT) trial cohort. Primary outcome was distribution of mRS at 90 days. Local evaluation was done by certified investigators masked to treatment assignment using structured face-to-face interviews. In addition, central assessment was performed by 2 independent raters via structured phone interview (n=120) and via video recordings of the face-to-face interviews with local investigators (n=106). Interrater agreement was evaluated using kappa and discordance statistics. Sensitivity analyses for the primary end point using different adjudication approaches were performed. Correlation between mRS obtained with each modality and 24-hour follow-up infarct volumes was studied. RESULTS Using local evaluation as the reference, higher agreement rates were noted with central video than with central phone evaluations (kw 0.92 [0.88-0.96] versus 0.77 [0.72-0.83]). Discrepancies in mRS scoring between local and central raters (phone- and video-based) were similar in both treatment allocation arms. Sensitivity analyses showed benefit of endovascular treatment irrespective of adjudication method, but higher odds ratios were observed with local evaluations. Final infarct volume was similarly correlated with mRS across all 3 evaluation modalities. CONCLUSIONS Central adjudication of mRS is feasible, reducing interrater variability and avoiding potential problems related to lack of blinding. Our findings may have implications in the planning of future randomized acute stroke trials, especially in those including nonpharmacological interventions.

METHODS Eligible studies evaluating one or more predictive factors for brace treatment outcome were included following a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE on October 23, 2017. Inclusion criteria were: (1) subjects diagnosed with AIS, (2) age ≤ 18 years, (3) treated with a thoraco-lumbo-sacral orthosis (TLSO), and (4) evaluated one or more predictive factors of treatment outcome (failure and/or success). The methodological quality of included studies was independently assessed by two authors. Pooling was not possible due to heterogeneity in statistical analysis. Predictive factors were presented according to a best-evidence synthesis. RESULTS The literature search identified 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, and multiple types of TLSO braces were identified (Boston, Wilmington, Chêneau, Osaka Medical College, Dresdner Scoliosis Orthosis and SPoRT). A total of 19 radiographic and 8 clinical predictive factors were reported. Strong evidence was found that lack of initial in-brace correction is associated with treatment failure. Moderate evidence suggests that brace wear time is associated with failure and success, whereas initial curve magnitude and curve type are not. CONCLUSION The results of this review suggest that lack of initial in-brace correction is strongly associated with brace treatment failure. Future studies on the threshold for minimal immediate in-brace correction, as a potential indication for brace treatment, are recommended.

150750,Non-invasive intervention for motor signs of Parkinson's disease: the effect of vibratory stimuli.,2020-09-11,"In an effort to develop an effective source of clinically relevant cells and tissues for cartilage repair a directed differentiation method was used to generate articular chondrocytes and cartilage tissues from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). It has previously been demonstrated that chondrocytes derived from hESCs retain a stable cartilage-forming phenotype following subcutaneous implantation in mice. In this report, the potential of hESC-derived articular-like cartilage to repair osteochondral defects created in the rat trochlea was evaluated. Articular cartilage-like tissues were generated from hESCs and implanted into the defects. After 6 and 12 weeks, the defects were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically, and the quality of repair was assessed using a modified ICRS II scoring system. Following 6 and 12 weeks after implantation, hESC-derived cartilage tissues maintained their proteoglycan and type II collagen-rich matrix and scored significantly higher than control defects, which had been filled with fibrin glue alone. Implants were found to be well integrated with native host tissue at the basal and lateral surfaces, although implanted human cells and host cells remained regionally separated. A subset of implants underwent a process of remodeling similar to endochondral ossification, suggesting the potential for a single cartilaginous implant to promote the generation of new subchondral bone in addition to repair of the articular cartilage. The ability to create cartilage tissues with integrative and reparative properties from an unlimited and robust cell source represents a significant advance for cartilage repair that can be further developed in large animal models before clinical- setting application.","Gardner, O F; Juneja, S C; Whetstone, H; Nartiss, Y; Sieker, J T; Veillette, C; Keller, G M; Craft, A M",European cells & materials,https://doi.org/10.22203/ecm.v038a15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688947/,129

However, limited information is available to inform the care of AYA cancer survivors in this regard. This scoping review, conducted by the Children's Oncology Group AYA Oncology Discipline Committee, summarizes available literature regarding sexual function among AYA cancer survivors, including relevant psychosexual aspects of romantic relationships and body image. Results suggest that, overall, AYA cancer survivors experience a substantial burden of sexual dysfunction. Both physical and psychosocial sequelae influence survivors' sexual health. Interventions to support sexual health and psychosexual adjustment after cancer treatment are needed.

Laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch reconstruction is a novel approach that may be especially suitable in these patients. METHODS Patients with a germline CDH1 mutation who underwent prophylactic laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch were included in our prospective database. RESULTS A total of 11 patients with a median age of 40 (22-61) years were included. The average operative time was 4:26 ± 0:49 h and the average blood loss was 219 ± 155 ml. Median length of hospital stay was 10 (7-27) days. In two patients, an esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage occurred (grade 4). The leakages were seen in patient numbers 2 and 3, which may be a result of a learning curve. The latter eight patients did not develop anastomotic leakage. Pulmonary complications occurred in one patient with atelectasis and in one patient with pneumonia (grade 2). The 60-day mortality rate was 0 %. Multiple foci of intramucosal diffuse gastric signet ring cell carcinoma were found in the resection specimen of 9/11 (82 %) patients. All 11/11 (100 %) resections were microscopically radical. CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic laparoscopic total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch reconstruction in patients with a CDH1 germline mutation is feasible and safe. In 82 % of patients, foci of intramucosal diffuse gastric signet ring cell carcinoma in the resection specimen were found.","Haverkamp, L; van der Sluis, P C; Ausems, M G E M; van der Horst, S; Siersema, P D; Ruurda, J P; Offerhaus, G J A; van Hillegersberg, R",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-2963-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26443527/,129

It occurs more commonly following banding and sleeve gastrectomy procedures than with gastric bypass, is associated with long duration and advanced stages of diabetes and is exacerbated by weight regain. Long-term diabetes management following various gastric restrictive surgery (i.e. lap banding) requires targeting weight loss, insulin resistance and insulin secretion defects with antidiabetic agents that have weight negative or neutral effects. In contrast, re-emergence of hyperglycaemia following gastric bypass may require targeting β-cell failure with insulin analogues. Revisional bariatric surgery is also a consideration.

RECENT FINDINGS The examination and history of a pediatric gynecologic patient involve information gathering in order to limit anxiety for the child and optimize the ability to diagnose and treat her. Child abuse recognition is increasing, and its management requires special expertise. The early management of disorders of sexual development (DSDs) has changed with a focus towards early identification and consideration of delayed surgical management. The multidisciplinary evaluation and management of the pelvic mass in the child involves careful preoperative evaluation to allow for conservative management. SUMMARY Reproductive endocrinology and infertility (REI) providers are often called upon to evaluate children when a pediatric gynecologist is not immediately available. This review highlights valuable information for adult gynecologic providers who may encounter young girls with gynecologic issues in a variety of settings. Having some basic knowledge of the evaluation and management will allow the provider to either manage the child themselves or triage her to the appropriate consultant.","Kudze, Tambu; Wheeler, Carol",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054101/,129
152814,Treatment patterns of FIGO Stage IB2 cervical cancer: a single-institution experience of radical hysterectomy with individualized postoperative therapy and definitive radiation therapy.,2008,"HIV-1 primarily infects activated CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Quiescent CD4+ T cells, however, possess cellular factors that limit HIV-1 infection at different postentry steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we show that the previously reported immune regulator monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) restricts HIV-1 production in CD4+ T cells. While the ectopic expression of MCPIP1 in cell lines abolished the production of HIV-1, silencing of MCPIP1 enhanced HIV-1 production. Subsequent analysis indicated that MCPIP1 imposes its restriction by decreasing the steady levels of viral mRNA species through its RNase domain. Remarkably, common T-cell stimuli induced the rapid degradation of MCPIP1 in both T-cell lines and quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Lastly, blocking the proteosomal degradation of MCPIP1 by MG132 abrogated HIV-1 production in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated human CD4+ T cells isolated from healthy donors. Overall, MCPIP1 poses a potent barrier against HIV-1 infection at a posttranscriptional stage. Although the observed HIV restriction conferred by MCPIP1 does not seem to be overcome by any viral protein, it is removed during cellular stimulation. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of cellular activation-mediated HIV-1 production in CD4+ T cells.","Liu, Shufeng; Qiu, Chao; Miao, Ruidong; Zhou, Jianhua; Lee, Aram; Liu, Baoming; Lester, Sandra N; Fu, Weihui; Zhu, Lingyan; Zhang, Linxia; Xu, Jianqing; Fan, Daping; Li, Kui; Fu, Mingui; Wang, Tianyi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1316208110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24191027/,129

Indeed, a total cure of the fistula can only be achieved when complete occlusion of the fistulous point(s) is obtained by penetration of the embolic agent. However, in some cases, especially for transosseous branches from extracranial arteries like the occipital artery (OcA) or the superficial temporal artery (STA), such penetration is usually poor, leading to major proximal reflux and incomplete fistula obliteration. We present three cases of embolization in two patients with TS DAVF through the OcA and/or the STA with Onyx® using a double-lumen balloon (Microvention, Tustin, CA, USA). This technique allows the penetration of the embolic agent in the transosseous branches by forming a counter-pressure with the inflated balloon. This technique may be useful to achieve complete occlusion of TS DAVFs by endovascular means.","Clarençon, Frédéric; Di Maria, Federico; Gabrieli, Joseph; Carpentier, Alexandre; Pistochi, Silvia; Bartolini, Bruno; Zeghal, Chiheb; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader-Antoine",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-016-2906-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27522356/,129

153022,Prognostic significance of BRAF mutation alone and in combination with microsatellite instability in stage III colon cancer.,2019,"PURPOSE Rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) is an uncommon condition caused by lesion of the superior or inferior epigastric arteries or their branches or by rupture of the rectus muscle. Treatment is usually supportive; however, if haemodynamic compromise develops, intravascular embolisation or surgery may be required. Furthermore, in some cases, bleeding may be so conspicuous that it can determine the patient's death before an adequate treatment is performed. We performed a retrospective study on 78 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of RSH admitted to the General Surgery Unit of our hospital between January 2000 and December 2010 in order to identify possible prognostic risk factors that could affect the operational approach before the onset of haemodynamic instability. METHODS Demographic characteristics, patient history, laboratory and diagnostic imaging examinations were investigated. The variables considered were: gender, age, anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy, trauma, international normalised ratio (INR) and bleeding time in the first 72 h of observation and concomitant diseases. The data were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Sixty patients received a conservative treatment, while 18 underwent operative treatment for haemodynamic instability (embolisation in 2 patients and surgery in 16 patients). Three of these 18 patients (17 %) died for consumption coagulopathy after surgery. None of the variables included in the univariate statistical analysis was significant (p = ns). CONCLUSION Ultrasonography or computed tomography are the most common methods used to establish the diagnosis of RSH, so it is no longer a diagnostic dilemma. Most patients can be treated conservatively and an operative treatment is justified only in case of haemodynamic instability. Our retrospective study could not identify any prognostic risk factor of haemodynamic instability in RSH. We believe that only a close observation of the patients with RSH and ""common sense"" can prevent a possible fatal outcome.","Villa, M; Grande, M; Rulli, F; Konda, D; Perretta, T; Amabile, D; Montuori, M; Giurioli, C; Simonetti, G; Tucci, G",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-012-0184-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26816257/,129
153073,Review of the state of renal nerve ablation for patients with severe and resistant hypertension.,2013,"CONTEXT Health care professionals advocate that athletes who are susceptible to exercise-associated muscle cramps (EAMCs) should moderately increase their fluid and electrolyte intake by drinking sport drinks. Some clinicians have also claimed drinking small volumes of pickle juice effectively relieves acute EAMCs, often alleviating them within 35 seconds. Others fear ingesting pickle juice will enhance dehydration-induced hypertonicity, thereby prolonging dehydration. OBJECTIVE To determine if ingesting small quantities of pickle juice, a carbohydrate-electrolyte (CHO-e) drink, or water increases plasma electrolytes or other selected plasma variables. DESIGN Crossover study. SETTING Exercise physiology laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Nine euhydrated, healthy men (age = 25 +/- 2 years, height = 179.4 +/- 7.2 cm, mass = 86.3 +/- 15.9 kg) completed the study. INTERVENTION(S) Resting blood samples were collected preingestion (-0.5 minutes); immediately postingestion (0 minutes); and at 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 minutes postingestion of 1 mL/kg body mass of pickle juice, CHO-e drink, or tap water. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Plasma sodium concentration, plasma magnesium concentration, plasma calcium concentration, plasma potassium concentration, plasma osmolality, and changes in plasma volume were analyzed. Urine specific gravity, osmolality, and volume were also measured to characterize hydration status. RESULTS Mean fluid intake was 86.3 +/- 16.7 mL. Plasma sodium concentration, plasma magnesium concentration, plasma calcium concentration, plasma osmolality, and plasma volume did not change during the 60 minutes after ingestion of each fluid (P >or= .05). Water ingestion slightly decreased plasma potassium concentration at 60 minutes (0.21 +/- 0.14 mg/dL [0.21 +/- 0.14 mmol/L]; P <or= .05). CONCLUSIONS At these volumes, ingestion of pickle juice and CHO-e drink did not cause substantial changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations, plasma osmolality, or plasma volume in rested, euhydrated men. Concern that ingesting these volumes of pickle juice might exacerbate an athlete's risk of dehydration-induced hypertonicity may be unwarranted. If EAMCs are caused by large electrolyte loss due to sweating, these volumes of pickle juice or CHO-e drink are unlikely to restore any deficit incurred by exercise.","Miller, Kevin C; Mack, Gary; Knight, Kenneth L",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-44.5.454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19771282/,129

METHOD Five patients with corneal opacity due to healed keratitis/optically failed therapeutic grafts along with pterygium or pseudopterygium underwent combined pterygium surgery by head inversion technique and corneal tattooing in the same sitting. All patients had no visual prognosis in that eye and surgery was indicated for cosmetic reasons only. RESULTS At 6 months follow up no complications of pterygium surgery like recurrence, thinning, dellen, infections were noted in any patient. The dye was retained in the cornea and the cosmetic rehabilitation was excellent in all patients. DISCUSSION Corneal tattooing combined with pterygium/pseudopterygium surgery can be performed in a single sitting with this novel technique in eyes with no visual potential. This is particularly suitable for eyes with limbal stem cell deficiency or large pterygia/pseudopterygia where conjunctival autograft is not advisable. These patients are often apprehensive for an allograft from their only seeing other eye.","Bafna, Rahul Kumar; Kalra, Nidhi; Sinha, Rajesh",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672120958308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962411/,129

The Barrett's International NBI Group (BING) aimed to develop and validate an NBI classification system for identification of dysplasia and cancer in patients with BE. METHODS The BING working group, composed of NBI experts from the United States, Europe, and Japan, met to develop a validated, consensus-driven NBI classification system for identifying dysplasia and cancer in BE. The group reviewed 60 NBI images of nondysplastic BE, high-grade dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma to characterize mucosal and vascular patterns visible by NBI; these features were used to develop the BING criteria. We then recruited adult patients undergoing surveillance or endoscopic treatment for BE at 4 institutions in the United States and Europe, obtaining high-quality NBI images and performing histologic analysis of biopsies. Experts individually reviewed 50 NBI images to validate the BING criteria, and then evaluated 120 additional NBI images (not previously viewed) to determine whether the criteria accurately predicted the histology results. RESULTS The BING criteria identified patients with dysplasia with 85% overall accuracy, 80% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 81% positive predictive value, and 88% negative predictive value. When dysplasia was identified with a high level of confidence, these values were 92%, 91%, 93%, 89%, and 95%, respectively. The overall strength of inter-observer agreement was substantial (κ = 0.681). CONCLUSIONS The BING working group developed a simple, internally validated system to identify dysplasia and EAC in patients with BE based on NBI results. When images are assessed with a high degree of confidence, the system can classify BE with >90% accuracy and a high level of inter-observer agreement.","Sharma, Prateek; Bergman, Jacques J G H M; Goda, Kenichi; Kato, Mototsugu; Messmann, Helmut; Alsop, Benjamin R; Gupta, Neil; Vennalaganti, Prashanth; Hall, Matt; Konda, Vani; Koons, Ann; Penner, Olga; Goldblum, John R; Waxman, Irving",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2015.11.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26627609/,129
153748,Sex disparities in diagnosis of bladder cancer after initial presentation with hematuria: a nationwide claims-based investigation.,2014,"The replication and pathogenicity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) critically depend on their ability to tolerate the antiviral interferon (IFN) response. To determine a potential role for the IAV hemagglutinin (HA) in viral sensitivity to IFN, we studied the restriction of IAV infection in IFN-β-treated human epithelial cells by using 2:6 recombinant IAVs that shared six gene segments of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus (PR8) and contained HAs and neuraminidases of representative avian, human, and zoonotic H5N1 and H7N9 viruses. In A549 and Calu-3 cells, viruses displaying a higher pH optimum of HA-mediated membrane fusion, H5N1-PR8 and H7N9-PR8, were less sensitive to the IFN-induced antiviral state than their counterparts with HAs from duck and human viruses, which fused at a lower pH. The association between a high pH optimum of fusion and reduced IFN sensitivity was confirmed by using HA point mutants of A/Hong Kong/1/1968-PR8 that differed solely by their fusion properties. Furthermore, similar effects of the viral fusion pH on IFN sensitivity were observed in experiments with (i) primary human type II alveolar epithelial cells and differentiated cultures of human airway epithelial cells, (ii) nonrecombinant zoonotic and pandemic IAVs, and (iii) preparations of IFN-α and IFN-λ1. A higher pH of membrane fusion and reduced sensitivity to IFN correlated with lower restriction of the viruses in MDCK cells stably expressing the IFN-inducible transmembrane proteins IFITM2 and IFITM3, which are known to inhibit viral fusion. Our results reveal that the pH optimum of HA-driven membrane fusion of IAVs is a determinant of their sensitivity to IFN and IFITM proteins.IMPORTANCE The IFN system constitutes an important innate defense against viral infection. Substantial information is available on how IAVs avoid detection by sensors of the IFN system and disable IFN signaling pathways. Much less is known about the ability of IAVs to tolerate the antiviral activity of IFN-induced cellular proteins. The IFN-induced proteins of the IFITM family block IAV entry into target cells and can restrict viral spread and pathogenicity. Here we show for the first time that the sensitivity of IAVs to the IFN-induced antiviral state and IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins depends on the pH value at which the viral HA undergoes a conformational transition and mediates membrane fusion. Our data imply that the high pH optimum of membrane fusion typical of zoonotic IAVs of gallinaceous poultry, such as H5N1 and H7N9, may contribute to their enhanced virulence in humans.","Gerlach, Thomas; Hensen, Luca; Matrosovich, Tatyana; Bergmann, Janina; Winkler, Michael; Peteranderl, Christin; Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Weber, Friedemann; Herold, Susanne; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Matrosovich, Mikhail",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00246-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28356532/,129

The main object of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between the ABO blood group and the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature search using appropriate MeSH terms was performed through Medline and PubMed. The outcomes considered were the prevalence of the blood group O vs non-O types in SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected subjects, and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to ABO group. The methodological quality of the studies included in the analysis was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the overall quality of the available evidence using the GRADE system. Benchmarks used to evaluate the effect size were odd ratios (ORs) for case control studies and risk ratios (RRs) for cohort studies. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included in the analysis. Overall, individuals with group O had a lower infection rate compared to individuals of non-O group (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.86). However, the difference in the effect size was significantly lower in cohort studies compared to case control studies. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on the disease severity in the infected patients. DISCUSSION We have found low/very low evidence that group O individuals are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those in the non-O group. No evidence was found indicating an effect of the O type on disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Franchini, Massimo; Cruciani, Mario; Mengoli, Carlo; Marano, Giuseppe; Candura, Fabio; Lopez, Nadia; Pati, Ilaria; Pupella, Simonetta; De Angelis, Vincenzo",Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,https://doi.org/10.2450/2021.0049-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059188/,129

The study is retrospective analysis of data acquired prospectively on 57 patients during the first 24 hours after the occurrence of the shock. Clinical and haemodynamic characteristics, skin perfusion parameters (capillary refill time (CRT), mottling score and temperature gradients) and the dose rate of NE infusion were collected. Negative correlations between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and temperature gradients (core-to-toe P = 0.03, core-to-index P = 0.04) were found and abnormal CRT was associated with lower MAP (P = 0.02). The dose rate of NE was negatively correlated with temperature gradients (core-to-toe: P = 0.02, core-to-index: P = 0.01, forearm-to-index: P = 0.008) in the overall population. In patients receiving NE for at least 12h, the NE dose rate positively was correlated with the mottling score (P = 0.006), temperature gradients (core-to-toe, P = 0.04, forearm-to-index: P = 0.02, core-to-index: P = 0.005) and CRT (P = 0.001). The dose of NE administered was associated with 14-days mortality (OR = 1.21 [1.06 - 1.38], P = 0.006) and with 28-days mortality (OR = 1.17 [1.01 - 1.36], P = 0.04). In conclusion, the study described the presence of correlations between peripheral perfusion and MAP and between peripheral perfusion and the dose rate of NE infusion.","Magnin, Mathieu; Amson, Harry; Vacheron, Charles-Hervé; Thiollière, Fabrice; Piriou, Vincent; Junot, Stéphane; Bonnet Garin, Jeanne-Marie; Allaouchiche, Bernard",Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1681.13540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133795/,129

Research related to the sequelae of diabetes-in particular, long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications-in patients who undergo weight-loss surgery is imperative to this pursuit. While numerous randomized control trials have assessed glucose control with bariatric surgery compared with intensive medical therapy, bariatric surgery outcome data relating to microvascular and macrovascular complications have been limited to observational studies and nonrandomized clinical trials. As a result, whether bariatric surgery is associated with a long-term reduction in microvascular and macrovascular complications when compared with current intensive glycemic control therapy cannot be determined because the evidence is insufficient. However, the consistent salutary effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes remission and glycemic improvement support the opportunity (and need) to conduct high-quality studies of bariatric surgery versus intensive glucose control.

(2) Method: The difference in efficacy was evaluated by comparing the risks detected in two groups in an initial assessment (with visits in the 2006-2008 period) to the risks detected in a later assessment, either after an intervention by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities or after an intervention by Technical Advisors without enforcement capabilities (2011-2013). The assessments identified risks in the companies, according to a specific risk map for olive oil mill enterprises. (3) Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in the comparison of the risk reductions of the two groups, with regard to the initial assessment. The greatest reductions in risk were found in the companies that received interventions by Authorized Technicians with enforcement capabilities, in the sections of individual protection equipment and the storage of dangerous products.

154152,Long-Term Follow-Up of Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients Evaluated via Sentinel Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,2017,"Auditory neuronal responses are modified by background noise. Inferior colliculus (IC) neuronal responses adapt to the most frequent sound level within an acoustic scene (adaptation to stimulus statistics), a mechanism that may preserve neuronal and behavioral thresholds for signal detection. However, it is still unclear if the presence of foreground stimuli and/or task involvement can modify neuronal adaptation. To investigate how task-engagement interacts with this mechanism, we compared the response of IC neurons to background noise, which caused adaptation to stimulus statistics, while macaque monkeys performed a masked tone detection task (task-driven condition) with responses recorded when the same background noise was presented alone (passive listening condition). In the task-dependent condition, monkeys performed a Go/No-Go task while 50 ms tones were embedded within an adaptation-inducing continuous background noise, whose level changed every 50 ms and were drawn from a probability distribution. The adaptation to noise stimulus statistics in IC neuronal responses was significantly enhanced in the task-driven condition compared to the passive listening condition, showing that foreground stimuli and/or task-engagement can modify IC neuronal responses. Additionally, the response of IC neurons to noise was significantly affected by the preceding sensory information (history effect) regardless of task involvement. These studies show that dynamic range adaptation in IC preserves behavioral and neurometric thresholds irrespective of noise type, and a dependence of neuronal activity on task-related factors at subcortical levels of processing.","Rocchi, Francesca; Ramachandran, Ramnarayan",Journal of neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00153.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937088/,129
154310,Audio Interview: Guidelines for Covid-19 Vaccine Deployment.,2020-09-10,"BACKGROUND Appropriate interfacility transfers are a key component of highly functioning trauma systems but transfer of unsalvageable patients can overburden the resources of higher-level centers. We sought to identify the occurrence and associated reasons for futile transfers within our trauma system. METHODS Using prospectively collected data from our system database, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify patients who underwent interfacility transfer to our American College of Surgeons level I center. Adult patients from June 2017 to June 2019 who died, had comfort measures implemented, were discharged, or went to hospice care within 48 hours of admission without significant operation, procedure, or radiologic intervention were examined. Futility was defined as resulting in death or hospice discharge within 48 hours of transfer without major operative, endoscopic, or radiologic intervention. RESULTS A total of 1,241 patients transferred to our facility during the study period. Four hundred seven patients had a length of stay less than or equal to 48 hours. Eighteen (1.5%) met the criteria for futility. The most common reason for transfer in the futile population was traumatic brain injury (56%) and need for neurosurgical capabilities (62%). Futile patients had a median age and Injury Severity Score of 75 and 21. The main transportation method was ground 9 (50%) with 8 (44.4%) being transported by helicopter and 1 (5.6%) being transported by both. Combining transport costs with hospital charges, each futile transfer was estimated to cost US $56,396 (interquartile range, 41,889-106,393) with a total cost exceeding US $1.7 million. With an estimated 33,000 interfacility transfers annually for trauma in the United States, the cost of futile transfers to the American trauma system would exceed 27 million dollars each year. CONCLUSION Futile transfers represent a small but costly portion transfer volume. Identification of patients whose conditions preclude the benefit of transfer due to futility and development of appropriate support for referral will significantly improve appropriate allocation of health care resources.

Participants (n = 698) completed an online survey in which they were asked to reflect on their mediated and interpersonal information consumption, in addition to reporting on risk perceptions, general efficacy perceptions, and preventative behaviors specific to COVID-19 in the past seven days. Participant age and chronic condition status were controlled for in all analyses. Time spent consuming news, social media, and health website information was not related to risk perceptions. Time spent on health websites predicted time spent having interpersonal conversations about COVID-19, as well as general efficacy levels. Following the Extended Parallel Process Model, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, and general perceived efficacy predicted preventative behaviors. The vast majority of participants did report taking preventative action against COVID-19, most commonly in the form of hand washing, with many enacting stronger preventative behaviors that had yet to be recommended for the general population. Overall, mediated and interpersonal information exposure had minimal effects on perceived risk and perceived general efficacy, which in turn predicted 27.5% of the variance in preventative behavior. Efficacy was the most powerful among these predictors, and health websites, specifically governmental websites, appeared to be underutilized resources with the potential to promote efficacy during outbreaks.

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted based in official databases. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated by age-gropus, educational level, sex and year. Rate Ratios (RR) were estimated with higher educational level as reference. The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) was estimated. Joinpoint regressions were applied to identify inflexion points in mortality trends, and Percent Annual Change (APC) between inflexion points. RESULTS 124,198 deaths caused by DM among adults (25+ years) were analysed, 57% among women (71,093); 74% of deaths occurred among those older than 45 years, especially senior adults (65+). The highest adjusted mortality rates were for those with primary and secondary educational levels. The highest mortality occurred in adult women (65 years or more) with primary education level. Relative Index of Inequality was higher for women than for men along the period. CONCLUSIONS Educational levels were found to be strongly associated with death by DM in adults (25+).

Thirty pregnant Wistar rats were divided into control and four treated groups receiving subcutaneously (s.c) on the 3rd day of pregnancy, K2Cr2O7 (10 mg/kg, s.c) alone, or in association with Se (0.3 mg/kg, s.c), ZnCl2 (20 mg/kg, s.c), or both of them simultaneously. The hormonal profile, oxidative stress biomarkers, DNA damage, and histological modifications were evaluated. Our main findings showed that K2Cr2O7 promoted hypothyroidism, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and histological alterations in the thyroid gland. The co-treatment with Se or ZnCl2 has mitigated K2Cr2O7-induced thyrotoxicity in pregnant Wistar rats by exhibiting antioxidant and genoprotective effects. However, the combined co-treatment of both of them was less thyroprotective, and therefore, further investigations on the synergetic interaction of Se and Zn against CrVI toxicity using different doses and exposure routes are required.","Fedala, Anfal; Adjroud, Ounassa; Abid-Essefi, Salwa; Timoumi, Rim",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12268-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423197/,129

In 1989, Peplau published her thoughts on how World War II (WWII) shaped early PMH APN practice. Following WWII and the return of hundreds of thousands of previously mentally healthy service members with combat-related psychiatric symptoms and disorders, the prevailing societal beliefs about mental illness began to shift from an innate/inherited etiological perspective to a broader appreciation of the additional contributions of social and environmental factors to mental well-being. With that awareness came a decrease in stigma and a shift from housing patients in psychiatric hospitals to treating them in community settings.

The median time from stroke onset to the start of treatment was 3.75 hours for endovascular therapy and 2.75 hours for intravenous t-PA (P<0.001). At 3 months, 55 patients in the endovascular-therapy group (30.4%) and 63 in the intravenous t-PA group (34.8%) were alive without disability (odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity, and atrial fibrillation status at baseline, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.14; P=0.16). Fatal or nonfatal symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 6% of the patients in each group, and there were no significant differences between groups in the rates of other serious adverse events or the case fatality rate. CONCLUSIONS The results of this trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke indicate that endovascular therapy is not superior to standard treatment with intravenous t-PA.

METHODS Retrospective observational case report. RESULTS A 75-year-old lady presented with a left eye pan uveitis picture with vitritis and extensive peripheral and mid-peripheral necrotising retinitis. In the right eye, she had a very mild superior peripheral retinitis with minimal anterior or vitreous inflammation. Two months prior to her diagnosis she completed a course of rituximab and chlorambucil chemotherapy for a relapse of diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient's nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive for COVID-19 in a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The vitreous sample PCR tested positive for Varicella Zoster Virus and was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of a case that has undergone vitreous PCR testing for COVID-19. It is interesting to note the high level of vitreous inflammation which would not be expected in an immunosuppressed state. We present a number of possible links between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the unusual ocular presentation of bilateral VZV viral retinitis in this patient.While extra ocular VZV outbreaks have been reported with rituximab treated patients, this report should also raise the awareness of VZV related viral retinitis in DLBCL patients on rituximab chemotherapy which is a very rare occurrence.This case may provide some evidence to healthcare policy makers who are making decisions regarding the re-introduction of routine Ophthalmic surgery.","Gupta, Ankur; Dixit, Bhavini; Stamoulas, Konstantinos; Akshikar, Rashmi",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672120974941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225728/,129

The mammalian expression system allows the procurement of specific and highly sensitive antibodies, avoiding animal immunization. In this study, S-metolachlor-specific IgG vectors bearing either Thosea asigna virus 2A or internal ribosome entry site (S-T2A or S-IRES) and single-chain variable fragment (scFv) vectors were designed and expressed. The recombinant antibodies (RAbs) were characterized by indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (icELISA). The results showed that full-length RAbs exhibited significantly better performance than scFv, and both bicistronic vectors expressed antibodies of correct size, while RAb S-T2A elicited a higher yield than RAb S-IRES. Further analyses showed that RAb S-T2A and RAb S-IRES exhibited comparable reactivities and specificities to the parental MAb, with IC50 values of 3.44, 3.89 and 3.37 ng/mL, respectively. Finally, MAb- and RAb-based icELISAs were established for the determination of S-metolachlor in environmental waters. The recoveries were in the range of 73.0-128.1%, and the coefficients of variation were mostly below 10%. This article describes the production of RAbs for S-metolachlor from mammalian cells for the first time and paves the way to develop RAb-based immunoassays for monitoring herbicide residues in the environment.","Yu, Xiaoting; Zhang, Xu; Xu, Jingjing; Guo, Pengyan; Li, Xiangmei; Wang, Hong; Xu, Zhenlin; Lei, Hongtao; Shen, Xing",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118539/,129

Herein, we introduce a visible-light-activated (VLA) antimicrobial air filter functionalized with titanium dioxide (TiO2)-crystal violet (CV) nanocomposites facilitating abandoned visible light from sunlight or indoor lights. The TiO2-CV based VLA antimicrobial air filters exhibit a potent inactivation rate of ∼99.98% and filtration efficiency of ∼99.9% against various bioaerosols. Under visible-light, the CV is involved in overall inactivation by inducing reactive oxygen species production both directly (CV itself) and indirectly (in combination with TiO2). Moreover, the susceptibility of the CV to humidity was significantly improved by forming a hydrophobic molecular layer on the TiO2 surface, highlighting its potential applicability in real environments such as exhaled or humid air. We believe this work can open a new avenue for designing and realizing practical antimicrobial technology using ubiquitous visible-light energy against the threat of infectious bioaerosols.","Heo, Ki Joon; Jeong, Sang Bin; Shin, Juhun; Hwang, Gi Byoung; Ko, Hyun Sik; Kim, Yeonsang; Choi, Dong Yun; Jung, Jae Hee",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275432/,129

However, the exact regulation mechanism of Anillin in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we examined and verified the anomalous high expression of Anillin in both HCC patients' specimens and HCC cell lines. High expression of Anillin is associated with dismal clinicopathologic features of HCC patients and poor prognosis. We conducted loss-of and gain-of function studies in HCC Hep3B cells. Anillin presented a significantly facilitating effect on cell proliferation in vitro and induced remarkable tumor growth in vivo. We found that the over-expression of Anillin was driven by a potential axis of miR-138/SOX4. Transcription factor SOX4 presented a high expression profile positive correlated with Anillin, and ChIP assay validated the interaction between SOX4 and the specific sequence of the promoter region of Anillin gene. While, we verified miR-138 as an upstream regulator of SOX4, which is abrogated in HCC cells and exerts degenerating effect on SOX4 mRNA. In our conclusion, Anillin facilitates the cell proliferation and enhances tumor growth of HCC, and is modulated by miR-138/SOX4 axis which regulates the transcriptional activity of Anillin. Findings above demonstrate us a probable axis for HCC diagnosis and treatment. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN POINT: Anillin facilitates the cell proliferation and enhances tumor growth in HCC.

As with other organs, intestinal immune responses and the development of immunity seems to be modulated by neural reflexes. Sympathetic immune modulation and reflexes are well described, and in the past decade the parasympathetic efferent vagus nerve has been added to this immune-regulation network. This system, designated 'the inflammatory reflex', comprises an afferent arm that senses inflammation and an efferent arm that inhibits innate immune responses. Intervention in this system as an innovative principle is currently being tested in pioneering trials of vagus nerve stimulation using implantable devices to treat IBD. Patients benefit from this treatment, but some of the working mechanisms remain to be established, for instance, treatment is effective despite the vagus nerve not always directly innervating the inflamed tissue. In this Review, we will focus on the direct neuronal regulatory mechanisms of immunity in the intestine, taking into account current advances regarding the innervation of the spleen and lymphoid organs, with a focus on the potential for treatment in IBD and other gastrointestinal pathologies.","Willemze, Rose A; Luyer, Misha D; Buurman, Wim A; de Jonge, Wouter J",Nature reviews.

157083,Developing your career in an age of team science.,2012,"BACKGROUND Patients undergoing colorectal cancer resections are at risk for delayed recovery. Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of surgery and to facilitate recovery. The authors previously demonstrated the limited impact of a prehabilitation program using exercise alone. They propose an expanded trimodal prehabilitation program that adds nutritional counseling, protein supplementation, and anxiety reduction to a moderate exercise program. This study aimed to estimate the impact of this trimodal program on the recovery of functional capacity compared with standard surgical care. METHODS Consecutive patients were enrolled in this pre- and postintervention study over a 23-month period. The postoperative recovery for 42 consecutive patients enrolled in the prehabilitation program was compared with that of 45 patients assessed before the intervention began. The primary outcome was functional walking capacity (6-min walk test [6MWT]). The secondary outcomes included self-reported physical activity (CHAMPS questionnaire) and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were analyzed using Chi-square and Student's t test. All p values lower than 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS The prehabilitation and control groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class. There was no difference in walking capacity at the first assessment (6MWT distance, 422 ± 87 vs 402 ± 57 m; p = 0.21). During the prehabilitation period lasting a median of 33 days (range, 21-46 days), functional walking capacity improved by 40 ± 40 m (p < 0.01). The postoperative complication rates and the hospital length of stay were similar. The patients in the prehabilitation program had better postoperative walking capacity at both 4 weeks (mean difference, 51.5 ± 93 m; p = 0.01) and 8 weeks (mean difference, 84.5 ± 83 m; p < 0.01). At 8 weeks, 81 % of the prehabilitated patients were recovered compared with 40 % of the control group (p < 0.01). The prehabilitation group also reported higher levels of physical activity before and after surgery. CONCLUSION In this pilot study, a 1-month trimodal prehabilitation program improved postoperative functional recovery.

157320,Rescue renal sympathetic denervation in a patient with ventricular electrical storm refractory to endo- and epicardial catheter ablation.,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Flow-diverter stents (FDSs) have been used effectively to treat large neck and complex saccular aneurysms on the anterior carotid circulation. Intra-aneurysmal flow reduction induces progressive aneurysm thrombosis in most patients. Understanding the degree of flow modification necessary to induce complete aneurysm occlusion among patients with considerable hemodynamics variability may be important for treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with incidental intracranial saccular aneurysms who underwent FDS endovascular procedures were included and studied for a 12 months' follow-up period. We used computational fluid dynamics on patient-specific geometries from 3D rotational angiography without and with virtual stent placement and thus compared intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic problems. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to estimate the stent:no-stent minimum hemodynamic ratio thresholds that significantly (p≤0.05) determined the condition necessary for long-term (12 months) aneurysm occlusion. RESULTS We included 12 consecutive patients with sidewall aneurysms located in the internal carotid or vertebral artery. The measured porosity of the 12 deployed virtual FDSs was 83±3% (mean±SD). Nine aneurysms were occluded during the 12 months' follow-up, whereas three were not. A significant (p=0.05) area under the curve (AUC) was found for spatiotemporal mean velocity reduction in the aneurysms: AUC=0.889±0.113 (mean±SD) corresponding to a minimum velocity reduction threshold of 0.353 for occlusion to occur. The 95% CI of the AUC was 0.66 to 1.00. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were ∼99% and ∼67%, respectively. For both wall shear stress and pressure reductions in aneurysms no thresholds could be determined: AUC=0.63±0.16 (p=0.518) and 0.67±0.165 (p=0.405), respectively. CONCLUSIONS For successful FDS treatment the post-stent average velocity in sidewall intracranial aneurysms must be reduced by at least one-third from the initial pre-stent conditions.","Ouared, Rafik; Larrabide, Ignacio; Brina, Olivier; Bouillot, Pierre; Erceg, Gorislav; Yilmaz, Hasan; Lovblad, Karl-Olof; Mendes Pereira, Vitor",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880724/,129

Despite these many similarities, closer analysis reveals important differences in the details of their connectivity and the behavioural impact of lesions in these two thalamic sites. These nuclei play qualitatively different roles that largely reflect the contrasting relative importance of their medial frontal cortex interactions (nucleus reuniens) compared with their retrosplenial, cingulate, and mammillary body interactions (anterior thalamic nuclei). While the anterior thalamic nuclei are critical for multiple aspects of hippocampal spatial encoding and performance, nucleus reuniens contributes, as required, to aid cognitive control and help select correct from competing memories.","Mathiasen, Mathias L; O'Mara, Shane M; Aggleton, John P",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069688/,129

158071,The role of 99m Tc-RBC scintigraphy in lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage.,2016,"INTRODUCTION Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health priority worldwide and the majority of people with diabetes live with multimorbidity (MM) (the co-occurrence of ≥2 chronic conditions). The aim of this systematic review was to explore the association between MM and all-cause mortality and glycaemic outcomes in people with T2D. METHODS The search strategy centred on: T2D, MM, comorbidity, mortality and glycaemia. Databases searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, The Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS. Restrictions included: English language, quantitative empirical studies. Two reviewers independently carried out: abstract and full text screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal. Disagreements adjudicated by a third reviewer. RESULTS Of the 4882 papers identified; 41 met inclusion criteria. The outcome was all-cause mortality in 16 studies, glycaemia in 24 studies and both outcomes in one study. There were 28 longitudinal cohort studies and 13 cross-sectional studies, with the number of participants ranging from 96-892,223. Included studies were conducted in high or upper-middle-income countries. Fifteen of 17 studies showed a statistically significant association between increasing MM and higher mortality. Ten of 14 studies showed no significant associations between MM and HbA1c. Four of 14 studies found higher levels of MM associated with higher HbA1c. Increasing MM was significantly associated with hypoglycaemia in 9/10 studies. There was no significant association between MM and fasting glucose (one study). No studies explored effects on glycaemic variability. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrates that MM in T2D is associated with higher mortality and hypoglycaemia, whilst evidence regarding the association with other measures of glycaemic control is mixed. The current single disease focused approach to management of T2D seems inappropriate. Our findings highlight the need for clinical guidelines to support a holistic approach to the complex care needs of those with T2D and MM, accounting for the various conditions that people with T2D may be living with.

158363,Cowper's gland hyperplasia: A potential pitfall at MRI of the prostate.,2021-08-08,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to investigate the physiological function and molecular mechanism of microRNA-181a (miRNA-181a) in the carcinogenesis of osteosarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS The relative expression of miRNA-181a in tissues and cultured cells was detected by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MiR-181a inhibitor and miR-181a mimics were used to manipulate its level in cells. Cell proliferation and invasion were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and transwell assay, respectively. The protein levels of the targeted genes were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay was employed to detect cell apoptosis. Moreover, a xenograft tumor bearing mice model was used to evaluate the effect of miR-181a in vivo. RESULTS We found that miRNA-181a was aberrantly elevated in osteosarcoma tissues and cells. Moreover, the overexpression of miRNA-181a could facilitate cell proliferation and migration. By contrast, miRNA-181a knockdown reverses these effects. Additionally, downregulation of miRNA-181a could activate NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-dependent pyroptosis, as evidenced by the increase of pyroptosis-related genes (NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin-18, and interleukin-1β) in miRNA-181a inhibitor transfected cells compared with the control. Further mechanistic studies identified that miRNA-181a knockdown suppresses cell proliferation and invasion by activating NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis. Silencing NLRP3 could effectively reverse the effects mediated by miRNA-181a inhibitor. Consistently, in vitro results also demonstrated that blockade of miRNA-181a notably suppresses tumor growth via activating pyroptosis. CONCLUSIONS These results provide that miRNA-181a might serve as potential therapeutic target for osteosarcoma patients.","Tian, B-G; Hua, Z; Wang, Z-J; Li, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202002_20153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096182/,129

Learning objectives included developing stronger therapeutic relationships, addressing the effects of structural racism in the lives of patients, and mitigating racism in the medical encounter. METHOD The anti-racism curriculum was delivered and evaluated in 2019 through focus groups and written input before and after each module. The process and outcome evaluation utilized a grounded theory approach. RESULTS Three emergent themes reflect how medical students experienced the anti-racism curriculum and inform recommendations for integrating an anti-racism curriculum into future medical education. The themes are: 1) the differential needs and experiences of persons of color and Whites; 2) the need to address issues of racism within medical education as well as in medical care; 3) the need for structures of accountability in medical education. CONCLUSIONS Medical educators must address racism in medical education before seeking to direct students to address it in medical practice.","Ona, Fernando F; Amutah-Onukagha, Ndidiamaka N; Asemamaw, Rina; Schlaff, Anthony L",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889941/,129
159729,Detection of atrial fibrillation with implantable loop recorders in horses.,2020-06-07,"OBJECTIVE Caregivers to patients with primary malignant brain tumours neglect their own physical and emotional needs during the disease trajectory. The aim of the systematic review was to explore how informal caregivers of patients with primary malignant brain tumour (high-grade glioma (HGG)) experience and manage their life situation after the death of the patient. METHODS A systematic literature search was carried out in December 2016 and revised in September 2017. The following six databases were searched: PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Scopus, PsycINFO and The Social Sciences Citation Index. Studies eligible for inclusion met the following criteria: (1) included bereaved caregivers to patients diagnosed with HGG ≥18 years, (2) described the caregiver's perspective at post bereavement (3) had been peer-reviewed. The papers included were assessed for methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. RESULTS Four qualitative articles, published from 2004 to 2015, met the eligibility criteria. Bereaved informal caregivers expressed profound grief and had unmet needs and questions related to the disease and their role as caregiver. Moreover, they experienced depressive symptoms and fatigue, resulting in a reduced work capability and social network. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that bereaved informal caregivers experience psychosocial consequences and emotional reactions after bereavement, resulting in feelings of isolation and loneliness. This review identified limited evidence on how the bereaved caregivers prefer to be supported, and further study is warranted. We suggest incorporating systematic information on bereavement in clinical practice and a cooperation across sectors.","Piil, Karin; Nordentoft, Sara; Larsen, Anders; Jarden, Mary",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2017-001386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29363550/,129

METHODS This study was conducted as a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of 44 consecutive cases of robot-assisted mesorectal excision for rectal adenocarcinoma performed between August 2005 and February 2010. Patient demographics, perioperative outcomes, and complications were evaluated and compared with similar published reports and relevant literature. RESULTS There were 28 (63.6%) men and 16 (36.4%) women, with a mean age of 63 years. The majority of patients were either overweight or obese and 88.7% of lesions were in the mid or low rectum. We performed 36 low anterior resections (6 intersphincteric) and 8 abdominoperineal resections with a median blood loss of 150 mL (range, 50-1000), a median operative time of 347 minutes (range, 155-510), and a median length of stay of 5 days (range, 3-36). The median lymph node yield was 14 (range, 5-45) and the circumferential resection margin was negative in all patients. We had 1 distal margin positivity (2.7%), 2 anastomotic leaks (5.6%), 1 death (2.7%), and 2 conversions (4.5%) to the open approach. No robot-associated morbidity occurred in this series. CONCLUSIONS This series compares favorably with similar published reports with regard to the safety and feasibility of robotic assistance in total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. The lower conversion rates reported for robotic rectal resection compared with laparoscopy require validation in large randomized trials.","deSouza, Ashwin L; Prasad, Leela M; Marecik, Slawomir J; Blumetti, Jennifer; Park, John J; Zimmern, Andrea; Abcarian, Herand",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181f22f1f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178854/,129

EE is a theory and evidence-based communication strategy that employs entertainment media for educational messaging. Here, we briefly review EE campaigns in response to previous health emergencies and present three cases of EE responses to the COVID-19 pandemic from leading global organizations (PCI Media, BBC Media Action, and Sesame Workshop). Responses ranged from adaptation and re-distribution of existing content to creating new content under social-distancing restrictions and utilizing transmedia. These cases demonstrate that EE initiatives responding to future pandemics may be well served by starting with existing infrastructure to quickly build capacity, support, and trust; working with partners to tailor programs to the local context; and continuing to focus on good storytelling while simultaneously considering evolving media formats and theory.","Riley, Amy Henderson; Sangalang, Angeline; Critchlow, Elizabeth; Brown, Neemesha; Mitra, Radharani; Campos Nesme, Brenda",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1847451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225758/,129

Although the subcellular localization site of BMV replication has been identified, that of the capsid protein (CP) has remained elusive. In this study, the application of immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to Nicotiana benthamiana leaves expressing replication-derived BMV CP as a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion, in conjunction with antibodies to the CP and double-stranded RNA, a presumed marker of RNA replication, revealed that the subcellular localization sites of replication and CP overlap. Our temporal analysis by transmission electron microscopy of ultrastructural modifications induced in BMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves revealed a reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) incorporating large assemblies of vesicles derived from ER accumulated in the cytoplasm during BMV infection. Additionally, for the first time, we have found by ectopic expression experiments that BMV CP itself has the intrinsic property of modifying ER to induce vesicles similar to those present in BMV infections. The significance of CP-induced vesicles in relation to CP-organized viral functions that are linked to replication-coupled packaging is discussed.","Bamunusinghe, Devinka; Seo, Jang-Kyun; Rao, A L N",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02020-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21209103/,129

METHODS The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) conducted literature searches for relevant articles published from 2012 to 2021. A task force of medical experts developed evidence-based guideline recommendations based on a review of clinical evidence, expertise, and informal consensus, according to established AACE protocol for guideline development. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes of interest included hemoglobin A1C, rates and severity of hypoglycemia, time in range, time above range, and time below range. RESULTS This guideline includes 37 evidence-based clinical practice recommendations for advanced diabetes technology and contains 357 citations that inform the evidence base. RECOMMENDATIONS Evidence-based recommendations were developed regarding the efficacy and safety of devices for the management of persons with diabetes mellitus, metrics used to aide with the assessment of advanced diabetes technology, and standards for the implementation of this technology. CONCLUSIONS Advanced diabetes technology can assist persons with diabetes to safely and effectively achieve glycemic targets, improve quality of life, add greater convenience, potentially reduce burden of care, and offer a personalized approach to self-management. Furthermore, diabetes technology can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical decision-making. Successful integration of these technologies into care requires knowledge about the functionality of devices in this rapidly changing field. This information will allow health care professionals to provide necessary education and training to persons accessing these treatments and have the required expertise to interpret data and make appropriate treatment adjustments.","Grunberger, George; Sherr, Jennifer; Allende, Myriam; Blevins, Thomas; Bode, Bruce; Handelsman, Yehuda; Hellman, Richard; Lajara, Rosemarie; Roberts, Victor Lawrence; Rodbard, David; Stec, Carla; Unger, Jeff",Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eprac.2021.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34116789/,129

We provide a novel evolutionary life history explanation whereby pathogenic and parasitic prevalence represents intrinsic rather than extrinsic mortality risk that drives slower life history strategies and the related disease control motivation in all animals but especially humans. Our theory was tested and supported based on publicly available data involving over 150 countries. Countries having a higher historical prevalence of infectious diseases are found to adopt slower life history strategies that are related to prompter COVID-19 containment actions by the government and greater compliance by the population. Findings could afford governments novel insight into the design of more effective COVID-19 strategies that are based on enhancing a sense of control, vigilance, and compliance in the general population.","Lu, Hui Jing; Liu, Yuan Yuan; O, Jiaqing; Guo, Shaolingyun; Zhu, Nan; Chen, Bin Bin; Lansford, Jennifer E; Chang, Lei",Evolutionary psychology : an international journal of evolutionary approaches to psychology and behavior,https://doi.org/10.1177/14747049211000714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752457/,129

While symptoms and physical signs of fluid overload are required to make a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, they lack both sensitivity and specificity, which might lead to diagnostic delay and uncertainty. Over the last decades, new ultrasound methods for the detection of elevated intracardiac pressures and/or fluid overload have been developed that are more sensitive and specific, thereby enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis and facilitating treatment strategies. Accordingly, we considered that a state-of-the-art review of ultrasound methods for the detection and quantification of congestion was timely, including imaging of the heart, lungs (B-lines), kidneys (intrarenal venous flow), and venous system (inferior vena cava and internal jugular vein diameter).

However, comparatively little is known about the interplay between RNAi and various viral infections in mammalian hosts. We show in the present study that the siRNA-mediated silencing of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2 [argonaute RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) catalytic component 2] transcripts in Huh7 cells resulted in elevated levels of HBV (hepatitis B virus)-specific RNAs and, conversely, we observed a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of same RNAi components in HepG2 cells infected with HBV. Similar reductions were also detectable in CHB (chronic hepatitis B) patients. Analysis of CHB liver biopsy samples, with high serum HBV DNA load (>log108 IU/ml), revealed a reduced mRNA and protein levels of Drosha, Dicer and Ago2. The low expression levels of key RNAi pathway components in CHB patient samples as well as hepatic cells established a link between HBV replication and RNAi components. The HBV proteins were also examined for RSS (RNA-silencing suppressor) properties. Using GFP-based reversion of silencing assays, in the present study we found that HBx is an RSS protein. Through a series of deletions and substitution mutants, we found that the full-length HBx protein is required for optimum RSS activity. The in vitro dicing assays revealed that the HBx protein inhibited the human Dicer-mediated processing of dsRNAs into siRNAs. Together, our results suggest that the HBx protein might function as RSS to manipulate host RNAi defence, in particular by abrogating the function of Dicer. The present study may have implications in the development of newer strategies to combat HBV infection.","Chinnappan, Mahendran; Singh, Avishek Kumar; Kakumani, Pavan Kumar; Kumar, Gautam; Rooge, Sheetalnath Babasaheb; Kumari, Anupama; Varshney, Aditi; Rastogi, Archana; Singh, Ashok Kumar; Sarin, Shiv Kumar; Malhotra, Pawan; Mukherjee, Sunil Kumar; Bhatnagar, Raj Kamal",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj20140316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902849/,129

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent robotic single-port transumbilical total hysterectomy between January 2010 and July 2010. All surgical procedures were performed through a single 3-4-cm umbilical incision, with a multi-channel system consisting of a wound retractor, a surgical glove, and two 10/12-mm and two 8 mm trocars. RESULTS Seven patients were treated with robotic single-port transumbilical total hysterectomy. Procedures included total hysterectomy due to benign gynecological disease (n=5), extra-fascial hysterectomy due to carcinoma in situ of the cervix (n=1), and radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer IB1 (n=1). The median total operative time was 109 minutes (range, 105 to 311 minutes), the median blood loss was 100 mL (range, 10 to 750 mL), and the median weight of the resected uteri was 200 g (range, 40 to 310 g). One benign case was converted to 3-port robotic surgery due to severe pelvic adhesions, and no post-operative complications occurred. CONCLUSION Robotic single-port transumbilical total hysterectomy is technically feasible in selected patients with gynecological disease. Robotics may enhance surgical skills during single-port transumbilical hysterectomy, especially in patients with gynecologic cancers.","Nam, Eun Ji; Kim, Sang Wun; Lee, Maria; Yim, Ga Won; Paek, Ji Heum; Lee, San Hui; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Jae Hoon; Kim, Jae Wook; Kim, Young Tae",Journal of gynecologic oncology,https://doi.org/10.3802/jgo.2011.22.2.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21860738/,129

Our study analyzes the association between low birth weight and negative health outcomes during adulthood in twin populations. METHODS Searches were conducted using databases inclusive of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and EBSCO. Observational studies on twins with low birth weight and adverse health outcomes during adulthood were included. Two reviewers independently screened the papers, and a third reviewer resolved the conflicts between the two reviewers. Following abstract and title screening, full-texts were screened to obtain eligibility. Eligible full-text articles were then assessed for quality using a modified Downs and Black checklist. Studies with a score within one standard deviation of the mean were included in the analysis. A fixed-effect model was used for analysis. RESULTS 3987 studies were screened describing low birth weight as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes during adulthood for all twelve-body systems (circulatory, digestive, endocrine, lymphatic, muscular, nervous, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal, urinary, and integumentary systems). One hundred fourteen articles made it through full-text screening, and 14 of those articles were assessed for quality. Five papers were selected to perform two meta-analyses for two outcomes: asthma and cerebral palsy. For asthma, the meta-analyses of three studies suggested a higher odds of low birth weight twins developing asthma (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.44, I2 = 77%). Meta-analysis for cerebral palsy included two studies and suggested a 4.88 times higher odds of low birth weight twins developing cerebral palsy compared to normal birth weight twins (OR 4.88, 95% CI 2.34-10.19, I2 = 79%). We could not find enough studies for other adverse health outcomes to pool data for a Forest plot. CONCLUSIONS The odds of low birth weight were found to be high in both asthma and cerebral palsy. There are not enough studies of similar nature (study types, similar body systems) to ensure a meaningful meta-analysis. We recommend that future research considers following up on twins to obtain data about adverse health outcomes during their adult lives.","Hassan, Sapha; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Inungu, Joseph; Craig, Jeffrey M",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01730-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167585/,129

For decades, the effects of cannabis on neurocognition were largely investigated by comparing chronic, heavy, cannabis users with those who do not use cannabis. Based on the premise that heavier cannabis users are associated with greater cognitive declines, the authors also divided the cannabis users based on severity of cannabis use.

165047,Covid-19 and breast cancer,2021,"Bright radar reflections observed beneath the south polar layered deposits (SPLD) by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding instrument were interpreted to represent liquid water, but the required amounts of salt and heat to form and maintain liquids in this location are implausible given what is known about Mars. Here, we present another hypothesis that accounts for the bright reflections: hydrated and cold clay-rich deposits at the base of the SPLD create the observed radar response. To support this hypothesis, we present experimental measurements and wave propagation modeling that show that smectites, cooled to 230 K, have real and imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity large enough to cause the bright reflections, even when mixed with other materials. Further, we find that absorptions attributable to these minerals are present in south polar orbital visible-near infrared reflectance spectra. Because these minerals are present at the south pole and can cause the reflections, we believe this to be a more viable scenario than the liquid water interpretation.","Smith, I. B.; Lalich, D.

This study collected second data from World Health Organisation (WHO)’s and World Bank’s database, applied Co-integration test and Causality test for a panel data set. The research provides crucial finding: there is causality between new cases of spreading coronavirus and time to close school too late. Moreover, Asian region, where the studied countries are being increases, new case of spreading coronavirus decrease. Furthermore, classification of income of the research countries is statistically insignificant to new case equivalent to absent association between the changes in the new case of spreading coronavirus and classification of income of the research countries. The spreading COVID – 19 can happen everywhere from high income, middle income to low-income countries. Another finding is that late closing school will enhance spreading COVID – 19 goes more than one thousand cases.","Nguyen-Phuong, L.; Dang, H. T. T.; Nguyen, N. P.

166768,"5 Sex, bugs & microwave attacks: how bad science, mating insects & psychogenic illness created an international incident with cuba",2021,"Background: This article explored the leadership responses that were used by two comprehensive universities in South Africa (Nelson Mandela University and University of Johannesburg) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in continuing with the rolling out of their teaching and learning programmes safely and digitally under disruptive conditions. Aim: Whilst universities in the developing world such as South Africa were expected to face challenges during the pandemic, this article showed that the leadership executives and general staff in two of its large universities, instead, crafted equitable and flexible improvisations to overcome the social challenges that could have posed a threat to their academic project. Setting: The selection of these two specific universities provided a unique opportunity to engage with comprehensive, massified and post-merger former Technikon-university institutions that mainly cater for working-class students. Methods: The social justice theory was utilised to frame the study, whilst critical narrative analysis was the methodology. Results: This research reveals that South African comprehensive universities possess capacity to adapt and innovate in the middle of an institutional crisis using their flexible systems and agile personnel to drive the academy under such circumstances. The study also reveals that the process of social justice is full of contradictions. As the universities created equitable measures to assist underprivileged students, these measures also generated injustices for others. Conclusion: This generated admirable and productive systematic traits to observe about some of our universities, as the South African higher education sector continued to engage with difficult conversations such as transformation.","Kele, Kamvalethu Mzileni Pedro",Transformation in Higher Education,https://doi.org/10.4102/the.v6i0.114,129

Nevertheless, psychologists’ attitudes towards the adoption of these tools and its impact in their professional practices need to be further explored.ObjectivesThe objective was to study the use of web-based tools on psychological practices before and during COVID-19 lockdown, trying to identify changes on psychologists’ professional practices related to the pandemic, as well as to explore factors that could have affected such changes.MethodsOne-hundred and eight psychologists filled-in an online survey, developed for the purposes of this study, during mandatory lockdown. The study was disseminated by mailing list, social networks, and by the Portuguese Psychologists Association.ResultsThe results have shown that psychologists kept providing their services during lockdown thanks to the adoption of web-based tools. Although psychologists have recognized that additional precautions were needed for at-distance practice in comparison to in-person interventions, the experience of using IC technologies in clinical practice was described as positive, ensuring clients’ adherence with positive results. Additionally, despite psychological services were maintained on a larger scale by psychologists with more years of experience, professionals with average experience stated more favorable attitudes towards the use of web-based tools in counseling and therapy.ConclusionsAlthough the implementation of ICT based practice was enforced by current circumstances, the experience that psychologists gathered and shared during the lockdown can guide future professional practice, improving and fostering the replication of best practices at distance.","Dores, A.

Our University General Hospital, Policlinico of “Tor Vergata” (PTV) in Rome, has become a Covid Hub in order to manage the spread of the epidemic. Thus, our Psychiatric Emergency Service (PES)’s access has been partially limited. Direct indicators of PES activity, as admission rates, can be useful for evaluating the psychological impact of Covid epidemic.ObjectivesTo assess psychiatric admittance rates to PES of PTV before and during Covid-19 global pandemic.MethodsData from our PES register have been obtained and analyzed. We compared all the psychiatric access during the trimester March – May 2019 and 2020. All patients have been characterized according to clinical features.ResultsA marked reduction of the number of patients presenting to PES has been observed (76 patients) in the 57-day period (March 11–May 04, 2020) of lockdown compared to the same period in 2019 (266 patients). The cutback was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for “Borderline Personality Disorder” diagnosis which have slightly increased. On the other hand, hospitalization rates in our psychiatric inpatients unit remained steady.ConclusionsAlthough larger study are needed to understand the mental consequences of the lockdown experience, people’s fear of potential infection might explain our results. Interestingly, personality disorder patients represent an exception to it, suggesting the importance of the clinical characteristics of fearless, engagement in dangerous behavior and detachment from reality. These findings might be helpful to improve psychosocial crisis interventions during the pandemic.","Fiori Nastro, F.; Mariano, A.; Santini, R.; Di Michele, F.; Bianchi, F.; Niolu, C.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.767,129

171692,The anxiety levels of children with cystic fibrosis and healthy children during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare hematologic malignancy caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) with dismal cure rates and poor response to conventional chemotherapy. Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (AlloSCT) is the only therapeutic option which may offer the chance of long-term remission and cures in a subset of patients. We sought to investigate the outcomes of transplantation in one of the largest cohorts in North America. Methods: A retrospective chart review study was conducted using the North-American ATLL and the Hematopoietic Precursor Cell transplantation databases at Montefiore Medical Center from 2011 to 2020. Variables collected include age, sex, ethnicity, ATLL subtype, molecular profile, previous treatments, conditioning regimens, type of transplant, immunosuppressive regimen, progression free survival (PFS) post-transplant and overall survival (OS) post-transplant. Results: Fourteen patients with ATLL who received an AlloSCT from 2011-2020 were identified. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of patients were male. Seventy-one percent (10/14) of patients were African American and twenty-nine percent (4/14) were Hispanic. Median age was 51 years. Sixty-four percent (9/14) of patients had Stage IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Forty-three percent (6/14) patients had acute and fifty-seven percent (8/14) had lymphomatous ATLL. Almost all patients (92%) were treated initially with EPOCH combination chemotherapy. Twenty-eight percent (4/14) of patients received interferon/zidovudine as bridge-to-transplant. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of patients achieved complete remission (CR) prior to AlloSCT, 7% (1/14) were in partial remission, and 28% (4/14) were relapsed or refractory. Forty-three percent (6/14) of patients received SCT from a matched-related donor (MRD), 36% (5/14) from a haplo-identical donor and 21% (3/14) from a matched-unrelated donor (MUD). Ninety-three percent (13/14) of patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen pre-transplantation. Seven percent (1/14) received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. RIC regimens consisted of fludarabine with melphalan +/- anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or fludarabine with cyclophosphamide with total-body irradiation in doses less than 500 cGy. Patients receiving haplo-identical SCT also received post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for prevention of graft vs host disease (GVHD). The MAC regimen used included busulfan with cyclophosphamide at myeloablative doses. Twenty-eight percent (4/14) of patients relapsed post-alloSCT with a median relapse-free survival of 6 months (range 4-18 months). The median OS of the whole cohort was 27 months (8-82 months). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) developed in 28% (4/14) percent of patients. The most common manifestation was skin GVHD. Fifty-percent (7/14) of the patients are surviving to-date. Transplant-related mortality (TRM) at day 100 was 21% (3/14) of patients. Causes of death were complex and included several diagnoses in certain patients. The most frequent diagnoses associated with death were infection (28%), graft failure (14%), GVHD (14%), veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) (7%), disease progression (14%) and unknown due to patient lost to follow-up (14%). The main infectious events included fungal (2), bacterial (1), and COVID-19 (1) infection. Forty-three percent (6/14) of patients remain in complete remission to date. Conclusions: Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation offers long-term survival with a TRM of 21% in a disease with an inherently dismal prognosis. AlloSCT using several graft sources, is thus, a safe and well tolerated treatment modality and offers long term remissions.

Observing functional differences of independent MSC-EV preparations in vitro, we established an optimized murine GvHD model for the analysis of independent MSC-EV preparations in vivo. To this end, T cell depleted allogeneic BM cells co-transplanted with naïve allogeneic spleen-derived T cells induced GvHD symptoms with reproducible strengths in mice being preconditioned by ionizing irradiation. Administration of MSC-EV preparations with confirmed in vitro immune modulatory properties at three consecutive days significantly suppressed GvHD symptoms. In contrast, application of MSC-EV preparations lacking these in vitro immune modulating capabilities failed to suppress GvHD symptoms. Thus, our results reveal therapeutic differences among independent MSC-EV preparations that had been produced in a standardized manner. Thus, given this functional heterogeneity, any individual MSC-EV preparation considered for the clinical application should be evaluated for its potency prior to administration to patients.","Madel, Rabea J.; Börger, Verena; Dittrich, Robin; Bremer, Michel; Tertel, Tobias; Phuong, Nhi Ngo Thi; Baba, Hideo A.; Kordelas, Lambros; Buer, Jan; Horn, Peter A.; Westendorf, Astrid M.; Brandau, Sven; Kirschning, Carsten J.; Giebel, Bernd",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423658,129

172872,An Evaluation of the 2035 WHO End TB Targets in 40 High Burden Countries,2020-10-02,"Jute is an important natural fiber crop cultivated in about 4 million hectares in India. Jute has the major export potential contributing to Rs.1, 000 to 1,200 crores annually. During the on-going pandemic COVID-19, the procurement is still lesser than the usual amount. As a result of the increase in demand for jute bags, there was an increase in the price of jute bags. But, the effect of COVID-19 on the prices of raw jute in the markets was not explored as most of the concerns are directed towards the jute industry and workers. Therefore, the study was carried out to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the market price of jute. The secondary data of market price and market arrival of jute before COVID-19 pandemic and during COVID-19 pandemic were collected from the official website of the Directorate of Marketing & Inspection (DMI), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India for Champadanga (Hooghly), Jiaganj (Murshidabad), Katwa (Burdwan) markets in West Bengal and the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Despite the price decrease during the pandemic, there was no significant difference in the price of jute before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were many variations in the market price of jute during the COVID-19 pandemic since the lockdown was enforced in five stages with strict restrictions in transport and other activities in the initial stages followed by relaxation in transport and other activities subsequently. There was a significant difference in the market arrivals of jute before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The arrival of jute in the market increased during COVID-19 compared to before COVID-19 because of the demand created for jute bags during lockdown due to closure of jute mills. There was a significant relationship between market price and market arrival during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the quantity of jute arrival increases the price of jute decreases in the market. Farmers did not bear the brunt of COVID-19 as much as the workers in the jute mills, it is, perhaps, because of the schedule of sowing and harvesting. As of now, the MSP for jute is less than the market price. Therefore, it is recommended that the MSP for jute should be increased to safeguard the interests of the jute farmers.","Logesh, M.; Mansingh, J.

It induces the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases, such as airway hyperresponsiveness, glycoprotein hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia. IL-13 also inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, which leads to carcinogenesis. In recent studies, elevated IL-13 serum levels have been shown in severe COVID-19 patients. Thus it is important to predict IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein for designing safe protein therapeutics particularly immunotherapeutic. This paper describes a method developed for predicting, designing and scanning IL-13 inducing peptides. The dataset used in this study contain experimentally validated 313 IL-13 inducing peptides and 2908 non-inducing homo-sapiens peptides extracted from the immune epitope database (IEDB). We have extracted 95 key features using SVC-L1 technique from the originally generated 9165 features using Pfeature. Further, these key features were ranked based on their prediction ability, and top 10 features were used for building machine learning prediction models. In this study, we have deployed various machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting IL-13 inducing peptides. These models were trained, test and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation techniques; best model were evaluated on independent dataset. Our best model based on XGBoost achieves a maximum AUC of 0.83 and 0.80 on the training and independent dataset, respectively. Our analysis indicate that certain SARS-COV2 variants are more prone to induce IL-13 in COVID-19 patients.

Ultrastructural changes were found in those cells, such as the loss of microvilli and primary cilium, the increase of multivesicular bodies and autophagosomes, and signs of cell death. No ciliated cells were found in those samples. Squamous cells from low viral load sample after 5 days of symptoms showed few microvilli and no primary cilium. VLPs and RO-like structures were found in the ciliated cells only. No ultrastructural alterations were seen in the cells from low viral load individuals after 10- and 14-days of symptoms. Our results shed light on the ultrastructural effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the human nasopharyngeal cells.","Saraiva, Karina Lidianne Alcântara; Vasconcelos, Luydson Richardson Silva; Bezerra, Matheus Filgueira; Arcoverde, Rodrigo Moraes Loyo; Brandão-Filho, Sinval Pinto; Ayres, Constância Flávia Junqueira; de Figueiredo, Regina Célia Bressan Queiroz; Pereira-Neves, Antonio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.451607,129

175384,A precision dosing application for patients treated with docetaxel and G-CSF,2021,"5-Methylcytosine (m5C) is a widespread post-transcriptional RNA modification and is reported to be involved in manifold cellular responses and biological processes through regulating RNA metabolism. However, its regulatory role in antiviral innate immunity has not yet been elucidated. Here, we report that NSUN2, a typical m5C methyltransferase, can negatively regulate type I interferon responses during viral infection. NSUN2 specifically mediates m5C methylation of IRF3 mRNA and accelerates its degradation, resulting in low levels of IRF3 and downstream IFN-β production. Knockout or knockdown of NSUN2 could enhance type I interferon responses and downstream ISG expression after viral infection in vitro. And in vivo, the antiviral innate responses is more dramatically enhanced in Nsun2+/− mice than in Nsun2+/+ mice. Four highly m5C methylated cytosines in IRF3 mRNA were identified, and their mutation could enhance the cellular IRF3 mRNA levels. Moreover, infection with Sendai virus (SeV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), Zika virus (ZIKV), or especially SARS-CoV-2 resulted in a reduction in endogenous levels of NSUN2. Together, our findings reveal that NSUN2 serves as a negative regulator of interferon response by accelerating the fast turnover of IRF3 mRNA, while endogenous NSUN2 levels decrease after viral infection to boost antiviral responses for the effective elimination of viruses. Our results suggest a paradigm of innate antiviral immune responses ingeniously involving NSUN2-mediated m5C modification.","Wang, Hongyun; Zhang, Lu; Zeng, Cong; Feng, Jiangpeng; Wang, Dehe; He, Miao; Jiang, Ao; Cao, Yuanyuan; Guo, Xiao; Liu, Jiejie; Yan, Kun; Tang, Hao; Xu, Ke; Fan, Chengpeng; Guo, Deyin; Lan, Ke; Zhou, Yu; Chen, Yu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.09.451748,129

The prevalence of such syndromes among community samples of children and adolescents remains less well characterized. Method: We identified all individuals age 5-18 across 2 New England health systems who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test between 3/12/2020 and 4/18/2021 and at least 90 days of follow-up visits documented in electronic health records. We identified neuropsychiatric symptoms in intervals prior to, and following, this testing using a previously-derived set of ICD-10 codes and natural language processing terms. Primary analysis examined sociodemographic features associated with presence of at least one incident (i.e., new-onset) neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days after an initial positive test for COVID-19. Results: Among 5058 children (50% female, 2.9% Asian, 6.3% Black, and 63% White; 30% Hispanic; mean age was 12.4 (IQR 8.9-15.6), 366 (7.2%) exhibited at least one new-onset neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days following initial SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. The most common incident symptoms at 90-150 days were headache (2.4%), mood and anxiety symptoms (2.4%), cognitive symptoms (2.3%), and fatigue (1.1%). In regression models, older children, girls, those with Hispanic ethnicity, those with public versus private insurance, and those with greater overall burden of medical comorbidity were more likely to exhibit subsequent symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms between 3- and 5- months following SARS-CoV-2 test positivity is similar to that observed in the period prior to infection.

This work is going to analyze the influences that the COVID-19 Pandemic Era has upon college students' physical conditions and their cognition on PE study, so as to not only find out a way to optimize students' cognition on PE study and help to strengthen their physical quality, but also provide a reference for the emphasis of physical education under the circumstance of regular epidemic prevention measures in the Post-COVID-19 Era. Through this research, we find out that the health awareness of college students during the Post-COVID-19 Era (from Apr. 2020 - , when domestic pandemic was under control) has been improved significantly, but still, few of them take regular exercise, while their sports needs are diversified. It is also discovered that the physical quality of college students shows a downward trend, especially for men. Therefore, the following suggestions are made especially for college physical education in the Post-COVID-19 Era: firstly, lead college students to set up positive sports values;secondly, help them to lose weight and control BMI level reasonably;and then, in terms of physical fitness, we should enhance the training of men's strength and speed quality, as well as women's endurance quality, apart from that, improve college students' specific physical weakness in time, so as to achieve the goal of 'educating students with all-around physical education'. © 2021 IEEE.","Zhang, Y.; Xu, W.

The only viable treatment options for metastatic disease are systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Nonetheless, chemoresistance remains a major cause of chemotherapy failure. New immunotherapeutic modalities such as anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade have shown promise; however, response to such strategies is highly variable across patients. Here, we show that our novel poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) based nanomicellar formulation of Resiquimod, an imidazoquinoline TLR 7/8 agonist, had a superior tumor inhibitory effect in a metastatic model of lung adenocarcinoma, relative to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy as well as platinum-based chemotherapy, which is the mainstay of treatment for NSCLC. Investigation of the in vivo immune status following Resiquimod PM (POx micellar formulation of Resiquimod) treatment showed that Resiquimod-based stimulation of antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment resulted in the mobilization of anti-tumor CD8+ immune response.

To gain an understanding of the network function it is imperative to identify and understand the network structure with respect to the underlying anatomical connectivity and the topographic organization. Here we show that the previously described resting-state network for the somatosensory area 3b comprises of distinct networks that are characteristic for different topographic representations. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis in macaque monkeys and humans using BOLD-fMRI signals from the face, the hand and rest of the medial somatosensory representations of area 3b revealed different correlation patterns. Both monkeys and humans have many similarities in the connectivity networks, although the networks are more complex in humans with many more nodes. In both the species face area network has the highest ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity, which included areas 3b and 4, and ventral premotor area. The area 3b hand network included ipsilateral hand representation in area 4. The emergent functional network structures largely reflect the known anatomical connectivity. Our results show that different body part representations in area 3b have independent functional networks perhaps reflecting differences in the behavioral use of different body parts. The results also show that large cortical areas if considered together, do not give a complete and accurate picture of the network architecture. Highlights Somatosensory resting-state functional network is not uniform across the entire area 3b. Different body part representations have different connectivity networks. These functional connectivity networks have many similarities in the two primate species, i.e. macaque monkeys and humans, although the human network is more complex. In both the species network of the face representation is most extensive, which includes ipsilateral face motor cortex and PMv in both hemispheres. The hand representation in area 3b has connectivity with ipsilateral hand motor cortex. Bilateral connectivity with homologous and nonhomologous area 3b representations was observed only in humans.

Immunocompromised individuals are highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Whether vaccine-induced immunity in these individuals involves the oral cavity, a primary site of infection, is presently unknown. Methods. Immunocompromised individuals (n=404) and healthy controls (n=82) participated in a prospective clinical trial encompassing two doses of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Immunocompromised individuals included primary immunodeficiencies (PID) and secondary immunodeficiencies caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)/chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T), solid organ transplantation (SOT), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Saliva and serum samples were collected at four time points from the first vaccine dose until 2 weeks after second dose. SARS-CoV-2 spike specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses were quantified by a multiplex bead-based assay in saliva and correlated to paired serum IgG titers determined by Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Results. IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike full-length trimeric glycoprotein (Spike-f) and S1 subunit in saliva in the HIV and HSCT/CAR-T groups were comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, PID, SOT, and CLL patients all displayed weaker responses which were mainly influenced by disease parameters or immunosuppressants. Salivary IgG levels strongly correlated with serum IgG titers on days 21 and 35 (rho=0.8079 and 0.7768, p=<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the predictive power of salivary IgG yielded AUC=0.95, PPV=90.7% for the entire cohort on D35. Conclusions. Saliva conveys humoral responses induced by BNT162b2 vaccination. The predictive power makes it highly suitable for screening low responding/vulnerable groups for revaccination.","Healy, K.; Pin, E.; Chen, P.; Soderdahl, G.; Nowak, P.; Mielke, S.; Hansson, L.; Bergman, P.; Smith, E.; Ljungman, P.; Valentini, D.; Blennow, O.; Osterborg, A.; Gabarrini, G.; Almanei, K.; Alkharaan, H.; Sobkowiak, M.; Xu, X.; Akbar, M.; Lore, K.; Hellstrom, C.; Muschiol, S.; Bogdanovic, G.; Buggert, M.; Ljunggren, H.-G.; Hober, S.; Nilsson, P.; Sallberg Chen, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.30.21264377v1?rss=1,129

The challenges involve its actual and perceived role within the medical system, in particular how psychiatric hospitals can maintain their core mission of attending to the mentally ill while at the same time providing relief to general medicine. Although psychiatric disorders are the top leading causes of global burden of disease, we can witness mental health care being de-emphasized in the wake of the massive onslaught of the pandemic: psychiatric wards are being downsized, clinics closed, psychiatric support systems discontinued etc. in order to make room for emergency care.

The curriculum tends to focus on computer literacy skills and is generally unable to use information and communication technologies to support specific subjects. Finally, teachers lack the preparation and, as a consequence, the confidence to use technology in innovative ways. The study-from-home necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic would have been an ideal opportunity to maximize the impact of computer-based interventions such as AISs as these technologies have been shown to compensate for weak teacher-led instruction.

This note evaluates various scenarios, based on an estimation of number of identified and unidentified infected cases, and examines the effectiveness of different policy responses to contain this pandemic. Our result, based on an estimation of the model for Iran, show that in many instances the number of unidentified cases, including asymptomatic individuals, could be much bigger than the reported numbers. The results confirm that in such circumstances, social distancing alone cannot be an effective policy unless a large portion of the population confine themselves for an extended period of time, which is not only difficult to implement, but it could also prove extremely costly and damaging to the economy. An alternative policy, this note argues, is to couple effective social distancing with extensive testing, even to those who are asymptomatic, and isolate the identified cases actively. Otherwise, many lives will be lost, and the health system will collapse, adding to the ongoing economic troubles that many countries have started to encounter.","Einian, Majid; Tabarraei, Hamid Reza",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045849,129

The following MeSH terms were used: Covid-19;suicide;SARS-Cov2;pandemic.ResultsMultiple factors can account for an increase in suicide rates such as isolation with a sense of decreased belongingness and increased burdensomeness. A synergy with known suicide precipitants can also occur such as domestic violence, intra-familiar conflicts, alcohol consumption and access to means. Media communication can represent a danger with constant reports about the crisis. And lastly the loss of employment and financial stressors can produce an important impact.ConclusionsIn conclusion, Covid-19 will produce an important impact in many spheres of society, one of which will be mental health.

Marginal effects derived from a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model suggest that a 1% increase in incidence of COVID-19 cases significantly diminished Indonesia?s equity market returns by 4.7%, depreciated the Indian rupee against the US dollar by 4.8%, but improved equity prospects in South Korea by 4.1%. For the other financial markets, the effect of COVID-19 was found to be insignificant. Further, the impulse response analyses imply that the influence of COVID-19 on foreign exchange and equity markets is only transitory in nature. Additional SVAR analysis for India and Indonesia over recent months (2 May 2020 to 22 January 2021) showed that their financial markets remained (or became) resistant to the escalating incidence of COVID-19 inflections and deaths.JEL Code: G15","Narayan, Seema Purnaningrum Evita Khawari Baqir",The Indian Economic Journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/00194662211036097,129

We explored whether mobile consulting is a viable option for communities with minimal resources in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We reviewed evidence published since 2018 about mobile consulting in low- and middle-income countries and undertook a scoping study (pre-coronavirus disease) in two rural settings (Pakistan and Tanzania) and five urban slums (Kenya, Nigeria and Bangladesh), using policy/document review, secondary analysis of survey data (from the urban sites) and thematic analysis of interviews/workshops with community members, healthcare workers, digital/telecommunications experts, mobile consulting providers, and local and national decision-makers. Project advisory groups guided the study in each country. Results: We reviewed four empirical studies and seven reviews, analysed data from 5322 urban slum households and engaged with 424 stakeholders in rural and urban sites. Regulatory frameworks are available in each country. Mobile consulting services are operating through provider platforms (n = 5–17) and, at the community level, some direct experience of mobile consulting with healthcare workers using their own phones was reported – for emergencies, advice and care follow-up. Stakeholder willingness was high, provided challenges are addressed in technology, infrastructure, data security, confidentiality, acceptability and health system integration. Mobile consulting can reduce affordability barriers and facilitate care-seeking practices. Conclusions: There are indications of readiness for mobile consulting in communities with minimal resources. However, wider system strengthening is needed to bolster referrals, specialist services, laboratories and supply chains to fully realise the continuity of care and responsiveness that mobile consulting services offer, particularly during/beyond coronavirus disease 2019. © The Author(s) 2021.","Harris, B.; Ajisola, M.; Alam, R.

As a result, the Taiwanese government has promulgated a number of regulatory measures and promotion plans (or programs) on bioethanol use, novel fermentation research projects and domestic production since the mid-2000s. The main aim of this paper was to present a trend analysis of the motor gasoline supply/consumption and bioethanol supply, and the regulatory system relevant to bioethanol production and gasohol use since 2007 based on the official database and the statistics. The motor gasoline supply has shown a decreasing trend in the last five years (2016–2020), especially in 2020, corresponding to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. Although the government provided a subsidy of NT$ 1.0–2.0 dollars per liter for refueling E3 gasohol based on the price of 95-unleaded gasoline, the bioethanol supply has shown decreasing demand since 2012. In addition, the plans for domestic bioethanol production from lignocellulosic residues or energy crops were ceased in 2011 due to non-profitability. To examine the obstacles to bioethanol promotion in Taiwan, the bottlenecks to bioethanol production and gasohol use were addressed from the perspectives of the producer (domestic enterprise), the seller (gas station) and the consumer (end user). © 2021 by the authors.

183874,[Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis].,2021,"IgG specific for members of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1) family, which mediates receptor- and tissue-specific sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IEs), is a central component of naturally acquired malaria immunity. PfEMP1-specific IgG is thought to protect via inhibition of IE sequestration, and through IgG-Fc Receptor (FcγR) mediated phagocytosis and killing of antibody-opsonized IEs. The affinity of afucosylated IgG to FcγRIIIa is elevated up to 40-fold compared to fucosylated IgG, resulting in enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Most IgG in plasma is fully fucosylated, but afucosylated IgG is elicited in response to enveloped viruses and to paternal alloantigens during pregnancy. Here we show that naturally acquired PfEMP1-specific IgG is likewise markedly afucosylated in a stable and exposure-dependent manner, and efficiently induces FcγRIIIa-dependent natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. In contrast, immunization with a soluble subunit vaccine based on VAR2CSA-type PfEMP1 resulted in fully fucosylated specific IgG. These results have implications for understanding natural and vaccine-induced antibody-mediated protective immunity to malaria. Summary Afucosylated IgG has enhanced Fc-receptor affinity and functionality, and is formed specifically against membrane proteins of enveloped viruses. We show that this also applies to Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane-specific IgG induced by natural infection, but not by soluble PfEMP1 vaccination.","Larsen, Mads Delbo; Lopez-Perez, Mary; Dickson, Emmanuel Kakra; Ampomah, Paulina; Ndam, Nicaise Tuikue; Nouta, Jan; Koeleman, Carolien A M; Ederveen, Agnes L Hipgrave; Mordmüller, Benjamin; Salanti, Ali; Nielsen, Morten Agertoug; Massougbodji, Achille; van der Schoot, C.

184811,Proteolytic enzymes in clinical medicine.,1965,"Fungi contribute to upwards of 1.5 million human deaths annually, are involved in the spoilage of up to a third of food crops, and have a devastating effect on plant and animal biodiversity. Moreover, this already significant issue is exacerbated by a rise in antifungal resistance and a critical requirement for novel drug targets. Quadruplexes are four-stranded secondary structures in nucleic acids which can regulate processes such as transcription, translation, replication, and recombination. They are also found in genes linked to virulence in microbes, and quadruplex-binding ligands have been demonstrated to eliminate drug resistant pathogens. Using a computational approach, we identified putative quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in 1362 genomes across the fungal kingdom and explored their potential involvement in virulence, drug resistance, and pathogenicity. Here we present the largest analysis of PQS in fungi and identified significant heterogeneity of these sequences throughout phyla, genera, and species. Moreover, PQS were genetically conserved. Notably, loss of PQS in cryptococci and aspergilli was associated with pathogenicity. PQS in the clinically important pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans were located within genes (particularly coding regions), mRNA, repeat regions, mobile elements, tRNA, ncRNA, rRNA, and the centromere. Genes containing PQS in these organisms were found to be primarily associated with metabolism, nucleic acid binding, transporter activity, and protein modification. Finally, PQS were found in over 100 genes associated with virulence, drug resistance, or key biological processes in these pathogenic fungi and were found in genes which were highly upregulated during germination, hypoxia, oxidative stress, iron limitation, and in biofilms. Taken together, quadruplexes in fungi could present interesting novel targets to ameliorate fungal virulence and overcome drug resistance.","Warner, Emily F.; Bohálová, Natália; Brázda, Václav; Waller, Zoë A.

Scientific evidence to the effectiveness of the three main non-pharmacological tools to mitigate a pandemic is given. A control system to control the Covid-19 outbreak caused by the Sars-CoV2 virus, called Coronavirus, is proposed, for preventing collapse of the health systems and saturation of Intensive Therapy Units (ITUs) capacity. The proposed system is based on the three existing non-pharmacological tools for the mitigation of epidemics and pandemics: social distancing, confinement and testing with isolation of a population in which there is community circulation of the virus. Both in the analysis and in the design of the control system, the mathematical model SEIRD (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered - Deceased) is used, which describes the dynamics of a pandemic, adjusted in this work to the behavior in space and time of the Sars-CoV2. In this work the incidence and impact of testing with isolation (or testing-quarantining) is incorporated in the model. The proposed control system uses, as a feedback signal, the demanded quantity of critical beds and ITUs, which is compared with the available beds capacity to generate the error signal as input to a PID controller. As control actions, five Phases of Social Distancing and Confinement (SD&C) are proposed, which must be applied by the public authority. The control system thus generates a SD&C decision sequence or policy, which can be applied once a week or every fortnight. Simulation results showing the practical feasibility and good performance of the proposed control system are given, preventing collapse of Healthcare Capacity based on Social Distancing, Confinement and Testing-quarantining as control actions. ©2020 IEEE","Patiño, H.

It has a particularly severe effect on the mental health of individuals and highlights pre-existing challenges in mental health provision in different countries. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mental health response to COVID-19 in the occupied Palestinian territories (oPt) in relation to mental health concerns and the political situation. Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzes the double struggle of Palestinians not only dealing with COVID-19 but with the ongoing Israeli occupation and human rights violations and focuses on the challenges in providing mental health services due to existing inequalities, systemic discrimination and lack of resources as a result of the political system of oppression. The findings are based on previously published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak in other countries, as well as the authors' clinical experience in the oPt and direct involvement in providing mental health services. Findings - The paper highlights how the current pandemic is being used to further attempts of annexation and political gains in Israel and how it exacerbated human rights violations due to the occupation. Emphasis is also put on the challenges in providing a Palestinian mental health response due to the high number of actors involved and the lack of preparedness at the level of mental health response provision. Originality/value - The value of the works lies in putting the current pandemic in relation to human rights violations in the oPt due to the ongoing Israeli occupation and in highlighting how a mental health response to COVID-19 can be implemented during a state of emergency and despite a lack of preparedness in response services in the oPt.","Helbich, M.; Jabr, S.",International Journal of Human Rights in Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijhrh-06-2020-0039,129

In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection (n=127). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted on all COVID-19-suspected cases, admitted to Masih Daneshvari Hospital (a designated hospital for COVID-19), Tehran, Iran, since February 19, 2020. All patients were tested for COVID-19, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Data of confirmed cases, including demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes, were collected and compared between three groups of patients, requiring different types of admission (requiring ICU admission, admission to the general ward, and transfer to ICU). RESULTS: Of 412 suspected cases, with the mean age of 54.1 years (SD=13.4), 127 (31%) were positive for COVID-19. Following the patients’ first visit to the clinic, 115 cases were admitted to the general ward, while ten patients required ICU admission. Due to clinical deterioration in the condition of 25 patients (out of 115 patients), ICU admission was essential. Based on the results, the baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Patients requiring ICU admission were more likely to have multiorgan involvement (liver involvement, P<0.001; renal involvement, P<0.001; and cardiac involvement, P=0.02), low O(2) saturation (P<0.001), and lymphopenia (P=0.05). During hospital admission, 21 (16.5%) patients died, while the rest (83.5%) were discharged and followed-up until March 26, 2020. Also, the survival rate of patients, who received immunoglobulin, was higher than other patients (60.87% vs. 39.13%). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was considerable in our study. Based on the present results, this infection can cause multiorgan damage. Therefore, intensive monitoring of these patients needs to be considered.","Baghaei, Parvaneh; Nadji, Seyed Alireza; Marjani, Majid; Moniri, Afshin; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammadreza; Sheikhzade, Hakimeh; Abtahian, Zahra; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Abedini, Atefeh; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Mansourafshar, Babak; Ahmadi, Zargham Hossein; Mokhber Dezfuli, Mojtaba; Seifi, Sharareh; Sadeghi, Mohsen; Mirenayat, Maryam Sadat; Yassari, Fatemeh; Lookzadeh, Somayeh; Farzanegan, Behrooz; Kiani, Arda; Vasheghani, Maryam; Dastan, Farzaneh; Eslaminejad, Alireza; Malekmohammad, Majid; Varahram, Mohammad; Zali, Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Velayati, Ali Akbar",Tanaffos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680520/,129

This study examined the knowledge, self-reported behaviours, and barriers to compliance with infection control practices and the use of PPE in Canadian pediatric EDs. METHODS A self-administered survey instrument consisting of 21 questions was developed and piloted for this study. The survey was mailed to all individuals listed in the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada database of physicians practicing pediatric emergency medicine in Canada. RESULTS A total of 186 physicians were surveyed, and 123 (66%) participated. Twenty-two percent of participants reported that they had never received PPE training and 32% had not been trained in the previous 2 years. Fifty-three percent reported being very or somewhat comfortable with their knowledge of transmission-based isolation practices. Participants were correct on a mean of 4.9 of 11 knowledge-based questions (SD 1.7). For scenarios assessing self-reported use of PPE, participants selected answers that reflected PPE use in accordance with national infection control standards in a mean of 1.0 of 6 scenarios (SD 1.0). Participants reported that they would be more likely to use PPE if patients were clearly identified prior to physician assessment, equipment was accessible, and PPE use was made a priority in their ED. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge and self-reported adherence to recommended infection control practices among Canadian pediatric emergency physicians is suboptimal. Early identification of patients requiring PPE, convenient access to PPE, and improved education regarding isolation and PPE practices may improve adherence.","Reid, Sarah M; Farion, Ken J; Suh, Kathryn N; Audcent, Tobey; Barrowman, Nicholas J; Plint, Amy C",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21435312/,129

IL-17A seems to have different roles in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic cancer (PC). IL-17A participates in the progression of acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and PanIN, but not related to the characteristics of PC stem cells and the overall survival of patients.

In the present study, we undertook a comprehensive and comparative analysis of the requirements for viral protein synthesis in the activation of JNK and p38. Infection with the UL36 mutant tsB7 or with UV-irradiated virus indicated that both JNK and p38 activation required viral gene expression. Cycloheximide reversal or phosphonoacetic acid treatment of wild-type virus-infected cells as well as infection with the ICP4 mutant vi13 indicated that only the immediate-early class of viral proteins were required for SAPK activation. Infection with ICP4, ICP27, or ICP0 mutant viruses indicated that only ICP27 was necessary. Additionally, we determined that in the context of virus infection ICP27 was sufficient for SAPK activation and activation of the p38 targets Mnk1 and MK2 by infecting with mutants deleted for various combinations of immediate-early proteins. Specifically, the d100 (0-/4-) and d103 (4-/22-/47-) mutants activated p38 and JNK, while the d106 (4-/22-/27-/47-) and d107 (4-/27-) mutants did not. Finally, infections with a series of ICP27 mutants demonstrated that the functional domain of ICP27 required for activation was located in the region encompassing amino acids 20 to 65 near the N terminus of the protein and that the C-terminal transactivation activity of ICP27 was not necessary.","Hargett, Danna; McLean, Tim; Bachenheimer, Steven L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15956580/,129

For this, amplification of a fragment of the PI adhesin gene in samples prepared by two methods was compared in two laboratories, and in one laboratory, a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified. The sensitivity of culture versus PCR was 61.5%. Provided a specific internal control is used, sample preparation by freeze-boiling combined with PCR for the PI gene and amplicon detection by visual inspection of the electrophoresis gel can be recommended, although maximal results are obtained after hybridization. M. pneumoniae was present in 0.5% of patients <2 years old and 6.9% of patients >2.

METHODS The serum samples of 86 patients with SARS confirmed clinically and serologically, 31 males and 55 females, aged 9 approximately 86, with the course of disease of 1 approximately 81 days, and 745 healthy persons were collected during the course. The specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) against N protein, IgG against S1 domain of S protein, and the SARS-CoV IgG in these sera were detected by ELISA. RESULTS The positive rates of anti-N-IgG, anti S1-IgG, and anti-SARS-CoV IgG were 14% (6/44), 5% (2/44), and 14% (6/44) respectively in the first week of the course of disease, 56% (10/18), 39% (7/18), and 56% (10/18) respectively in the second week, and 100% (24/24), S1-IgG 83% (20/24), and 100% (24/24) respectively in the third week. The agreement rates of the results of anti-N-IgG and anti-s1-IgG with that of the anti-SARS-CoV IgG were 88% (76/86) and 83% (71/86) respectively. The anti-SARS-CoV IgG positive rate in the healthy persons was 1.88% (14.745).

Postoperative chemotherapy with CapeOX was initiated, but para-aortic lymph node metastasis was discovered 4months after the surgery. Chemoradiation therapy with Cape and Bev, and 70 Gy/28 Fr led to the disappearance of the metastasized lesions. At 13months after the surgery, FDG accumulation was observed in the Virchow's lymph node, and chemotherapy with IRIS and Bev was initially administered. Subsequently, chemoradiation therapy with S-1 and Bev, and 66 Gy/33Fr was administered, followed by chemotherapy with S-1 and Bev, S-1. These therapies led to complete response(CR). However, 35 months after the surgery, the Virchow's lymph node had enlarged again, and chemoradiation therapy with S-1 and 60 Gy/30Fr was administered. Although no FDG accumulation was detected in the lymph node at 40 months after the surgery, metastasis was found in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Panitumumab therapy achieved CR, and no metastasis had been identified at 60 months after the final therapy. Chemoradiation therapy is a treatment option to improve the prognosis of patients with metastasis only in the Virchow's lymph node.","Sakimura, Yusuke; Yamamoto, Daisuke; Saito, Hiroshi; Nishimura, Akihiro; Sugita, Hiroaki; Hayashi, Kengo; Nishida, Yoji; Tsuji, Toshikatsu; Kitamura, Hirotaka; Kadoya, Shinichi; Taima, Yoko; Bandou, Hiroyuki",Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Use of the pulse oximeter has increased massively, especially in the COVID-era, and has a central role in managing patients at the emergency department. However, interpretation of the plethysmogram is frequently incorrect which may lead to incorrect conclusions. Moreover, an irregular plethysmographic signal may well 'give' a saturation percentage. We will discuss how pulse oximeters work and discuss some pitfalls.

194169,"European National Society Cardiovascular Journals. Background, rationale and mission statement of the ""Editors' Club"" (Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology).",2008,"AIM New Zealand's stated goal of eradicating COVID-19 included the enforcement of a national lockdown. During this time, a perceived decrease in hospital presentations nationwide was noted. This was also the experience of the Department of General Surgery, Bay of Plenty District Health Board (BOPDHB). We sought to quantify this reduction by analysing the frequency and severity of three common acute general surgical presentations; appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis. METHODS Data on presentations of patients with appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis were retrospectively collected for the national lockdown period (25 March 2020-27 April 2020) and the immediate pre-lockdown period (21 February 2020-25 March 2020). Data collected included patient demographics, duration of symptoms, method of diagnosis, treatment, severity of disease, length of stay and complications. RESULTS A reduction of 62.2% was noted in the frequency of appendicitis during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period. Patients presented later during lockdown and had a higher complication rate (5.4% versus 42.8%). Similarly, a 39.2% reduction in presentations of cholecystitis during lockdown was found. The lockdown group of patients had a longer length of stay (6.9 versus 4 days) and only one patient (9.1%, 1/11) was managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the lockdown period, compared to 52.9% of patients (9/17) over the pre-lockdown period. No difference in frequency or severity of acute diverticulitis presentations between the two periods was found. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 lockdown led to fewer presentations, but these were often delayed, with more complications and a longer length of stay. This could be partly explained by patient fear around exposure to the virus and reluctance to attend hospital. More research is needed to study the flow-on effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on surgical presentations.","Boyle, Leah Imogen; Boyle, Alexander; Jay, Sharon; Marnewick, Jacques",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223552/,129

To address these challenges, we designed and constructed a new insertable robotic end-effectors platform (IREP) for SPAS. The IREP can be inserted through a Ø15 mm trocar into the abdomen and it uses 21 actuated joints for controlling two dexterous arms and a stereo-vision module. Each dexterous arm has a hybrid mechanical architecture comprised of a two-segment continuum robot, a parallelogram mechanism for improved dual-arm triangulation, and a distal wrist for improved dexterity during suturing. The IREP is unique because of the combination of continuum arms with active and passive segments with rigid parallel kinematics mechanisms. This paper presents the clinical motivation, design considerations, kinematics, statics, and mechanical design of the IREP. The kinematics of coordination between the parallelogram mechanisms and the continuum arms is presented using the pseudo-rigid-body model of the beam representing the passive segment of each snake arm. Kinematic and static simulations and preliminary experiment results are presented in support of our design choices.","Ding, Jienan; Goldman, Roger E; Xu, Kai; Allen, Peter K; Fowler, Dennis L; Simaan, Nabil",IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics : a joint publication of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23963105/,129

In order to provide a basis for clinical diagnosis, this study retrospectively analyzed the imaging characteristics, evolution and related imaging manifestations of COVID-19 patients in different stages of the disease. The results suggest that the imaging findings of 48 COVID-19 patients from Hengyang, Hunan Province are comparable in different stages of the disease. Chest CT showed no pneumonia in one mild patient. Chest CT findings of moderate type (n=38) and severe type (n=9) had comparable characteristics. The main manifestations were ground-glass opacity (GGO) (18/38, 47.37%; 1/9, 11.11%), and GGO with consolidation (16/38, 42.11%; 5/9, 55.56%), which respectively presented in bilateral lungs (34/38, 89.47%; 9/9, 100.00%), and multi-lobe distribution (involving 5 lobes) (17/38, 44.74%; 8/9, 88.89%).

D-RNAs based on the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) D-RNA CD-61 have been rescued (replicated and packaged into virions) in a helper virus-dependent manner following electroporation of in vitro-generated T7 transcripts into IBV-infected cells. In order to increase the efficiency of rescue of IBV D-RNAs, cDNAs based on CD-61, under the control of a T7 promoter, were integrated into the fowlpox virus (FPV) genome. The 3'-UTR of the D-RNAs was flanked by a hepatitis delta antigenomic ribozyme and T7 terminator sequence to generate suitable 3' ends for rescue by helper IBV. Cells were co-infected simultaneously with IBV, the recombinant FPV (rFPV) containing the D-RNA sequence and a second rFPV expressing T7 RNA polymerase for the initial expression of the D-RNA transcript, subsequently rescued by helper IBV. Rescue of rFPV-derived CD-61 occurred earlier and with higher efficiency than demonstrated previously for electroporation of in vitro T7-generated RNA transcripts in avian cells. Rescue of CD-61 was also demonstrated for the first time in mammalian cells. The rescue of rFPV-derived CD-61 by M41 helper IBV resulted in leader switching, in which the Beaudette-type leader sequence on CD-61 was replaced with the M41 leader sequence, confirming that helper IBV virus replicated the rFPV-derived D-RNA. An rFPV-derived D-RNA containing the luciferase gene under the control of an IBV transcription-associated sequence was also rescued and expressed luciferase on serial passage.","Evans, S; Cavanagh, D; Britton, P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11086116/,129

In the aftermath of a large-scale anthrax attack, mass screening to identify early inhalational anthrax may improve both the management of individual cases and the efficiency of health resource utilization. PURPOSE To develop the evidence base for outpatient anthrax screening protocols by quantifying differences in clinical presentation between inhalational anthrax and common viral respiratory tract infections. DESIGN Review, compilation, and data extraction from English-language case reports of inhalational anthrax and epidemiologic studies of influenza and other viral respiratory infections. DATA SOURCES 13 reports of 28 cases of inhalational anthrax from 1920 to 2001 and 5 studies reporting on the clinical features of 2762 cases of influenza and 1932 cases of noninfluenza viral respiratory disease. DATA SYNTHESIS Characterization of presenting clinical symptoms in anthrax and viral disease and calculation of likelihood ratios for the presence of selected clinical features. RESULTS Fever and cough do not reliably discriminate between inhalational anthrax and viral respiratory tract infection. Features suggestive of anthrax include the presence of nonheadache neurologic symptoms (positive likelihood ratio cannot be calculated), dyspnea (positive likelihood ratio, 5.3 [95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4]), nausea or vomiting (positive likelihood ratio, 5.1 [CI, 3.0 to 8.5]), and finding of any abnormality on lung auscultation (positive likelihood ratio, 8.1 [CI, 5.3 to 12.5]). In contrast, rhinorrhea (positive likelihood ratio, 0.2 [CI, 0.1 to 0.4]) and sore throat (positive likelihood ratio, 0.2 [CI, 0.1 to 0.5]) are more suggestive of viral respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSION Inhalational anthrax has characteristic clinical features that are distinct from those seen in common viral respiratory tract infections. Screening protocols based on these features may improve rapid identification of patients with presumptive inhalational anthrax in the setting of a large-scale anthrax attack.","Hupert, Nathaniel; Bearman, Gonzalo M L; Mushlin, Alvin I; Callahan, Mark A",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12965942/,129

197149,Psychosocial phenotyping as a personalization strategy for chronic disease self-management interventions.,2021,"RNA viruses (except retroviruses) replicate by the action of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which lacks a proofreading exonuclease and, consequently, errors may occur in each replication giving place to viral mutants. Depending on their fitness, these mutants either become extinct or thrive, spawning variants that escape the immune system. The most important SARS-CoV-2 mutations are those that alter the amino acid sequence in the viral S protein because this protein holds the key for the virus to enter the human cell. The more viruses replicate, the more they mutate, and the more likely it is that dominant resistant variants will appear. In such cases, more stringent measures for community protection will be required. Vaccines and polyclonal antibodies, which induce a response directed towards several sites along the S protein, would maintain effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, vaccines appear to induce an increased helper and cytotoxic T-cell response, which may also be a biomarker of protection. In densely populated areas with insufficient protection measures, the virus spreads freely, thus increasing the likelihood of generating escape mutants. India and Manaus exemplify this situation. Natural evolution selects the mutants that multiply most efficiently without eliminating the host, thus facilitating their spread. Contrastingly, the circulation of viruses of high virulence and lethality (Ebola, hantavirus) that eliminate the host remain limited to certain geographic areas, without further dissemination. Therefore, it would be expected that SARS-CoV-2 will evolve into more infectious and less virulent variants.","Kantor, Isabel N; Lüthy, Isabel A; Ritacco, Viviana",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137703/,129

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon-alpha2b and lamivudine combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B. DESIGN Randomized, controlled, open-label trial. SETTING Outpatient clinic in a referral center. PARTICIPANTS 100 treatment-naive patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B and moderately elevated alanine aminotransferase levels. MEASUREMENT The primary end point was sustained virologic response (HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA level < 500,000 copies/mL) at 24 weeks after cessation of treatment. INTERVENTION A staggered regimen of combination therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha2b (1.5 microg/kg of body weight per week; maximum, 100 microg) given for 32 weeks plus lamivudine (100 mg daily) given for 52 weeks versus lamivudine (100 mg daily) monotherapy given for 52 weeks. Of the 100 participants, 96% completed treatment and 80% completed post-treatment follow-up. RESULTS The rate of sustained virologic response was 36% for the combination treatment group and 14% for the lamivudine monotherapy group (absolute difference, 22 percentage points [95% CI, 6 to 38 percentage points]). End-of-treatment outcomes showed that, compared with monotherapy, patients receiving combination therapy more often had virologic response (60% vs. 28% [absolute difference, 32 percentage points (CI, 14 to 50 percentage points)]); had more substantial reductions of HBV DNA (3.91 log10 copies/mL vs. 2.83 log10 copies/mL); and less often had lamivudine-resistant mutants (21% vs. 40%). The percentages of patients with normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels and histologic improvement did not differ. Adverse effects, such as transient influenza-like symptoms, alopecia, and local erythematous reactions, were more common with combination therapy. LIMITATIONS This study lacked a double-blind design and was conducted at 1 institution. Because of the staggered pegylated interferon-lamivudine regimen, patients assigned to combination therapy received treatment for 8 weeks longer than those assigned to monotherapy.

The components of honey are sucrose, glucose, fructose and 5-hydroxymethyl-furaldehyde (HMF). To clarify the causative component(s) in honey that altered the metabolic pharmacokinetics of GZ, rabbits were given GZ (150 mg kg(-1)) with and without glucose (5 g/rabbit), fructose (5 g/rabbit) and HMF (1 mg kg(-1)), respectively, in crossover designs. An HPLC method was used to determine concentrations of GZ and GA in serum as well as GA and 3-dehydroglycyrrhetic acid (3-dehydroGA) in faeces suspension. A noncompartment model was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters and analysis of variance was used for statistical comparison. Our results indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of GA was significantly increased by 29% when HMF was coadministered, whereas the pharmacokinetics of GZ and GA were not significantly altered by coadministration of glucose or fructose. An in-vitro study, using faeces to incubate GZ and GA individually, indicated that HMF significantly inhibited the oxidation of GA to 3-dehydroGA and this may explain the enhanced GA absorption in-vivo. It was concluded that HMF is the causative component in honey that affects the presystemic metabolism and pharmacokinetics of GZ in-vivo.","Hou, Y C; Ching, H; Chao, P D L; Tsai, S Y; Wen, K C; Hsieh, P H; Hsiu, S L",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15720790/,129

METHOD Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to detect serum antibody against SARS coronavirus in the lysate of whole SARS coronavirus from 19 SARS patients and 200 medical staff members without obvious SARS symptoms after possible exposure to the virus during routine medical practice. RESULTS Serum IgG antibody against SARS coronavirus was detected in all the 19 SARS patients, and among the 200 staff members, 20 (10%) were found positive for the antibody but with no obvious or only mild symptoms. CONCLUSION Serum IgG antibody against SARS coronavirus is positive in a small proportion (around 10%) of the medical staff members exposed to the virus in our hospital, but may not cause obvious symptoms, suggesting SARS coronavirus infection might in some cases have mild or even no clinical manifestations.","Si, Jian-hua; Tan, Jia-ju; Yang, Guang; Tang, Li-xia",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16503535/,129

199110,Effect of Oxygen Therapy on Mortality in the ICU,2021,"CONTEXT Round pneumonia is a condition usually described in children, with few reports addressing adult patients. It is an oval-shaped consolidation that, due to its radiological appearance, simulates bronchogenic carcinoma. Its evolution tends to be benign, although diagnostic dilemmas have sometimes required exploratory thoracotomy. Deaths caused by this condition have even been reported. To the best of our knowledge, there have been 31 previous cases of round pneumonia in adults reported in the English and Portuguese-language literature, of which only one was completely asymptomatic. CASE REPORT The case of a 54-year-old female patient presenting a lung mass found on routine imaging evaluation is reported. Respiratory symptoms and signs were absent, but the patient had a significant history of smoking. Her physical examination gave normal results. On chest radiographs, a mass located in the middle third of the right lung was observed. Three weeks after the initial evaluation, the patient was admitted for a complete evaluation and for staging of a pulmonary malignancy, but repeated chest radiographs showed complete resolution.","Camargo, José Jesus de Peixoto; Camargo, Spencer Marcantonio; Machuca, Tiago Noguchi; Perin, Fabíola Adélia",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18853036/,129

However, the precise incidence and the clinical impact of RSV in this group are unknown. Therefore, the incidence and clinical impact of RSV infection in persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who reside in the community were prospectively evaluated over two consecutive winters in 134 persons. Eight RSV (incidence of 4.3 per 100 subject-winters), 13 influenza A (incidence of 7.0 per 100 subject-winters), seven rhinovirus, nine coronavirus, and two parainfluenza virus infections were identified. The clinical illnesses associated with RSV and influenza A virus were similar, causing both upper and lower respiratory signs and symptoms. The clinical impact was significant as three of eight RSV-infected subjects were hospitalized compared with six of 13 influenza A-infected persons and zero of seven rhinovirus-infected persons.","Walsh, E E; Falsey, A R; Hennessey, P A",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10471598/,129

Many doctors and nurses have been redeployed to acute care wards. In order to ensure the best quality of care it is essential for health professionals to stay updated on clinical studies and novel therapeutical approaches. Most patients with COVID-19 who become seriously unwell have an acute respiratory illness and about 14 % will require non-invasive respiratory support. This article aims at presenting some of the approaches in respiratory support and drug therapy. The overview of management is based on current guidelines and conclusions of several studies. The author is aware of the fact that the approach in COVID-19 management may change over time based on the current state of knowledge. It is worth mentioning that regardless its severity clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 pneumonia may only be minor and thus regular monitoring on standard wards is required. The article refers to recent studies related to dexamethasone and remdesivir. The treatment with interleukin-6 receptor antagonists is also discussed.

202679,Authors’ Reply,2020,"The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Mpro, is conserved among coronaviruses with no human homolog and has therefore attracted significant attention as an enzyme drug target for COVID-19. The number of studies targeting Mpro for in silico screening has grown rapidly, and it would be of great interest to know in advance how well docking methods can reproduce the correct ligand binding modes and rank these correctly. Clearly, current attempts at designing drugs targeting Mpro with the aid of computational docking would benefit from a priori knowledge of the ability of docking programs to predict correct binding modes and score these correctly. In the current work, we tested the ability of several leading docking programs, namely, Glide, DOCK, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, FRED, and EnzyDock, to correctly identify and score the binding mode of Mpro ligands in 193 crystal structures. None of the codes were able to correctly identify the crystal structure binding mode (lowest energy pose with root-mean-square deviation < 2 Å) in more than 26% of the cases for noncovalently bound ligands (Glide: top performer), whereas for covalently bound ligands the top score was 45% (EnzyDock). These results suggest that one should perform in silico campaigns of Mpro with care and that more comprehensive strategies including ligand free energy perturbation might be necessary in conjunction with virtual screening and docking.","Zev, Shani; Raz, Keren; Schwartz, Renana; Tarabeh, Reem; Gupta, Prashant Kumar; Major, Dan T",J Chem Inf Model,,129

204821,Clinical approach to the inflammatory etiology of cardiovascular diseases,2020,"Honeysuckle flower is a common edible-medicinal food with significant anti-inflammatory efficacy. Process quality control of its ethanol precipitation is a topical issue in the pharmaceutical field. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is commonly used for process quality analysis. However, establishing a robust and reliable quantitative model of complex process remains a challenge in industrial applications of NIR. In this paper, modeling design based on quality by design concept (QbD) was implemented for the ethanol precipitation process quality control of Honeysuckle flower. According to the 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots, quadratic model was the best with Radj2 increasing from 0.1395 to 0.9085, indicating the strong interaction among spectral pre-processing methods, variable selection methods, and latent factors. SG9 and CARS was an appropriate combination for modeling. Furthermore, spectral assignment method was creatively introduced for variable selection. Another 56 models' performances and 25 contour plots were established. Compared with the chemometric variable selection method, spectral assignment combined with QbD concept made a higher Rpre2 and a lower RMSEP. When the latent factors of PLS was small, Rpre2 of the model by spectral assignment increased from 0.9605 to 0.9916 and RMSEP decreased from 0.1555 mg/mL to 0.07134 mg/mL. This result suggests that the variable selected by spectral assignment is more representative and precise. This provided a novel modeling guideline for process quality control in PAT.","Ma, Lijuan; Liu, Daihan; Du, Chenzhao; Lin, Ling; Zhu, Jinyuan; Huang, Xingguo; Liao, Yuan; Wu, Zhisheng",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,,129

Pregnant women are at risk of infection. The present study examined the frequency of washing hands with soap and wearing face mask when going out, prevalence of depression and anxiety, and identified their associated factors among pregnant women during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 24 February and 3 March 2020. A total of 15 428 pregnant women who were using maternal health care services in China completed a questionnaire which assessed their socio-demographic and pregnancy-related characteristics, contextual, cognitive and social factors related to COVID-19, frequency of washing hands and wearing face masks, and depression and anxiety. Logistics regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors of preventive behaviours and mental health. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable anxiety and depression was 28.2% and 43.6% respectively. 19.8% reported always wearing face mask when going out, and 19.1% reported washing hands with soap for more than 10 times per day. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that older age was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (OR = 0.42-0.67) and higher frequency of washing hands (OR = 1.57-3.40). Higher level of education level was associated with probable depression (OR = 1.31-1.45) and higher frequency of wearing face mask (OR = 1.50-1.57). After adjusting for significant socio-demographic and pregnancy-related factors, place of residence being locked down (aOR = 1.10-1.11), being quarantined (aOR = 1.42-1.57), personally knowing someone being infected with COVID-19 (aOR = 1.80-1.92), perception that COVID-19 would pose long term physical harm to human (aOR = 1.25-1.28) were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, while the perception that the disease will be under control in the coming month was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (aOR = 0.59-0.63) and lower tendency of always wearing face mask (aOR = 0.85). Social support was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (aOR = 0.86-0,87) and higher frequency of washing hands (aOR = 1.06). CONCLUSIONS: The mental health and preventive behaviours of pregnant women during COVID-19 outbreak was associated with a range of socio-demographic, pregnancy-related, contextual, cognitive and social factors. Interventions to mitigate their mental health problems and to promote preventive behaviours are highly warranted.","Wang, Qian; Mo, Phoenix K H; Song, Bo; Di, Jiang-Li; Zhou, Feng-Rong; Zhao, Juan; Wu, Ying-Lan; Tian, Hong; Qiu, Li-Qian; Xia, Jianhong; Wang, Lan; Li, Fen; Wang, Lin-Hong",Infect Dis Poverty,,129

While vaccines have been successfully developed against certain viruses (e.g., yellow fever virus, polio virus, and human papilloma virus HPV), those against a number of other important public health threats, such as HIV-1, hepatitis C, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have so far had very limited success. The global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, highlights the urgency of vaccine development against this and other constant threats of zoonotic infection. While some traditional methods of producing vaccines have proven to be successful, new concepts have emerged in recent years to produce more cost-effective and less time-consuming vaccines that rely on viral vectors to deliver the desired immunogens. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different viral vaccine vectors and their general strategies and applications in both human and veterinary medicines. A careful review of these issues is necessary as they can provide important insights into how some of these viral vaccine vectors can induce robust and long-lasting immune responses in order to provide protective efficacy against a variety of infectious disease threats to humans and animals, including those with zoonotic potential to cause global pandemics.","Vrba, Sophia M; Kirk, Natalie M; Brisse, Morgan E; Liang, Yuying; Ly, Hinh",,,129

Yet contact tracing is among the most powerful. Contact tracing is the process by which public-health officials identify people, or contacts, who have been exposed to a person infected with a pathogen or another hazard. For all its power, though, contact tracing yields a variable level of success. One reason is that contact tracing's ability to break the chain of transmission is only as effective as the proportion of contacts who are actually traced. In part, this proportion turns on the quality of the information that infected people provide, which makes human memory a crucial part of the efficacy of contact tracing. Yet the fallibilities of memory, and the challenges associated with gathering reliable information from memory, have been grossly underestimated by those charged with gathering it. We review the research on witnesses and investigative interviewing, identifying interrelated challenges that parallel those in contact tracing, as well as approaches for addressing those challenges.","Garry, Maryanne; Hope, Lorraine; Zajac, Rachel; Verrall, Ayesha J; Robertson, Jamie M",Perspect Psychol Sci,,129

Teledentistry is widely being practiced in this pandemic era for the diagnosis and to give instructions to the patients. Hence, an attempt has been made to explore the knowledge, attitude, and awareness of practicing orthodontists regarding the usage of teledentistry during COVID lockdown, in Kerala. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was done on about 150 orthodontic professionals. A pretested, self-organized, close-ended survey was managed through online stages that comprised of 15 questions. The information gathered was assembled in a systematic way and investigated regarding recurrence and Chi-square test was utilized for the examination of frequencies. Results: It was observed that 93.3% orthodontic practitioners had knowledge regarding teledentistry and a positive attitude toward teledentistry was shown by younger age group practitioners and those who were working in institutions (P &lt; 0.05). 77.3% believed that teledentistry can save dentist's time and 71.3% responded that the new technology can be helpful in reducing the cost of treatment for patients. Conclusion: The knowledge, awareness, and attitudes were discovered to be acceptable among the orthodontic practitioners. Younger practitioners had more positive attitude toward teledentistry, and there was an overall positive attitude for using teledentistry as a temporary alternate for direct patient contact in COVID-19 pandemic time.","George, Pradeep Edathotty Terry Gopikrishnan S.; Prasanth, P.; Mathew, Sandeep Ameen A.

METHODS: To provide a better understanding of the importance of abnormal laboratory findings in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis, we searched the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science medical databases and selected 19 articles (totaling 2988 patients, 484 of whom [16.1%] had severe disease) that reported panels of laboratory examinations in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Although in vitro diagnostics, primarily using PCR- and ELISA-based methods, efficiently contribute to the etiological identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we suggest that laboratory medicine may also be of significant assistance when differentiating between severe and non-severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: When we wrote this article, our ability to provide a definitive conclusion may have been adversely affected by some limitations, such as the low sample size, differently applied methods, dissimilar reference ranges, non-synchronized representations of results, and variety of the patients' panels. Despite the limitations, the analysis of the current scientific literature demonstrates the value of laboratory parameters as simple, rapid, and cost-effective biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.","Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Bashash, Davood; Fateh, Fatemeh; Abolghasemi, Hassan",Clin Chim Acta,,129
211561,Adapting Scientific Conferences to the Realities Imposed by COVID-19,2020,"We study how moral suasion that appeals to two major ethical theories, Consequentialism and Deontology, affects individual intentions to contribute to a public good. We use the COVID-19 pandemic as an exemplary case where there is a large gap between private and social costs and where moral suasion has been widely used as a policy instrument. Based on a survey experiment with a representative sample of around 3500 Germans at the beginning of the pandemic, we study how moral appeals affect contributions with low and high opportunity costs, hand washing and social distancing, to reduce the infection externality as well as the support for governmental regulation. We find that Deontological moral suasion, appealing to individual moral duty, is effective in increasing planned social distancing and hand-washing, while a Consequentialist appeal only increases planned hand-washing. Both appeals increase support for governmental regulation. Exploring heterogeneous treatment effects reveals that younger respondents are more susceptible to Deontological appeals. Our results highlight the potential of moral appeals to induce intended private contributions to a public good or the reduction of externalities, which can help to overcome collective action problems for a range of environmental issues.","Bos, Björn; Drupp, Moritz A; Meya, Jasper N; Quaas, Martin F",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,129
211740,[Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis],2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. However, the hazard to newborns in pregnancy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the vertical transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from mother to child and developmental toxicity in the fetus. METHODS: All clinical information was recorded on 22 neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Tongji Hospital. RESULTS: The average birth weight of the 22 newborns (16 males and 6 females) was 2980 g, and the mean gestational week was 37W+3. The birth weight of three babies was <2500 g, and the gestational week of all three low-birth-weight neonates was less than 36W. Three newborns had minor lesions of infection in the lungs as shown by computed tomography (CT) scans. Furthermore, three newborns had elevated SARS-CoV-2-related immunoglobin M (IgM) antibodies, and 11 newborns (52.4%) had positive immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies. Notably, both cystatin C and ß2-microglobulin were increased in all newborns. Five of the 21 tested newborns had leukocytosis, and 11 had increased neutrophil levels. In addition, the aspartate aminotransferase of 18 newborns and the Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase of 19 newborns were increased. Total bilirubin was elevated in all newborns and serum albumin was reduced in 20 of 22 newborns. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to discover that COVID-19 infection in the third trimester of pregnancy could cause fetal kidney developmental injury, as indicated by increased cystatin C and ß2-microglobulin in all neonates. Furthermore, there is the possibility of maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","He, Zheng; Fang, Yinian; Zuo, Qin; Huang, Xiaoxing; Lei, Yongfang; Ren, Xiuhua; Liu, Dong",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,129

213780,"[Epidemiological and clinical aspects of diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of imported malaria cases in Russian Federation]",2020,"Introduction: Overweight and obesity in children is a global health problem among children of all ages. Based on the Indonesia Basic Health Research, overweight problems in children aged 5 12 years was still high, 18.8% were overweight and 8.8% were obese. In developing countries, the rate increased obesity and overweight in children 30% higher than developed countries. Aims: Our study aims to identify the relationship between gadgets use and pocket money with school children s nutritional status. Methods: This research was a cross-sectional study involving 672 schoolchildren randomly selected from ten elementary schools in Surabaya City, Indonesia. Data about duration of gadget use, pocket money, and snacking habit were assessed using structured questionnaire. Body weight and height were directly measured to calculate the subject s nutritional status using digital weight scale and stadiometer. Statistical analysis done in this study was Chi-square test to assess the relationship between variable tested. Results: The results showed that 38.8% of participants were overweight. 71.9% children were having gadget use for more than 2 hours/day, exceeding the recommended time use. Duration of gadget use and pocket money were significantly correlated with the nutritional status of school children (p 0.001). Snacking habits at home (p=0.302) and school (p=0.933) were not significantly correlated with nutritional status. Conclusions: Gadget use duration and pocket money proved to be correlated with the increase of nutritional status among schoolchildren. Thus, parents should pay more attention to control gadget use and pocket money to prevent overweight.","Mahmudiono, T.; Rachmah, Q.; Indriani, D.; Nindya, T.

215979,Molecular characterization of breast cancer needle core biopsy specimens by the 21-gene Breast Recurrence Score test,2020,"BACKGROUND: The endeavor to tackle the spread of COVID-19 effectively remains futile without the right grasp of perceptions and beliefs presiding in the community. Therefore, this study aimed to assess myths, beliefs, perceptions, and information gaps about COVID-19 in Ethiopia. METHODS: An internet-based survey was conducted in Ethiopia from April 22 to May 04, 2020. The survey link was promoted through emails, social media, and the Jimma University website. Perceptions about COVID-19 have considered the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and local beliefs. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 20.0. Classifications and lists of factors for each thematic perception of facilitators, inhibitors, and information needs were generated. Explanatory factor analysis (EFA) was executed to assist categorizations. Standardized mean scores of the categories were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-tests. A significant difference was claimed at p-value <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 929 responses were gathered during the study period. The EFA generated two main categories of perceived facilitators of COVID-19 spread: behavioral non-adherence (55.9%) and lack of enablers (86.5%). Behavioral non-adherence was illustrated by fear of stigma (62.9%), not seeking care (59.3%), and hugging and shaking (44.8%). Perceived lack of enablers of precautionary measures includes staying home impossible due to economic challenges (92.4%), overcrowding (87.6%), and inaccessible face masks (81.6%) and hand sanitizers (79.1%). Perceived inhibitors were categorized into three factors: two misperceived, myths (31.6%) and false assurances (32.9%), and one correctly identified; engagement in standard precautions (17.1%). Myths about protection from the virus involve perceived religiosity and effectiveness of selected food items, hot weather, traditional medicine, and alcohol drinking, ranging from 15.1% to 54.7%. False assurances include people's perception that they were living far away from areas where COVID-19 was rampant (36.9%), and no locally reported cases were present (29.5%). There were tremendous information needs reported about COVID-19 concerning protection methods (62.6%), illness behavior and treatment (59.5%), and quality information, including responses to key unanswered questions such as the origin of the virus (2.4%). Health workers were perceived as the most at-risk group (83.3%). The children, adolescents, youths were marked at low to moderate (45.1%-62.2%) risk of COVID-19. Regional, township, and access to communication showed significant variations in myths, false assurances, and information needs (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Considering young population as being at low risk of COVID-19 would be challenging to the control efforts, and needs special attention. Risk communication and community engagement efforts should consider regional and township variations of myths and false assurances. It should also need to satisfy information needs, design local initiatives that enhance community ownership of the control of the virus, and thereby support engagement in standard precautionary measures. All forms of media should be properly used and regulated to disseminate credible information while filtering out myths and falsehoods.","Kebede, Yohannes; Birhanu, Zewdie; Fufa, Diriba; Yitayih, Yimenu; Abafita, Jemal; Belay, Ashenafi; Jote, Abera; Ambelu, Argaw",PLoS One,,129

There has been constant tension between the sovereign right of a WTO member state to determine its own appropriate level of protection (ALOP) and the regulatory constraints imposed under the SPS Agreement to prevent abuse and disguised trade protection. The case emerged from this tension and raises questions on the extent of the regulatory autonomy in the application of an SPS measure. This article addresses these questions and examines the criteria for the qualitative standards for the ALOP, the question that the Appellate Body decision did not fully resolve. The criteria for the qualitative ALOP standards affect the regulatory autonomy significantly under the current SPS rules as they determine the manner and the extent to which a Member may meet the sensitive public interests in the application of an SPS measure. The article proposes a rational basis test to restrain abuse of SPS measures while preserving the regulatory autonomy protected under the SPS Agreement.","Lee, Yong-Shik",World Trade Review,,129

The extent to which this change in health news consumption practice impacts health knowledge is not known. This study investigates the relationship between most trusted information source and COVID-19 knowledge. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was sent to a convenience sample from a list of adults on a central Pennsylvania health system's marketing database 25-31 March 2020. Respondents were grouped by their trusted news sources and comparison of respondent COVID-19 knowledge was made between these groups for 5948 respondents. RESULTS: Those who selected government health websites as their most trusted source were more likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who selected other internet news sources or television news (OR 1.21, p < .05; 1.08, p > .05; and 0.87, p < .05, respectively). Those who used Facebook as an additional source of news in any way were less likely to answer COVID-19 questions correctly than those who did not (OR 0.93, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 knowledge correlates with trusted news source. To increase public knowledge of COVID-19 in order to maximize information dissemination and compliance with COVID-19-related public health recommendations, those who provide health information should consider use of the public's most trusted sources of information, as well as monitoring and correcting misinformation presented by other sources. Independent content review for accuracy in media may be warranted in public health emergencies to improve knowledge.","Sakya, Surav Man; Scoy, Lauren Jodi Van; Garman, John C; Miller, Erin L; Snyder, Bethany; Wasserman, Emily; Chinchilli, Vernon M; Lennon, Robert P",Curr Med Res Opin,,129

Beyond causing respiratory distress, COVID-19 may also cause mortality by way of suicide. The pathways by which emerging viral disease outbreaks (EVDOs) and suicide are related are complex and not entirely understood. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association between EVDOs and suicidal behaviors and/or ideation. An electronic search was conducted using five databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus in April 2020. A rapid systematic review was carried out, which involved separately and independently extracting quantitative data of selected articles. The electronic search yielded 2480 articles, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the data were collected in Hong Kong (n = 3) and the USA (n = 3). Four studies reported a slight but significant increase in deaths by suicide during EVDOs. The increase in deaths by suicide was mainly reported during the peak epidemic and in older adults. Psychosocial factors such as the fear of being infected by the virus or social isolation related to quarantine measures were the most prominent factors associated with deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Overall, we found scarce and weak evidence for an increased risk of deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Our results inform the need to orient public health policies toward suicide prevention strategies targeting the psychosocial effects of EVDOs. High-quality research on suicide risk and prevention are warranted during the current pandemic.","Leaune, Edouard; Samuel, Maeva; Oh, Hans; Poulet, Emmanuel; Brunelin, Jérôme",Prev Med,,129

At the clinical level, the issues are the fulfillment of medical care demand with adequate health care teams, infrastructure, and supplies, and to cover critical care demands that surpass the available resources. Therefore, ethically correct approaches are required for the allocation of life sustaining resources. There are recommendations for the allocating life support during disasters based on multiple considerations, including ethical ones. However, the ethical criteria of existing guidelines are variable. Ethical principles usually considered are saving the greatest number of lives, saving the greatest number of years of life and the principle of the life cycle or the goal to give each individual equal opportunity to live through the various phases of life. However, the centrality of the human being and the search for the common good should be considered. Knowledge of public perspectives and moral benchmarks on these issues is essential. A successful assignment effort will require everyone's trust and cooperation. Decision making should be planned and discussed in advance, since in-depth deliberation will be extremely complex during the disaster.

However, the information on the risk factors associated with the mortality of COVID-19 and of their prognostic potential is limited. In this retrospective study, the clinical characteristics, treatment and outcome data were collected and analyzed from 676 COVID-19 patients stratified into 140 non-survivors and 536 survivors. We found that the levels of Dimerized plasmin fragment D (D-dimer), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT) were significantly higher in non-survivals on admission (non-survivors vs. survivors: D-Dimer &#8805; 0.5 mg/L, 83.2% vs. 44.9%, P<0.01; CRP &#8805;10 mg/L, 50.4% vs. 6.0%, P<0.01; LDH &#8805; 250 U/L, 73.8% vs. 20.1%, P<0.01; PCT &#8805; 0.5 ng/ml, 27.7% vs. 1.8%, P<0.01). Moreover, dynamic tracking showed D-dimer kept increasing in non-survivors, while CRP, LDH and PCT remained relatively stable after admission. D-dimer has the highest C-index to predict in-hospital mortality, and patients with D-dimer levels &#8805;0.5 mg/L had a higher incidence of mortality (Hazard Ratio: 4.39, P<0.01). Our study suggested D-dimer could be a potent marker to predict the mortality of COVID-19, which may be helpful for the management of patients.","Huang, Yongsheng; Lyu, Xiaoyu; Li, Dan; Wang, Lin; Wang, Yujun; Zou, Wenbin; Wei, Yingxin; Wu, Xiaowei",PLoS One,,129

METHODS: From March 17, 2020, to May 26, 2020, we prospectively identified hospitalized children with MIS-C (n = 10), symptomatic COVID-19 (n = 10), and KD (n = 5) and hospitalized controls (n = 4) at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. With institutional review board approval, we obtained prospective and residual blood samples from these children and measured SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG), full-length spike IgG, and nucleocapsid protein antibodies using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using live-virus focus-reduction neutralization assays. We statistically compared the log-transformed antibody titers among groups and performed linear regression analyses. RESULTS: All children with MIS-C had high titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibodies, which correlated with full-length spike IgG antibodies (R 2 = 0.956; P < .001), nucleocapsid protein antibodies (R 2 = 0.846; P < .001), and neutralizing antibodies (R 2 = 0.667; P < .001). Children with MIS-C had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG antibody titers (geometric mean titer 6800; 95% confidence interval 3495-13 231) than children with COVID-19 (geometric mean titer 626; 95% confidence interval 251-1563; P < .001), children with KD (geometric mean titer 124; 95% confidence interval 91-170; P < .001), and hospitalized controls (geometric mean titer 85; P < .001). All children with MIS-C also had detectable RBD immunoglobulin M antibodies, indicating recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RBD IgG titers correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R 2 = 0.512; P < .046) and with hospital (R 2 = 0.548; P = .014) and ICU lengths of stay (R 2 = 0.590; P = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 serology may have a role in establishing the diagnosis of MIS-C, distinguishing it from similar clinical entities, and stratifying risk for adverse outcomes.","Rostad, Christina A; Chahroudi, Ann; Mantus, Grace; Lapp, Stacey A; Teherani, Mehgan; Macoy, Lisa; Tarquinio, Keiko M; Basu, Rajit K; Kao, Carol; Linam, W Matthew; Zimmerman, Matthew G; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Oster, Matthew E; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Anderson, Evan J; Suthar, Mehul S; Wrammert, Jens; Jaggi, Preeti",Pediatrics,,129

MBS has the potential to become an aerosol generating procedure (AGP) as it may trigger a cough or necessitate suctioning which may result in transmission of C-ARI putting patients and health care workers at risk. Regulations and best practices from international and US governmental and commercial agencies were reviewed. This review led to the multidisciplinary development of best practices of the safety measures and structural requirements to avoid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or other C-ARIs when performing MBS. Implementation of these best practices resulted in structural changes to the fluoroscopy suite and protocol workflows. This enabled patients with COVID-19 to undergo MBS while maintaining patient and staff safety including mitigation of potential risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other patients. With proper modifications, MBS can be safely performed on patients with C-ARI such as COVID-19 while maintaining patient and health care worker (HCW) safety.","Goldman, Alice R; Pahade, Jay K; Langton-Frost, Nicole A; Hodges, Chiquacta A; Taylor, Amy M; Bova, Gregory; Azadi, Javad R",Abdom. radiology (Internet),,129

Publications for rapid development, training, and coordination of regional hospital triage teams to manage the allocation of scarce resources during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are lacking. Over a period of 3 weeks, over 100 clinicians, ethicists, leaders, and public health authorities convened virtually to achieve consensus on how best to save the most lives possible and share resources. This is referred to as population-based crisis management. The rapid regionalization of 22 acute care hospitals across 4500 square miles in the midst of a pandemic with a shifting regulatory landscape was challenging, but overcome by mutual trust, transparency, and confidence in the public health authority. Because many cities are facing COVID-19 surges, we share a process for successful rapid formation of health-care care coalitions, Crisis Standard of Care, and training of Triage Teams. Incorporation of continuous process improvement and methods for communication is essential for successful implementation. Use of our regional health-care coalition communications, incident command system, and the crisis care committee helped mitigate crisis care in the San Diego and Imperial County region as COVID-19 cases surged and scarce resource collaborative decisions were required.","Devereaux, Asha; Yang, Holly; Seda, Gilbert; Sankar, Viji; Maves, Ryan C; Karanjia, Navaz; Parrish, John Scott; Rosenberg, Christy; Goodman-Crews, Paula; Cederquist, Lynette; Burkle, Frederick M; Tuteur, Jennifer; Leroy, Chiara; Koenig, Kristi L",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,129

There is potential for a determined revision of the current activity-driven clinical approach, with the adoption of the minimally invasive oral care philosophy into routine practice and use of technology to remotely support our patients. Throughout COVID-19, the whole of the dental profession has demonstrated adaptability in redeployment and compassion in delivering care in a variety of settings. These vital traits and bold clinical leadership, prepared to make timely choices and act fast, will underpin our successful transition towards the safe resumption of routine dental services.

Semantic Segmentation of CT is one of many research fields of automatic detection of Covid-19 and was widely explored since the Covid19 outbreak. In the robotic field, Semantic Segmentation of organs and CTs are widely used in robots developed for surgery tasks. As new methods and new datasets are proposed quickly, it becomes apparent the necessity of providing an extensive evaluation of those methods. To provide a standardized comparison of different architectures across multiple recently proposed datasets, we propose in this paper an extensive benchmark of multiple encoders and decoders with a total of 120 architectures evaluated in five datasets, with each dataset being validated through a five-fold cross-validation strategy, totaling 3.000 experiments.

Development of robust and successful protocols in preventing the disease among the recipients, donors and healthcare workers would help in re-starting the LT programs. We adapted a protocol at our center, which is predominantly a living donor liver transplant center based in north India, and continued the service as the pandemic unfolded and peaked in India with good results and shared the experience of the same. Between March 24 and June 7, 2020, during the government-enforced public curfew-""lockdown""-7 children received LT. The protocols of infection control were drafted in our team by local customization of published guidelines. The number of pediatric LT done during the lockdown period in 2020 was similar to that done in corresponding pre-COVID period in 2019. The outcomes were of 100% survival, and none of recipients developed COVID. One potential donor was asymptomatic positive for COVID, responded well to conservative treatment, and was later accepted as a donor. LT program during the COVID pandemic can successfully function after putting in place standard protocols for infection control. These can be implemented with minimal extra involvement of healthcare infrastructure, hence without diversion of resources from COVID management. In conclusion, pediatric liver transplantation services can be continued amid COVID-19 pandemic after establishing a properly observed protocol with minimum additional resources.","Varma, Sharat; Pandey, Yuktansh; Chikkala, Bhargava Ram; Acharya, Rajgopal; Verma, Sapana; B, Inbaraj; Sreekumar, Sreejith; Das, Dibyajyoti; Dey, Rajesh; Agarwal, Shaleen; Gupta, Subhash",Pediatr Transplant,,129

To understand possible ramifications of these delays, we examined the association between time to surgery (TTS), pathological staging and overall survival (OS). STUDY DESIGN: Patients with DCIS or ER+ cT1-2N0 breast cancer treated 2010-2016 were identified in the National Cancer Database. TTS was recorded. Factors associated with pathological upstaging were examined using logistic regression analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze OS. Analyses were stratified by disease stage and initial treatment strategy. RESULTS: 378,839 patients were identified. Among those undergoing primary surgery, TTS was within 120 days in >98% in all groups. Among cT1-2N0 patients selected for NET, surgery was performed within 120 days in 59.6% of cT1N0 and 30.9% of cT2N0 patients. Increased TTS was associated with increased odds of pathological upstaging in DCIS patients (ER+: 60-120 days: OR:1.15, 95% CI:1.08-1.22; >120 days: OR:1.44, 95% CI:1.24-1.68; ER-: 60-120 days: NS; >120 days: OR:1.36, 95% CI:1.01-1.82; <60 days: reference), but not in patients with invasive cancer irrespective of initial treatment strategy. No difference in OS was seen by TTS in DCIS or NET patients. CONCLUSION: Increased TTS was associated with a small increase in pathological upstaging in DCIS patients, but did not impact OS. In patients with cT1-2N0 disease, NET use did not impact stage or OS, supporting the safety of delay strategies in ER+ breast cancer patients during the pandemic.","Minami, Christina A; Kantor, Olga; Weiss, Anna; Nakhlis, Faina; King, Tari A; Mittendorf, Elizabeth A",J.

From March until late April, the number of cases increased exponentially. The delivery of anti-cancer therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic was extremely challenging. In order to balance the benefits of continuing anti-cancer therapy with the associated increased hospital visits, combined with the risk of COVID-19 infection, we undertook a series of system changes in the delivery of cancer care. METHODS: Patients who attended our dayward over a 4-month period were included. Data were obtained from patient and chemotherapy prescribing records. Patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 at two separate timepoints: prior to their visit via telephone, and using a symptom questionnaire on arrival at the hospital. If patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, they were isolated and a viral swab arranged. RESULTS: A total of 456 patients attended from January 1st to April 30th. The numbers of visits from January to April were 601, 586, 575, and 607, respectively. During this period, there were 2369 patient visits to the dayward and 1953 (82%) intravenous regimens administered. Of the 416 visits that did not lead to treatment, 114 (27%) were scheduled non-treatment review visits, 194 (47%) treatments were held due to disease-related illness, and 108 (26%) treatments were held due to treatment-related complications. Screening measurements were implemented on March 18th due to rising COVID-19 prevalence in the general population. Overall, 53 treatments were held due to the screening process: 19 patients (36%) elicited COVID-19 symptoms via telephone screening; 34 patients (64%) were symptomatic in our pre-assessment area and referred for swabs, of which 4 were positive. Those with a negative swab were rescheduled for chemotherapy the following week.

Comprised primarily of lay volunteers and some trained health workers, FRC volunteers in the Paris (France) region have faced challenges in adapting to pandemic conditions, working with sick and vulnerable populations, managing limited resources and coping with high demand for their services. Existing studies of volunteers focus on individual, social and organisational determinants of motivation, but attend less to contextual ones. Public health incertitude about the COVID-19 pandemic is an important feature of this pandemic. Whether and how uncertainty interacts with volunteer understandings and experiences of their work and organisational relations to contribute to Red Cross worker motivation is the focus of this investigation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This mixed-methods study will investigate volunteer motivation using ethnographic methods and social network listening. Semi-structured interviews and observations will illuminate FRC volunteer work relations, experiences and concerns during the pandemic. A questionnaire targeting a sample of Paris region volunteers will allow quantification of motivation. These findings will iteratively shape and be influenced by a social media (Twitter) analysis of biomedical and public health uncertainties and debates around COVID-19. These tweets provide insight into a French lay public's interpretations of these debates. We evaluate whether and how socio-political conditions and discourses concerning COVID-19 interact with volunteer experiences, working conditions and organisational relations to influence volunteer motivation. Data collection began on 15 June 2020 and will continue until 15 April 2021. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol has received ethical approval from the Institut Pasteur Institutional Review Board (no 2020-03). We will disseminate findings through peer-reviewed articles, conference presentations and recommendations to the FRC.","Heyerdahl, Leonardo W; Vray, Muriel; Leger, Vincent; Le Fouler, Lénaig; Antouly, Julien; Troit, Virginie; Giles-Vernick, Tamara",BMJ Open,,129

Group testing strategies to increase capacity facilitate mass population testing but do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a nonadaptive combinatorial (NAC) group testing strategy to increase throughput while facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350, and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1% to 10%. NAC matrices were compared versus Dorfman sequential (DS) group testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels, with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n = 700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1% to 3%) prevalence, all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%), the DS matrix was marginally superior, although both group testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximizes the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. This methodology may allow laboratories to adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.","McDermott, John H; Stoddard, Duncan; Woolf, Peter J; Ellingford, Jamie M; Gokhale, David; Taylor, Algy; Demain, Leigh A M; Newman, William G; Black, Graeme",J Mol Diagn,,129

249466,The economics of infection prevention: why it is crucial to invest in hand hygiene and nurses during the novel coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Iron (Fe) is one of the most important micronutrients for most life forms on earth. While abundant in soil, Fe bioavailability in oxic soil is very low. In environmental conditions, bacteria need to acquire sufficient Fe to sustain growth while limiting the energy cost of siderophore synthesis. Biofilm formation might mitigate this Fe stress, since it was shown to accumulate Fe in certain Gram-negative bacteria and that this Fe could be mobilized for uptake. However, it is still unclear if and to what extent the amount of Fe accumulated in the biofilm can sustain growth, and if the mobilization of this local Fe pool is modulated by the availability of environmental Fe (i.e., Fe outside the biofilm matrix). Here we use a non-domesticated strain of the ubiquitous biofilm-forming soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, and stable Fe isotopes to precisely evaluate the origin of Fe during growth in the presence of tannic acid and hydroxides, used as proxies for different environmental conditions. We report that this B. subtilis strain can accumulate a large quantity of Fe in the biofilm, largely exceeding Fe associated with cells. We also report that only a fraction of biofilm-bound Fe is available for uptake in the absence of other sources of Fe in the vicinity of the biofilm. We observed that availability of environmental Fe modulates the usage of this pool of biofilm-bound Fe. Finally, our data suggest that consumption of biofilm-bound Fe relates to the efficacy of B. subtilis to transport Fe from the environment to the biofilm, possibly through siderophores.Importance Recent evidences suggest that Fe bound to the biofilm could assume at least two important functions; a local source of Fe for uptake and a support to extracellular metabolism such as extracellular electron transfer. Our results show that B. subtilis can use biofilm-bound Fe for uptake only if it does not compromise Fe homeostasis of the biofilm, i.e., maintaining a minimum Fe concentration in the biofilm for extracellular purposes. We propose a theoretical framework based on our results and recent literature to explain how B. subtilis manages biofilm-bound Fe and Fe uptake in response to environmental Fe availability. These results provide important insights into the management of biofilm-bound and environmental Fe by B. subtilis in response to Fe stress.","Rizzi, Adrien; Leroux, Julie; Charron-Lamoureux, Vincent; Roy, Sébastien; Beauregard, Pascale B; Bellenger, Jean-Philippe",,,129

SUMMARY: Two male patients, a 71-year-old and 62-year-old presented to the emergency department for symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Both patients were on long-term warfarin therapy with their most recent international normalized ratio (INR) prior to admission within their patient specific goal as managed by their outpatient Pharmacist. In both instances, the patients denied any changes in diet, lifestyle, or missed doses of medications upon admission interview. During admission, both patients experienced a marked elevation in INR within 24 to 48 hours of the initiation of remdesivir with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia directed therapy. The patients were both eventually stable and were instructed to continue warfarin monitoring and management under the direction of their outpatient Pharmacist upon discharge. CONCLUSION: The underrecognized but probable interaction between warfarin in conjunction with remdesivir and dexamethasone warrants further analysis.","Landayan, Ronald Patrick; Saint-Felix, Sampson; Williams, Ashley",J Pharm Pract,,129

250903,COVID-19 and Cystic Fibrosis: Tips for children and family with Cystic Fibrosis,2020,"Respiratory, circulatory, and renal failure are among the gravest features of COVID-19 and are associated with a very high mortality rate. A common denominator of all affected organs is the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protease responsible for the conversion of Angiotensin 1-8 (Ang II) to Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7). Ang 1-7 acts on these tissues and in other target organs via Mas receptor (MasR), where it exerts beneficial effects, including vasodilation and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis, along an attenuation of cardiac and vascular remodeling. Unfortunately, ACE2 also serves as the binding receptor of SARS viral spike glycoprotein, enabling its attachment to host cells, with subsequent viral internalization and replication. Although numerous reports have linked the devastating organ injuries to viral homing and attachment to organ-specific cells widely expressing ACE2, little attention has been given to ACE-2 expressed by the immune system. Herein we outline potential adverse effects of SARS-CoV2 on macrophages and dendritic cells, key cells of the immune system expressing ACE2. Specifically, we propose a new hypothesis that, while macrophages play an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, in the case of SARS-CoV, they may also serve as a Trojan horse, enabling viral anchoring specifically within the pulmonary parenchyma. It is tempting to assume that diverse expression of ACE2 in macrophages among individuals might govern the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, reallocation of viral-containing macrophages migrating out of the lung to other tissues is theoretically plausible in the context of viral spread with the involvement of other organs.","Abassi, Zaid; Knaney, Yara; Karram, Tony; Heyman, Samuel N",Front Immunol,,129

The state of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19 hot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to implement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal precautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the COVID- 19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a forecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from the Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial differential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data from the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S. The proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among county clusters in Arizona and human activities on the transmission of COVID-19. The results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable (above 94%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions such as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases at the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to slow the spread of COVID- 19 in Arizona.

255350,The promising barrier: Theoretical investigation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that the reallocation of health care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts health care system. This study describes the epidemiology and the outcome of major trauma patients admitted to centers in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all consecutive trauma patients aged 15 years and older admitted into 15 centers contributing to the TraumaBase® registry during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France. This COVID-19 trauma cohort was compared to historical cohorts (2017-2019). RESULTS: Over a 4 years-study period, 5762 patients were admitted between the first week of February and mid-June. This cohort was split between patients admitted during the first 2020 pandemic wave in France (pandemic period, 1314 patients) and those admitted during the corresponding period in the three previous years (2017-2019, 4448 patients). Trauma patient demographics changed substantially during the pandemic especially during the lockdown period, with an observed reduction in both the absolute numbers and proportion exposed to road traffic accidents and subsequently admitted to traumacenters (348 annually 2017-2019 [55.4% of trauma admissions] vs 143 [36.8%] in 2020 p < 0.005). The in-hospital observed mortality and predicted mortality during the pandemic period were not different compared to the non-pandemic years. CONCLUSIONS: During this first wave of COVID-19 in France, and more specifically during lockdown there was a significant reduction of patients admitted to designated trauma centers. Despite the reallocation and reorganization of medical resources this reduction prevented the saturation of the trauma rescue chain and has allowed maintaining a high quality of care for trauma patients.","Moyer, Jean-Denis; James, Arthur; Gakuba, Clément; Boutonnet, Mathieu; Angles, Emeline; Rozenberg, Emmanuel; Bardon, Jean; Clavier, Thomas; Legros, Vincent; Werner, Marie; Mathais, Quentin; Ramonda, Véronique; Le Minh, Pierre; Berthelot, Yann; Colas, Clélia; Pottecher, Julien; Gauss, Tobias",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,129

The COVID-19 data (cumulative, confirmed cases and deaths), air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2) and meteorological data (temperature and relative humidity) were collected from January 2020 to August 2020 for all 28 states and the union territory of India during the pandemic. Now, to understand the relationship between air pollutant concentration, meteorological factor, and COVID-19 cases, the nonparametric Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlation were used. The COVID-19 shows a favourable temperature (0.55-0.79) and humidity (0.14-0.52) over the Indian region. The PM2.5 and PM10 gave a strong and negative correlation with COVID-19 cases in the range of 0.64-0.98. Similarly, the NO2 shows a strong and negative correlation in the range of 0.64-0.98. Before the lockdown, the concentration of pollution parameters is high due to the shallow boundary layer height. But after lockdown, the overall reduction was reported up to 33.67% in air quality index (AQI). The background metrological parameters showed a crucial role in the variation of pollutant parameters (SO2, NO2, PM10 and PM2.5) and the COVID-19 infection with the economic aspects. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts derived monthly average wind speed was also plotted. It can see that January and February of 2020 show the least variation of air mass in the range of 1-2 m/s. The highest wind speed was reported during July and August 2020. India's western and southern parts experienced an air mass in the range of 4-8 m/s. The precipitation/wet deposition of atmospheric aerosols further improves the AQI over India. According to a study, the impact of relative humidity among all other metrological parameters is positively correlated with Cases and death.

YKL-40 (chitinase-3-like protein 1), a protein involved in atherogenesis, is upregulated in human calcific aortic valves. We hypothesized that circulating YKL-40 would be elevated and associated with the degree of AS severity and outcome in patients with symptomatic AS. METHODS: Plasma YKL-40 was analyzed in 2 AS populations, one severe AS (n=572) with outcome measures and one with mixed severity (n=67). YKL-40 expression in calcified valves and in an experimental pressure overload model was assessed. RESULTS: We found (1) patients with AS had upregulated circulating YKL-40 compared with healthy controls (median 109 versus 34 ng/mL, P<0.001), but levels were not related to the degree of AS severity. (2) High YKL-40 levels (quartile 4) were associated with long-term (median follow-up 4.7 years) all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.37-2.73], P<0.001). (3) YKL-40 protein expression in human calcific valves co-localized with its putative receptor IL-13r&#945;2 in close proximity to valve interstitial cells. (4) Myocardial YKL-40 increased in experimental pressure overload (6-fold in decompensated versus sham mice). CONCLUSIONS: YKL-40 levels were elevated in AS and associated with mortality but not with other metrics of disease severity including the degree of AS severity. Despite scientific rationale for its role in AS, the clinical utility of circulating YKL-40 as a biomarker is limited.

Four groups of pregnant female rats were used. Group 1 control animals were given 2 ml/kg/day of distilled water. Groups 2, 3, and 4 animals were given oral gavage doses of 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day of ACR respectively immediately pregnancy was confirmed. Mother rats were sacrificed 10 weeks after delivery and litters were sacrificed at 13 weeks. Proteinuria was observed in ACR-treated mother rats and their litters. Serum electrolytes, urea, and creatinine values observed in the treated group were deranged for both the mothers and litters respectively. Disruption of nephrogenesis was observed in the litters of ACR-treated mother compared to the control. The results of the effect of ACR on lipid profile indicated a significant elevation in the LDL, cholesterol, and triglyceride compared to the control. There was significant reduction in the SOD, catalase, GSH, and significant elevation in the C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde. Conclusively, exposure to acrylamide during pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of renal disease in the mother rats and their litters.","Idris, Adeoye Oyewole; Alabi, Quadri Kunle; Ologe, Mary Funmilayo; Oluogun, Waheed Akanni; Akanbi, Marijke Haas Jimoh; Iwalewa, Ezekiel Olugbenga",,,129

Commentary on the 2020 UK guidelines for follicular lymphoma,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations, however, are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and on-going development of a largely ""bottom-up"" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Structural data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data becomes publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.","Yu, Alvin; Pak, Alexander J; He, Peng; Monje-Galvan, Viviana; Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Dommer, Abigail C; Amaro, Rommie E; Voth, Gregory A",Biophys. j,,129

Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.","Bwire, George M.; Paulo, Linda S.",Trop. Med. Health,,129

269524,Clinical activity of pembrolizumab in metastatic prostate cancer with microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) detected by circulating tumor DNA,2020,"COVID-19 is only the latest in a series of global pandemics that began when the world of disease was united by the establishment of intensive connections by sea after 1500. India was a major participant in this process. A pandemic has both direct and indirect effects. Human reactions to mass illness both mitigate and enhance these effects. The networks of transmission are paralleled by networks of private and public information. But aggregated information only becomes available as governmental information systems take shape. This article explains the use of quarantine as emerging from both. It then explains why it was introduced to India only after 1800. It then looks at three great pandemics: cholera, bubonic plague and lethal influenza and governmental and societal responses to each of these. The article analyses the subsidence of pandemics into chronic presences ('background') that nonetheless contributed significantly ill-health, poverty and early death for hundreds of millions. But there is a paradox after Independence. Successful state action in independent India was nevertheless accompanied by the effective collapse of government information systems. This contributed to the massive economic damage from what should have been a minor episode of plague in 1994. The article thus reviews what we know about the effects of the pandemic, epidemic and chronic background phenomena on the economic life of Indian sub-continent through the past 500 years.","Guha, Sumit",Indian Econ Rev,,129

271219,Anterior-segment spectral domain optical coherence tomography in epidermolysis bullosa,2020,"BACKGROUND: In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or coronavirus (COVID-19), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk by covering exposed body parts. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to put PPE on (i.e. donning) or to remove PPE (i.e. doffing), and how to train HCWs to use PPE as instructed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate which type of full-body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of contamination or infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL to 20 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all controlled studies that evaluated the effect of full-body PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training on the same outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included trials. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Earlier versions of this review were published in 2016 and 2019. In this update, we included 24 studies with 2278 participants, of which 14 were randomised controlled trials (RCT), one was a quasi-RCT and nine had a non-randomised design. Eight studies compared types of PPE. Six studies evaluated adapted PPE. Eight studies compared donning and doffing processes and three studies evaluated types of training. Eighteen studies used simulated exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless microbes. In simulation studies, median contamination rates were 25% for the intervention and 67% for the control groups. Evidence for all outcomes is of very low certainty unless otherwise stated because it is based on one or two studies, the indirectness of the evidence in simulation studies and because of risk of bias. Types of PPE The use of a powered, air-purifying respirator with coverall may protect against the risk of contamination better than a N95 mask and gown (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.43) but was more difficult to don (non-compliance: RR 7.5, 95% CI 1.81 to 31.1). In one RCT (59 participants) coveralls were more difficult to doff than isolation gowns (very low-certainty evidence). Gowns may protect better against contamination than aprons (small patches: mean difference (MD) -10.28, 95% CI -14.77 to -5.79). PPE made of more breathable material may lead to a similar number of spots on the trunk (MD 1.60, 95% CI -0.15 to 3.35) compared to more water-repellent material but may have greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5). According to three studies that tested more recently introduced full-body PPE ensembles, there may be no difference in contamination. Modified PPE versus standard PPE The following modifications to PPE design may lead to less contamination compared to standard PPE: sealed gown and glove combination (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.55), a better cover of the gown-wrist interface (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78, low-certainty evidence), added tabs to grab to facilitate doffing of masks (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31). Donning and doffing Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (small patches: MD -5.44, 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45). One-step removal of gloves and gown may lead to less bacterial contamination (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.77) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28) than separate removal. Double-gloving may lead to less viral or bacterial contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.66) but not to less fluorescent contamination (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.28). Additional spoken instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4) and to fewer contamination spots (MD -5, 95% CI -8.08 to -1.92). Extra sanitation of gloves before doffing with quaternary ammonium or bleach may decrease contamination, but not alcohol-based hand rub. Training The use of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7). A video lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70, 95% CI 20.14 to 41.26) than a traditional lecture. Face-to-face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low- to very low-certainty evidence that covering more parts of the body leads to better protection but usually comes at the cost of more difficult donning or doffing and less user comfort. More breathable types of PPE may lead to similar contamination but may have greater user satisfaction. Modifications to PPE design, such as tabs to grab, may decrease the risk of contamination. For donning and doffing procedures, following CDC doffing guidance, a one-step glove and gown removal, double-gloving, spoken instructions during doffing, and using glove disinfection may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than folder-based training. We still need RCTs of training with long-term follow-up. We need simulation studies with more participants to find out which combinations of PPE and which doffing procedure protects best. Consensus on simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. We also need more real-life evidence. Therefore, the use of PPE of HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should be registered and the HCW should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.","Verbeek, Jos H; Rajamaki, Blair; Ijaz, Sharea; Sauni, Riitta; Toomey, Elaine; Blackwood, Bronagh; Tikka, Christina; Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Kilinc Balci, F Selcen",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,129
271317,The Impact of COVID-19 on National Clinical Trials Network Breast Cancer Trials,2021,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is challenging during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the preoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in elective and emergency surgery and to calculate the patient contacts during hospital stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All surgeries defined by the German procedural classification (starting with a 5) from 1 June until 29 November 2020 were retrospectively evaluated regarding the preoperative SARS-CoV­2 nasopharyngeal swab test. The results were then divided in emergency and elective surgeries. To show the personal contacts of the patients in a university hospital, we calculated the patient pathway within the department of urology and urosurgery for April 2020. Therefor we used the electronic patient records. RESULTS: Altogether 7745 surgical procedures in 5985 patients were performed, whereby 39 (0.5%) SARS-CoV­2 tests were positive. 2833 (37%) surgical procedures were emergency cases and 4912 (63%) were elective procedures. 25 (0.9%) of the emergency group and 14 (0.3%) of the elective surgeries had a positive SARS-CoV­2 test. The average number of contacts in the patient room was 12.83 (0-50) and 84.22 (0-249) at the ward level, not counting contacts with the clinic staff. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1% of the preoperative SARS-CoV­2 tests of either emergency or elective surgeries tested positive in the 6 months prior to November 2020. Although the risk of undetected SARS-CoV­2 infection appears to be low in terms of costs and personnel, preoperative screening is useful in high-risk areas to ensure further necessary surgeries, especially concerning cancer patients and to prevent virus spread in a hospital.","Rassweiler-Seyfried, M-C; Miethke, T; Becker, K-P; Siegel, F",Urologe A,,129

METHODS: A total of 3519 nasopharyngeal samples received at nine Spanish clinical microbiology laboratories were processed individually and in pools (342 pools of ten samples and 11 pools of nine samples) according to the existing methodology in place at each centre. RESULTS: We found that 253 pools (2519 samples) were negative and 99 pools (990 samples) were positive; with 241 positive samples (6.85%), our pooling strategy would have saved 2167 PCR tests. For 29 pools (made out of 290 samples), we found discordant results when compared to their correspondent individual samples, as follows: in 22 of 29 pools (28 samples), minor discordances were found; for seven pools (7 samples), we found major discordances. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values for pooling were 97.10% (95% confidence interval (CI), 94.11-98.82), 100%, 100% and 99.79% (95% CI, 99.56-99.90) respectively; accuracy was 99.80% (95% CI, 99.59-99.92), and the kappa concordant coefficient was 0.984. The dilution of samples in our pooling strategy resulted in a median loss of 2.87 (95% CI, 2.46-3.28) cycle threshold (Ct) for E gene, 3.36 (95% CI, 2.89-3.85) Ct for the RdRP gene and 2.99 (95% CI, 2.56-3.43) Ct for the N gene. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high efficiency of pooling strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA testing across different RNA extraction and amplification platforms, with excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values.","de Salazar, Adolfo; Aguilera, Antonio; Trastoy, Rocio; Fuentes, Ana; Alados, Juan Carlos; Causse, Manuel; Galán, Juan Carlos; Moreno, Antonio; Trigo, Matilde; Pérez-Ruiz, Mercedes; Roldán, Carolina; Pena, Maria José; Bernal, Samuel; Serrano-Conde, Esther; Barbeito, Gema; Torres, Eva; Riazzo, Cristina; Cortes-Cuevas, Jose Luis; Chueca, Natalia; Coira, Amparo; Sanchez-Calvo, Juan Manuel; Marfil, Eduardo; Becerra, Federico; Gude, María José; Pallarés, Ángeles; Pérez Del Molino, María Luisa; García, Federico",Clin. microbiol. infect,,129

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status. METHODS: We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9â years and 686 (42.7%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95% CI) 2.681 (1.424-5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03-2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07-2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60-7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95% CI) was 1.79 (1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.","Guan, Wei-Jie; Liang, Wen-Hua; Zhao, Yi; Liang, Heng-Rui; Chen, Zi-Sheng; Li, Yi-Min; Liu, Xiao-Qing; Chen, Ru-Chong; Tang, Chun-Li; Wang, Tao; Ou, Chun-Quan; Li, Li; Chen, Ping-Yan; Sang, Ling; Wang, Wei; Li, Jian-Fu; Li, Cai-Chen; Ou, Li-Min; Cheng, Bo; Xiong, Shan; Ni, Zheng-Yi; Xiang, Jie; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chun-Liang; Peng, Yi-Xiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Ya-Hua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jian-Ming; Liu, Ji-Yang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhi-Jian; Qiu, Shao-Qin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Chang-Jiang; Zhu, Shao-Yong; Cheng, Lin-Ling; Ye, Feng; Li, Shi-Yue; Zheng, Jin-Ping; Zhang, Nuo-Fu; Zhong, Nan-Shan; He, Jian-Xing",Eur. respir. j,,129

275443,"Infection, Infectious Agents and Vascular Disease",2021,"Public health experts emphasize the need for quick, point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection as an effective strategy for controlling virus spread. To this end, many ""antigen"" detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2's nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices' tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work, we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprising four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spike's S1 subunit. The assay's performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of novel antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct < 25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct < 25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being outperformed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results. Schematic representation of sample collection and analysis.

277514,Radyolojik Tanınız Nedir?: Journal of Pediatric Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: The dengue virus is endemic in many low- and middle-income countries. In Burkina Faso, the proportion of fevers that could be due to dengue is growing. In 2013, a dengue epidemic spread there, followed by other seasonal outbreaks. Dengue is often confused with malaria, and health workers are not trained to distinguish between them. Three training videos using different narrative genres were tested with nursing students from two institutions in Ouagadougou: journalistic, dramatic and animated video. The study aimed to determine if video is an effective knowledge transfer tool, if narrative genre plays a role in knowledge acquisition, and which narrative elements are the most appreciated. METHODOLOGY: A mixed method research design was used. The relative effectiveness of the videos was verified through a quasi-experimental quantitative component with a comparison group and post-test measurements. A qualitative component identified participants' perceptions regarding the three videos. Data were drawn from a knowledge test (n = 482), three focus groups with health professionals' students (n = 46), and individual interviews with health professionals (n = 10). Descriptive statistics and single-factor variance analysis were produced. A thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Results showed that all three videos led to significant rates of knowledge improvement when compared with the comparison group (p <0.05): 12.31% for the journalistic video, 20.58% for the dramatic video, and 18.91% for the animated video. The dramatic and animated videos produced a significantly higher increase in knowledge than did the journalistic video (with respectively 8.27% (p = 0.003) and 6.59% (p = 0.029) and can be considered equivalent with a difference of 1.68% (p = 0.895). Thematic analysis also revealed that these two videos were considered to be better knowledge transfer tools. Four key aspects are important to consider for a video to be effective: 1) transmitting information in a narrative form, 2) choosing good communicators, 3) creating a visual instrument that reinforces the message and 4) adapting the message to the local context. CONCLUSIONS: Video has proven to be an effective and appreciated knowledge transfer and training tool for health professionals, but the narrative genre of the videos can influence knowledge acquisition. The production of other videos should be considered for training or updating health professionals and their narrative genre taken into consideration. The actual context of constant circulation of new diseases, such as COVID-19, reaffirms the need to train health professionals.","Hébert, Catherine; Dagenais, Christian; Mc Sween-Cadieux, Esther; Ridde, Valéry",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,129

The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses helped identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, we compared the codon usage bias using global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group CA and between-group CA. We found that the bat RaTG13 virus best matched the overall codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 in orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, while the pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage in membrane gene. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.","Gu, Haogao; Chu, Daniel K W; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",Virus Evol,,129

The COVID-19 pandemic required an unprecedented shutdown in our institutional LDCT program. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer screening and subsequent cancer diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed our prospective institutional LDCT screening database, which began in 2012. In all, 2,153 patients have participated. Monthly mean number of LDCTs were compared between baseline (January 2017 to February 2020) and COVID-19 periods (March 2020 to July 2020). RESULTS: LDCT was suspended on March 13, 2020 and 818 screening visits were cancelled. Phased reopening began on May 5, 2020 and full opening on June 1, 2020. Total monthly mean ± SD LDCTs (146 ± 31 vs 39 ± 40; p < 0.01) and new patient monthly LDCTs (56 ± 14 vs 15 ± 17; p < 0.01) were significantly decreased during the COVID-19 period. New patient monthly LDCTs have remained low despite resuming full operations. Three- and 6-month interval follow-up LDCTs were prioritized and were significantly increased compared with baseline (11 ± 4 vs 30 ± 4; p < 0.01). The ""no-show"" rate was significantly increased from baseline (15% vs 40%; p < 0.04). Most concerning, the percentage of patients with lung nodules suspicious for malignancy (Lung-RADS 4) were significantly increased after screenings resumed (8% vs 29%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 caused significant disruption in lung cancer screening, leading to a decrease in new patients screened and an increased proportion of nodules suspicious for malignancy once screening resumed. Using lung cancer and the LDCT screening program as a model, this early analysis showed the unrecognized consequences related to the pandemic for screening programs and cancer care.","Van Haren, Robert M; Delman, Aaron M; Turner, Kevin M; Waits, Brandy; Hemingway, Mona; Shah, Shimul A; Starnes, Sandra L",J.

282513,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for implementation of Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) at the state level in the United States (US). Based in part on the then concern for H1N1 pandemic, there was a recognized need for additional planning at the state level to maintain health system preparedness and conventional care standards when available resources become scarce. Despite the availability of this framework, in the years since and despite repeated large-scale domestic events, implementation remains mixed. PROBLEM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rejuvenates concern for how health systems can maintain quality care when faced with unrelenting burden. This study seeks to outline which states in the US have developed CSC and which areas of care have thus far been addressed. METHODS: An online search was conducted for all 50 states in 2015 and again in 2020. For states without CSC plans online, state officials were contacted by email and phone. Public protocols were reviewed to assess for operational implementation capabilities, specifically highlighting guidance on ventilator use, burn management, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, pediatric standards, and reliance on influenza planning. RESULTS: Thirty-six states in the US were actively developing (17) or had already developed (19) official CSC guidance. Fourteen states had no publicly acknowledged effort. Eleven of the 17 public plans had updated within five years, with a majority addressing ventilator usage (16/17), influenza planning (14/17), and pediatric care (15/17), but substantially fewer addressing care for burn patients (9/17). CONCLUSION: Many states lacked publicly available guidance on maintaining standards of care during disasters, and many states with specific care guidelines had not sufficiently addressed the full spectrum of hazard to which their health care systems remain vulnerable.","Margus, Colton; Sarin, Ritu R; Molloy, Michael; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehosp Disaster Med,,129

In any instance stimuli-responsive effects on the molecular level are converted into macroscopic movement, whereby generally two different moving behaviors have to be differentiated for polymer-based materials: the shape-memory effect and the shape-changing capability. Basic concepts for the molecular design of suitable polymer architectures for shape-memory polymers as well as tailored programming processes are presented. The thermally-induced shape-memory effect of polymers is described as well as the extension of this concept to other stimuli than heat. Indirect actuation of the thermally-induced effect by IR-irradiation, electric current, humidity or alternating magnetic fields are outlined as well as recent work on light-induced shape-memory polymers. For shape-changing polymers, two basic concepts are presented: shape changes occurring during phase orientation of liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) and the photomechanical effect based on photoisomerization of moieties, such as azo-groups incorporated in suitable polymer systems.","Behl, Marc; Lendlein, Andreas",Soft Matter,,129

METHODS: Children's perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by asking 103 French children, aged 5 to 17 years old, first to draw a coronavirus and then to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a series of 16 images during summer 2020. RESULTS: One hundred three children were included in the study, either during outpatient visits at the hospital (in Marseille and Paris) or through the authors' social network, and were grouped in terms of age, parents' occupation, mode of recruitment, and recollection of having previously seen a representation of a coronavirus. Half of the children drew the coronavirus as circular in shape, and almost all included a crownlike feature. One-third of the drawings had anthropomorphic features. Although the pictorial representations of the virus were fairly accurate overall, the children's interpretations of the crownlike structure were imaginative. The explanations the children gave for their drawings were in some cases surprising. Among the 16 pictures they were shown, the children correctly identified those of SARS-CoV-2, other than the electron micrograph, in more than two-thirds of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Children of all ages, even the youngest, and both sexes had a relatively accurate perception of SARS-CoV-2, as evaluated through their drawings and their ability to recognize it among other pictures. The children's drawings of the coronavirus were colorful and had a less frightening tone than expected in the light of media coverage, suggesting that they had developed coping mechanisms.","Martinerie, Laetitia; Bernoux, Delphine; Giovannin-Chami, Lisa; Fabre, Alexandre",Pediatrics,,129

DESIGN: We used zero-inflated negative binomial mixed effects regressions to model the associations of time since the vaccine clinic ending the week of December 27, 2020 (cohort 1), January 3, 2021 (cohort 2), or January 10, 2021 (cohort 3) controlling for county rate of COVID-19, bed size, urban location, racial and ethnic census, and level of registered nurses with resident cases and deaths of COVID-19 and staff cases of COVID-19. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All 2501 NHs who held a vaccine clinic from the first 17 states to initiate clinics as part of the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) for time in 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after the first vaccine clinic for resident cases and deaths of COVID-19 and staff cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Resident and staff cases trended downward in all three cohorts following the vaccine clinics. Time following the first clinic at 5 and 6 weeks was consistently associated with fewer resident cases (IRR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.54-0.84], IRR: 0.64 [95% CI: 0.48-0.86], respectively); resident deaths (IRR: 0.59 [95% CI: 0.45-0.77], IRR: 0.45 [95% CI: 0.31-0.65], respectively); and staff cases (IRR: 0.64 [95% CI: 0.56-0.73], IRR: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.42-0.62], respectively). Other factors associated with fewer resident and staff cases included facilities with less than 50 certified beds and high nurse staffing per resident day (>0.987). Contrary to prior research, higher Hispanic non-white resident census was associated with fewer resident cases (IRR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.31-0.56) and deaths (IRR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.12-0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 vaccine is associated with decreased spread of SARS-CoV-2 in both residents and staff as well as decreased deaths among residents.","Domi, Marsida; Leitson, Michael; Gifford, David; Nicolaou, Anna; Sreenivas, Kiran; Bishnoi, Courtney",J. am. geriatr. soc,,129

Implementation research methodology can guide the use of evidence-based interventions to re-orient health supply chains towards equity and optimize health outcomes. Using this approach, private and public sector entities can adapt their strategies to focus not just on efficiency and cost savings but ensuring that vulnerable populations have access to essential medications, vaccines, and supplies. Findings can inform regulations that address supply chain inequities at the global level, strengthen existing systems to fill structural gaps at the national level, and address contextual challenges at the subnational level. This methodology can help account for historical practices from prior health initiatives, identify contemporary barriers and facilitators for positive change, and have applicability to the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing vaccine distribution efforts. An implementation research approach is critical in equipping health supply chains with a path for more resilient and equitable distribution of necessary supplies, vaccines, and delivery of care.","Frisch, Miriam F; Scott, Kirstin Woody; Binagwaho, Agnes",Ann Glob Health,,129
285786,The right amount of pressure: Implementing time pressure in online exams,2021,"Effective systems for the analysis of molecular data are fundamental for monitoring the spread of infectious diseases and studying pathogen evolution. The rapid identification of emerging viral strains, and/or genetic variants potentially associated with novel phenotypic features is one of the most important objectives of genomic surveillance of human pathogens and represents one of the first lines of defense for the control of their spread. During the COVID 19 pandemic, several taxonomic frameworks have been proposed for the classification of SARS-Cov-2 isolates. These systems, which are typically based on phylogenetic approaches, represent essential tools for epidemiological studies as well as contributing to the study of the origin of the outbreak. Here we propose an alternative, reproducible and transparent phenetic method to study changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity over time. We suggest that our approach can complement other systems and facilitate the identification of biologically relevant variants in the viral genome. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we present comparative genomic analyses of more than 175,000 genomes. Our method delineates 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, which, based on the distribution of high frequency genetic variants, fall into 4 major macro haplogroups. We highlight biased spatio-temporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic profiles and show that 7 of the 22 haplogroups (and of all of the 4 haplogroup clusters) showed a broad geographic distribution within China by the time the outbreak was widely recognised-suggesting early emergence and widespread cryptic circulation of the virus well before its isolation in January 2020. General patterns of genomic variability are remarkably similar within all major SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, with UTRs consistently exhibiting the greatest variability, with s2m, a conserved secondary structure element of unknown function in the 3' UTR of the viral genome showing evidence of a functional shift. While several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more haplogroups were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall our analyses suggest that the emergence of novel types is unlikely to be driven by convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions, or by selection of recombined strains. In the absence of extensive clinical metadata for most available genome sequences, and in the context of extensive geographic and temporal biases in the sampling, many questions regarding the evolution and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates remain open. However, our data indicate that the approach outlined here can be usefully employed in the identification of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of clinical and epidemiological importance.","Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S; Gissi, Carmela; Pesole, Graziano",Mol. biol. evol,,129

However, cases without subcategorization are often encountered due to limited reproducibility. We evaluated whether the subcategorization of AGC based on the Bethesda terminology can estimate lesion sites. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated cases whose cervical smears were interpreted as AGC and underwent pathological assessment at our institution between June 2009 and September 2017. AGC was subcategorized based on the Bethesda System. Not-otherwise-specified (NOS) was subcategorized into endocervical cells (NOS-EC), endometrial cells (NOS-EM), or glandular cells (NOS-G). Favor neoplastic (FN) was subcategorized into endocervical cells (FN-EC) or glandular cells (FN-G). FN-G was further subcategorized into endometrial cells (FN-EM) or unknown origin (FN-UO). Clinicopathological data were retrieved from the medical records. RESULTS: Of 88 AGC cases, there were 30 NOS-EC (34.1%), 2 NOS-EM (2.3%), 25 FN-EC (28.4%), 22 FN-EM (25.0%), and 9 FN-UO (10.2%). A significantly higher proportion of neoplastic lesions occurred in FN than in NOS (P <.001). The concordance of AGC subclass and lesion site was 88.0%, 70.7%, and 77.3% in FN-EC, FN-G, and FN-EM, respectively. The concordance of FN-EM and lesion site increased to 88.9% in patients aged >50 years. Of nine cases of FN-UO, six experienced nonendometrioid endometrial cancer and extrauterine malignancy. CONCLUSION: Subcategorization of NOS and FN would be useful in estimating neoplastic lesions. Further subcategorization into FN-EC, FN-EM, and FN-UO would similarly be beneficial in estimating the lesion site, especially for small endometrial and extrauterine lesions.","Kawano, Kouichiro; Yamaguchi, Tomohiko; Nasu, Hiroki; Nishio, Shin; Ushijima, Kimio",Diagn. cytopathol,,129

HCWs were challenged with new guidelines and practices to protect themselves from occupational risks. AIM: To determine whether hand hygiene behaviour by real-time measurement was related to the dynamic of the epidemic, and the type of patient being cared for in France. METHODS: This study used an automated hand hygiene recording system to measure HCW hand hygiene on entry to and exit from patient rooms throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation between hand hygiene compliance and COVID-19 epidemiological data was analysed. Analysis of variance was performed to compare compliance rate during the different periods of the epidemic. FINDINGS: HCW hand hygiene rate on room entry decreased over time; on room exit, it increased by 13.73% during the first wave of COVID-19, decreased by 9.87% during the post-lockdown period, then rebounded by 2.82% during the second wave of the epidemic. Hand hygiene during patient care and hand hygiene on room exit had a positive relationship with the local COVID-19 epidemic; conversely, hand hygiene on room entry did not depend on the trend of the epidemic, nor on nursing of COVID-19 patients, and it decreased over time.

METHODS: This is a controlled randomized trial for a multidisciplinary telehealth intervention in Southern Brazil, with social distancing measures. Adults aged 18 years or older with previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The intervention performed was a set of strategies to help patients stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic and included the maintaining of telephone contacts and providing educational materials on issues related to mental health, healthy habits, and diabetes care. The primary outcome was a positive screening for mental health disorders (Self-Reporting Questionnaire) after 16 weeks of intervention. A positive screening for mental health disorders was considered when the survey scored greater than or equal to 7. Secondary outcomes included a positive screening for diabetes-related emotional distress (Problem Areas in Diabetes), eating (Eating Attitudes Test), and sleep disorders (Mini Sleep Questionnaire). Comparisons with &#967;2 tests for dichotomous outcomes, along with the Mann-Whitney U test, was used for between group analyses. RESULTS: A total of 91 individuals agreed to participate (46 intervention group and 45 control group). There were no differences in demographic and clinical data at baseline. After 16 weeks of follow-up, a positive screening for mental health disorders was found in 37.0% of participants in the intervention group vs. 57.8% in the control group (P = 0.04). Diabetes-related emotional distress was found in 21.7% of participants in the intervention group vs. 42.2% in the control group (P = 0.03).

A systematic review was performed to evaluate the evidence supporting different frequencies of routine follow-up. METHODS: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration Library were searched from database inception to July 16, 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies (PCS) evaluating different frequencies of routine follow-up. Citations were assessed by pairs of independent reviewers. Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Cohort Studies. Findings were summarized narratively. RESULTS: The literature search identified 3316 studies, of which 7 (6 RCTs and 1 PCS) were eligible. Study endpoints included; quality of life (QoL; 5 RCTs and 1 PCS), disease free survival (DFS) (1 RCT), overall survival (OS) (1 RCT) and cost-effectiveness (1 RCT). The results showed reduction in follow-up frequency had no adverse effect on: QoL (6 studies, n = 920), DFS (1 trial, n = 472) or OS (1 trial, n = 472), but improved cost-effectiveness (1 trial, n = 472). Four RCTs specifically examined follow-up on-demand versus scheduled follow-up visits and found no statistically significant differences in QoL (n = 544). CONCLUSION: While no evidence-based guidelines suggest that follow-up of EBC patients improves DFS or OS, routinely scheduled in-person assessment is common. RCT data suggests that reduced frequency of follow-up has no adverse effects.","Surujballi, Julian; Shah, Hely; Hutton, Brian; Alzahrani, Mashari; Beltran-Bless, Ana-Alicia; Shorr, Risa; Larocque, Gail; McGee, Sharon; Cole, Katherine; Ibrahim, Mohammed F K; Fernandes, Ricardo; Arnaout, Angel; Stober, Carol; Liu, Michelle; Sienkiewicz, Marta; Saunders, Deanna; Vandermeer, Lisa; Clemons, Mark",Cancer Treat Rev,,129

With the available evidence suggesting that medical students' mental health status is already poorer than that of the general population, with academic stress being a chief predictor, such changes are likely to have a significant effect on these students. This online, cross-sectional study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 on perceived stress levels of medical students, investigate possible contributing and alleviating factors, and produce recommendations for medical schools to implement during future healthcare emergencies. The majority (54.5%) of respondents reported levels of stress ranging from moderate to extreme.

292501,COVID-19 and SARS Coronavirus 2: Antibodies for the Immediate Rescue and Recovery Phase,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic that occurred throughout 2020 has an impact on economic sector. Consumers tend to use online channels to reduce face-to-face contact with marketers or other consumers. On the other hand, the consumer's need to see, touch and feel a product directly is only available in physical stores. This study aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail consumer behavior. This study uses quantitative methods with secondary data sources obtained from several countries including the United States, England, Germany, France, Canada and Latin America. The results show that the shopping trends during the COVID-19 pandemic are webrooming and pure online shopping. Retail sales data in these countries shows that retail sales in physical stores exceed 70% of total retail sales and retail e-commerce sales are less than 30% of total retail sales. This research is expected to be useful for marketers in improving retail marketing strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Sayyida, Sayyida; Hartini, Sri; Gunawan, Sri; Husin, Syarief Nur",Aptisi Transactions On Management (Atm),,129

Discovery of this heritable HLH/SPTCL diathesis has expanded our understanding of a rare and molecularly heterogeneous lymphoma. Furthermore, patients with SPTCL have excellent survival unless they develop HLH. Therefore, through compiling data on SPTCL-related conditions that predispose patients to HLH, we are better able to predict which patients with SPTCL have the greatest risk of mortality. We present the first case of SPTCL with concomitant HLH and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in a patient who was subsequently diagnosed with familial HLH (F-HLH) attributable to a germline STXBP2 splice-site mutation. She had wildtype HAVCR2.

Methods: The study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 deaths, from the first confirmed death on March 17th to May 15th, 2020. These data were collected from an official Brazilian website of the Ministry of Health. The Boltzmann function was applied to a data simulation for each set of data regarding all states of the country. Results: The model data were well-fitted, with R2 values close to 0.999. Up to May 15th, 14,817 COVID-19 deaths have been confirmed in the country. Amazonas has the highest rate of accumulated cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants (321.14), followed by Ceará (161.63). Rio de Janeiro, Roraima, Amazonas, Pará, and Pernambuco are estimated to experience a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases until July 15th. Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina will show lower rates per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Conclusion: We estimate a substantial increase in the rate of cumulative cases in Brazil over the next months. The Boltzmann function proved to be a simple tool for epidemiological forecasting that can assist in the planning of measures to contain COVID-19.","Melo, Géssyca Cavalcante de; Duprat, Irena Penha; Araújo, Karina Conceição Gomes Machado de; Fischer, Frida Marina; Araújo Neto, Renato Américo de",Rev. bras. epidemiol,,129

Methods: PSAP processes were modified over several days including (1) referral of non-ill callers to public health information call centers; (2) algorithms for detection, isolation, or hospitalization of suspected COVID-19 patients; and (3) specialized medical teams sent to the PSAP for triage and case management, including ambulance dispatches or alternative dispositions. Call volumes, ambulance dispatches, and response intervals for the 2 weeks after announcement were compared to 2017-2019 data and the week before. Results: For 2 weeks following outbreak announcement, the primary-level PSAP (police/fire/EMS) averaged 56% more daily calls compared to prior years and recorded 9281 (106% increase) on Day 4, averaging â¼400/hour. The secondary-level (EMS) PSAP recorded an analogous 63% increase with 3863 calls (â¼161/hour; 264% increase) on Day 3. The COVID-19 response team processed the more complex cases (n = 5361), averaging 432 ± 110 daily (â¼one-fifth of EMS calls). Although community COVID-19 cases increased exponentially, ambulance response intervals and dispatches (averaging 1120 ± 46 daily) were successfully contained, particularly compared with the week before (1174 ± 40; P = 0.02). Conclusion: With sudden escalating EMS call volumes, rapid reorganization of dispatch operations using tailored algorithms and specially assigned personnel can protect EMS system resources by optimizing patient dispositions, controlling ambulance allocations and mitigating hospital impact. Prudent population-based disaster planning should strongly consider pre-establishing similar highly coordinated medical taskforce contingencies.","Marrazzo, Francesco; Spina, Stefano; Pepe, Paul E; D039,; Ambrosio, Annapaola; Bernasconi, Filippo; Manzoni, Paola; Graci, Carmela; Frigerio, Cristina; Sacchi, Marco; Stucchi, Riccardo; Teruzzi, Mario; Baraldi, Sara; Lovisari, Federica; Langer, Thomas; Sforza, Alessandra; Migliari, Maurizio; Sechi, Giuseppe; Sangalli, Fabio; Fumagalli, Roberto",,,129

300592,Letter to Editor,2021,"BACKGROUND: A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in February 2020 and was controlled at the end of March 2020 in Daegu, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Korea. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Daegu. METHODS: In collaboration with Daegu Metropolitan City and Korean Center for Diseases Control, we conducted a retrospective, multicenter cohort study. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including viral RNA detection, were obtained from the electronic medical records and cohort database and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariate and multi-variable logistic regression methods and Cox regression model and performed Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine the risk factors associated with the 28-day mortality and release from isolation among the patients. RESULTS: In this study, 7,057 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 (total cohort) who had been diagnosed from February 18 to July 10, 2020 were included. Of the total cohort, 5,467 were asymptomatic to mild patients (77.4%) (asymptomatic 30.6% and mild 46.8%), 985 moderate (14.0%), 380 severe (5.4%), and 225 critical (3.2%). The mortality of the patients was 2.5% (179/7,057). The Cox regression hazard model for the patients with available clinical information (core cohort) (n = 2,254) showed the risk factors for 28-day mortality: age > 70 (hazard ratio [HR], 4.219, P = 0.002), need for O2 supply at admission (HR, 2.995; P = 0.001), fever (> 37.5°C) (HR, 2.808; P = 0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.119; P = 0.008), cancer (HR, 3.043; P = 0.011), dementia (HR, 5.252; P = 0.008), neurological disease (HR, 2.084; P = 0.039), heart failure (HR, 3.234; P = 0.012), and hypertension (HR, 2.160; P = 0.017). The median duration for release from isolation was 33 days (interquartile range, 24.0-46.0) in survivors. The Cox proportional hazard model for the long duration of isolation included severity, age > 70, and dementia. CONCLUSION: Overall, asymptomatic to mild patients were approximately 77% of the total cohort (asymptomatic, 30.6%). The case fatality rate was 2.5%. Risk factors, including older age, need for O2 supply, dementia, and neurological disorder at admission, could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","Kim, Shin Woo; Kim, Seung Mee; Kim, Yu Kyung; Kim, Jong Yeon; Lee, Yu Mi; Kim, Bong Ok; Hwangbo, Suhyun; Park, Taesung",J Korean Med Sci,,129

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly associated with a cytokine storm. Objectives: To elucidate serum levels of TNF-&#945; and soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNFR1) in patients with severe and mild COVID-19 disease as determinants of disease severity. Methods: We determined serum TNF-&#945; and sTNFR1 concentrations in 46 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (17 patients with severe disease within the intensive care unit [ICU] and 29 non-severe, non-ICU patients) and 15 healthy controls upon admission using ELISA. Subjects were recruited between March-May 2020 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital Tehran, Iran. Results: Serum levels of sTNFRI were significantly higher in ICU patients (P<0.0001) and non-ICU patients (P=0.0342) compared with healthy subjects. Serum sTNFR1 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients (P<0.0001). Serum TNF-&#945; levels were greater in ICU and non-ICU patients than in the healthy subjects group (p<0.0001). The sTNFRI concentration in ICU (r=0.79, p=0.0002) and non-ICU (r=0.42, p=0.02) patients positively correlated with age although serum sTNFRI levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in older healthy subjects. The sTNFRI concentration in ICU patients negatively correlated with ESR. Conclusions: The study demonstrates higher sTNFRI in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease and this be a biomarker of disease severity and mortality. Future studies should examine whether lower levels of systemic sTNFR1 at admission may indicate a better disease outcome.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Tabarsi, Payam; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Dalil Roofchayee, Neda; Dezfuli, Neda K; Hashemian, Seyed MohammadReza; Moniri, Afshin; Marjani, Majid; Malekmohammad, Majid; Mansouri, Davood; Varahram, Mohammad; Folkerts, Gert; Adcock, Ian M",Front Immunol,,129
300955,Audio Interview: What the U.S. Response to Covid-19 Looks Like Today,2020,"Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes best recognized because of their ability to control activation of caspase-1, which in turn regulates the maturation of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta). IL-1beta was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, capable of inducing local and systemic inflammation as well as a fever response reaction in response to infection or injury. Excessive production of IL-1beta is related to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are characterized by excessive inflammatory response. For SARS, there is no correlation between viral load and worsening symptoms. However, there is no specific medicine which is available to treat the disease. As an important part of medical practice, TCM showed an obvious therapeutic effect in SARS-CoV-infected patients. In this article, we summarize the current applications of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Herein, we also offer an insight into the underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of TCM, as well as introduce new naturally occurring compounds with anti-coronavirus activity, in order to provide a new and potential drug development strategy for the treatment of COVID-19.","Li, P.; Hu, S.; Qian, C.; Yao, Y.; Li, L.

302046,European ad-hoc consensus statement on gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy,2020,"External debt levels will be unprecedented in 2021—in this last decade of action to secure the sustainable development goals (SDGs)—and mostly in distress for low-income-developing countries (LIDC) and least developed countries (LDCs). However, increased levels of debt distress were on the horizon even before the dire economic effects of COVID-19. These high levels of external debt and a decreasing inability to access international capital were already expected to impede the advancement of the SDGs;the situation has become far graver because of the Great Lockdown and efforts to stymie transmission of COVID-19. The international community faces perhaps its greatest challenge: it must alleviate poor countries debt burdens exacerbated by COVID-19 to effectively combat its spread, but there is no consensus as to how to achieve this. Though there is no historical parallel to the current debt crisis, the heavily indebted poor country initiative (HIPC) suggests debt relief alone will be insufficient to keep the SDGs on track. While the challenges that arise with regards to the scaling up of debt swap initiatives—learned from previous efforts—are formidable, this article provides critical reflection as to their effective operationalization within the current context: responding to the economic and social devastation wrought by COVID-19 and keeping the SDGs on track. It shows how debt swaps can be effectively deployed as part of a revitalized global partnership for development, for the advancement of the SDGs and broader debt sustainability. © 2021 The Authors.

A major sensor of DNA that triggers the innate immune response is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which produces the second messenger cGAMP. cGAMP activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which activates a signaling cascade leading to the production of type I interferons and other immune mediators. Recent research has demonstrated an expanding role of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway in many physiological and pathological processes, including host defense against microbial infections, anti-tumor immunity, cellular senescence, autophagy, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Biochemical and structural studies have elucidated the mechanism of signal transduction in the cGAS pathway at the atomic resolution. This review focuses on the structural and mechanistic insights into the roles of cGAS and STING in immunity and diseases revealed by these recent studies.","Zhang, Xuewu; Bai, Xiao-Chen; Chen, Zhijian J",Immunity,,129

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between March 20th and March 31st, 2020 at Cochin hospital, Paris France. Thoracic CT examinations of all patients referred for another reason than a suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed. CT images were analyzed by a chest radiologist to confirm the presence of findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and quantify disease extent. Clinical and biological data (C-reactive protein serum level [CRP] and white blood cell count) of patients with CT findings suggestive for COVID-19 pneumonia were retrieved from the electronic medical chart. RESULTS: During the study period, among 205 diagnostic CT examinations, six examinations (6/205, 3%) in 6 different patients (4 men, 2 women; median age, 57 years) revealed images highly suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. The final diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR. Three inpatients were suspected of extra thoracic infection whereas three outpatients were either fully asymptomatic or presented with fatigue only. All had increased CRP serum level and lymphopenia. Disease extent on CT was mild to moderate in 5/6 patients (83%) and severe in 1/6 patient (17%). CONCLUSION: Cumulative incidence of fortuitous diagnosis if COVID-19 pneumonia did not exceed 3% during the highest pandemic phase and was predominantly associated with limited lung involvement.","Neveu, S; Saab, I; Dangeard, S; Bennani, S; Tordjman, M; Chassagnon, G; Revel, M-P",Diagn Interv Imaging,,129

METHODS: Three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to 20th January 2021 were searched for relevant literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess quality bias, and STATA was employed to pool the effect size by a random effects model. Additionally, potential publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, with a total of 23,944 COVID-19 patients, for quantitative analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of frailty was 51% (95% CI: 44-59%). Patients with frailty who were infected with COVID-19 had an increased risk of mortality compared to those without frailty, and the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) were 1.99 (95% CI: 1.66-2.38) and 2.48 (95% CI: 1.78-3.46), respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis based on population showed that the pooled ORs for hospitalized patients in eight studies and nursing home residents in two studies were 2.62 (95% CI: 1.68-4.07) and 2.09 (95% CI: 1.40-3.11), respectively. Subgroup analysis using the frailty assessment tool indicated that this association still existed when using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) (assessed in 6 studies, pooled OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.52-5.45; assessed in 5 studies, pooled HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.66-2.38) and other frailty tools (assessed in 4 studies, pooled OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.81-2.16). In addition, these significant positive associations still existed in the subgroup analysis based on study design and geographic region. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that frailty is an independent predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Thus, frailty could be a prognostic factor for clinicians to stratify high-risk groups and remind doctors and nurses to perform early screening and corresponding interventions urgently needed to reduce mortality rates in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Jiao, Jing; Cao, Jing; Huo, Xiao-Peng; Zhu, Chen; Wu, Xin-Juan; Xie, Xiao-Hua",BMC Geriatr,,129

307738,[Current understanding of the role of age-related hypogonadism in the development of cardiovascular diseases],2021,"BACKGROUND: A cluster of pneumonia cases were reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life. We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020. METHODS: Respondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status. We also investigated respondents' behavior changes. Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained. More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%). Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities. About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia. Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status. Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities. At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection. The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%). CONCLUSIONS: We need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities. Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups. The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.","Liu, Xi; Luo, Wen-Tao; Li, Ying; Li, Chun-Na; Hong, Zhong-Si; Chen, Hui-Li; Xiao, Fei; Xia, Jin-Yu",Infect Dis Poverty,,129
309221,Aberrant Expression of Syndecan-1 in Cervical Cancers,2020,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the nosocomial infection rate worldwide has been reported high. It is urgent to figure out an affordable way to monitor and alarm nosocomial infection. Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) concentration can reflect the ventilation performance and crowdedness, so CO2 sensors were placed in Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital's fever clinic and emergency department where the nosocomial infection risk was high. Patients' medical records were extracted to figure out their timelines and whereabouts. Based on these, site-specific CO2 concentration thresholds were calculated by the dilution equation and sites' risk ratios were determined to evaluate ventilation performance. CO2 concentration successfully revealed that the expiratory tracer was poorly diluted in the mechanically ventilated inner spaces, compared to naturally ventilated outer spaces, among all of the monitoring sites that COVID-19 patients visited. Sufficient ventilation, personal protection, and disinfection measures led to no nosocomial infection in this hospital. The actual outdoor airflow rate per person (Qc ) during the COVID-19 patients' presence was estimated for reference using equilibrium analysis. During the stay of single COVID-19 patient wearing a mask, the minimum Qc value was 15-18 L/(s·person). When the patient was given throat swab sampling, the minimum Qc value was 21 L/(s·person). The Qc value reached 36-42 L/(s·person) thanks to window-inducted natural ventilation, when two COVID-19 patients wearing masks shared the same space with other patients or healthcare workers. The CO2 concentration monitoring system proved to be effective in assessing nosocomial infection risk by reflecting real-time dilution of patients' exhalation.","Lu, Yiran; Li, Yifan; Zhou, Hao; Lin, Jinlan; Zheng, Zhuozhao; Xu, Huji; Lin, Borong; Lin, Minggui; Liu, Li",Indoor air,,129

In this study, in relation to the pandemic, psychological distress, sleep quality and affecting factors in adults were examined. METHODS: Using the convenience sampling method, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and questionnaires to determine psychological distress levels and sociodemographic characteristics were distributed online to 405 participants. RESULTS: The mean psychological distress score of the participants was 34.55 ± 8.07, while their mean sleep quality score was 6.39 ± 3.31. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.1%. The psychological distress scores were higher among the men than the women, married participants than single ones, those with children than those without children and those who were employed than those who were not. The sleep quality of the single participants and the participants with low education levels was poorer. The sleep quality of those who left work in the pandemic period was poorer than those who were working from home/office and those who were already not employed before the pandemic. The sleep quality of those not working in the field of health was better than healthcare professionals and those not working at all. The scores for psychological distress were positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with sleep quality levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the psychological distress and sleep quality of adults. It is recommended for healthcare professionals to take the necessary psychosocial precautions.","Duran, Songül; Erkin, Özüm",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,129

Yet, given the deteriorating state of the global environment they are but one element of international environmental governance.

Rather the international community must move on to the implementation of existing binding and non-binding rules and principles. While the UNGA continues to play an important role in the context of sustainable development and the Agenda 2030 process and is, indeed a stable platform for international cooperation on environmental issues, it seems that the time for comprehensive global environmental conferences may have come to an end, unless more innovative mechanisms for the implementation of international environmental law and policy are brought forward.","Matz-Lück, Nele Christiansen Liv",Environmental Policy and Law,,129

The app prioritizes the protection of users' privacy from a variety of parties (eg, other users, potential attackers, and public authorities), enhances the capacity to balance the current load of excessive pressure on health care systems (eg, local triage of exposure risk and reduction of in-person hospital visits), increases the speed of responses to the pandemic (eg, automated recording of close contact based on proximity), and reduces operation errors and population mobility. The peer-to-peer framework of COCOA is intended to provide the public with dynamic and credible updates on the COVID-19 pandemic without sacrificing the privacy of their information. However, cautions must be exercised to address critical concerns, such as the rate of participation and delays in data sharing. The results of a simulation imply that the participation rate in Japan needs to be close 90% to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.","Nakamoto, Ichiro; Jiang, Ming; Zhang, Jilin; Zhuang, Weiqing; Guo, Yan; Jin, Ming-Hui; Huang, Yi; Tang, Kuotai",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,129

This study aimed to assess the commercial whey products (CWP) whey protein isolate (WPI), galacto-oligosaccharide-whey protein concentrate (GOS-W) and glycomacropeptide (GMP) for their potential to improve intestinal health in vitro using HT29-MTX intestinal goblet and Caco-2 epithelial cells. Results from HT29-MTX culture showed that WPI mitigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at a higher extent compared to GOS-W or GMP. However, GMP downregulated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR-4 inflammatory pathway with the highest potency compared to the other CWP. Biomarkers of epithelial integrity assessed on both cell lines showed tight junction proteins claudin-1, claudin-3, occludin (OCC), and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) upregulation by GMP in HT29-MTX (1.33-1.93-fold of control) and in Caco-2 cells (1.56-2.09-fold of control). All CWP increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in TNF-&#945; challenged Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture monolayer (p < 0.05), but only GMP was similar to the positive control TGF-ß1, known for its role in promoting epithelial barrier function. The TNF-&#945;-induced co-culture monolayer permeability was prevented at similar levels by all CWP (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CWP may be used as functional food ingredients to protect against intestinal disorders with emphasis on the GMP enhanced anti-inflammatory and intestinal barrier function properties. Further in vivo studies are guaranteed to validate these findings.","Arbizu, Shirley; Chew, Boon; Mertens-Talcott, Susanne U; Noratto, Giuliana",Food funct,,129
312385,Inhibition of aquaporins as a potential adjunct to breast cancer cryotherapy,2021,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as one pathogenetic trigger in severe COVID-19 cases and therefore well-described animal models to understand the influence of NETs in COVID-19 pathogenesis are needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes infection and interstitial pneumonia of varying severity in humans and COVID-19 models. Pulmonary as well as peripheral vascular lesions represent a severe, sometimes fatal, disease complication of unknown pathogenesis in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are known to contribute to vessel inflammation or endothelial damage, have also been shown as potential driver of COVID-19 in humans. Though most studies in animal models describe the pulmonary lesions characterized by interstitial inflammation, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, edema, fibrin formation and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, detailed pathological description of vascular lesions or NETs in COVID-19 animal models are lacking so far. Here we report different types of pulmonary vascular lesions in the golden Syrian hamster model of COVID-19. Vascular lesions included endothelialitis and vasculitis at 3 and 6 days post infection (dpi), and were almost nearly resolved at 14 dpi. Importantly, virus antigen was present in pulmonary lesions, but lacking in vascular alterations. In good correlation to these data, NETs were detected in the lungs of infected animals at 3 and 6 dpi. Hence, the Syrian hamster seems to represent a useful model to further investigate the role of vascular lesions and NETs in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Becker, Kathrin; Beythien, Georg; de Buhr, Nicole; Stanelle-Bertram, Stephanie; Tuku, Berfin; Kouassi, Nancy Mounogou; Beck, Sebastian; Zickler, Martin; Allnoch, Lisa; Gabriel, Gülsah; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang",Front Immunol,,129

Here we show the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a single dose of adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector-based vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in non-human primates. Fifty-two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were immunized with Ad26 vectors that encoded S variants or sham control, and then challenged with SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal and intratracheal routes9,10. The optimal Ad26 vaccine induced robust neutralizing antibody responses and provided complete or near-complete protection in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Titres of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies correlated with protective efficacy, suggesting an immune correlate of protection. These data demonstrate robust single-shot vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human primates.

The treatment outcomes of drugs for neuropathic pain, physical therapy or epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are still unclear, especially in elderly patients. There is currently no consensus on pain management. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the short-term outcomes of epidural steroid injections among elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study. The sample consisted of 44 patients aged 65 or older who underwent epidural steroid injections secondary to lumbar spinal stenosis between 2014 and 2016 at a single center. Data were collected using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Istanbul Low Back Pain Disability Index (ILBPDI) before and at 3-month follow-up visit. RESULTS: Participants had lower mean scale scores at all times after ESI administration than before. Four patients (9.1%) needed additional injections while two (4.5%) needed operation. No minor or major ESI-related complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Epidural steroid injections are an effective nonsurgical option for pain relief and improvement of physical function in elderly patients.

320752,Sleep characteristics and risk of ovarian cancer among postmenopausal women,2020,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as novel biological targets are hardly applied in diagnostic and treatment of diseases, as they are difficult to be accurately detected and regulated. Here, we demonstrated a modular DNA intelligent machine named three-dimensional tweezers (TD-tweezers) to image and regulate miRNAs in living cells simultaneously. Fluorophore or miRNA inhibitors are introduced as detecting or regulating parts to construct different types of TD-tweezers, and the conformational state of TD-tweezers is controlled by the target miRNAs. The TD-tweezers exhibit excellent sensitivity, specificity, stability, and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo, and their function of regulating miRNAs was confirmed by the up-regulated expression of downstream genes and proteins. Moreover, the TD-tweezers have been tested in whole blood, preliminarily verifying their clinical application potential. This design provides a multifunctional platform that can achieve efficient detection and regulation of targets within living cells and promote the development of DNA intelligent machines.","Zhou, Lin; Gao, Mingxuan; Fu, Weiling; Wang, Yunxia; Luo, Dan; Chang, Kai; Chen, Ming",Sci.

Here, we introduce an ultrasensitive chip-based antigen test with single protein biomarker sensitivity for the differentiated detection of both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A antigens in nasopharyngeal swab samples at diagnostically relevant concentrations. The single-antigen assay is enabled by synthesizing a brightly fluorescent reporter probe, which is incorporated into a bead-based solid-phase extraction assay centered on an antibody sandwich protocol for the capture of target antigens. After optimization of the probe release for detection using ultraviolet light, the full assay is validated with both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A antigens from clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples (PCR-negative spiked with target antigens). Spectrally multiplexed detection of both targets is implemented by multispot excitation on a multimode interference waveguide platform, and detection at 30 ng/mL with single-antigen sensitivity is reported.","Stambaugh, Alexandra; Parks, Joshua W; Stott, Matthew A; Meena, Gopikrishnan G; Hawkins, Aaron R; Schmidt, Holger",Proc.

The use of the anti-interleukin-6 receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) has been proposed in this hyperinflammatory phase, although supporting evidence is limited. We retrospectively analyzed 88 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that received at least one dose of intravenous TCZ in our institution between 16 and 27 March 2020. Clinical status from day 0 (first TCZ dose) through day 14 was assessed by a 6-point ordinal scale. The primary outcome was clinical improvement (hospital discharge and/or a decrease of &#8805;2 points on the 6-point scale) by day 7. Secondary outcomes included clinical improvement by day 14 and dynamics of vital signs and laboratory values. Rates of clinical improvement by days 7 and 14 were 44.3% (39/88) and 73.9% (65/88). Previous or concomitant receipt of subcutaneous interferon-ß (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06-0.94; P = .041) and serum lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L at day 0 (aOR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.06-0.99; P = .048) were negatively associated with clinical improvement by day 7. All-cause mortality was 6.8% (6/88). Body temperature and respiratory and cardiac rates significantly decreased by day 1 compared to day 0. Lymphocyte count and pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/FiO2 ratio increased by days 3 and 5, whereas C-reactive protein levels dropped by day 2. There were no TCZ-attributable adverse events.

322180,Case 26-2020: A Woman with Altered Mental Status and Left-Sided Weakness,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Chondrosarcomas are extremely rare, locally invasive, and potentially mortal malignant cartilaginous tumors. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival rates and trends of skull base chondrosarcomas (SBC). METHODS: Data from SBC patients between 1975 and 2017 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The age-adjusted incidence rates (AAR) were calculated for the overall cases and based on gender, age, race, and histology. Furthermore, the relative survival rates for one, three, and five years, and the rates stratified to the aforementioned selected variables were computed. Besides, we conducted a joint point regression analysis to calculate the annual percent change (APC) and its associated standard error (SE) for AAR and mortality. RESULTS: The AAR rate of SBC was 0.019 per 100,000. Higher AAR rates were observed in patients who were in the 65-74-year-age-group, females, Caucasians, and had none mesenchymal subtype. The relative one-year, three-year and five-year-survival rates were 99.58 %, 93.67 %, and 89.10 %, respectively. Lower survival rates were noted in patients who were males, African Americans, and had a mesenchymal subtype. The trend analysis has shown a significant yearly increase (Pâ¯<â¯0.001) in AAR of SBC (APCâ¯±â¯SEâ¯=â¯0.0005 %±0.0001), along with a significant yearly decline in mortality rates (APCâ¯±â¯SE= -0.0202 %±0.0029). CONCLUSION: Despite the increase in AAR over time, there has been a significant decline in mortality rates over time, which might have been due to the advancement of treatment modalities, improvement in diagnostic imaging, and modification in disease grading.","Dibas, Mahmoud; Doheim, Mohamed Fahmy; Ghozy, Sherief; Ros, Mohamed Hassan; El-Helw, Ghidaa Osama; Reda, Abdullah",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,129

323100,COVID-19: General recommendations and specifications for the patient with advanced lung cancer. literature review,2020,"INTRODUCTION: During the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, hospitals developed contingency plans that transformed and reorganized the hospital activity. One of the measures was to restrict access to family members of hospitalized patients. The presence of the patient's family is considered an alternative to physical restraint. The aim of this study is to compare the use of physical restraint in hospitalized patients in an acute care hospital during the previous period of the pandemic of COVID-19 with the post-confinement period with hospitals being still closed to family. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We made an observational study that compares the prevalence of physical restraint in an acute care hospital during the previous period to the alarm state (February 2020) with the second period, when visits where restricted (May 2020). From the clinical history of the patients with physical restraint we collected the following variables: sex, diagnostic, hospital admission unit, reason for using physical restraint, localization, length, type of material, registration in the medical record, information given to the family, alternatives to the physical restraint and injuries related to the physical restraint. RESULTS: We evaluated 690 patients: 388 during the previous period and 320 during the second period. From all patients, 29 needed physical restraint. The use of physical restraint went from 8 (2%) to 21 (7%) (p=0.003). In the second period, a not statistically significant increase in continuous physical restraint was identified compared to the first period. CONCLUSIONS: The physical restraint prevalence has been superior during the second period in which families were not present with the hospitalized patients.","Font, R; Quintana, S; Monistrol, O",J. healthc. qual. res,,129

325854,Telerehabilitation for patients with breast cancer through the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades the respiratory system, causing acute and sometimes severe pulmonary symptoms, but turned out to also act multisystematically with substantial impact on the brain. A growing number of studies suggests a diverse spectrum of neurological manifestations. To investigate the spectrum of symptoms, we here describe the neurological manifestations and complications of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been hospitalized at the RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany. METHODS: Between March and September 2020, we evaluated common symptoms, clinical characteristics, laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis), radiological, and electroencephalography (EEG) data from 53 patients admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) to screen for cognitive impairment, when feasible. We compared critically ill and non-critically ill patients categorized according to the presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Major clinical neurological features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were coordination deficits (74%), cognitive impairment (61.5%), paresis (47%), abnormal reflex status (45%), sensory abnormalities (45%), general muscle weakness and pain (32%), hyposmia (26%), and headache (21%). Patients with ARDS were more severely affected than non-ADRS patients. 29.6% of patients with ARDS presented with subarachnoid bleedings, and 11.1% showed ischemic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cognitive deficits mainly affected executive functions, attention, language, and delayed memory recall. We obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture in nine of the 53 patients, none of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous findings, our results provide evidence for a range of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. 26% of patients reported hyposmia, emphasizing the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can enter the olfactory bulb. It can therefore be speculated that neurological manifestations may be caused by direct invasion of the virus in the CNS; however, PCR did not reveal positive intrathecal SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we hypothesize it is more likely that the para-infectious severe pro-inflammatory impact of COVID-19 is responsible for the neurological deficits including cognitive impairment. Future studies with comprehensive longitudinal assessment of neurological deficits are required to determine potential long-term complications of COVID-19.","Ermis, Ummehan; Rust, Marcus Immanuel; Bungenberg, Julia; Costa, Ana; Dreher, Michael; Balfanz, Paul; Marx, Gernot; Wiesmann, Martin; Reetz, Kathrin; Tauber, Simone C; Schulz, Jörg B",Neurol Res Pract,,129

The results were discussed with a Primary Care physicians clinical group and the results were synthesized using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: A good quality systematic review was found that includes articles with a high risk of bias. And 8 EC launched that will produce results beyond May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Although the conclusions of the systematic review generate a low confidence in the results, and the clinical variables that show benefit are intermediate variables, the side effects are acceptable and could be minimized with the use of QT lengthening risk tools, so it is could make a weak recommendation in favor of the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in patients with mild-moderate stage COVID-19.","Mayayo-Vicente, S; Rodriguez Salvanés, F; Gallego-Arenas, A; Sánchez-Gómez, L M; Ruiz-López, M; Sierra García, B; Jurado-López, A; Arriola-Bolado, P; Cervera Cano, M; Novella-Arribas, B",Semergen,,129
326154,Diagnosis for COVID-19: current status and future prospects,2021,"The 2019 novel SARS-CoV2 disease causing COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the world, and those with pain conditions may be at heightened risk for these negative consequences. Given COVID-19 limitations, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders, pain is likely largely going untreated, leading to greater pain and associated consequences. Mental health symptoms, which have been found to be elevated due to COVID-19, may contribute to elevated pain experience, but little work has examined how COVID-19-specific mental health factors may be associated with pain. Therefore, the current study examined (1) how COVID-19-specific psychological factors and general mental health symptoms differ between those with pain and without, and (2) among those with pain, which psychological factors were most strongly associated with pain experience. Results from a national (U.S. based) online sample of 174 adults (42.5% female, M age = 37.80 years, SD = 11.30, 88 with pain) collected between April and May 2020 indicated that, compared to those individuals reporting no pain, those with pain reported significantly higher values on all variables. Additionally, COVID-19 fear and sleep problems were associated with pain intensity, and for pain-related interference, fear, sleep problems, and depression were significantly associated. These results highlight the potential importance of COVID-19-specific psychological factors in pain experience.","Rogers, Andrew H; Garey, Lorra; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cogn Behav Ther,,129

This study was carried out to determine the SMA Dopplervelocimetry variables in term newborns, relating them to gestation and to fetal growth. METHODS: Fifty-eight mothers and their 59 neonates (one twin gestation) whose deliveries occurred at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein were included. Toshiba SSH 140 equipment with color duplex-Dopplersystem of high-resolution was used, evaluating the SMA in its origim, determining caliber, systolic velocity, diastolic velocity, mean velocity and resistance and pulsatility indexes. RESULTS: It was observed that the caliber of superior mesenteric artery was 1.94 mm; the mean of systolic velocity was 86.47 cm/s ; the mean of diastolic velocity was 17.66 cm/s and mean velocity 36.93 .The indexes of resistance and pulsatility were 0.79 and 1.91 ( DP 0.46 and 9.54) respectively. The SMA caliber correlated positively with birth weight and negatively with cephalic perimeter. The velocities and indexes are related to the anthropometric data of the newborn, to hours after birth, to minutes of fasting and to the mother's weight at the end of gestation. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the SMA Dopplervelocimetric variables are related to the maternal and newborns' variables; possible factors involving this association are discussed. Characteristics such as newborn gender and mother's weight at the beginning of gestation did not alter results.","Solange Badaró-Marques, Carmen; Duailibi Casanova, Lucy; Aranha, Carlos; A M Segre, Conceição",Acta cir. bras.,,129

331219,"Comment on ""ApoE e4e4 Genotype and Mortality With COVID-19 in UK Biobank"" by Kuo et al",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumopathy is characterized by a complex clinical picture and heterogeneous pathological lesions, both involving alveolar and vascular components. The severity and distribution of morphological lesions associated with SARS-CoV-2 and how they relate to clinical, laboratory, and radiological data have not yet been studied systematically. The main goals of the present study were to objectively identify pathological phenotypes and factors that, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, may influence their occurrence. Lungs from 26 patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory failure were comprehensively analysed. Robust machine learning techniques were implemented to obtain a global pathological score to distinguish phenotypes with prevalent vascular or alveolar injury. The score was then analysed to assess its possible correlation with clinical, laboratory, radiological, and tissue viral data. Furthermore, an exploratory random forest algorithm was developed to identify the most discriminative clinical characteristics at hospital admission that might predict pathological phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2. Vascular injury phenotype was observed in most cases being consistently present as pure form or in combination with alveolar injury. Phenotypes with more severe alveolar injury showed significantly more frequent tracheal intubation; longer invasive mechanical ventilation, illness duration, intensive care unit or hospital ward stay; and lower tissue viral quantity (p < 0.001). Furthermore, in this phenotype, superimposed infections, tumours, and aspiration pneumonia were also more frequent (p < 0.001). Random forest algorithm identified some clinical features at admission (body mass index, white blood cells, D-dimer, lymphocyte and platelet counts, fever, respiratory rate, and PaCO2 ) to stratify patients into different clinical clusters and potential pathological phenotypes (a web-app for score assessment has also been developed; https://r-ubesp.dctv.unipd.it/shiny/AVI-Score/).

331948,Correction to: Cognitive Impairment in SLE: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is challenging healthcare systems worldwide, none more so than critical and intensive care settings. Significant attention has been paid to the capacity of Australian intensive care unit (ICUs) to respond to a COVID-19 surge, particularly in relation to beds, ventilators, staffing, personal protective equipment, and unparalleled increase in deaths in ICUs associated with COVID-19 seen internationally. While death is not uncommon in critical care, the international experience demonstrates that restrictions to family presence at the end of life result in significant distress for families and clinicians. As a result, the Australian College of Critical Care Nurses and the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control supported the development of a position statement to provide critical care nurses with specific guidance and recommendations for practice for this emerging priority area. Where possible, position statements are founded on high-quality evidence. However, the short time period since the first recognition of a cluster of pneumonia-like cases in China in January, 2020, meant that an integrative approach was required to expedite timely development of this position statement in preparation for a COVID-19 surge in Australia. This position statement is intended to provide practical guidance to critical care nurses in facilitating next-of-kin presence for patients dying from COVID-19 in the ICU.","Bloomer, Melissa J; Bouchoucha, Stéphane",,,129

In this review, we aim to narrate the current state of the literature on telehealth applied to migraine care. First, telemedicine in the context of non-acute headache management has been shown to produce non-inferior patient outcomes when compared to traditional face-to-face appointments. The assignment of patients to telehealth appointments should be made after referring more urgent cases to dedicated in-person clinics. During the virtual appointment, physicians can ask their patients about the ""3 F's"" in order to perform a thorough assessment of their headaches: frequency of headache days, frequency of acute medication usage and functional impairment. Clinical assessment scores that have been studied and deemed feasible for telemedicine, safe and efficient include the HIT-6, VAS and MIDAS scores. Although MIDAS was found to be redundant and inadequate to use on a daily basis, we suggest that it can be useful in periodic remote follow-up appointments. Additionally, several mobile health apps have been studied including Migraine Buddy, Migraine Coach and Migraine Monitor. All of these are appropriate for use in telemedicine when combined with an adequate trial period with Migraine Buddy being rated the highest, as it captures the most detailed clinical picture. High satisfaction rates have been reported for virtual headache management which were shown to be equal to in-person consults. These are based on patients' perceived increase in convenience due to avoided travel time, less disruption of their daily routine and feeling more comfortable in the environment of their choice. Despite this, limitations such as technological knowledge, access to videoconferencing modalities and having a more impersonal consultation with the physician may hinder some patients from adopting this service.","Noutsios, C.

Thus, we analyzed peripheral blood monocytes from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and found that these cells show signs of altered bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction, had a reduced basal and maximal respiration, reduced spare respiratory capacity, and decreased proton leak. Basal extracellular acidification rate was also diminished, suggesting reduced capability to perform aerobic glycolysis. Although COVID-19 monocytes had a reduced ability to perform oxidative burst, they were still capable of producing TNF and IFN-Î³ in vitro. A significantly high amount of monocytes had depolarized mitochondria and abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure. A redistribution of monocyte subsets, with a significant expansion of intermediate/pro-inflammatory cells, and high amounts of immature monocytes were found, along with a concomitant compression of classical monocytes, and an increased expression of inhibitory checkpoints like PD-1/PD-L1. High plasma levels of several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including GM-CSF, IL-18, CCL2, CXCL10, and osteopontin, finally confirm the importance of monocytes in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","Gibellini, Lara; De Biasi, Sara; Paolini, Annamaria; Borella, Rebecca; Boraldi, Federica; Mattioli, Marco; Lo Tartaro, Domenico; Fidanza, Lucia; Caro-Maldonado, Alfredo; Meschiari, Marianna; Iadisernia, Vittorio; Bacca, Erica; Riva, Giovanni; Cicchetti, Luca; Quaglino, Daniela; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Busani, Stefano; Girardis, Massimo; Mussini, Cristina; Cossarizza, Andrea",EMBO Mol Med,,129

The outcomes are retrospectively reported. The primary endpoint is the fatality rate of COVID-19. The secondary endpoints are the hospital and ICU admission rates. Endpoints were compared with the official Spanish rates for the elderly. The mean age of our population was 85 and 48% were over 80 years old. No hospital admissions, deaths, nor adverse drug effects were reported in our patient population. By the end of June, 100% of the residents had positive serology for COVID-19. Although clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy of both drugs in the treatment of COVID-19, this analysis suggests that primary care diagnosis and treatment with antihistamines, plus azithromycin in selected cases, may treat COVID-19 and prevent progression to severe disease in elderly patients.","Morán Blanco, Juan Ignacio; Alvarenga Bonilla, Judith A; Homma, Sakae; Suzuki, Kazuo; Fremont-Smith, Philip; Villar Gómez de Las Heras, Karina",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,,129
336915,Pentoxifylline and complicated COVID-19: A pathophysiologically based treatment proposal,2020,"Institutions of higher education face the difficult challenge of balancing student privacy with public health concerns presented by the COVID‐19 pandemic The following guidance addresses the most common questions institutions are facing today: Q If a student tests positive for COVID‐19, what information can university officials share within the institution and with the greater community? A According to the most recent advice from the Department of Education, the general rule is that an institution may disclose that a student has tested positive for COVID‐19 as long as it doesn't directly or indirectly identify the specific student The context for this limitation is that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information contained in a student's educational record, such as their health status, unless the situation involves an exception to the general restriction against public disclosure or when the parent or eligible student has provided written consent Institutions need to ensure that the information they provide cannot be combined with other available information that would reveal the identity of the student For instance, it is best to disclose only that a student in a particular residence hall tested positive, rather than state that a female student on the second floor of the residence hall tested positive Depending on the size of the residence hall, any additional details the institution provides could be used by other individuals to identify that student Therefore, higher ed administrators should manage each situation on a case‐by‐case basis Nonidentifying information may be provided to other students or parents, or to local health agencies that are tracking the disease Q What can an institution disclose if the student who tested positive for COVID‐19 was in very close contact with other students who may benefit from being notified? A Under the FERPA exception for health or safety emergency situations, educational institutions may disclose PII, such as health status contained in student education records, without prior written consent if sharing that information is necessary to protect the health or safety of a student or another individual (20 U S C § 1232g(b)(1)(I);34 C F R §§ 99 31(a)(10) and 99 36) Whether to release such PII is determined on a case‐by‐case basis after considering the totality of the circumstances The institution must be able to determine that an “articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or another individual” exists and that specific parties need the PII to ensure the health or safety of a student or another individual (34 C F R § 99 36(c)) Based on the information available at that time, an institution must be able to explain the threat and the significance of that threat For example, if a student‐wrestler tests positive, then other wrestlers who were in close physical contact with that student likely need to know so they can seek testing and/or medical care for themselves Institutions making such disclosures should reveal the minimum amount of information necessary In most cases, institutions should keep this information limited to the identity of the student testing positive and the window of time when others could have been exposed And such information should only be disclosed to parties who need to know for health and safety reasons, such as public health officials, law enforcement, trained medical personnel, and parents of at‐risk students (See 34 C F R § 99 36 and the Department of Education's guidance at bit ly/3nktdF9 ) The institution must also make notations in the affected student's educational record regarding the basis for the disclosure and the parties who received the information (See 34 C F R § 99 32(a)(5) ) Q When do institutions have a duty to disclose information for mandatory health‐reporting purposes? A States have different requirements for educational institutions regarding their obligations to report information about communicable diseases to public health agencies For example, in Washington state, schools are legally required to notify local public health authorities of suspected or confirmed cases of selected diseases or conditions, including COVID‐19 It's worth noting that FERPA, not the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, applies to student health records In fact, HIPAA's Privacy Rule expressly excludes information that is considered an education record under FERPA","Javanshir, Leila Rice David",Dean and Provost,,129
337170,Audio Interview: Approaches to Covid-19 Vaccines and Antivirals,2020,"Background: : Literature data suggests that age, gender and body mass index (BMI) could be associated with difference in immune responses to vaccines. The first goal of the study was to analyze the antibody titre seven days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in a group of 248 healthcare workers (HCWs). The second goal was to analyze how antibody titre changes in correlation with age, gender, BMI and hypertension. Methods: : An immunogenicity evaluation was carried out among HCWs vaccinated at the Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri (IFO), Rome, Italy. All HCWs were asked to be vaccinated by the Italian national vaccine campaign at the beginning of 2021. 260 vaccinated HCWs were enrolled in the study. All eligible participants were assigned to receive the priming dose in two weeks' time and the booster dose exactly 21 days thereafter. Blood and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at baseline and 7 days after second dose of vaccine. Quantitative measurements of IgG antibodies against S1/S2 antigens of SARS-CoV-2 were performed with a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay. Presence of SARS-Cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swab was determined by commercial RT-PCR testing. Findings: : 248 HWCs were analyzed, 158 women (63.7%) and 90 men (36.3%). After the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, 99.5% of participants developed a humoral immune response. The geometric mean concentration of antibodies among the vaccinated subjects after booster dose (285.9 AU/mL 95% CI: 249.5-327.7) was higher than that of human convalescent sera (39.4 AU/mL, 95% CI: 33.1-46.9), with p<0.0001. Multivariate linear regression analysis of AU/mL by age, gender and BMI multivariate was performed by the inclusion of covariates. This analysis demonstrated that age (p<0.0001) and gender (p = 0.038) are statistically associated with differences in antibody response after vaccination, whereas BMI and hypertension have no statistically significant association (p = 0.078 and p = 0.52 respectively).","Pellini, Raul; Venuti, Aldo; Pimpinelli, Fulvia; Abril, Elva; Blandino, Giovanni; Campo, Flaminia; Conti, Laura; De Virgilio, Armando; De Marco, Federico; Di Domenico, Enea Gino; Di Bella, Ornella; Di Martino, Simona; Ensoli, Fabrizio; Giannarelli, Diana; Mandoj, Chiara; Manciocco, Valentina; Marchesi, Paolo; Mazzola, Francesco; Moretto, Silvia; Petruzzi, Gerardo; Petrone, Fabrizio; Pichi, Barbara; Pontone, Martina; Zocchi, Jacopo; Vidiri, Antonello; Vujovic, Branka; Piaggio, Giulia; Morrone, Aldo; Ciliberto, Gennaro",EClinicalMedicine,,129

We aimed to clarify the characteristics of radiological and functional lung sequelae of COVID-19 patients described in follow-up period. METHOD: PubMed and EMBASE were searched on January 20th, 2021 to investigate characteristics of lung sequelae in COVID-19 patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) and pulmonary function test (PFT) data were collected and analyzed using one-group meta-analysis. RESULTS: Our search identified 15 eligible studies with follow-up period in a range of 1-6 months. A total of 3066 discharged patients were included in these studies. Among them, 1232 and 1359 patients were evaluated by chest CT and PFT, respectively. The approximate follow-up timing on average was 90 days after either symptom onset or hospital discharge. The frequency of residual CT abnormalities after hospital discharge was 55.7% (95% confidential interval (CI) 41.2-70.1, I2 = 96.2%). The most frequent chest CT abnormality was ground glass opacity in 44.1% (95% CI 30.5-57.8, I2 = 96.2%), followed by parenchymal band or fibrous stripe in 33.9% (95% CI 18.4-49.4, I2 = 95.0%). The frequency of abnormal pulmonary function test was 44.3% (95% CI 32.2-56.4, I2 = 82.1%), and impaired diffusion capacity was the most frequently observed finding in 34.8% (95% CI 25.8-43.8, I2 = 91.5%). Restrictive and obstructive patterns were observed in 16.4% (95% CI 8.9-23.9, I2 = 89.8%) and 7.7% (95% CI 4.2-11.2, I2 = 62.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggested that about half of the patients with COVID-19 still had residual abnormalities on chest CT and PFT at about 3 months. Further studies with longer follow-up term are warranted.","So, Matsuo; Kabata, Hiroki; Fukunaga, Koichi; Takagi, Hisato; Kuno, Toshiki",BMC Pulm Med,,129
338402,Novel classifications for systemic sclerosis: challenging historical subsets to unlock new doors,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has become an urgent issue in every country. Based on recent reports, the most severely ill patients present with coagulopathy, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like massive intravascular clot formation is frequently seen in this cohort. Therefore, coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19. The clinical presentation of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is organ dysfunction primarily, whereas hemorrhagic events are less frequent. Changes in hemostatic biomarkers represented by increase in D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products indicate the essence of coagulopathy is massive fibrin formation. In comparison with bacterial-sepsis-associated coagulopathy/DIC, prolongation of prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decrease in antithrombin activity is less frequent and thrombocytopenia is relatively uncommon in COVID-19. The mechanisms of the coagulopathy are not fully elucidated, however. It is speculated that the dysregulated immune responses orchestrated by inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte cell death, hypoxia, and endothelial damage are involved. Bleeding tendency is uncommon, but the incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 and the adequacy of current recommendations regarding standard venous thromboembolic dosing are uncertain.","Iba, Toshiaki; Levy, Jerrold H; Levi, Marcel; Thachil, Jecko",J. thromb. haemost,,129

340096,Eligibility for Liver Transplantation in Patients with Perihilar Cholangiocarcinoma,2020,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting increasingly large number of people worldwide, posing significant stress to the health care systems. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical in screening of infected patients and breaking the person-to-person transmission. Chest X-ray (CXR) based computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 using deep learning becomes a promising solution to this end. However, the diverse and various radiographic features of COVID-19 make it challenging, especially when considering each CXR scan typically only generates one single image. Data scarcity is another issue since collecting large-scale medical CXR data set could be difficult at present. Therefore, how to extract more informative and relevant features from the limited samples available becomes essential. To address these issues, unlike traditional methods processing each CXR image from a single view, this paper proposes triple-view convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 diagnosis with CXR images. Specifically, the proposed networks extract individual features from three views of each CXR image, i.e., the left lung view, the right lung view and the overall view, in three streams and then integrate them for joint diagnosis. The proposed network structure respects the anatomical structure of human lungs and is well aligned with clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in practice. In addition, the labeling of the views does not require experts' domain knowledge, which is needed by many existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in the more challenging three class classification task, and admits wide generality and high flexibility.","Zhang, Jianjia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14091v1.pdf,129
340434,"MS, pregnancy and COVID-19",2020,"Background: The goal of this study was to empirically examine the degree to which alcohol use and drinking motives changed during the first month of the pandemic and to examine individual differences associated with such changes. Methods: A U.S. nationwide survey of 500 adults was conducted; data from 201 individuals (Mage=38.98, SD=12.04, 52.2% female, 76.1% White) who endorsed current alcohol use were included in this study. Results: Paired-samples t-tests indicated that there was a significant decrease in drinking quantity [t(199)=3.74, p<.001], but no change in drinking frequency [t(198)=0.19, p=.849] overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. There were significant decreases in enhancement [t(201)=4.55, p<.001], social [t(201)=9.39, p<.001] and conformity [t(201)=3.58, p<.001] motives, but a significant increase in coping motives [t(201)=-3.71, p<.001]. Regression analyses showed that increases in enhancement [ß=0.46, p<.001] and coping [ß=0.27, p=.004] motives were significantly related to increases in drinking frequency, and increases in coping motives [ß=0.32, p=.002] were related to increases in drinking quantity. Riskier drinking prior to the pandemic was significantly related to greater increase in drinking quantity in the first month of the U.S. pandemic [ß=0.31, p<.001]. Conclusion: Results of this study provide initial support that changes in drinking motives were important predictors for changes in alcohol use during the first month of the U.S. pandemic. Contrary to anecdotal reports, drinking decreased overall during the first month of the U.S. pandemic; however, those with existing risky patterns of drinking prior to the start of the U.S. pandemic were at greatest risk for drinking escalation during this time.","Prestigiacomo, Christiana J; Liu, Melissa A; Plawecki, Martin H; Cyders, Melissa A",Subst Use Misuse,,129
340528,Minimize impact of pandemic on radiation oncology department: Experience from a moderate-sized regional cancer program in the battle against COVID-19 virus,2020,"Recently, the lung infection due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) affected a large human group worldwide and the assessment of the infection rate in the lung is essential for treatment planning. This research aims to propose a Machine-Learning-System (MLS) to detect the COVID-19 infection using the CT scan Slices (CTS). This MLS implements a sequence of methods, such as multi-thresholding, image separation using threshold filter, feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion and classification. The initial part implements the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA+KE) thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures. Finally, a two-class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID-19 group. In this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with linear kernel (SVM) are implemented and the classification task is performed using various feature vectors. The experimental outcome of the SVM with Fused-Feature-Vector (FFV) helped to attain a detection accuracy of 89.80%.","Kadry, Seifedine; Rajinikanth, Venkatesan; Rho, Seungmin; Raja, Nadaradjane Sri Madhava; Rao, Vaddi Seshagiri; Thanaraj, Krishnan Palani",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13122v1.pdf,129

Qualitative data may contextualise existing knowledge surrounding perceptions of mHealth among AA women as part of formative work for designing a physical activity application (app). METHODS: A convenience sample of 16 AA women completed an informatics survey prior to participating in focus groups exploring their use of mobile technology and health apps. Survey responses provided frequency data, while iterative transcript analysis of focus groups identified themes. RESULTS: The majority of participants (mean age=62.1 years, SD=6.6) felt comfortable using a tablet/smartphone (75.0%). Most (68.8%) reported using health-related apps, primarily focused on physical activity and nutrition. Focus groups revealed four overarching concepts, including (1) user attachment, (2) technology adoption, (3) potential facilitators and (4) potential barriers. Important features which may serve as facilitators or barriers to future adoption of a mobile app for an mHealth intervention include individual app tailoring and software concerns, respectively. DISCUSSION: Thematic analysis revealed high user attachment to smartphones and described participants' process for adopting new mHealth technology. CONCLUSION: Early engagement of target end users as a part of a broader co-design and community-based participatory research process for developing mHealth technologies may be useful for sustained adoption of these tools in future mHealth behavioural interventions.","Claudel, Sophie E; Ceasar, Joniqua N; Andrews, Marcus R; El-Toukhy, Sherine; Farmer, Nicole; Middleton, Kimberly R; Sabado-Liwag, Melanie; Mitchell, Valerie M; Tamura, Kosuke; Brooks, Alyssa T; Wallen, Gwenyth R; Powell-Wiley, Tiffany M",,,129

While the final cost on human lives and world economy remains unpredictable, the timely identification of a suitable treatment and the development of an effective vaccine remain a significant challenge and will still require time. The aim of this study is to show that the global collective effort to control the coronavirus pandemic (Covid 19) should also consider alternative therapeutic methods, and national health systems should quickly endorse the validity of proven homeopathic treatments in this war against coronavirus disease. Subject and methods: With the help of mathematics, we will show that the fundamental therapeutic law on which homeopathy is founded can be proved. Results: The mathematical proof of the law of similarity justifies perfectly the use of ultra - high diluted succussed solution products as major tools in the daily practices of homeopathy.

METHODS: We performed a web-based survey, including 35 questions on the responders and their endoscopic practice, from March 23rd to March 27th 2020, sent to the 3300 French gastroenterologists practicing endoscopy. RESULTS: 694 (21%) gastrointestinal endoscopists provided analyzable data. 29.4% (204/694) were involved in the management of COVID-19 patients outside the endoscopy departments, and 98.7% (685/694) of the endoscopic procedures were canceled. 12.8% (89/694) of the gastroenterologists reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 infection, and a positive PCR was recorded in 12/197 (6.1%) vs. 3/497 (0.6%) patients in the high vs. low prevalence areas, p<0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a major reduction in the volume of gastrointestinal endoscopies performed in France in March 2020. The prolonged limited access to gastrointestinal endoscopy could lead to a delay in the management of patients with gastrointestinal cancers.","Belle, Arthur; Barret, Maximilien; Bernardini, David; Tarrerias, Anne-Laure; Bories, Erwan; Costil, Vianna; Denis, Bernard; Gincul, Rodica; Karsenti, David; Koch, Stephane; Laquière, Arthur; Lecomte, Thierry; Quentin, Vincent; Rahmi, Gabriel; Robaszkiewicz, Michel; Vaillant, Emmanuel; Vanbiervliet, Geoffroy; Vienne, Ariane; Dumeirain, Franck; Gronier, Olivier; Chaussade, Stanislas",Endoscopy,,129
348598,Effect of Ergothioneine on 7-Ketocholesterol-Induced Endothelial Injury,2020,"PURPOSE: During adolescence, PCOS features are supposed to be in evolution. Because of this, the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescence is often unclear and few studies have compared adolescent and adult PCOS phenotype distribution and features. The aim is to compare phenotypes in adolescents and young adults with PCOS. METHODS: 109 girls aged from 13 to 19 years were retrospectively studied. All patients had a gynecological age > 2 years. 63 patients were adolescents (3-5 years beyond menarche) while 46 patients were young adults (6-9 years beyond menarche). Diagnosis of different PCOS phenotypes (A, B, C, D) was made according to the Rotterdam criteria. Clinical data (menstrual cycles, BMI, presence of hirsutism), androgen circulating levels (total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) and ovarian morphology by ultrasound were assessed. RESULTS: 109 patients presented PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria. Phenotype A was by far the most common phenotype (73.4%) followed by phenotype B (21.1%). Only few patients had phenotype C (4.6%) or phenotype D (0.9%). When patients were divided in two groups (adolescent and young adult patients), no significant difference in prevalence and features of the different phenotypes was observed. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of adolescent and young adult women with PCOS, the progression of age does not change the prevalence and the features of main PCOS phenotypes. It suggests that the Rotterdam criteria might be used also in adolescents, at least in those with 2 or more years of gynecological age, for the diagnosis of PCOS.","Fruzzetti, F; Baldari, F; Palla, G; Fidecicchi, T; Carmina, E",J. endocrinol. invest,,129
348933,Comment on: Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis,2020,"Cardio- and neurotoxicity of amphetamines play an important role in worsening morbidity, making the initial evaluation of the patient's status a potentially lifesaving action. The current study hypothesized that the S-100ß serum level could predict the severity of acute amphetamine toxicity and the in-hospital outcome. The current study is a prospective cohort study conducted on 77 patients diagnosed with acute amphetamine exposure and referred to Aseer Poison Control Center, Saudi Arabia. The patients admitted to ICU showed significantly higher serum levels of S-100ß in comparison to those not admitted (p < 0.05). Moreover, the S-100ß level was significantly elevated among patients with prolonged QTc intervals. Receiver-operating characteristic curve of S-100ß serum level as an in-hospital outcome predictor showed that at a cutoff value > 0.430 ug/L, the sensitivity of S-100ß serum level as severity predictor was 100%, and the specificity was 74.1%. In conclusion, the current study revealed that the S-100ß serum level could be used as an outcome predictor in hospital admission cases due to toxic amphetamine exposure and offers an idea about the cardiac and neuronal involvement. This can help select patients who will benefit most from ICU admission and early management and assess the severity of cases in settings where GC-MS is not available.","Sharif, Asmaa F; Elsheikh, Eman; Al-Asmari, Abdullah Z; Gameel, Dina El",Cardiovasc. toxicol.

349437,Calcification in thymomas can predict invasiveness to surrounding organs,2021,The World Health Organization has issued international instructions for certification and classification (coding) of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as cause of death. Central to these instructions is the selection of the underlying cause of death for a public health preventive purpose. This article focuses on two rules for this selection: (1) that a death due to COVID-19 should be counted independently of pre-existing conditions that are suspected of triggering a severe course of COVID-19 and (2) that COVID-19 should not be considered as due to anything else. The article argues that observance of the first rule may not always lead to an optimal selection from a preventive point of view and that in the future the ascertainment of an animal source of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) would make it possible to reconceptualize 'COVID-19' and create a zoonotic classification code by means of which a factor of a greater preventive value could be selected than what is currently possible.,"Lindahl, B I B",Hist Philos Life Sci,,129

352135,COVID-19 pandemic - an African perspective,2020,"Feline lungworms such as Aerulostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior are snail-borne pathogens causing respiratory disease in domestic cats. Paratenic hosts such as rodents and reptiles have also been implicated in the epidemiology of these parasites. Although A. abstrusus has been recognized for a long time as the most prevalent lungworm among cats worldwide, T. brevior is of major concern in kittens. Bearing in mind that disease due to T. brevior occurs mainly in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age, the diagnosis of this parasite in two kittens presenting severe respiratory disease from the garden of one of the authors inspired us to investigate the potential routes of transmission for T. brevior in domestic cats. Of the three queens (A, B and C) that delivered kittens (nâ¯=â¯8), only cat A was positive for T. brevior, presenting her two kittens severe respiratory clinical signs, which lead to the exitus in one of them, 18 days of age. In addition, three kittens, the offspring of queen B, turned to be positive at the coprological examination after suckling from queen A, whereas those from queen C (that suckled only on their own mother) remained negative. A series of coprological, histological and molecular tests were conducted to confirm the presence of T. brevior in the patients as well as in the other cats cohabiting the same garden. Adult nematodes were retrieved from the trachea and bronchi of the dead kitten (kitten 1A), and larvae at the histology of the lung and liver parenchyma associated with bronco pneumonitis and lymphocytic pericholangitis, respectively. Cornu aspersum (nâ¯=â¯60), Eobania vermiculata (nâ¯=â¯30) snails (intermediate hosts) as well as lizards and rats (potential paratenic hosts) were collected from the same garden and processed through tissue digestion and molecular detection. Troglostrongylus brevior larvae were recovered through tissue digestion from two C. aspersum (3.33 %) and it was confirmed by PCR-sequencing approach, which also detected T. brevior DNA in the liver and lungs of one rat and in the coelomatic cavity of one gecko lizard. During the COVID-19 lockdown, when scientists spent more time at home, we grasp the opportunity to decipher T. brevior biology and ecology starting in a small ecological niche, such as the garden of our house. Data herein presented led us to suggest: i) the transmammary transmission of T. brevior in domestic cats; ii) the role of intermediate and paratenic hosts (including reptiles) in the epidemiology of the infection which they transmit; as well as iii) the importance of observational parasitology in studying any event that certainly occurs in small ecological niches, as it could be in our home gardens.","Bezerra-Santos, Marcos Antônio; Mendoza-Roldan, Jairo Alfonso; Abramo, Francesca; Lia, Riccardo Paolo; Tarallo, Viviana Domenica; Salant, Harold; Brianti, Emanuele; Baneth, Gad; Otranto, Domenico",Vet Parasitol,,129

While studies report that approximately 5-15% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation, a substantially higher number need non-invasive ventilation and are subject to prolonged hospitalizations, with long periods of immobility and isolation. The purpose of this study is to describe the post-infectious sequelae of severe viral illness and the post-acute complications of intensive care treatments in critically ill patients who have recovered from severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of adult patients initially hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection, who recovered and were transferred to a general medical ward or discharged home between March 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020, dates inclusive, after an intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) admission in a designated COVID-19 hospital in the United Arab Emirates. Demographic data, underlying comorbidities, treatment, complications, and outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 71 patients transferred out of ICU (n = 38, 54%) and HDU (n = 33, 46%), mean age was 48 years (SD, 9.95); 96% men; 54% under age 50. Mean ICU stay was 12.4 days (SD, 5.29), HDU stay was 13.4 days (SD, 4.53). Pre-existing conditions were not significantly associated with developing post-acute complications (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41, 2.93, p = 1.00). Fifty nine percent of patients had complications; myopathy, swallowing impairments, and pressure ulcers were most common. Delirium and confusion were diagnosed in 18% (n = 13); all were admitted to the ICU and required mechanical ventilation. Of note, of all patients studied, 59.2% (n = 42/71) had at least 1 complication, 32.4% (n = 23) had at least 2 complications, and 19.7% (n = 14) suffered 3 or more sequelae. Complications were significantly more common in ICU patients (n = 33/38, 87%), compared to HDU patients (n = 9/33, 27%) (OR 17.6, 95% CI 5.23, 59.21, p <0.05). CONCLUSION: In a subset of critically ill patients who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection, there was considerable short-term post-infectious and post-acute disability.

354749,A blood supply chain network with backup facilities considering blood groups and expiration date: A real-world application,2021,"The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic required a dramatic change in social practices, including distancing from social settings, to limit its spread. While social capital has considerable potential in facilitating the adoption of these norms, it also comes with considerable limitations that potentially undermine its effectiveness. We draw upon recently released mobility data from Google, network data from Facebook, and demographic data from the 2018 American Community Survey to determine how both organizational and networked measures of social capital relate to different forms of distancing. In addition, we employ geographically weighted regression to identify how these relationships vary across the nation. Findings indicate that while both forms of social capital can positively relate to distancing, the impacts are spatially inconsistent and, in some locations, social capital can discourage distancing. In sum, more policy efforts are needed to address not only low-social capital, but also unhelpful social capital.","Gibbons, Joseph Yang Tse-Chuan Oren Eyal",Spatial demography,,129

The novel coronavirus is a new outbreak virus that is susceptible to all people. Up to now, the disease has been widely spread in the world and poses a great threat to public health. In this review, the genomic features, key proteins, host infection and replication of coronaviruses and novel coronaviruses are reviewed in order to provide theoretical basis for the study of the pathogenic mechanism of virus infection on host cells and to provide basic support for the development of specific antiviral drugs.","He, Lihong Liu Wenjun Li Jing",Shengwu Gongcheng Xuebao,,129
355251,A83 Impact of Telehealth on Medication Adherence in Gastroenterology Chronic Disease Management,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is causing an enormous psychological burden for most people. This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15 037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that there have been changes in mental health and health status at an individual level since the outbreak of COVID-19. In order to maintain mental health, the observed predictors should be addressed.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Steinbach, Jasmin; Schweda, Adam; Beckord, Jil; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Musche, Venja; Dörrie, Nora; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria",J Prim Care Community Health,,129
356456,Autonomic dyshomeostasis in patients with diabetes mellitus during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Telepsychiatry enables patients to establish or maintain psychiatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the factors influencing patients' initial decisions to participate in telepsychiatry in the midst of a public health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This paper seeks to examine factors influencing patients' initial decisions to accept or decline telepsychiatry immediately after the stay-at-home order in Michigan, their initial choice of virtual care modality (video or telephone), and their anticipated participation in telepsychiatry once clinics reopen for in-person visits. METHODS: Between June and August 2020, we conducted a telephone-based survey using a questionnaire comprising 14 quantitative and two qualitative items as part of a quality improvement initiative. We targeted patients who had an in-person appointment date that fell in the first few weeks following the Michigan governor's stay-at-home order, necessitating conversion to virtual visits or deferment of in-person care. We used descriptive statistics to report individual survey responses and assess the association between chosen visit type and patient characteristics and future participation in telepsychiatry using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 244 patients whose original in-person appointments were scheduled within the first 3 weeks of the stay-at-home order in Michigan completed the telephone survey. The majority of the 244 respondents (n=202, 82.8%) initially chose to receive psychiatric care through video visits, while 13.5% (n=33) chose telephone visits and 1.2% (n=3) decided to postpone care until in-person visit availability. Patient age correlated with chosen visit type (P<.001; 95% CI 0.02-0.06). Patients aged &#8805;44 years were more likely than patients aged 0-44 years to opt for telephone visits (relative risk reduction [RRR] 1.2; 95% CI 1.06-1.35). Patient sex (P=.99), race (P=.06), type of insurance (P=.08), and number of previous visits to the clinic (P=.63) were not statistically relevant. Approximately half of the respondents (114/244, 46.7%) stated they were likely to continue with telepsychiatry even after in-person visits were made available. Telephone visit users were less likely than video visit users to anticipate future participation in telepsychiatry (RRR 1.08; 95% CI 0.97-1.2). Overall, virtual visits met or exceeded expectations for the majority of users. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, patient age correlates with the choice of virtual visit type, with older adults more likely to choose telephone visits over video visits. Understanding challenges to patient-facing technologies can help advance health equity and guide best practices for engaging patients and families through telehealth.","Severe, Jennifer; Tang, Ruiqi; Horbatch, Faith; Onishchenko, Regina; Naini, Vidisha; Blazek, Mary Carol",JMIR Form Res,,129

359915,Q&A: Ned Sharpless on COVID-19 and Cancer Prevention,2021,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed at investigating the expression of Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) PGM5-AS1 and its facilitating effects on proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer by sponging miR-100-5p. PATIENTS AND METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expressions of PGM5-AS1 and SMAD4 in human colorectal cancer tissues and cells. CCK-8 assay was performed to evaluate the SW403 cells proliferation and transwell assay was performed to evaluate the SW403 cells migration. The correlation between miR-100-5p and PGM5-AS1 was detected by statistical analysis. Bioinformatics prediction and Luciferase assay were performed to explore the interaction and binding site of PGM5-AS1 and miR-100-5p, miR-100-5p and SMAD4, respectively. RESULTS: We found that both PGM5-AS1 and SMAD4 were downregulated in human colorectal cancer tissues and cells. qRT-PCR and CCK-8 assay showed that PGM5-AS1 expression is associated with the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. Transwell assay showed that PGM5-AS1 regulated the migration ability of colorectal cancer cells. The bioinformatics prediction and Luciferase assay demonstrated that by sponging miR-100-5p, PGM5-AS1 can serve as a molecular sponge to further regulate the expression of SMAD4. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that lncRNA-PGM5-AS1 was low expressed in human colorectal cancer cells, which could promote tumor proliferation, migration and invasion by serving as a molecular sponge and by modulating the inhibitory effect of miR-100-5p on tumor suppressor gene SMAD4.","Zhou, B; Yi, F; Chen, Y; Li, C-H; Cheng, Y-S; Yang, K",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,129
360626,Identification of a novel subgroup of endometrial cancer patients with loss of thyroid hormone receptor beta expression and improved survival,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the limitations of the current health care workforce. As health care workers across the globe have been overwhelmed by the crisis, oversight entities and training programs have sought to loosen regulations to support ongoing care. Notably, however, workforce challenges preceded the current crisis. Now may be the time to address these underlying workforce challenges and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic with a stronger health care workforce.Building upon historical exemplars in the context of the current crisis, the authors of this Perspective provide a roadmap to rapidly and safely increase the workforce for COVID-19 and beyond. The authors recommend the following: (1) a comprehensive approach to guide health care workforce development, (2) streamlining transitions to the next level of practice, (3) reciprocity among state licensing boards or national licensure, (4) payment reform to support a strengthened health care workforce, and (5) efforts by employers to ensure the ongoing safety and competence of the bolstered workforce. These steps require urgent collaboration among stakeholders commensurate with the acuity of the pandemic. Implemented together, these actions could address not only the novel challenges presented by COVID-19 but also the underlying inadequacies of the health care workforce that must be remedied to create a healthier society.","Dow, Alan W; DiPiro, Joseph T; Giddens, Jean; Buckley, Peter; Santen, Sally A",Acad Med,,129

PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence on the prevalence, levels, and durability of detectable antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confer natural immunity. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization global literature database, and Covid19reviews.org from 1 January through 15 December 2020, limited to peer-reviewed publications available in English. STUDY SELECTION: Primary studies characterizing the prevalence, levels, and duration of antibodies in adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); reinfection incidence; and unintended consequences of antibody testing. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators sequentially extracted study data and rated quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Moderate-strength evidence suggests that most adults develop detectable levels of IgM and IgG antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and that IgG levels peak approximately 25 days after symptom onset and may remain detectable for at least 120 days. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that IgM levels peak at approximately 20 days and then decline. Low-strength evidence suggests that most adults generate neutralizing antibodies, which may persist for several months like IgG. Low-strength evidence also suggests that older age, greater disease severity, and presence of symptoms may be associated with higher antibody levels. Some adults do not develop antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection for reasons that are unclear. LIMITATIONS: Most studies were small and had methodological limitations; studies used immunoassays of variable accuracy. CONCLUSION: Most adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR develop antibodies. Levels of IgM peak early in the disease course and then decline, whereas IgG peaks later and may remain detectable for at least 120 days.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: 1,095 general practitioners' (GPs) and 960 specialist practices in Germany. SUBJECTS: 2.45 million older patients aged 65 or older. METHODS: The number of documented physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and incident diagnoses during the imposed lockdown in 2020 was descriptively analyzed and compared to 2019. RESULTS: Physician consultations decrease slightly in February (-2%), increase before the imposed lockdown in March (+9%), and decline in April (-18%) and May (-14%) 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Volumes of hospital admissions decrease earlier and more intensely than physician consultations (-39% vs. -6% respectively). Overall, 15%, 16%, and 18% fewer incident diagnoses were documented by GPs, neurologists, and diabetologists respectively in 2020. Diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer, and stroke were diagnosed less frequently during the lockdown (-17% to -26%), meaning that the decrease in the recognition of diseases was greater than the decrease in physician consultations. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that organizational changes were adopted quickly by practice management, but also raise concerns about the maintenance of routine care. Prospective studies should evaluate the long-term effects of lockdowns on patient-related outcomes.","Michalowsky, Bernhard; Hoffmann, Wolfgang; Bohlken, Jens; Kostev, Karel",Age Ageing,,129
370920,Advances of the clinical pharmacology of hydroxychloroquine sulfate/ 硫酸羟氯喹的临床药理学研究进展,2020,"In this paper, we describe our approach in the shared task: COVID-19 event extraction from Twitter. The objective of this task is to extract answers from COVID-related tweets to a set of predefined slot-filling questions. Our approach treats the event extraction task as a question answering task by leveraging the transformer-based T5 text-to-text model. According to the official exact match based evaluation scores returned, namely F1, our submitted run can achieve competitive performance as compared to other participating runs (Top 3). However, we argue that this evaluation can potentially underestimate the actual performance of runs based on text-generation approaches (e.g. our run). This is due to the fact that although some predictions of such runs answer the slot questions well, they may not be an exact string match for the gold standard answers. To further measure the extent of this underestimation, we adopt a simple exact answer transformation method aiming at converting the well-answered predictions to exactly-matched predictions. The results show that after the transformation our run reaches the same level of performance as the best participating run. Our code is publicly available to aid reproducibility.","Wang, Congcong; Lillis, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10047v1.pdf,129

When a recession lands on their doorstep with a sudden thud, as it apparently just has, many of these same people will find themselves having sailed too close to the wind, with cash running out and a dearth of tools to help them weather the storm and understand what has gone wrong But it need not be so, for there are four simple tools to help any business owner answer these four important questions: (1) Where is cash going in my business, and where is it coming from? (2) To what extent are my profit margins improving or declining, and why? (3) To what extent am I effectively managing the cash-flow relationships with my customers and my suppliers? (4) What, if anything, can I do to better manage the cash that flows into and out of my business?

374960,The Importance of Connectivity,2020,"The widespread idea about the Russian Orthodox Church as an institution incapable of development needs to be substantially modified The conservatism inherent in the Church should not be confused with reactionism, which is not its immanent attribute Moreover, it is possible to talk about the internal polyphony of the Church, which incorporates a fairly wide range of views Historically, the Russian Orthodox Church has been distinguished by an extremely high degree of adaptability, the ability to integrate different traditions even in such conservative areas as worship, but in the Soviet years it was ""encapsulated"" and largely turned into a hermetic structure with the focus on preserving tradition The current situation in the Russian Orthodox community is characterized by a huge gap between the number of ""nominal"" and ""practising"" believers At the same time, the low and diffuse mass religiosity is compensated and, so to say, replaced by the increased activity of the practising minority and priests But the active minority in the Russian Orthodox Church is heterogeneous and is split into several groups, the most important of which are conservatives and pragmatists The internal polyphony of the Russian Orthodox Church was clearly visible during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic The situation touched upon the church-state relations, as well as the question of the role of confessions in modern society, rather than boiling down to the usual confrontation between liberals and conservatives The pandemic not only exacerbated the contradictions between pragmatists and conservatives, but also led to the serious disagreements between the state and the Church that looked up to its influential conservatives in the decision-making process However, since the Church as an institution is not ready to oppose state power, the prevailing model of relations between them is likely to remain, although it may become less idyllic","Makarkin, A.

376919,Breast cancer and COVID-19: Impact of active treatment on severe outcomes,2021,"BackgroundThe computer simulation presented in this study aimed to investigate the effect of contact tracing on COVID-19 transmission and infection in the context of rising vaccination rates. MethodsThis study proposed a deterministic SEIRV model with contact tracing and vaccination components. We initialized some parameters using the Malaysian COVID-19 data to inform the model. We defined contact tracing effectiveness as the proportion of contacts of a positive case that was successfully traced and vaccination rate as the proportion of daily doses administered per population in Malaysia. Sensitivity analyses on the untraced and infectious populations were conducted. The study presented in silico findings on multiple scenarios by varying the contact tracing effectiveness and daily vaccination rates. ResultsAt a vaccination rate of 1.4%, a contact tracing with the effectiveness of 70% could delay the peak of untraced asymptomatic cases by 17 days and reduce the highest number of daily cases by 70% compared with a 30% contact tracing effectiveness. A similar trend was observed for symptomatic cases when a similar experiment setting was used. We also performed sensitivity analyses by using different combinations of contact tracing effectiveness and vaccination rates. In all scenarios, the effect of contact tracing on COVID-19 incidence persisted for both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. ConclusionDespite testing only on two public health and social measures (PHSMs), we observed the scenario with low contact tracing and increasing vaccination rates successfully mimicked the current transmission trend in Malaysia. Hence, while vaccines are progressively rolled out, efficient contact tracing must be rapidly implemented concurrently to reach, find, test, isolate, and support the affected populations to bring the pandemic under control.","Raja, Dhesi Baha; Taib, Nur Asheila Abdul; Teo, Alvin Kuo Jing; Jayaraj, Vivek Jason; Ting, Choo Yee",,,129
376942,Repositioning Chromones for Early Anti-inflammatory Treatment of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Advancing age is an independent predictor of mortality in septic patients. Recent animal studies were unable to reflect this clinical pathophysiological process, largely hampering the development of new efficacious therapies. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM-2) is a novel immune regulator with multiple activities. However, very little is known about the regulatory role of TREM-2 in sepsis upon aging. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from septic patients within 24âhours after Intensive Care Unit admission. The patients were preselected into two groups based on the age (age with &#8805; 60 years old and age with < 60 years old). Sepsis in aged mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The expression of TREM-2 was evaluated in septic patients and aged septic mice. Aged macrophages overexpressing TREM-2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were administered to aged septic mice after cecal ligation and puncture. Survival rate was monitored, and bacterial load and inflammatory mediators levels were evaluated. In vivo IL-23 function was blocked using appropriate monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The expression levels of TREM-2 were downregulated in both aged septic patients and aged septic mice. The administration of TREM-2-overexpressing macrophages significantly prolonged survival and alleviated organ injury in the aged septic mice. The protective effect did not affect host bacterial burden, but markedly inhibited the host IL-17A response, as determined by a multiplex cytokine assay. Screening the expression of IL-17A-related activating factors revealed that the IL-23 level in TREM-2-overexpressing macrophages was significantly lower than that in GFP-expressing macrophages. Blocking IL-23 after the administration of GFP-expressing macrophages protected aged mice against sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: TREM-2 prolonged survival of aged mice from sepsis by finely modulating the IL-23/IL-17A immune pathway. These results provide previously unidentified mechanistic insight into immune regulation by TREM-2 and new therapeutic targets in sepsis upon aging.","Chen, QiXing; Yang, Yang; Wu, XiaoLiang; Yang, ShiYue; Zhang, Yan; Shu, Qiang; Fang, XiangMing",Shock (Augusta Ga.),,129

In the first step, we use signal(s) as queries to retrieve the key content from the source document. Then, a pre-trained language model conducts further sentence search and edit to return the final extracted summaries. Importantly, our work can be flexibly extended to a multi-view framework by different signals. Automatic evaluation on three scientific document datasets verifies the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The further human evaluation suggests that the extracted summaries cover more content aspects than previous systems.","Ju, Jiaxin; Liu, Ming; Koh, Huan Yee; Jin, Yuan; Du, Lan; Pan, Shirui",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01280v1.pdf,129

381446,The potential oncogenic role of the RAS-like GTP-binding gene RIT1 in glioblastoma,2020,"Background: Guidelines and recommendations from public health authorities related to face masks have been essential in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the prevalence and correlates of mask usage during the pandemic. Methods: We examined a total of 13,723,810 responses to a daily cross-sectional representative online survey in 38 countries who completed from April 23, 2020 to October 31, 2020 and reported having been in public at least once during the last seven days. The outcome was individual face mask usage in public settings, and the predictors were country fixed effects, country-level mask policy stringency, calendar time, individual sociodemographic factors, and health prevention behaviors. Associations were modelled using survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression. Findings: Mask-wearing varied over time and across the 38 countries. While some countries consistently showed high prevalence throughout, in other countries mask usage increased gradually, and a few other countries remained at low prevalence. Controlling for time and country fixed effects, sociodemographic factors (older age, female gender, education, urbanicity) and stricter mask-related policies were significantly associated with higher mask usage in public settings, while social behaviors considered risky in the context of the pandemic (going out to large events, restaurants, shopping centers, and socializing outside of the household) were associated with lower mask use. Interpretation: The decision to wear a face mask in public settings is significantly associated with sociodemographic factors, risky social behaviors, and mask policies. This has important implications for health prevention policies and messaging, including the potential need for more targeted policy and messaging design.","Badillo-Goicoechea, Elena; Chang, Ting-Hsuan; Kim, Esther; LaRocca, Sarah; Morris, Katherine; Deng, Xiaoyi; Chiu, Samantha; Bradford, Adrianne; Garcia, Andres; Kern, Christoph; Cobb, Curtiss; Kreuter, Frauke; Stuart, Elizabeth A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11678v2.pdf,129
382476,Incorporation of Reversible Electroporation Into Electrolysis Accelerates Apoptosis for Rat Liver Tissue,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged from China in December 2019. The outbreak further exploded in Europe and America in mid-March 2020 to become a global health emergency. We reviewed recent published articles and on-line open messages on SARS-CoV-2-positive infants and children younger than 20 years of age. Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults. Twelve critically or mortally ill children were found in the published or news reports before April 6, 2020. Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has not been proven definitively. However, six early-onset (<7 days) and 3 late-onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the literature. We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread. Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19. Multidirectional investigations are crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.","Jeng, Mei-Jy",J Chin Med Assoc,,129

Simply by using graphite rod cathode instead of platinum plate cathode, chemoselectivity of this radical relay strategy is shifted to the dehydrogenative [2+2+2] cycloaddition via 1,2-diarylation, annulation and dehydrogenation cascades leading to complex 11,12-dihydroindolo[2,3-a]carbazoles. Mechanistical studies indicate that a key step for the radical relay processes is transformations of the aromatic hydrocarbons to the aryl sp2-hybridized carbon-centered radicals via deprotonation of the corresponding aryl radical cation intermediates with bases.","Li, Jin-Heng; Qin, Jing-Hao; Luo, Mu-Jia; An, De-Lie",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,129

384738,Breast cancer surgery under the shadow of COVID-19: Quest for optimal axillary management after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy,2020,"Background Patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 are at risk of deterioration. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) is widely recommended, however it's validity in Covid-19 is not established and indices more specific for respiratory failure may be more appropriate. We aim to describe the physiological antecedents to deterioration, test the predictive validity of NEWS2 and compare this to the ROX index ([SpO2/FiO2]/respiratory rate). Method A single centre retrospective cohort study of adult patients who were admitted to a medical ward, between 1/3/20 and 30/5/20, with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Physiological observations and the NEWS2 were extracted and analysed. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac arrest, unplanned critical care admission or death within 24 hours. A generalized linear model was used to assess the association of physiological values, NEWS2 and ROX with the outcome. Findings The primary outcome occurred in 186 patients (26%). In the preceding 24 hours, deterioration was most marked in respiratory parameters, specifically in escalating oxygen requirement;tachypnoea was a late sign, whilst cardiovascular observations remained stable. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.815 (95% CI 0.804–0.826) for NEWS2 and 0.848 (95% CI 0.837–0.858) for ROX. Applying the optimal level of ROX, the majority of patients triggered four hours earlier than with NEWS2 of 5. Interpretation NEWS2 may under-perform in Covid-19 due to intrinsic limitations of the design and the unique pathophysiology of the disease. A simple index utilising respiratory parameters can outperform NEWS2 in predicting the occurrence of adverse events.","Prower, Emma Grant David Bisquera Alessandra Breen Cormac P.; Camporota, Luigi Gavrilovski Maja Pontin Megan Douiri Abdel Glover Guy W.",EClinicalMedicine,,129

Recently proposed methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their potential in image processing tasks, including some medical image analysis tasks. Those methods can learn various feature representations with numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels, however, the missed diagnosis rate of regions of interest (ROIs) is still high in medical image segmentation. Two crucial factors behind this shortcoming, which have been overlooked, are small ROIs from medical images and the limited context information from the existing network models. In order to reduce the missed diagnosis rate of ROIs from medical images, we propose a new segmentation framework which enhances the representative capability of small ROIs (particularly in deep layers) and explicitly learns global contextual dependencies in multi-scale feature spaces. In particular, the local features and their global dependencies from each feature space are adaptively aggregated based on both the spatial and the channel dimensions. Moreover, some visualization comparisons of the learned features from our framework further boost neural networks' interpretability. Experimental results show that, in comparison to some popular medical image segmentation and general image segmentation methods, our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the liver tumor segmentation task with 91.18% Sensitivity, the COVID-19 lung infection segmentation task with 75.73% Sensitivity and the retinal vessel detection task with 82.68% Sensitivity. Moreover, it is possible to integrate (parts of) the proposed framework into most of the recently proposed Fully CNN-based models, in order to improve their effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks.","Pang, Shuchao; Du, Anan; Yu, Zhenmei; Orgun, Mehmet A",Methods (S.

Moreover, there still exists a shortfall in demonstrating specific clinical manifestations of the brain involvement of the virus. Here, we presented a 33-year-old female patient with COVID-19, reporting acute-onset paranoid delusions symptoms, insomnia and irritability. Cranial MRI showed an hyperintense signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, which might possibly indicate the presence of cytotoxic edema related to the brain involvement of the infection. Following the completion of SARS-CoV-2 treatment, both cytotoxic edema and psychiatric symptoms resolved. In light of this report, we suggest that either heightened immune response and direct viral infection that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to such psychiatric manifestations and neuropsychiatric monitoring should be performed in patients with COVID-19. Prompt recognition of psychiatric consequences of COVID-19 may help clinicians provide guidance for differential diagnosis and manage them accordingly.","Sen, Meltem; Yesilkaya, Umit Haluk; Balcioglu, Yasin Hasan",J Clin Neurosci,,129

METHOD: 32 semi-structured interviews were administered to a not probabilistic sample of the different professional roles (coordinators, nurses, healthcare assistants, physiotherapists, community animators) of a Human Services Company in Reggio Emilia (Italy). This includes day-care and residential care facilities for the elderly. RESULTS: The thematic content analysis showed that inter-professional collaboration and positive relationships with superiors, colleagues and elderly people favour the job satisfaction, while workload, high responsibilities, reduction of rest periods and contributory inequity create dissatisfaction. The work engagement is favoured by professional autonomy, a sense of belonging, professional growth, specific training, while it is disadvantaged by scarce career opportunities, job insecurity and low recognition of one's contribution. Finally, inadequate pay, work load, high turnover and strong emotional experiences related to elderly people increase work-related stress/burnout, while working autonomy, psychological support and good relationships with the elderly reduce it. Some specificities were found according to the different professional roles and the type of services offered. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest organizational improvement strategies that take these factors into account. Among the improvement proposals we highlight, for example, the promotion of training events, a greater involvement of personnel in corporate decisions and an adequate psychological support for professionals.","Foà, Chiara; Guarnieri, Maria Cristina; Bastoni, Giorgia; Benini, Barbara; Giunti, Olimpia Maria; Mazzotti, Manola; Rossi, Cristina; Savoia, Alessandra; Sarli, Leopoldo; Artioli, Giovanna",Acta Biomed,,129

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the current state of the evidence on health and healthcare utilization outcomes associated with NP-home visits. METHOD: Five Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the Cochrane Library) were systematically searched to identify studies examining NP-home visits. The search focused on English language studies that were published before April 2019 and sought to describe the outcomes associated with NP-home visits. We included experimental and observational studies. Quality appraisal was performed with the Kmet, Lee & Cook tool, and results summarized qualitatively. The impact of NP-home visits on clinical (functional status, quality of life [QOL]), and healthcare utilization (hospitalization, Emergency department(ED) visits) outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: A total of 566 citations were identified; 7 met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The most commonly reported outcomes were emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions. Given the limited number of articles generated by our search and wide variation in intervention and outcomes measures. NP-home visits were associated with reductions in ED visits in 2 out of 3 studies and with reduction in readmissions in 2 out of 4 studies. CONCLUSION: Published studies evaluating the outcomes associated with NP-home visits are limited and of mixed quality. Limitations include small sample size, and variation in duration and frequency of NP-home visits. Future studies should investigate the independent effect of NP-home visits on the health outcomes of older adults using large and nationally representative data with more rigorous study design.","Osakwe, Zainab Toteh; Aliyu, Sainfer; Sosina, Olukayode Ayodeji; Poghosyan, Lusine",Geriatr. nurs,,129

Risk factors for critical illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection include male gender, obesity, diabetes, and age >65. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to critical illness are poorly understood. Of interest, these comorbidities have previously been associated with increased signaling of Th17 cells. Th17 cells secrete IL-17A and are important for clearing extracellular pathogens, but inappropriate signaling has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently there are few treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 infections. This review describes evidence linking risk factors for critical illness in COVID-19 with increased Th17 cell activation and IL-17 signaling that may lead to increased likelihood for lung injury and respiratory failure. These findings provide a basis for testing the potential use of therapies directed at modulation of Th17 cells and IL-17A signaling in the treatment of COVID-19.","Orlov, Marika; Wander, Pandora L; Morrell, Eric D; Mikacenic, Carmen; Wurfel, Mark M",J Immunol,,129

However, no comprehensive data have been reported on pre-existing neurological comorbidities and COVID-19. This study aims at evaluating the prevalence of neurological comorbidities, and their association with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We evaluated all consecutive patients admitted to the Emergency Room (ER) of our hospital between the 3rd March and the 14th April 2020, and diagnosed with COVID-19. Data on neurological and non-neurological diseases were extracted, as well as data on demographic characteristics and on severity degree of COVID-19. The prevalence of neurological comorbidities was calculated, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between neurological diseases and COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 344 patients. Neurological comorbidities accounted for 22.4% of cases, with cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment being the most frequent. Neurological comorbidity resulted independently associated with severe COVID-19 (OR 2.305; p = 0.012), as well as male gender (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.001), neoplastic diseases (p = 0.039), and arterial hypertension (p = 0.045). When neurological comorbidity was associated with non-neurological comorbidities, the OR for severe COVID-19 rose to 7.394 (p = 0.005). Neurological patients, in particular cerebrovascular and cognitively impaired ones, received more respiratory support indication. CONCLUSION: Neurological comorbidities represent a significant determinant of COVID-19 severity, deserving a thorough evaluation since the earliest phases of infection. The vulnerability of patients affected by neurological diseases should suggest a greater attention in targeting this population for proactive viral screening.","Romagnolo, Alberto; Balestrino, Roberta; Imbalzano, Gabriele; Ciccone, Giovannino; Riccardini, Franco; Artusi, Carlo Alberto; Bozzali, Marco; Ferrero, Bruno; Montalenti, Elisa; Montanaro, Elisa; Rizzone, Mario Giorgio; Vaula, Giovanna; Zibetti, Maurizio; Lopiano, Leonardo",J. neurol,,129

It shows that apparently authoritative sources and experts gave information or policy recommendations that have turned out to be wrong, sometimes dangerously so, and explores the kinds of bias that enter medical advice and planning decisions. The article then diagnoses a WhatsApp voice-note from a young South African doctor that went viral and was denounced as 'fake news' because of obvious errors. This note, however, revealed behind the scenes medical thinking about subjects that professional bodies and authorities usually avoid discussing publicly. In highlighting what apparently authoritative sources omit and distort, the article suggests that journalists should report medical advice, even from authoritative sources, with caution and shows that apparently 'fake' news may reveal issues other news sources neglect.","Glenn, I.",Journal of African Media Studies,,129

[German]",2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, encoding the prefusion-stabilized spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This phase 2, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 8 sites in the USA, in healthy adults aged &#8805;18 years with no known history or risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and had not previously received an investigational CoV vaccine or treatment. Participants were stratified into two age cohorts (&#8805;18-<55 and &#8805;55) and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either 50 or 100 µg of mRNA-1273, or placebo administered as two intramuscular injections 28 days apart. The primary outcomes were safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessed by anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike binding antibody level (bAb). Secondary outcome was immunogenicity assessed by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) response. RESULTS: Between 29 May and 8 July 2020, 600 participants were randomized, 300 per age cohort. The most common solicited adverse reactions were pain at injection site, headache, and fatigue following each vaccination in both age cohorts. One serious adverse event deemed unrelated by the site investigator occurred 33 days post-vaccination one. mRNA-1273 induced bAb and nAb by 28 days post-vaccination one that were higher at the 100 µg dose relative to the 50 µg dose; this difference was less apparent post-vaccination two. Binding antibodies and nAb increased substantially by 14 days following the second vaccination (day 43) to levels exceeding those of convalescent sera and remained elevated through day 57. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with mRNA-1273 resulted in significant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in participants 18 years and older, with an acceptable safety profile, confirming the safety and immunogenicity of 50 and 100 µg mRNA-1273 given as a 2 dose-regimen.

Its narrative and strategies reinforces the counter-hegemonic movement that denounces the logics of commodification and financialisation in the housing sector, placing hope in a post-capitalist transition in the post-COVID horizon. We conclude that the actors in this urban struggle have limited power over the changes they initiate, or make an effort to inflict, if they are not involved in a concerted and politically integrated action, not least because the achievements they obtain are temporary and exceptional, like the state of emergency imposed by COVID-19.","Mendes, Luís",Tijdschr.

405790,COVID-19: a recommendation to examine the effect of hydroxychloroquine in preventing infection and progression,2020,"In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. Although it has been reported that some COVID-19 patients showed elevated liver biochemistries, there are few studies regarding clinical features and prognosis of these patients. In this multicenter, retrospective study, we collected data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from three hospitals in Wuhan, China, who died or were discharged between February 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. The data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations on admission, complications, treatment, and outcome were collected. A total of 482 patients were enrolled in this study. Of those, 142 (29.5%) patients showed abnormal liver biochemistries on admission, and patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) accounted for 67.6%, 69.0%, and 16.2%, respectively. Those with abnormal liver biochemistries showed higher percentages of severe cases and comorbidities and were more likely to have dyspnea, chest distress or pain, and increased hemoglobin (Hb) on admission. Higher rates of complications and mortality and worse recovery when discharged were observed in patients with abnormal AST or TBIL. The multivariable regression analysis showed that chest distress or pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.765; P = 0.018), dyspnea (OR, 2.495; P = 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level (OR, 1.007; P = 0.008), elevated white blood count (WBC) (OR, 1.139; P = 0.013), and elevated Hb concentration (OR, 1.024; P = 0.001) were independent factors associated with elevated liver biochemistries in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Elevated liver biochemistries were common in COVID-19 patients. Patients with hypoxia or severe inflammation are more likely to experience increased liver biochemistries on admission. Those with abnormal AST or TBIL on admission are more likely to suffer from severe complications and death.","Fu, Yu; Zhu, Rui; Bai, Tao; Han, Ping; He, Qin; Jing, Mengjia; Xiong, Xiaofeng; Zhao, Xi; Quan, Runze; Chen, Chaoyue; Zhang, Ying; Tao, Meihui; Yi, Jianhua; Tian, Dean; Yan, Wei",Hepatology (Baltim.),,129
405793,COVID-19: a recommendation to examine the effect of hydroxychloroquine in preventing infection and progression ;Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy ;Oxford Academic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate an urgent need to take action against mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.56). PRs for new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.72). Severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly more prevalent when there was higher urbanization plus lower neighborhood deprivation (PR = 1.34 [1.15-1.56], and 1.57 [1.22-2.03], respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is not the number of COVID-19 cases by residence area but higher urbanization level and greater neighborhood deprivation (lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status) that are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic. These findings differ in part from evidence obtained before the pandemic.","Okubo, Ryo; Yoshioka, Takashi; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Okano, Hiroki; Ikezawa, Satoru; Tsuno, Kanami; Murayama, Hiroshi; Tabuchi, Takahiro",J Affect Disord,,129

This major event that changed the way we see the renin-angiotensin system today could have passed quietly. Instead, the discovery that ACE2 is a major player in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has blown up the literature regarding this enzyme. ACE2 connects the classical arm renin-angiotensin system, consisting mainly of angiotensin II peptide and its AT1 receptor, with a protective arm, consisting mainly of the angiotensin 1-7 peptide and its Mas receptor. In this brief article, we have reviewed the literature to describe how ACE2 is a key protective arm enzyme in the function of many organs, particularly in the context of brain and cardiovascular function, as well as in renal, pulmonary and digestive homeostasis. We also very briefly review and refer to recent literature to present an insight into the role of ACE2 in determining the course of coronavirus diseases 2019.","Pagliaro, Pasquale; Thairi, Cecilia; Alloatti, Giuseppe; Penna, Claudia",J. cardiovasc. med.

411664,Increased interleukin-6 and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 are associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: In dealing with community spread of COVID-19, two active interventions have been attempted or advocated-containment, and mitigation. Given the extensive impact of COVID-19 globally, there is international interest to learn from best practices that have been shown to work in controlling community spread to inform future outbreaks. This study explores the trajectory of COVID-19 infection in Singapore had the government intervention not focused on containment, but rather on mitigation. In addition, we estimate the actual COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore, given that confirmed cases are publicly available. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a COVID-19 infection model, which is a modified SIR model that differentiate between detected (diagnosed) and undetected (undiagnosed) individuals and segments total population into seven health states: susceptible (S), infected asymptomatic undiagnosed (A), infected asymptomatic diagnosed (I), infected symptomatic undiagnosed (U), infected symptomatic diagnosed (E), recovered (R), and dead (D). To account for the infection stages of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, the asymptomatic infected individuals were further disaggregated into three infection stages: (a) latent (b) infectious and (c) non-infectious; while the symptomatic infected were disaggregated into two stages: (a) infectious and (b) non-infectious. The simulation result shows that by the end of the current epidemic cycle without considering the possibility of a second wave, under the containment intervention implemented in Singapore, the confirmed number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic cases) is projected to be 52,053 (with 95% confidence range of 49,370-54,735) representing 0.87% (0.83%-0.92%) of the total population; while the actual number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed and undiagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic infected cases) is projected to be 86,041 (81,097-90,986), which is 1.65 times the confirmed cases and represents 1.45% (1.36%-1.53%) of the total population. A peak in infected cases is projected to have occurred on around day 125 (27/05/2020) for the confirmed infected cases and around day 115 (17/05/2020) for the actual infected cases. The number of deaths is estimated to be 37 (34-39) among those infected with COVID-19 by the end of the epidemic cycle; consequently, the perceived case fatality rate is projected to be 0.07%, while the actual case fatality rate is estimated to be 0.043%. Importantly, our simulation model results suggest that there about 65% more COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore that have not been captured in the official reported numbers which could be uncovered via a serological study. Compared to the containment intervention, a mitigation intervention would have resulted in early peak infection, and increase both the cumulative confirmed and actual infection cases and deaths. CONCLUSION: Early public health measures in the context of targeted, aggressive containment including swift and effective contact tracing and quarantine, was likely responsible for suppressing the number of COVID-19 infections in Singapore.","Ansah, John P; Matchar, David Bruce; Shao Wei, Sean Lam; Low, Jenny G; Pourghaderi, Ahmad Reza; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Min, Tessa Lui Shi; Wei-Yan, Aloysius Chia; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock",PLoS One,,129

In this multicenter retrospective study, we reviewed charts of patients admitted with symptomatic COVID-19 infection and STEMI to a total of 4 hospitals spanning Italy, Lithuania, Spain and Iraq from February 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020. A total of 78 patients were included in this study, 49 (63%) of whom were men, with a median age of 65 [58, 71] years, and high comorbidity burden. During hospitalization, 8 (10%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 14 (18%) required mechanical ventilation. 19 (24%) patients were treated with primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) and 59 (76%) were treated with fibrinolytic therapy. 13 (17%) patients required cardiac resuscitation, and 9 (11%) died. For the 19 patients treated with primary PCI, 8 (42%) required intubation and 8 (42%) required cardiac resuscitation; stent thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (21%). A total of 5 patients (26%) died during hospitalization. 50 (85%) of the 59 patients initially treated with fibrinolytic therapy had successful fibrinolysis. The median time to reperfusion was 27 minutes [20, 34]. Hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 5 patients (9%). Six patients (10%) required invasive mechanical ventilation; 5 (9%) required cardiac resuscitation, and 4 (7%) died. In conclusion, this is the largest case series to-date of COVID-19 positive patients presenting with STEMI and spans 4 countries.

413222,Brain MRI abnormalities in a child with spinal muscular atrophy type II,2020,"Surface ozone is a severe air pollution problem in the North China Plain, which is home to 300 million people. Ozone concentrations are highest in summer, driven by fast photochemical production of hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx) that can overcome the radical titration caused by high emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from fuel combustion. Ozone has been very low during winter haze (particulate) pollution episodes. However, the abrupt decrease of NOx emissions following the COVID-19 lockdown in January 2020 reveals a switch to fast ozone production during winter haze episodes with maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations of 60 to 70 parts per billion. We reproduce this switch with the GEOS-Chem model, where the fast production of ozone is driven by HOx radicals from photolysis of formaldehyde, overcoming radical titration from the decreased NOx emissions. Formaldehyde is produced by oxidation of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which have very high emissions in the North China Plain. This remarkable switch to an ozone-producing regime in January-February following the lockdown illustrates a more general tendency from 2013 to 2019 of increasing winter-spring ozone in the North China Plain and increasing association of high ozone with winter haze events, as pollution control efforts have targeted NOx emissions (30% decrease) while VOC emissions have remained constant. Decreasing VOC emissions would avoid further spreading of severe ozone pollution events into the winter-spring season.","Li, Ke; Jacob, Daniel J; Liao, Hong; Qiu, Yulu; Shen, Lu; Zhai, Shixian; Bates, Kelvin H; Sulprizio, Melissa P; Song, Shaojie; Lu, Xiao; Zhang, Qiang; Zheng, Bo; Zhang, Yuli; Zhang, Jinqiang; Lee, Hyun Chul; Kuk, Su Keun",Proc.

Policy measures adopted to slow the transmission of disease are decreasing the demand for imaging independent of COVID-19. Hospital preparations to expand crisis capacity are further diminishing the amount of appropriate medical imaging that can be safely performed. Although economic recessions generally tend to result in decreased health care expenditures, radiology groups have never experienced an economic shock that is simultaneously exacerbated by the need to restrict the availability of imaging. Outpatient-heavy practices will feel the biggest impact of these changes, but all imaging volumes will decrease. Anecdotal experience suggests that radiology practices should anticipate 50%-70% decreases in imaging volume that will last a minimum of 3-4 months, depending on the location of practice and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act provides multiple means of direct and indirect aid to health care providers and small businesses. The final allocation of this funding is not yet clear, and it is likely that additional congressional action will be necessary to stabilize health care markets. Administrators and practice leaders must be proactive with practice modifications and financial maneuvers that can position them to emerge from this pandemic in the most viable economic position. It is possible that this crisis will have lasting effects on the structure of the radiology field.","Cavallo, Joseph J; Forman, Howard P",Radiology,,129

However, the evaluation of the sustainability of a power plant depends on the development of several analyses, which should encompass thermodynamic and environmental parameters. Energy, exergy, and exergoenvironmental assessments are carried out for a sugarcane bagasse cogeneration system, along with a Life Cycle Assessment for the Brazilian sugarcane bagasse, employing the Eco-indicator 99 method. The specific environmental impacts of electricity and steam are 6.023 mPt/MJ and 4.038 mPt/MJ, respectively, and the boiler feed pump and radiator presented the highest average environmental impact per exergy of fuel and product, respectively. The component with the highest exergoenvironmental factor was the furnace (60.32%), demonstrating margins for benefits in the formation of pollutants and destruction of exergy. Exergoenvironmental assessments can be utilized to support the adoption of more efficient (although more complex) cogeneration systems, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis.","Cavalcanti, Eduardo J.C.; Carvalho, Monica; da Silva, Daniel R.S.",Energy Convers.

Medical students are a potential pool for blood donors. The aim of this study was to determine overall attitudes of medical students at a single academic institution toward blood donation during times of increased need. METHODS: Three anonymous REDCap surveys were administered to all medical students at a rural academic institution. Surveys 1 and 2 were administered preceding and after an institution-wide MCI drill, in September and November 2019, respectively. Survey 3 was administered following a student-organized COVID-19 blood drive in June 2020. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if factors, ie, experience with MCI drills and emergency medical services (EMS) training, were associated with willingness to donate blood. Furthermore, barriers to donation among those not willing to donate were assessed. RESULTS: Overall response rate for MCI surveys (surveys 1 and 2) was 38% (mean age 25.2 years and 50% women). 91% (n = 210) of respondents were willing to donate blood. Previous participation in MCI drills and EMS training was not associated with higher willingness to donate blood. Response rate for survey 3 was 15.6% (59.4% women), and 30 (31.3%) respondents indicated they did not volunteer to donate blood during the COVID-19 drive. Most common reasons for not donating were ""other,"" medical concerns, and being out-of-town. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of medical students are willing to donate blood during times of increased need and offer a possible solution to increase blood donor pool.","Khatun, Rahima; Otaibi, Banan W; Ssentongo, Anna; Hazelton, Joshua P; Cooper, AmandaB",Am Surg,,129

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Radiology, Shifa International Hospital, from 1st March to June 30th, 2020. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and three consecutive patients' RT PCR positive for COVID-19 were included. Two consultant radiologists, with experience of 7 to 10 years in body imaging, evaluated their HRCT studies in consensus and calculated the CT severity score. A scoring of all 20 individual regions in each lung were assigned by the radiologists attributing a score of 0, 1 or 2 to each region, if parenchymal opacification was none, less than 50%, or 50% or more, respectively. The CT severity score was a summation of scores of all 20 regions of both lungs combined with a range of 0 to 40 points. The scores were compared for clinically mild and severe disease. RESULTS: Significant differences were noted regarding the scoring of lung opacity in mild and severe groups in each lung segment, p <0.05. The most significantly involved segments were right lower lobe's medial and lateral basal segment, left upper lobe's superior lingular segment and left lower lobe's medial basal and lateral basal segments. To discriminate mild versus severe disease, CT-SS threshold value turned out to be 19.5 Conclusion: CTSS may be of value for a prompt and objective means of assessing the degree of severity and disease burden in lungs.

419327,COVID-19 and androgen targeted therapy for prostate cancer patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or reduced urine flow associated with mortality in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AKI is often associated with renal tissue damage, which may lead to chronic kidney disease. Biomarkers of tissue damage may identify patients of particular risk. METHODS: In a prospective observational study of 57 patients admitted to intensive care, AKI incidence and characteristics was evaluated according to KDIGO criteria and related to days after admission. Urinary albumin, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), Kidney Injury Molecule 1 (KIM-1) and Plasma Tissue Inhibitor of MetalloProteinase 2 (TIMP-2) were analysed in 52 patients at admission. The majority (n = 51, 89%) of patients developed AKI, and 27 (47%) patients had predominantly oliguric AKI where oliguria was more severe than plasma Creatinine increase. Severe oliguria within first 2 days after admission was common (n = 37, 65%), whereas stage 2 and 3 AKI due to Creatinine occurred later than day 2 in 67% (12/18) of cases. Renal replacement therapy was started in 9 (16%) patients, and 30-day mortality was 28%. Urinary biomarkers were increased in a majority of patients, but did not robustly predict KDIGO stage. Most patients had microalbuminuria, and severe albuminuria (albumin Creatinine ratio > 30 mg/mmol) was found in n = 9 (17%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU develop AKI. The functional deficit is often low urinary volume, and initial levels of biomarkers are generally increased without clear relation to final AKI stage.","Luther, Tomas; Bülow-Anderberg, Sara; Larsson, Anders; Rubertsson, Sten; Lipcsey, Miklos; Frithiof, Robert; Hultström, Michael",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,129

However, whether zinc plays a direct antiviral role in viral infections and whether viruses have adopted strategies to modulate zinc homeostasis have not been investigated. Results from clinical trials of zinc supplementation in infections indicate that zinc supplementation may be beneficial in a pathogen- or disease-specific manner, further underscoring the importance of understanding the interaction between zinc homeostasis and virus infections at the molecular level. We investigated the effect of RSV infection on zinc homeostasis and show that RSV infection in lung epithelial cells leads to modulation of zinc homeostasis. The intracellular labile zinc pool increases upon RSV infection in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent fashion. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitous zinc uptake transporter ZIP1 suggests that labile zinc levels are increased due to the increased uptake by RSV-infected cells as an antiviral response. Adding zinc to culture medium after RSV infection led to significant inhibition of RSV titers, whereas depletion of zinc by a zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) led to an increase in RSV titers. The inhibitory effect of zinc was specific, as other divalent cations had no effect on RSV titers. Both RSV infection and zinc chelation by TPEN led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, whereas addition of zinc blocked ROS induction. These results suggest a molecular link between RSV infection, zinc homeostasis, and oxidative-stress pathways and provide new insights for developing strategies to counter RSV infection.IMPORTANCE Zinc deficiency rates in developing countries range from 20 to 30%, and zinc supplementation trials have been shown to correct clinical manifestations attributed to zinc deficiency, but the outcomes in the case of respiratory infections have been inconsistent. We aimed at understanding the role of zinc homeostasis in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Infection of lung epithelial cell lines or primary small-airway epithelial cells led to an increase in labile zinc pools, which was due to increased uptake of zinc. Zinc supplementation inhibited RSV replication, whereas zinc chelation had an opposing effect, leading to increases in RSV titers. Increases in labile zinc in RSV-infected cells coincided with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both zinc depletion and addition of exogenous ROS led to enhanced RSV infection, whereas addition of the antioxidant inhibited RSV, suggesting that zinc is part of an interplay between RSV-induced oxidative stress and the host response to maintain redox balance.","Khan, Naseem Ahmed; Singla, Mohit; Samal, Sweety; Lodha, Rakesh; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R",MSphere,,129

The clinical presentation of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) having COVID-19 is unclear. Methods: We identified articles reporting about the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in those with underlying IBD from PubMed and Embase. The studies, irrespective of design or language, were included. The overall pooled frequency of various symptoms was estimated. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of studies. Results: Eleven studies, including 1,325 patients, were included in the pooled analysis. The pooled estimates for clinical presentation were; fever: 67.53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.38-83.88), cough: 59.58% (95% CI, 45.01-72.63), diarrhea: 27.26% (95% CI, 19.51-36.69), running nose: 27% (95% CI, 15.26-43.19) and dyspnea: 25.29% (95% CI, 18.52-33.52).

Our narrative review aims to determine whether the diagnosis of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) in COVID-19 patients represents coinfection or colonization based on the evidence available in the literature. We also discuss the decision to treat COVID-19 patients with coinfection by PJP. METHODS: A literature search was performed through the Pubmed and Web of Science databases from inception to March 10, 2021. RESULTS: We identified 12 COVID-19 patients suspected to have PJP coinfection. All patients were critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. Many were immunosuppressed from HIV or long-term corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. In both the HIV and non-HIV groups, severe lymphocytopenia was encountered with absolute lymphocyte and CD4+T cell count less than 900 and 200 cells/mm, respectively. The time to PJP diagnosis from the initial presentation was 7.8 (range 2-21) days. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta-D-glucan were elevated in those coinfected with PJP. All patients were treated with anti-PJP therapy, predominantly sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with corticosteroids. The overall mortality rate was 41.6%, and comparable for both HIV and non-HIV groups. CONCLUSION: As the current evidence is restricted to case reports, the true incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with PJP coinfections cannot be accurately determined. Comorbidities of poorly controlled HIV with lymphocytopenia and multiple immunosuppressive therapies are likely predisposing factors for PJP coinfection.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K; Chopra, Amit",Infection,,129

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: The Central Hospitals of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty one full-term pregnant patients who were admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-2019 with laboratorial and clinical methods, were reviewed by our medical team, and the data were collected from January 20, 2020 to February 29, 2020. MAIN CLINICAL DATA COLLECTION: Clinical data had been collecting using a standard case report form, such as epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination of major laboratory and clinic, etc. All the information was collected and confirmed by our medical team. RESULTS: Twenty one full-term pregnant patients were reviewed (median age 29 years), and no patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and died during the treating progress. According to our review, all the cases were infected by human to human transmission, and the most common symptoms at onset of illness were cough in 17 (80.95%), fatigue in 10 (47.62%), fever in 7 (33.33%), expectoration in 1 (4.76%), and only one patient (4.76%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 10 days (interquartile range 7 -2 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 1 day (interquartile range 1-2 days). CONCLUSIONS: As of February 29, 2020, all the patients who were full-term pregnancy combined with COVID-2019 were cured and delivered successfully, and all the newborns were not infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there were no evidence of mother-to-child transmission.","Chen, Yanfen; Bai, Jun",Arch Gynecol Obstet,,129

432374,PRAC May 2021 meeting highlights: COVID-19 vaccine AEs,2021,"The implications of COVID-19 on health care systems globally are proving to be immense, with unforeseen impacts that are still to fully emerge. Local and national health care systems, hospitals and health care workers have been overwhelmed by the needs of patients and limited by weaknesses in resources, staff capacity and distribution networks. These circumstances impact the ergonomic conditions within which health care staff work, and subsequently their behavioural responses. In this commentary we argue that urgent research is needed globally to bridge the evidence gap that exists on how best to support health care workers with the repercussions of working on the frontline of a pandemic. Leadership on the frontline is what matters. It is not only what policies, guidelines and checklists are in place to support nurses, doctors and health care workers; it is the actions and behaviours of their frontline and local leaders in implementing initiatives that really make the difference. Recognising that the leadership style, organisational culture, and the model of successful implementation are inextricable is the first step to ensure sustainable interventions to support health care workers' wellbeing will follow.","OBrien, Niki; Flott, Kelsey; Durkin, Mike",Int. j. qual. health care,,129

Seeing the vast impact of the pandemic and knowing its roots as a zoonotic disease, he realized this approach was critical to his medical education and for preparation against future novel infectious diseases. Zoonotic diseases have been emerging into human populations with increasing frequency, leading to public health emergencies such as Ebola, avian influenza, and SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 narrative, starting in bats and then mutating through an intermediate host into humans, is another striking example of the interconnectedness between human, animal, and ecosystem health that underlies these infections. Preventing future pandemics will require a transdisciplinary One Health approach, and physicians should be prepared to participate in these discussions while advocating for One Health initiatives for the benefit of their current and future patients. Integration of One Health education into medical school curricula will also prepare future physicians for other complex and urgently important health issues such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and the impact of biodiversity loss. As the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, education in One Health must become a priority; it is essential to break down the conventional disciplinary silos of human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, public health, and the social sciences, so that future health crises can be prevented and mitigated collaboratively.","Dykstra, Michael P; Baitchman, Eric J",Acad Med,,129

Clinical Case: A 51-year-old Mexican man with past medical history of T2DM presented to our hospital with 1-week history of fever, dyspnea, polydipsia, and nausea. Initial vital signs were notable for fever (axillary temperature 39°C) and low oxygen saturation (90% on room air). His examination was notable for a BMI of 31.2 kg/m2. Blood tests showed hyperglycemia (663 mg/dl, n 70–100 mg/dL), hypernatremia (146 mEq/L, n 135–145 mEq/L), hyperchloremia (113 mEq/L, n 95–110 mEq/L), elevated C-Reactive Protein [CRP] (18.7 mg/dl, n &amp;lt;0.7 mg/dl), elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] (672 U/L, n 100–170 U/L), high D-dimer (3420 ng/ml, n &amp;lt;400 ng/ml), elevated WBC count (13,200 cell/mm3, n 4600–10200 cells/mm3), high neutrophil count (11300 cells/mm3, n 2000–6900 cells/mm3) and low lymphocyte count (200 cells/mm3, n 600–3400 cells/mm3). Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.2 [n 7.35–7.45], bicarbonate 8mmol/L [22–28 mmol/L], anion gap 23.5 [8–16]) with ketones (100 mg/dl, n &amp;lt;5 mg/dl) in the urine analysis. Calculated serum osmolarity resulted of 328 mOsm/kg (n 278–305 mOsm/kg). Electrocardiogram showed no alterations. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities with bilateral infiltrates. Blood and urine cultures were negative. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Intravenous fluids, insulin infusion with ceftriaxone i.v. (2 g daily) and clarithromycin p.o. (1 g daily) were initiated but did not result in clinical improvement, continuing with fever, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis and worsening of respiratory status. At first day of hospitalization, he presented acute respiratory distress syndrome and was intubated and sedated. He developed multi-organ failure and expired after 3 days of mechanical ventilation. Conclusion: DM is a predisposing factor leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Patient showed similar features reported in cases who died of combined DKA and HHS associated with COVID-19: male, Hispanic, poor blood glucose control, mechanical ventilation, elevated CRP with high LDH and D-dimer. In this patient, obesity was an additional feature that led to severe COVID- 19.

To understand viral disease biology, we have carried out proteo-genomic analysis using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry on nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients to examine the clinical genome and proteome. Our study confirms the mutability of SARS-CoV-2 showing multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms. NGS analysis detected 27 mutations, of which 14 are synonymous, 11 are missense, and 2 are extragenic in nature. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates indicated their close relation to a Bangladesh isolate and multiple origins of isolates within the country. Our proteomic analysis, for the first time, identified 13 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins from the clinical swabs. Of the total 41 peptides captured by high-resolution mass spectrometry, 8 matched to nucleocapsid protein, 2 to ORF9b, and 1 to spike glycoprotein and ORF3a, with remaining peptides mapping to ORF1ab polyprotein. Additionally, host proteome analysis revealed several key host proteins to be uniquely expressed in COVID-19 patients. Pathway analysis of these proteins points toward modulation in immune response, especially involving neutrophil and IL-12-mediated signaling. Besides revealing the aspects of host-virus pathogenesis, our study opens new avenues to develop better diagnostic markers and therapeutic approaches.","Tushir, Sheetal; Kamanna, Sathisha; Nath, Sujith S; Bhat, Aishwarya; Rose, Steffimol; Aithal, Advait R; Tatu, Utpal",J Proteome Res,,129
435656,Thromboinflammation in COVID-19 acute lung injury,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 has caused the largest pandemic of the twenty-first century (COVID-19), threatening the life and economy of all countries in the world. The identification of novel therapies and vaccines that can mitigate or control this global health threat is among the most important challenges facing biomedical sciences. To construct a long-term strategy to fight both SARS-CoV-2 and other possible future threats from coronaviruses, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the virus action. The viral entry and associated infectivity stems from the formation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complex with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The detection of putative allosteric sites on the viral spike protein molecule can be used to elucidate the molecular pathways that can be targeted with allosteric drugs to weaken the spike-ACE2 interaction and, thus, reduce viral infectivity. In this study, we present the results of the application of different computational methods aimed at detecting allosteric sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The adopted tools consisted of the protein contact networks (PCNs), SEPAS (Affinity by Flexibility), and perturbation response scanning (PRS) based on elastic network modes. All of these methods were applied to the ACE2 complex with both the SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV spike proteins. All of the adopted analyses converged toward a specific region (allosteric modulation region [AMR]), present in both complexes and predicted to act as an allosteric site modulating the binding of the spike protein with ACE2. Preliminary results on hepcidin (a molecule with strong structural and sequence with AMR) indicated an inhibitory effect on the binding affinity of the spike protein toward the ACE2 protein.","Di Paola, Luisa; Hadi-Alijanvand, Hamid; Song, Xingyu; Hu, Guang; Giuliani, Alessandro",J Proteome Res,,129

However, little is known about how the pandemic has impacted pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-using men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: Data come from an online cohort of PrEP-using MSM in the Southern United States from October 2019 to July 2020. Participants were administered 10 surveys in total, including 1 ad hoc survey specifically on COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of this ad hoc survey (n = 56) and present changes in sexual behaviors and utilization of and access to sexual health services. Using linear mixed-effect regression models, we also analyzed data from the larger cohort and document how sexual behaviors and PrEP use varied longitudinally across several months. RESULTS: A fifth of participants discontinued or changed how often they take PrEP because of COVID-19. A quarter of the cohort documented challenges when attempting to access PrEP, HIV testing, or STD testing. For all sexual behaviors examined longitudinally-number of male sexual partners, anal sex acts, condomless anal sex, and oral sex (all measured in the past 2 weeks)-there was a decrease from February to April followed by an increase from April to June. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest reduced access to and utilization of STD and HIV services coupled with a continuation of behaviors which confer STD/HIV risk. Ensuring appropriate delivery of STD/HIV prevention services during this pandemic is imperative.","Pampati, Sanjana; Emrick, Kayla; Siegler, Aaron J; Jones, Jeb",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,129

436832,Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy use in early stage breast cancer during the covid-19 pandemic,2021,"The fore- and hindlimbs of birds are specialized to perform different functions. The growth patterns of limb bones and their relationship with the ontogeny of locomotion are critical to our understanding of variation in morphological, physiological and life-history traits within and among species. Unfortunately, the ontogenetic development of limb bones has not been well explored, especially in altricial birds. In this study, we sampled the entire measurements of the pigeon (Columba livia) of individual skeletons, to investigate the ontogenetic allometry of limb bones by reduced major axis regression. The ulna and humerus were found to be positively allometric in relation to body mass, with the ulna growing more rapidly than the humerus. Together with previous data, this suggests that strong positive allometric growth in forelimb bones could be a common trend among diverse Carinatae groups. Hindlimb was dominated by positive allometry, but was variable in the growth of the tarsometatarsus which included three allometric patterns. A greater dorsoventral diameter in the midsection of the humerus and ulna confers superior bending resistance and is ideal for flapping/gliding flight. Shape variation in the midsection of different hindlimb components reflects different mechanical loading, and the markedly inverse trend between the tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus before 28 days of age also suggests loading change before fledging. Before fledging, the growth of the leg bones was prior to that of the wing bones. This kind of asynchronous development of the fore- and hindlimbs was associated with the establishment and improvement of different functions, and with shifts in the importance of different functions over time.","Yan, Jianjian; Zhang, Zihui",Vet. med. sci,,129

Design/methodology/approach A total of 1,068 Indonesian respondents through a purposive sampling approach, filled out online questionnaires during the pandemic. The collected data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings The results indicated that subjective norm as the external factor of the TPB has a stronger effect than the internal factors;attitude and behavioral control. It appears that in a collectivist society, prohibition enforced by family and friends, as well as the government's sanctions have a stronger influence on one's decision to travel. The findings also suggested that knowledge, perceived risks and social concern effect tourists' behavior. Uncertainty and inadequate knowledge will decrease the level of perceived risk, which leads to lower control in practicing physical distancing and increasing intention to travel during the pandemic. Research limitations/implications The research has limitations in its use of a convenient sampling method. This method may not represent the whole population, causing the results to be difficult for generalization. There is also the need for extending the TPB model with different variables in the context of tourism and pandemic. This study enriches the existing tourism literature by applying TPB to examine tourists' behavior during the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on knowledge, social concern and perceived risk theory. Practical implications This paper offers useful insights for tourism planners in the government and private destination management levels. It is crucial for a destination management organization to understand the relationship between knowledge, perception and social concern with tourists' behavior while traveling during pandemics. The understanding of tourist's behavior when traveling during the pandemic will assist in developing and creating activities and designing health protocols at tourist attractions. Originality/value This study extended the TPB to analyze tourists behavior during the pandemic by applying knowledge, social concern and perceived risk elements.","Rahmafitria, F.; Suryadi, K.; Oktadiana, H.; Putro, H.

Health care personnel (HCP) are essential workers defined as paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials (3). During February 12-April 9, among 315,531 COVID-19 cases reported to CDC using a standardized form, 49,370 (16%) included data on whether the patient was a health care worker in the United States; including 9,282 (19%) who were identified as HCP. Among HCP patients with data available, the median age was 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 32-54 years), 6,603 (73%) were female, and 1,779 (38%) reported at least one underlying health condition. Among HCP patients with data on health care, household, and community exposures, 780 (55%) reported contact with a COVID-19 patient only in health care settings. Although 4,336 (92%) HCP patients reported having at least one symptom among fever, cough, or shortness of breath, the remaining 8% did not report any of these symptoms. Most HCP with COVID-19 (6,760, 90%) were not hospitalized; however, severe outcomes, including 27 deaths, occurred across all age groups; deaths most frequently occurred in HCP aged &#8805;65 years.

441876,Essential role of STAT5a in DCIS formation and invasion following estrogen treatment,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Papaverine is a topical vasodilator commonly used during microvascular surgery to inhibit undesired vasoconstriction. A previous national shortage of papaverine prompted evaluation of an alternative, effective vasodilator. This study aims to assess the experience of a solution of verapamil and nitroglycerin (VG) as a potential alternative pharmacologic vasodilator. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Two tertiary academic medical centers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Among 298 patients, 306 consecutive free tissue transfers performed between 2014 and 2017 for head and neck defect reconstruction utilized a VG solution. Patient and flap characteristics, intraoperative patient and flap complications, and postoperative complications were reviewed. Diameter of the cervical recipient artery was measured intraoperatively before and after topical application of the VG solution in a subset of 43 patients (44 flaps). RESULTS: Flaps included fibula, radial forearm, subscapular system, and anterolateral thigh. In total, 3 (0.98%) flaps failed with varied etiology unrelated to the VG solution (venous thrombosis, arterial anastomosis thrombosis, physical damage to the perforator). Specific to topical application of the VG solution, the mean recipient artery diameter increased from 2.1 to 3.1 mm, a 48% increase (P < .01). There were no intraoperative cardiac events or complications attributable to the VG solution. CONCLUSION: We describe the use of a VG solution for pharmacologic vasodilation during microvascular free tissue transfer. Its use was associated with an acceptable incidence of adverse events, none of which were directly attributable to the VG solution. Apparent and sustained vasodilation was demonstrated. The VG solution represents a safe and efficacious alternative to papaverine in microvascular surgery.","Seth, Rahul; Badran, Karam W; Cedars, Elizabeth; Plonowska, Karolina; Benjamin, Tania; Saggi, Satvir; Knott, P Daniel; Heaton, Chase M; Blackwell, Keith E",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,129

Presentation of case: A 42-year old man was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia. Fever, respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia significantly improved over the next 2 weeks, but the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea, and low-grade fever. Computed tomography scan revealed absence of contrast enhancement of gallbladder wall and a micro-perforation of the fundus. At laparoscopy, gallbladder gangrene was confirmed and a subtotal cholecystectomy performed. Special precautions were adopted for patient transportation from the ward to a dedicated operating room, and two teams with adequate personal protective equipment took charge of the procedure. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 7 under protective lockdown measures for 2 weeks. Discussion: The pathogenesis of acute acalcolous gangrenous cholecystitis is multifactorial. It is unknown whether a prothrombotic state induced by COVID-19 contributes to wall ischemia and perforation. Percutaneous cholecystostomy should be avoided in patients with gallbladder gangrene. Contraindications to laparoscopy are not evidence-based since aerosolization is produced during both open and laparoscopic surgical procedures. However, personal protective equipment is key for prevention. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and surgical therapy are critical in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis.

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered spontaneous and intensive media attention, which has affected people's adoption of personal preventive measures and their mental health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between exposure to COVID-19-specific information and mental health (depression and sleep quality) and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures (face mask wearing and hand sanitizing). We also tested whether these associations were moderated by thoughtful consideration of the veracity of the information to which people were exposed. METHODS: A cross-sectional, closed web-based survey was conducted among a sample of 3035 factory workers at the beginning of work resumption following the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used for recruitment. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable moderate-to-severe depression was 170/3035 (5.6%), while that of good or excellent sleep quality was 2110/3035 (69.5%). The prevalence of self-reported consistent face mask wearing in public places was 2903/3035 (95.7%), while that of sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching public installations was 2151/3035 (70.9%). Of the 3035 respondents, 1013 to 1638 (33.3% to 54.0%) reported >1 hour of daily exposure to COVID-19-specific information through web-based media and television. After controlling for significant background variables, higher information exposure via television and via newspapers and magazines was associated with better sleep quality and higher compliance with hand sanitizing. Higher exposure via unofficial web-based media was associated with higher compliance with hand sanitizing but was also associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, higher exposure through face-to-face communication was associated with higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and lower compliance with hand sanitizing. Exposure to information about positive outcomes for patients with COVID-19, development of vaccines and effective treatments, and heroic stories about frontline health care workers were associated with both better mental health and higher compliance with preventive measures. Higher overall information exposure was associated with higher depressive symptoms among participants who were less likely to carefully consider the veracity of the information to which they were exposed; it was also associated with better sleep quality among people who reported more thoughtful consideration of information veracity. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence of how the amount, sources, and contents of information to which people were exposed influenced their mental health and compliance with personal preventive measures at the initial phase of work resumption in China. Thoughtful consideration of information quality was found to play an important moderating role. Our findings may inform strategic risk communication by government and public health authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pan, Yihang; Xin, Meiqi; Zhang, Changhua; Dong, Willa; Fang, Yuan; Wu, Wenhui; Li, Mingzhe; Pang, Jun; Zheng, Zilong; Wang, Zixin; Yuan, Jinqiu; He, Yulong",J Med Internet Res,,129

445412,Response to Letter by Rallis and Tejerina,2020,"A novel strain of coronavirus, namely, SARS-CoV-2 identified in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. There are no specific therapies available and investigations regarding the treatment of this disease are still lacking. In order to identify a novel potent inhibitor, we performed blind docking studies on the main virus protease Mpro with eight approved drugs belonging to four pharmacological classes such as: anti-malarial, anti-bacterial, anti-infective and anti-histamine. Among the eight studied compounds, Lymecycline and Mizolastine appear as potential inhibitors of this protease. When docked against Mpro crystal structure, these two compounds revealed a minimum binding energy of -8.87 and -8.71 kcal/mol with 168 and 256 binding modes detected in the binding substrate pocket, respectively. Further, to study the interaction mechanism and conformational dynamics of protein-ligand complexes, Molecular dynamic simulation and MM/PBSA binding free calculations were performed. Our results showed that both Lymecycline and Mizolastine bind in the active site. And exhibited good binding affinities towards target protein. Moreover, the ADMET analysis also indicated drug-likeness properties. Thus it is suggested that the identified compounds can inhibit Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2.","Tachoua, Wafa; Kabrine, Mohamed; Mushtaq, Mamona; Ul-Haq, Zaheer",J Mol Graph Model,,129

446436,Happy Hypoxemia in COVID-19-A Neural Hypothesis,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has come to impact all areas of life involving the health, psycho-social and economic wellbeing of individuals, as well as all stages of life from childhood to old age. Particularly, the frail elderly have had to face the gravest consequences of the disease;while reporting measures tend to differ between countries making direct comparisons difficult, national statistics worldwide point to a disproportionate and staggering share of COVID-19 related mortality coming from residential long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Still, the severity of the impact on the institutionalized elderly has not been uniform across countries. In an effort to better understand the disparities in impact on Europe?s elderly living in LTCFs, we review data on mortality outcomes seen during the first wave of the pandemic (months March to June 2020). We then set out to understand the role played by the following two factors: (1) the infection rate in the general population and (2) member state adherence to policy recommendations put forth by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) targeting the LTC sector. Regarding the latter, we compare the content of national policy measures in six countries ? Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Sweden ? with those of the ECDC. Our findings establish that infection rates in the general population accounted for most of the variation in mortality among member states, however adherence to EU policy helped to explain the residual variation between cases. This suggests that in order to best protect the institutionalized elderly from infectious disease of this kind, countries need to adopt a two-pronged approach to developing measures: one that aims at reducing transmission within the general population and one that specifically targets LTCFs.","Frisina Doetter, Lorraine Preuß Benedikt Rothgang Heinz",Global Social Policy,,129

We share our academic institution's experience in mitigating the disruption on the CME programme amidst the pandemic. Most specialty training programmes had switched to videoconferencing to maintain teaching. Some programmes also utilized small group teachings with precautions and e-learning modules. Surgical residencies were disproportionately affected due to reductions in elective procedures but some ways to provide continued surgical exposure include going through archived surgical videos with technical pointers from experienced faculty and usage of surgical simulators .

Official reports of suspected cases were used to appraise the general screening, case management, and the emergency preparedness and response of the country towards the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the surveillance and capacity to screen at the ports of entry, the country seems to be faring well. The country might not be screening optimally, considering the number of COVID-19 tests conducted to date and the suspected cases who missed testing. Three of the suspected cases faced mental, social, and psychological consequences due to them being suspected cases of COVID-19. There is a need to enhance the screening process and infrastructure at all the ports of entry. More COVID-19 diagnostic tests should be procured to increase the testing capacity.

449054,Comment on: Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis: reply,2020,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 by contact (direct or indirect) is widely accepted, but the relative importance of airborne transmission is still controversial. Probability of outdoor airborne transmission depends on several parameters, still rather uncertain: virus-laden aerosol concentrations, viability and lifetime, minimum dose necessary to transmit the disease. In this work, an estimate of outdoor concentrations in northern Italy (region Lombardia) was performed using a simple box model approach, based on an estimate of respiratory emissions, with a specific focus for the cities of Milan and Bergamo (Italy). In addition, the probability of interaction of virus-laden aerosol with pre-existing particles of different sizes was investigated. Results indicate very low (<1 RNA copy/m3) average outdoor concentrations in public area, excluding crowded zones, even in the worst case scenario and assuming a number of infects up to 25% of population. On average, assuming a number of infects equal to 10% of the population, the time necessary to inspire a quantum (i.e. the dose of airborne droplet nuclei required to cause infection in 63% of susceptible persons) would be 31.5 days in Milan (range 2.7-91 days) and 51.2 days in Bergamo (range 4.4-149 days). Therefore, the probability of airborne transmission due to respiratory aerosol is very low in outdoor conditions, even if it could be more relevant for community indoor environments, in which further studies are necessary to investigate the potential risks. We theoretically examined if atmospheric particles can scavenge virus aerosol, through inertial impact, interception, and Brownian diffusion. The probability was very low. In addition, the probability of coagulation of virus-laden aerosol with pre-existing atmospheric particles resulted negligible for accumulation and coarse mode particles, but virus-laden aerosol could act as sink of ultrafine particles (around 0.01 µm in diameter). However, this will not change significantly the dynamics behaviour of the virus particle or its permanence time in atmosphere.","Belosi, Franco; Conte, Marianna; Gianelle, Vorne; Santachiara, Gianni; Contini, Daniele",Environ Res,,129

In this essay, a patient recovering from COVID-19 analyzes how histories of epidemics often follow the logic proposed by the discipline of epidemiology itself: a focus on acute cases and on a tracking of the ""peak(s)"" often means that longer temporalities of suffering are hidden. In contrast, this essay follows ""Long Covid""-an illness collectively made and named by patients, which changed how the natural history of a new disease (COVID-19) was being mapped out by conventional scientific experts. Long Covid conceptualizes time differently from common categories and prefixes used in medicine and epidemiology, such as the ""chronic"" or the ""post-."" The collective labor of ill people thinking from the sickbed-both those with Long Covid and those working to bring to visibility other illnesses and the sequelae of other epidemics-has allowed other possible arrangements of sick bodies, symptoms, and diagnostic classifications to come into view. These arrangements hold potential for historians of medicine, as well as for clinical scientists.","Callard, Felicity",Bull Hist Med,,129

The aims of this study were to explore medical students' perception on the school's response and management of clinical rotation during the COVID-19 pandemic and on how it had affected the quality of their education. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to third year medical students at one institution whose clinical rotations re-started during the pandemic. The questions asked about the students' satisfaction with the school's policy and feelings of safety, and the impact of COVID-19 on clinical learning. RESULTS: The students' perception on the school's response to the pandemic was mixed. Re-commencement of the clinical rotations and procurement of personal protective equipment was positive but a third of students still felt unsafe. The decreased number of hospital patients did not seem to have impacted their overall clinical education with praise on the role of the supervising physicians. Seventy-six-point seven percent of students conferred the positive educational opportunities on medical professionalism presented to them only as the clinical rotation during the ongoing pandemic.

In clinic, four stages (A, B, C, and D) were used to describe heart failure progression. This study was aimed to explore plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles in different HF stages to identify potential biomarkers. Metabolomics and lipidomics were performed using plasma of heart failure patients at stages A (n = 49), B (n = 61), and C+D (n = 26). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for screening dysregulated molecules. Bioinformatics was used to retrieve perturbed metabolic pathways. Univariate and multivariate receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were used for potential biomarker screening. Stage A showed significant difference to other stages, and 142 dysregulated lipids and 134 dysregulated metabolites were found belonging to several metabolic pathways. Several marker panels were proposed for the diagnosis of heart failure stage A versus stage B-D. Several molecules, including lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2, cholesteryl ester 18:1, alanine, choline, and Fructose, were found correlated with B-type natriuretic peptide or left ventricular ejection fractions.

458738,Lactoferrin for the treatment of COVID-19 (Review),2020,"Food systems are important sites of economic stress, political response and adaptation. Access to food is also an important marker of how well a society distributes its wealth, reflecting the state of political accountability, economic redistribution, and the society's level of commitment to uphold the right to food. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the interconnected weaknesses of our food, social and economic systems and offers lessons for building more just and resilient food systems. We focus on three lessons learned anew in the pandemic: (1) food insecurity both reflects and reinforces inequity, (2) food workers are essential yet treated as sacrificial, and (3) racialized migrant food workers face unique forms of inequity. These lessons – chosen for their ethical salience, global relevance, and political urgency – show how interconnected inequities revealed by the pandemic are undermining resilience. We conclude with specific policy recommendations for redress, both within and beyond food systems. This will not be the final global pandemic, nor is it the only shock that regions are currently experiencing. COVID-19 is an opening to think about how societies might center justice and equity in efforts to build back better. Governments should take this opportunity to invest in structural changes to reduce persistent inequities in food access due to poverty, health outcomes, decent work and overall wellbeing, especially for racialized communities and migrants.","Klassen, Susanna; Murphy, Sophia",World Dev.,,129

One especially disconcerting change was patient addressability to medical facilities, as well as access to proper healthcare in various fields. As these changes occurred rapidly, dermatologists too had to adapt by means of teledermatology, giving us back the ability to reach, treat, and comfort our patients. Among the individuals requiring special dermatological attention are those suffering from psoriasis, especially considering that the biological therapies employed in treating this debilitating disease become questionable in the circumstance of the current pandemic. As more evidence surfaces concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, we become closer to understanding which therapies may interfere with its clearance, and which are actually safe to use. This review aims to answer the question, are biological therapies warranted in the treatment of psoriasis during the COVID-19 outbreak, or should they be discontinued?","Timis, Teodora-Larisa; Florian, Ioan-Alexandru; Vesa, Stefan-Cristian; Orasan, Remus-Ioan",J Dermatolog Treat,,129

462586,The TOMM40 '523' polymorphism in disease risk and age of symptom onset in two independent cohorts of Parkinson's disease,2021,"Democrats and Republicans have seemed to grow apart in the past three decades. Since the United States as we know it today is undeniably bipartisan, this phenomenon would not appear as a surprise to most. However, there are triggers which can cause spikes in disagreements between Democrats and Republicans at a higher rate than how the two parties have been growing apart gradually over time. This study has analyzed the idea that national events which generally are detrimental to all individuals can be one of those triggers. By testing polarization before and after three events (Hurricane Sandy [2012], N. Korea Missile Test Surge [2019], COVID-19 [2020]) using Twitter data, we show that a measurable spike in polarization occurs between the Democrat and Republican party. In order to measure polarization, sentiments of Twitter users aligned to the Democrat and Republican parties are compared on identical entities (events, people, locations, etc.). Using hundreds of thousands of data samples, a 2.8% increase in polarization was measured during times of crisis compared to times where no crises were occurring. Regardless of the reasoning that the gap between political parties can increase so much during times of suffering and stress, it is definitely alarming to see that among other aspects of life, the partisan gap worsens during detrimental national events.","Shisode, Parth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15669v1.pdf,129

Using Google's data on community mobility, I employ an event-study design to compare the effects of movement restrictions on physical mobility in the U.S. and Europe. I find that compared to Europe, the U.S. has higher levels of mobility related to visits to groceries and pharmacies and lower levels of the residential presence relative to baseline values, and the differences are not only statistically significant but also of large magnitudes. Such differences in post-restriction mobility are still significant between Europe and the U.S.' early epicenters of COVID-19. The main results of this paper are robust to changes in samples and specifications. These findings suggest that movement restrictions appear to be less effective in the U.S., which have useful implications for health policy evaluation, pandemic forecasting, and economic recovery.","Xu, Dafeng",Econ Hum Biol,,129

472945,Association between adjuvant chemotherapy and survival in patients with rectal cancer and pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and resection,2020,"BACKGROUND: Among the challenges for personalizing the management of mechanically ventilated patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the effects of different positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and body positions in regional lung mechanics. Right-left lung aeration asymmetry and poorly recruitable lungs with increased recruitability with alternating body position between supine and prone have been reported. However, real-time effects of changing body position and PEEP on regional overdistension and collapse, in individual patients, remain largely unknown and not timely monitored. The aim of this study was to individualize PEEP and body positioning in order to reduce the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury: collapse and overdistension. METHODS: We here report a series of five consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS in which sixteen decremental PEEP titrations were performed in the first days of mechanical ventilation (8 titration pairs: supine position immediately followed by 30° targeted lateral position). The choice of lateral tilt was based on X-Ray. This targeted lateral position strategy was defined by selecting the less aerated lung to be positioned up and the more aerated lung to be positioned down. For each PEEP level, global and regional collapse and overdistension maps and percentages were measured by electrical impedance tomography. Additionally, we present the incidence of lateral asymmetry in a cohort of forty-four patients. RESULTS: The targeted lateral position strategy resulted in significantly smaller amounts of overdistension and collapse when compared with the supine one: less collapse along the PEEP titration was found within the left lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.014); and less overdistension along the PEEP titration was found within the right lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.005). Regarding collapse within the right lung and overdistension within the left lung: no differences were found for position. In the cohort of forty-four patients, ventilation inequality of > 65/35% was observed in 15% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted lateral positioning with bedside personalized PEEP provided a selective attenuation of overdistension and collapse in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS and right-left lung aeration/ventilation asymmetry.

474040,Oncologic Safety of Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy in Patients with Breast Cancer and Tumor-to-Nipple Distance ≤ 1 cm: A Matched Cohort Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. As a response, the United States shut down public gatherings and businesses in an effort to quarantine. This included the stopping of elective operations, which greatly affected plastic surgeons and their practices during the initial shutdown. OBJECTIVES: We aim to study the early impact of COVID-19 on the financial implications and practice patterns of plastic surgeons in the state of California during the initial shutdown of elective surgery and provide guidelines for effective management during future crises. METHODS: A 20-question survey was sent using Qualtrics XM software to 851 surgeon members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey was open from May 13, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Standard statistical analysis was completed to compare private practice and nonprivate practice plastic surgeons. RESULTS: We had a total of 140 respondents to our survey for a 16.5% response rate. The majority (77.1%) of the respondents were in a private practice setting. Private practice plastic surgeons reported a higher financial impact with a 79% reduction in financial income compared with nonprivate practice plastic surgeons at a 37% reduction (P < 0.0001). Additionally, private practice plastic surgeons demonstrated a higher reduction in case volume and were more likely to lay off or furlough staff, close their practice, and apply for loans (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey study showed that private practice plastic surgeons in the state of California faced the most financial hardship during the early shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a valuable snapshot in our economic history and depicts the heavy financial impact of the stopping of elective surgery. Since the reopening of practices, new guidelines have been implemented to maintain safe elective surgery while the pandemic continues. Further follow-up studies on both the state and national level need to be completed to see the continued financial effects on private and nonprivate plastic surgery practices since the reopening and resumption of elective surgery.","Crowley, Jiwon Sarah; Reghunathan, Meera; Kadakia, Nikita; Barttelbort, Scott; Gosman, Amanda",Ann Plast Surg,,129

The aim of this study was to elucidate the household transmission mode and to further estimate effective and basic reproductive number with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). METHODS: A total of 26 households with 39 family clusters between January, 2020 and February, 2021 in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. The Becker's chain binomial model was used to analyze the probabilities of being infected and escaping from SARS-COV-2 before and after January 1st, 2021, which were further converted to estimating basic reproductive numbers in the absence of NPIs. The likelihood of leading to the subsequent community-acquired outbreak given NPIs was further assessed. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate was 46.2%. Given the saturated Greenwood model selected as the best fitted model, the probability of being infected and escaping from COVID-19 within household was estimated as 44.4% (95% CI: 5.0%-53.7%) and 55.7% (95% CI: 46.3%-65.0%), respectively. In the second period of early 2021, the infected probability was increased to 58.3% (95% CI: 12.7%-90.0%) and the escape probability was lowered to 41.7% (95% CI: 0.0%-86.9%). The corresponding basic reproductive numbers (R0) increased from 4.29 in the first period to 6.73 in the second period without NPIs. However, none of subsequent community-acquired outbreak was noted in Taiwan given very effective NPIs in both periods. CONCLUSION: The proposed method and results are useful for designing household-specific containment measures and NPIs to stamp out a large-scale community-acquired outbreak as demonstrated in Taiwan.","Hsu, Chen-Yang; Wang, Jann-Tay; Huang, Kuo-Chin; Fan, Antoria Chiao-Hsin; Yeh, Yen-Po; Chen, Sam Li-Sheng",J Formos Med Assoc,,129

METHODS: 1008 severe COVID-19 patients, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive detected with the mixed specimen of nasopharyngeal swab and oropharyngeal swab by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), were selected to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the 12 types of specimens by RT-qPCR during hospitalization. All of 20 discharged cases with COVID-19 were selected to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in isolation period with 7 types of specimens by RT-qPCR before releasing the isolation period. RESULTS: Of the enrolled 1008 severe patients, the nasopharyngeal swab specimens showed the highest positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (71.06%), followed by alveolar lavage fluid (66.67%), oropharyngeal swab (30.77%), sputum (28.53%), urine (16.30%), blood (12.5%), stool (12.21%), anal swab (11.22%) and corneal secretion (2.99%), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA couldn't be detected in other types of specimen in this study. Of the 20 discharged cases during the isolation period, the positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 30% (6/20): 2 cases were positive in sputum at the eighth and ninth day after discharge, respectively, 1 case was positive in nasopharynx swab at the sixth day after discharge, 1 case was positive in anal swab at the eighth day after discharge, and 1 case was positive in 3 specimens (nasopharynx swab, oropharynx swab and sputum) simultaneously at the fourth day after discharge, and no positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in other specimens including stool, urine and blood at the discharged patients. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be detected in multiple specimens, such as nasopharynx swab, oropharynx swab, sputum, and if necessary, stool and anal swab specimens should be performed simultaneously at discharge when the patients were considered for clinical cure and before releasing the isolation period.","Tong, Yongqing; Bao, Anyu; Chen, Hongbing; Huang, Jingtao; Lv, Zhihua; Feng, Lina; Cheng, Yun; Wang, Youna; Bai, Li; Rao, Wenlong; Zheng, Hongyun; Wu, Zegang; Qiao, Bin; Zhao, Zhijun; Wang, Huiming; Li, Yan",J Transl Med,,129

479211,Chronic Disaster: Reimagining Noncommunicable Chronic Disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pokémon Go is a very popular location-based augmented reality game with widespread influences over the world. An emerging body of research demonstrates that playing Pokémon Go can lead to improvements in physical activity and psychosocial well-being; however, whether Pokémon Go reduces self-harm incidence at the population-level is still questionable. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify how the launch of Pokémon Go in Hong Kong affected the incidence of self-harm using a quasi-experimental design. METHODS: An interrupted time-series design with Poisson segmented regression adjusted for time and seasonality trends was used on data from 2012 to 2018 to detect any changes in the number of accident and emergency attendances due to self-harm, after Pokémon Go was launched. The findings were validated using a baseline control period and using other intentional injuries and minor noninjuries as control outcomes. We also assessed intervention effects by age group. RESULTS: From January 1, 2012 to July 31, 2018, there were 13,463 accident and emergency attendances due to self-harm in Hong Kong. During the period after launching Pokémon Go, self-harm attendances dropped by 34% (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.66, 95% CI 0.61-0.73). When analyzed by age group, a reduction in self-harm incidence was only apparent in adults (18 to 24 years of age: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.78, P=.02; 25 to 39 years of age: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.75, P<.001; 40 years of age and older: adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.57, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-harm incidence in the population, particularly in adults, showed a significant decline in the period after Pokémon Go was launched. Augmented reality games such as Pokémon Go show great promise as a tool to enhance psychosocial well-being and improve mental health.","Wong, Rosa Sze Man; Ho, Frederick Ka Wing; Tung, Keith Tsz Suen; Fu, King-Wa; Ip, Patrick",JMIR Serious Games,,129

Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful, policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb.In this paper, we propose to augment epidemiological forecasting with actual data-driven models that will learn to fine-tune predictions for different contexts (e.g., per country). We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen countries. When used for forecasting, this approach provides actionable insights into the impact of individual measures and strategies.","Ghamizi, Salah; Rwemalika, Renaud; Veiber, Lisa; Cordy, Maxime; Bissyande, Tegawende F.; Papadakis, Mike; Klein, Jacques; Traon, Yves Le",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07087v1.pdf,129

However, the exact role and timing of ECMO for COVID-19 patients remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective comparison of the first 32 patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS to the last 28 patients with influenza-associated ARDS placed on V-V ECMO. We compared patient factors between the two cohorts and used survival analysis to compare the hazard of mortality over sixty days post-cannulation. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were older (mean 47.8 vs. 41.2 years, p = 0.033), had more ventilator days before cannulation (mean 4.5 vs. 1.5 days, p < 0.001). Crude in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort at 65.6% (n = 21/32) versus 36.3% (n = 11/28, p = 0.041). The adjusted hazard ratio over sixty days for COVID-19 patients was 2.81 (95% CI 1.07, 7.35) after adjusting for age, race, ECMO-associated organ failure, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION: ECMO has a role in severe ARDS associated with COVID-19 but providers should carefully weigh patient factors when utilizing this scarce resource in favor of influenza pneumonia.","Raff, Lauren A; Reid, Trista D; Johnson, Daniel; Raff, Evan J; Schneider, Andrew B; Charles, Anthony G; Gallaher, Jared R",Am. j. surg,,129

485118,Optical Coherence Tomography Detects Retinal Changes in Hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy,2020,"Children seem to be less severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as compared to adults. Little is known about the prevalence and pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in children affected by SARS-CoV-2. Dehydration seems to be the most common trigger factor, and meticulous attention to fluid status is imperative. The principles of initiation, prescription, and complications related to renal replacement therapy are the same for coronavirus disease (COVID) patients as for non-COVID patients. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains the most common modality of treatment. When to initiate and what modality to use are dependent on the available resources. Though children are less often and less severely affected, diversion of all hospital resources to manage the adult surge might lead to limited CRRT resources. We describe how these shortages might be mitigated. Where machines are limited, one CRRT machine can be used for multiple patients, providing a limited number of hours of CRRT per day. In this case, increased exchange rates can be used to compensate for the decreased duration of CRRT. If consumables are limited, lower doses of CRRT (15-20 mL/kg/h) for 24 h may be feasible. Hypercoagulability leading to frequent filter clotting is an important issue in these children. Increased doses of unfractionated heparin, combination of heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation, or combination of prostacyclin and heparin might be used. If infusion pumps to deliver anticoagulants are limited, the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin might be considered. Alternatively in children, acute peritoneal dialysis can successfully control both fluid and metabolic disturbances. Intermittent hemodialysis can also be used in patients who are hemodynamically stable. The keys to successfully managing pediatric AKI in a pandemic are flexible use of resources, good understanding of dialysis techniques, and teamwork.","Deep, Akash; Bansal, Mehak; Ricci, Zaccaria",Blood Purif,,129

The current paper considers Tennessee's ``open-testing'' policy where the state substantially increased the number of available tests while opening testing to all individuals that wanted a test; this is unlike most other states that have required that individuals must be showing specific symptoms in order to be tested. In the current paper, we examine whether Tennessee's policy has affected (i) the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, (ii) the number of trips to work, and (iii) the (unobserved) number of actual Covid-19 cases. To study these effects, we employ standard identifying assumptions in the policy evaluation literature, but this strategy is greatly complicated by the non-random nature of the tests. We construct bounds on the policy effects of interest. We find suggestive evidence that Tennessee's open-testing policy has led to a reduction in the number of confirmed and total cases as well as reduced travel in counties that have experienced relatively large increases in confirmed cases.","Callaway, Brantly; Li, Tong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09605v1.pdf,129

However, the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of favipiravir therapy and the potential for resistance development is unclear. METHODS: We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens collected from patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of favipiravir at hospitals across Japan between March and May 2020. Paired genomes were sequenced from those who remained RT-PCR-positive 5-8 days into favipiravir therapy. Daily nasopharyngeal specimens from 69 patients who were RT-PCR-positive at randomization were examined for a cytopathic effect (CPE). RESULTS: Some strains early in the trial belonged to clade 19 B, whereas the majority belonged to clade 20 B. The median time from the disease onset to negative CPE was 9 days. CPE was strongly correlated with the time from disease onset, viral load, age, and male sex. Among 23 patients for whom paired genomes were available, all except one had identical genomes. Two mutations were observed in one patient who received favipiravir, neither in the RdRp gene. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome distribution in this clinical trial conducted in Japan reflected the early influx of strains from China followed by replacement by strains from Europe. CPE was significantly associated with age, male sex, and viral loads but not with favipiravir therapy. There was no evidence of resistance development during favipiravir therapy.","Suzuki, Masahiro; Imai, Takumi; Sakurai, Aki; Komoto, Satoshi; Ide, Tomihiko; Lim, Chang Kweng; Shintani, Ayumi; Doi, Yohei; Murata, Takayuki",J Infect Chemother,,129

491331,Impact of COVID-19 on peripheral blood stem cell mobilization for myeloma patients,2021,"Combining the increasing availability and abundance of healthcare data and the current advances in machine learning methods have created renewed opportunities to improve clinical decision support systems. However, in healthcare risk prediction applications, the proportion of cases with the condition (label) of interest is often very low relative to the available sample size. Though very prevalent in healthcare, such imbalanced classification settings are also common and challenging in many other scenarios. So motivated, we propose a variational disentanglement approach to semi-parametrically learn from rare events in heavily imbalanced classification problems. Specifically, we leverage the imposed extreme-distribution behavior on a latent space to extract information from low-prevalence events, and develop a robust prediction arm that joins the merits of the generalized additive model and isotonic neural nets. Results on synthetic studies and diverse real-world datasets, including mortality prediction on a COVID-19 cohort, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing alternatives.","Xiu, Zidi; Tao, Chenyang; Gao, Michael; Davis, Connor; Goldstein, Benjamin A.; Henao, Ricardo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08541v5.pdf,129

Methods: We sent an 18-item survey to 1,213 patients who underwent elective hand and upper extremity surgery at 1 academic institution from October 2020 to January 2021. The survey consisted of questions related to patient demographics, treatment delays due to COVID-19, and patient perceptions of COVID-19 precautions. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the survey responses. Responses for patients aged 18-50 and 51+ were compared using a chi-square analysis for categorical variables and a Student t-test for continuous variables. Results: Out of 1,213 invitations, 384 survey respondents completed the survey (31.6%). Of the respondents, 16.8% reported delaying medical treatment for an average of 123.2 days because of COVID-19. The preventative measures were found to be adequate by 95% of patients. Only 2.6% of patients reported experiencing surgical delays due to preoperative COVID-19 testing or other COVID-19-related precautions. COVID-19 testing was seen as necessary by 88% of patients, and 74% did not find COVID-19 testing to be a barrier to their surgery. Patients aged 51+ were more likely to delay seeking medical treatment than younger patients (19.3% vs 9.1%, respectively). Furthermore, those that did delay seeking treatment waited longer on average than their younger counterparts (136.1 vs 72.9 days, respectively). Conclusions: In conclusion, patients undergoing hand and upper extremity surgery typically do not find COVID-19 precautions to be a significant barrier to care and understand their importance. Despite this, many patients, particularly older ones, are delaying medical care for extended periods of time. It is important for hand surgeons to acknowledge their patients' perspectives and work to educate patients on evolving surgical safety guidelines.

As the world attempts to navigate through this difficult time, most companies are struggling to maintain a steady flow of required goods and services. Whether it is frozen foods and grocery items (i.e., toilet papers), or ventilators and masks, or even the services (i.e., clinic visits), the supply chain has been facing multiple obstacles. Most models and frameworks built in the extant literature are not been able to capture these disruptions and as such, firms are not having proper strategies to deal with. For firms with complex supply chains (i.e., manufacturing, retailing), it is indeed critical to identify strategies to deal with such a crisis. In this paper, we intend to offer strategic insights in terms of major issues firms are facing and strategic options firms are contemplating. We rely on the twitter data from NASDAQ 100 firms to generate themes regarding the issues faced by the firms and the strategies they are adopting using text analytics tools. We find that firms are facing challenges in terms of demand-supply mismatch, technology, and development of a resilient supply chain. Moreover, moving beyond profitability, firms are experiencing difficulties to construct a sustainable supply chain. We provide futuristic strategic recommendations for the rebuilding of the supply chain.","Sharma, Amalesh; Adhikary, Anirban; Borah, Sourav Bikash",J. Bus. Res.,,129

Methods: We have specified a novel multi-parameter generalized logistic growth model, which does not only look at the trend of the data, but also includes explanatory covariates, using a quasi-Poisson regression specification to account for overdispersion of the count data. We fitted our model to data from the onset of the disease (February 28) until September 15. Estimating the parameters from our model, we predicted the growth of the epidemic for the evolution of the disease until the end of October 2020. We also evaluated via simulations different fictional scenarios for the outcome of alternative policies (those analyses are included in the Supplementary Material). Results and Conclusions: The evolution of the disease has not followed an exponential growth, but rather, stabilized and moved downward after July 2020, starting to increase again after the implementation of the Step-by-Step policy. The lockdown policy implemented in the majority of the country has proven effective in stopping the spread, and the lockdown-relaxation policies, however gradual, appear to have caused an upward break in the trend.","Vicuña, María Ignacia; Vásquez, Cristián; Quiroga, Bernardo F",Front Public Health,,129
494017,Laboratory testing for ADAMTS13: Utility for TTP diagnosis/exclusion and beyond,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increasing number of reports have observed thrombosis in severe cases of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of thromboembolism in mild/moderate cases of COVID-19. All of the patients had normal coagulation tests and none had any overt thrombotic complications. Our findings indicate that it is important to screen the thrombotic status of cases with mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: Between 11 June and 8 July 2020, 23 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 pneumonia consented to having computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CPTA) and computed tomography venography (CTV) scans of the lungs and extremity veins. Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was also performed in all patients for screening. The incidence, clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, imaging features, and prognosis, of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) were analyzed and compared with those of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia without VTE. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (82.6%) had VTE, mainly distal limb thrombosis. Only one of the VTE patients was positive when screened by DUS; the other VTE patients were negative by DUS. All of the mild/moderate patients with VTE were screened by CTPA + CTV. Blood tests for inflammatory, coagulation, and biochemical, parameters were all within the normal range, except for WBC and LDH. CONCLUSIONS: When using CTV screening for DVT, we found that the incidence of thrombosis in patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 markedly increased to 82.6% (19/23). Screening for thrombosis is therefore important in patients with COVID-19. CTV is more sensitive than DUS for the detection of thrombosis. More research is now needed to evaluate the significance of thrombosis in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Chen, Budong; Jiang, Chunguo; Han, Bing; Guan, Chunshuang; Fang, Gaoli; Yan, Shuo; Wang, Kexin; Liu, Ligai; Conlon, Christopher P; Xie, Ruming; Song, Rui",Int J Infect Dis,,129

Building upon previous works that introduced a smartphone-based coding course to secondary and tertiary students in Ghana via an in-person program and an online course, this work introduced Africans in 37 countries to our online smartphone-based course in 2019. Students in this 8-week course read lesson notes, submitted assignments, collaborated with peers, and facilitators in an online forum and completed open and closed-ended surveys after the course. We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses on the data from the course. Out of the 709 students that applied, 210 were officially admitted to the course after passing the preliminary assignments. And at the end of the course, 72% of the 210 students completed the course. Additionally, students' assignment submissions and self-reports showed an understanding of the programming concepts, with comparable performance between males and females and across educational levels. Also, students mentioned that the lesson notes were easy to understand and they enjoyed the experience of writing code on their smartphones. Moreover, students adequately received help from peers and facilitators in the course forum. Lastly, results of a survey sent to students a year after completing this program showed that they had developed various applications, wrote online tutorials, and learned several tools and technologies. We were successful at introducing coding skills to Africans using smartphones through SuaCode Africa.","Boateng, George; Annor, Prince Steven; Kumbol, Victor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12257v1.pdf,129
497005,Vaccine Considerations for Multiple Sclerosis in the COVID-19 Era,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has prompted the extensive use of computational models to understand the trajectory of the pandemic. This article surveys the kinds of dynamic simulation models that have been used as decision support tools and to forecast the potential impacts of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). We developed the Values in Viral Dispersion model, which emphasizes the role of human factors and social networks in viral spread and presents scenarios to guide policy responses. METHODS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 was developed with individual agents able to move between 3 states (susceptible, infectious, or recovered), with each agent placed in 1 of 7 social network types and assigned a propensity to comply with NPIs (quarantine, contact tracing, and physical distancing). A series of policy questions were tested to illustrate the impact of social networks and NPI compliance on viral spread among (1) populations, (2) specific at-risk subgroups, and (3) individual trajectories. RESULTS: Simulation outcomes showed large impacts of physical distancing policies on number of infections, with substantial modification by type of social network and level of compliance. In addition, outcomes on metrics that sought to maximize those never infected (or recovered) and minimize infections and deaths showed significantly different epidemic trajectories by social network type and among higher or lower at-risk age cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Although dynamic simulation models have important limitations, which are discussed, these decision support tools should be a key resource for navigating the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and can help local and national decision makers determine where, when, and how to invest resources.","Page, Andrew; Diallo, Saikou Y; Wildman, Wesley J; Hodulik, George; Weisel, Eric W; Gondal, Neha; Voas, David",Simul. healthc,,129

This study aims to evaluate clinical and subclinical response to calcipotriol+betamethasone foam, in patients with PsO, comparing, for the first time, data from microvascular ultrasound (MicroV) and shear wave elastography (SWE) with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). METHODS: Between November 2018 and April 2019 in Tor Vergata Hospital (Roma, Italy), we enrolled 26 patients with PsO who were ageds 20-75 years, with PASI score &#8805;4, candidated for calcipotriol+betamethasone foam treatment. They underwent MicroV and SWE evaluation at baseline (T0) and after 4 weeks of treatment (T4). Clinical follow-up was carried on at T4, T8 and T12. Student's t-test (p values<0.05 statistically significant) was used to compare SWE and PASI values. RESULTS: At T0, SWE stiffness values of target plaques (61.5% on elbows, 23% knees, 7.7% sacrum,7.7% legs) were significantly higher than values under healthy skin. At T4, all patients showed a significant reduction of PASI; MicroV showed reduction in vascularisation of responsive plaques in 85% of cases, only in 15%, the vascularisation degree remained stable; and SWE values of target plaques were significantly lower compared with T0. Only in 7.7%, there was a relapse at T12. CONCLUSIONS: Calcipotriol+betamethasone foam is a very effective topical treatment in a short-medium term follow-up in patients with PsO. MicroV and SWE evaluate response to treatment (in term of plaque vascularisation and stiffness), so they could represent promising early indicators of therapeutic response and help the physician to establish a better clinical-therapeutic management of patients with PsO.","Guazzaroni, Manlio; Ferrari, Donatella; Lamacchia, Feliciana; Marisi, Vanessa; Tatulli, Doriana; Marsico, Salvatore; Orlacchio, Antonio; Floris, Roberto; Bianchi, Luca; Dattola, Annunziata",Postgrad. med. j,,129

However, effective, tailored mental health services and interventions cannot be achieved until we understand the patterns of mental health issues emerging after a public health crisis, especially in the context of the rapid transmission of COVID-19. Understanding the public's emotions and needs and their distribution attributes are therefore critical for creating appropriate public policies and eventually responding to the health crisis effectively, efficiently, and equitably. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to detect the temporal patterns in emotional fluctuation, significant events during the COVID-19 pandemic that affected emotional changes and variations, and hourly variations of emotions within a single day by analyzing data from the Chinese social media platform Weibo. METHODS: Based on a longitudinal dataset of 816,556 posts published by 27,912 Weibo users in Wuhan, China, from December 31, 2019, to April 31, 2020, we processed general sentiment inclination rating and the type of sentiments of Weibo posts by using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries. We also grouped the publication times into 5 time groups to measure changes in netizens' sentiments during different periods in a single day. RESULTS: Overall, negative emotions such as surprise, fear, and anger were the most salient emotions detected on Weibo. These emotions were triggered by certain milestone events such as the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. Emotions varied within a day. Although all emotions were more prevalent in the afternoon and night, fear and anger were more dominant in the morning and afternoon, whereas depression was more salient during the night. CONCLUSIONS: Various milestone events during the COVID-19 pandemic were the primary events that ignited netizens' emotions. In addition, Weibo users' emotions varied within a day. Our findings provide insights into providing better-tailored mental health services and interventions.","Yu, Shaobin; Eisenman, David; Han, Ziqiang",J Med Internet Res,,129

Here, we describe a novel application of biolayer interferometry for the rapid detection of antigen-specific antibody levels in plasma samples, and demonstrate its utility for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Our biolayer interferometry immunosorbent assay (BLI-ISA) utilizes single-use biosensors in an automated ""dip-and-read"" format, providing real-time optical measurements of antigen loading, plasma antibody binding, and antibody isotype detection. Complete semi-quantitative results are obtained in less than 20 min. BLI-ISA meets or exceeds the performance of high complexity methods such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Chemiluminescent Immunoassay. Importantly, our method can be immediately implemented on existing BLI platforms for urgent COVID-19 studies, such as serosurveillance and the evaluation of vaccine candidates. In a broader sense, BLI-ISA can be developed as a novel diagnostic platform to evaluate antibodies and other biomolecules in clinical specimens.","Dzimianski, John V; Lorig-Roach, Nicholas; O039,; Rourke, Sara M; Alexander, David L; Kimmey, Jacqueline M; DuBois, Rebecca M",Sci Rep,,129

Considering that myocardial response in COVID-19 is closely associated with in-hospital mortality, local biological effects on myocardial tissue from epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is warrant further discussion.","Zhao, Lei",Obesity (Silver Spring),,129

506228,Treatment and prognosis of COVID-19: Current scenario and prospects (Review),2021,"The service sector has been rocked by the COVID-19 pandemic. This stems in large part from the inseparable, high-contact nature of many services. During a pandemic, multiple forms of contact – customer-to-customer, customer-to-employee, employee-to-employee, and customer/employee-to-air/surfaces – can lead to serious illness or death. The urgent need for increased separability and decreased contact have led to a wave of service adaptations (firms’ efforts to improve safety) and service transformations (innovations that bolster safety while offering additional benefits that are superior to what existed previously). COVID-19 has made service safety paramount, with most attention being paid to minimizing disease transmission. However, safety needs in a pandemic extend beyond physical to include interrelated domains of emotional, financial, and information safety. Physical safety is the absence of harm or injury. Emotional safety is relief from mental distress arising from pandemic-related personal traumas. Financial safety concerns minimizing economic insecurity related to the pandemic. Information safety refers to people’s sense of confidence that they have the information they need to make good decisions, information that is trustworthy. We describe the unique service transformations addressing these safety concerns of Hong Kong International Airport, Henry Ford Health System (Detroit), Innocent Bystander (Australia), and Service Now that are likely to continue after the pandemic has passed. Important questions for service researchers to guide managers in reinventing how they create, deliver, and market services are highlighted.","Berry, Leonard L.; Danaher, Tracey S.; Aksoy, Lerzan; Keiningham, Timothy L.",J.

However, most studies failed to consider important cofounding factors in the estimation of health effects of air pollution. The objective of the study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of air pollution on the COVID-19 risk and fatality in Lombardy and Veneto. Air pollutants were studied based on monitoring station information in Lombardy and Veneto from January 2013 to May 2020. The daily number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were collected from the reports of the Italian Ministry of Health in Italy. A generalized linear model with the generalized estimating equation method was used to evaluate the effects of short- and long-term exposure to air pollution on the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy and Veneto. After adjusting for other covariates, we found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 had a tendency to increase the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than long-term exposure, while for other air pollutants, including SO2 and NO2, long-term exposure was more significant than short-term exposure. Both short- and long-term exposure of SO2 resulted in increased health effects on COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that exposure to atmospheric pollution has a significant impact on COVID-19 pandemic and call for further researches to deeply investigate this topic.","Ho, Chi-Chang; Hung, Shih-Chieh; Ho, Wen-Chao",Environ Res,,129

A total of 360 1-day-old male broilers were randomly divided into three groups containing six replicates with 20 broilers per replicate. The negative control (NC) group and the positive control (PC) group were given non-GM maize and non-GM maize plus exogenous vitamin E (VE), respectively, and the VER group was given VER replacing the non-GM maize given to the NC group. Between days 1 and 21 and days 22 and 42, VE levels were 4.38 and 4.63 mg kg-1 in the NC group, and 14.11 and 14.91 mg kg-1 in the PC and VER group, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that &#945;-tocopherol from both VER and additives increased &#945;-tocopherol transfer protein and cytochrome P450 concentrations. Additionally, serum &#945;-tocopherol and &#945;-tocopherylquinone levels of broilers in the PC and VER groups were significantly higher than those in the NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with the NC group, broilers in both groups that received &#945;-tocopherol had reduced NF-&#954;B p65 concentrations, significantly decreased serum prostaglandin E2 , IL-6, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide levels (P < 0.05), and significantly increased glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In summary, both VER and non-GM maize fortified with exogenous VE showed similar effects on broilers, indicating that the &#945;-tocopherol in VER has sufficient biological activity.

Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the origin and core location of the epidemic. Neurosurgeons were faced with the challenge of balancing treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions and preventing the cross-transmission of the virus. Methods: A series of infection prevention and control strategies was adopted for the peri-operative period of emergency surgeries in our department. These strategies include protective measures for the emergency department (ED) and measures for the peri-operative period of emergency surgery. The propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match COVID-19-related patients with patients before the epidemic. Length of wait time in the ED and duration of operation were compared. Results: From January 23, 2020 to March 18, 2020, we performed emergency surgery for 19 patients who were either COVID-19-related or COVID-19-suspected. None of the medical staff involved in the surgeries developed viral infection, and no peri-operative virus transmission occurred in our hospital. After the PSM, 32 patients were included in the epidemic group and the pre-epidemic group (16 patients in each group). The duration of wait time in the ED of the former group was longer than that of the latter group (z = -3.000; p = 0.003). During the epidemic, the duration of a craniotomy was longer than before the epidemic (z = -2.253; p = 0.024), and there was no difference in the duration of interventional surgery (z = -0.314; p = 0.753). Conclusion: We believe that our experience can provide a useful reference for other surgeons facing the same challenges and as a lesson for similar infectious diseases that may occur in the future.","Chen, Aobo; Song, Jian; Xu, Guozheng; Guan, Jiangheng; Xie, Tianhao","Surg. infect.,(Larchmt.)",,129

Here, we investigated asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection development and progression in subjects undergoing mandatory quarantine on airport arrival. METHODS: 2714 subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and all were quarantined for 2 weeks. Viral retesting was undertaken on symptom development and routinely at 14 days if asymptomatic. Asymptomatic positive patients underwent viral testing every 2 days to determine viral clearance. RESULTS: 188/2714(6.9%) patients became SARS-CoV-2 positive. On arrival, 44/188(23.4%) testing positive were symptomatic and 92/188(48.9%) were asymptomatic (136/188 positive on arrival); all 92 patients remained asymptomatic and were retested every 2-days until viral clearance. 2526 quarantined subjects remained virus free at 14-days.

510624,Plasma-Derived miRNA-222 as a Candidate Marker for Papillary Thyroid Cancer,2020,": Self-medication with antibiotics is a major contributing factor to antimicrobial resistance. Prior research examining factors associated with antibiotic self-medication has focused on an individual's knowledge about antibiotics, antibiotic usage practices, accessibility to antibiotic medication, and demographic characteristics. The role of psychological distress associated with perceived health risks in explaining antibiotic self-medication is less understood. This study was designed to address this knowledge gap in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. An online survey of 2217 participants was conducted at the height of the initial outbreak and revealed that 19.5% of participants took antibiotics to protect themselves from COVID-19. Multivariate logistic analysis examined the predictors of taking antibiotics for protection against COVID-19. An integrative framework developed from the results illustrates potential pathways and facilitating factors that may contribute to prophylactic self-medication with antibiotics. Specifically, COVID-19 pandemic-induced psychological distress was significantly positively related to self-medication. Preventive use of antibiotics was also facilitated by a lack of understanding about antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotics usage practices, the nature of the patient-doctor relationship, and demographic characteristics. The findings highlight that to combat antimicrobial resistance due to self-medication, interventions need to focus on interrupting entrenched behavioural responses and addressing emotional responses to perceived health risks.","Zhang, Airong; Hobman, Elizabeth V; De Barro, Paul; Young, Asaesja; Carter, David J; Byrne, Mitchell",,,129

Mortality from COVID-19 is much greater in elderly men, many of whom succumb to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) triggered by the viral infection. Because there is no specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19, new strategies are urgently needed. Selenium is an essential trace element with antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects. Poor nutritional status increases the pathogenicity of viruses and low selenium in particular can be a determinant of viral virulence. In the past decade, selenium pharmaconutrition studies have demonstrated some reduction in overall mortality, including how reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and infectious complications such as ARDS in the critically ill. Consequently, we postulate that intravenous selenium therapy, could be part of the therapeutic fight against COVID-19 in intensive care unit patients with ARDS and that outcomes could be affected by age, sex, and body weight. Our working hypothesis addresses the question: Could high-dose selenite pharmaconutrition, as an early pharmacologic intervention, be effective at reducing the incidence and the progression from type 1 respiratory failure (non-ARDS) to severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, and new infectious complications in patients with COVID-19 patients?","Manzanares, William; Moreira, Eduardo; Hardy, Gil",Nutrition,,129

Fifty three respondents had continued to provide a service. Forty now worked from a wholly/substantially different location to normal but many clinics provided no practical support for this (n = 17), or remote access to relevant clinic (n = 17) or client information (n = 12) and twenty five respondents reported reduced multi-disciplinary involvement. Few received regular information updates. Some whose service was stopped (n = 11) abruptly lost income and/or were unsure whether they could or would resume working. Increased remote counselling proved crucial for accessibility and could be effective. Concerns included fatigue, technical and practical challenges, confidentiality, lowered therapeutic effectiveness. Respondents supported patients having choice over how to receive counselling in the future but a third (n = 21) had not been included in such planning. These findings suggest the need for increased involvement and support of fertility counsellors in the event of a future waves, other pandemic or healthcare crisis. More needs to be understood about why clinic responses varied; how to improve the safety and efficacy of remote counselling; and how to accommodate future needs for face-to-face contact.","Pericleous-Smith, Angela; Dark, Suzanne; McCluskey, Gerry; Mizen, Lynda; Crawshaw, Marilyn",Hum Fertil (Camb),,129

In 2016, the United Nations highlighted the importance of societies investing sufficient funds in their professional nurses to support and promote public health, gender equality, and economic growth. Good-quality care requires that nurses have good physical and mental health, while creating and maintaining a friendly nursing work environment rely on cooperation among the government, labor unions, and hospitals. Over the past decade, the Taiwan government has increasingly promoted relevant regulations and established a friendly platform to allow nursing staffs to identify problems and report labor rights violations. In addition, nurses have formed unions to defend and advocate for their professional rights. After the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019, the Department of Nursing and Health Care of the Ministry of Health and Welfare actively proposed policies related to creating and maintaining good nursing work environments. The Taiwan Nursing and Medical Industries Union took a supervisory role in this process, providing feedback on policies from the perspective of Taiwan's professional nurses and arguing for the reasonable and fair subsidization of epidemic prevention facilities, implementation of mask and protective equipment, nursing labor rights, and social respect for the nursing profession. Much work still needs to be done to improve the domestic working environment for nursing staffs, including improving and expanding education, normalizing and effectively utilizing nursing staff feedback and whistleblowing information, promoting information transparency, and implementing better policies.

PURPOSE: Cost savings achieved at an academic medical center by reformulating the institution's standard vasopressin infusions to reduce waste are described. SUMMARY: After a retrospective review of vasopressin utilization over a 4-month period revealed that only approximately 40% of dispensed vasopressin units were actually administered to patients, pharmacy leaders determined that the institution's standard vasopressin concentration for continuous infusions (100 units in 100 mL of sodium chloride 0.9% injection) was resulting in substantial waste, as many infusion preparations were not needed within the 18- to 24-hour expiration window. A concentration of 20 units/100 mL was adopted as the new standard formulation for vasopressin continuous infusions, with use of alternative concentrations allowed on a restricted basis. A pre-post study to assess the impact of the formulation change indicated a 38.7% decrease in vasopressin utilization (from 21,900 to 8,480 units) relative to utilization in a retrospective sample of patients who received vasopressin infusions prior to the formulation change. This reduced utilization equated to a cost decrease of $55,656.20 (as calculated on the basis of 2017 cost estimates) or $77,214.23 (as calculated on the basis of 2019 cost estimates) for the time period collected. It was estimated that the new formulations could yield annual cost savings ranging from $222,625 to $308,857. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first description of cost savings following a change in formulation of vasopressin for continuous infusions. Other institutions could consider employing a similar approach in addition to the previously reported cost-saving interventions, such as lower vasopressin starting doses and vasopressin restriction policies.","Kelly, Courtney E; Miller, Christopher; Darko, William; Cwikla, Greg; Mogle, Bryan; Featherly, Julianna; Marcinak, Rebecca; Probst, Luke A; Seabury, Robert",Am. j. health system pharm,,129

519697,Hemoadsorption eliminates remdesivir from the circulation: Implications for the treatment of COVID-19,2021,"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic leading to unprecedented disruption of global health and economy. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been found to be critical in priming the viral spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor before the virus enters into the host cell. Recent studies have experimentally demonstrated that Alpha 1 antitrypsin (encoded by SERPINA1 gene) is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and provided support to the already approved therapy as a candidate for COVID-19. Interestingly Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is common among Europeans. Here we have provided in silico evidence that Alpha 1 antitrypsin can interact with TMPRSS2 and both of them are co-expressed in the human liver and lung. We then analyzed the gnomAD dataset to show that Europeans and Latinos have a substantially higher carrier frequency of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (~12%) compared to other large ethnicities. Therefore, we hypothesize that Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency might be a risk factor for severe infection with SARS-CoV-2. We propose Alpha 1 antitrypsin status as a potential prognostic predictor of COVID-19 outcome.","Dutta, Atanu Kumar; Goswami, Kalyan",Med Hypotheses,,129
519698,Hemoadsorption eliminates remdesivir from the circulation: Implications for the treatment of COVID-19,2021,"Studies of vertebrate genomes have indicated that all species contain in their chromosomes stretches of DNA with sequence similarity to viral genomes. How such 'endogenous' viral elements (EVEs) ended up in host genomes is usually explained in general terms such as 'they entered the germ line at some point during evolution'. This seems a correct statement, but is also rather imprecise. The vast number of endogenous viral sequences suggest that common routes to the 'germ line' may exist, as relying on chance alone may not easily explain the abundance of EVEs in modern mammalian genomes. An increasing number of virus types have been detected in human semen and a growing number of studies have reported on viral infections that cause male infertility or subfertility and on viral infections that threaten in vitro fertilisation practices. Thus, it is timely to survey the pathway(s) that viruses can use to gain access to the human germ line. Embryo transfer and semen quality studies in livestock form another source of relevant information because virus infection during reproduction is clearly unwanted, as is the case for the human situation. In this review, studies on viruses in the male and female reproductive tract and in the early embryo will be discussed to propose a plausible viral route to the mammalian germ line.","van der Kuyl, Antoinette Cornelia; Berkhout, Ben",Virus Res,,129
521120,Comparing the effectiveness of negative-pressure barrier devices in providing air clearance to prevent aerosol transmission,2021,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS (Kirsten RAt Sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog) mutation has become a clinical challenge in cancer treatment as KRAS-mutant tumors are often resistant to conventional anti-tumor therapies. Activated CDC42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1), an activator of protein kinase B (AKT), is a promising target for KRAS-mutant tumor therapy, but the downstream ACK1 signaling remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combined ACK1/AKT inhibition on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H23, NCI-H358, and A549). The cells were treated with an inhibitor of either ACK1 (dasatinib or sunitinib) or AKT (MK-2206 or GDC-0068), and the optimal concentrations of the two yielding synergistic tumor-killing effects were determined by applying the Chou-Talalay equation for drug combinations. We showed that combined administration of ACK1 and AKT inhibitors at the optimal concentrations effectively suppressed NSCLC cell viability and promoted apoptosis, while inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. Moreover, NSCLC cell migration and invasion were inhibited by combined ACK1/AKT inhibition. These phenomena were associated with the reduced phosphorylation levels of ACK1 and AKT (at Ser473 and Thr308), as well as alterations in caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling.

METHODS: Retrospective review of the first 31 patients with SARS-CoV-2 treated with siltuximab, in Hospital Clinic of Barcelona or Hospital Universitario Salamanca, from March to April 2020 with positive polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The cohort included 31 cases that received siltuximab with a median (IQR) age of 62 (56-71) and 71% were males. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (48%). The median dose of siltuximab was 800 mg ranging between 785 and 900 mg. 7 patients received siltuximab as a salvage therapy after one dose of tocilizumab. At the end of the study, a total of 26 (83.9) patients had been discharged alive and the mortality rate was 16.1% but only 1 out of 24 that received siltuximab as a first line option (4%). CONCLUSIONS: Siltuximab is a well-tolerated alternative to tocilizumab when administered as a first line option in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia within the first 10 days from symptoms onset and high C-reactive protein.","Meira, F; Albiach, L; Carbonell, C; Martín-Oterino, J A; Martín-Ordiales, M; Linares, L; Macaya, I; Agüero, D; Ambrosioni, J; Bodro, M; Cardozo, C; Chumbita, M; De la Mora, M; García-Pouton, N; Garcia-Vidal, C; González-Cordón, A; Hernández-Meneses, M; Inciarte, A; Laguno, M; Leal, L; Morata, L; Puerta-Alcalde, P; Rico, V; Letona, L; Cózar-Llistó, A; Dueñas, G; Solá, M; Torres, B; Rojas, J; Moreno, A; Moreno-García, E; Torres, M; Martínez, J A; Soriano, A; García, F",Rev. esp. quimioter,,129

590752,"Infection, Sepsis and the Inflammatory Response: Mechanisms and Therapy",2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND: During outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), healthcare providers are facing critical clinical decisions based on the prognosis of patients. Decision support tools of risk stratification are needed to predict outcomes in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study recruited 2425 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. A logistic regression model was used to select and estimate the factors independently associated with outcomes. Simplified risk stratification score systems were constructed to predict outcomes in moderate and severe patients with COVID-19, and their performances were evaluated by discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: We constructed two risk stratification score systems, named as STPCAL (including significant factors in the prediction model: number of clinical symptoms, the maximum body temperature during hospitalization, platelet count, C-reactive protein, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase) and TRPNCLP (including maximum body temperature during hospitalization, history of respiratory diseases, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and prothrombin time), to predict hospitalization duration for moderate patients and disease progression for severe patients, respectively. According to STPCAL score, moderate patients were classified into three risk categories for a longer hospital duration: low (Score 0–1, median = 8 days, with less than 20.0% probabilities), intermediate (Score 2–6, median = 13 days, with 30.0–78.9% probabilities), high (Score 7–9, median = 19 days, with more than 86.5% probabilities). Severe patients were stratified into three risk categories for disease progression: low risk (Score 0–5, with less than 12.7% probabilities), intermediate risk (Score 6–11, with 18.6–69.1% probabilities), and high risk (Score 12–16, with more than 77.9% probabilities) by TRPNCLP score. The two risk scores performed well with good discrimination and calibration. CONCLUSIONS: Two easy-to-use risk stratification score systems were built to predict the outcomes in COVID-19 patients with different clinical types. Identifying high risk patients with longer stay or poor prognosis could assist healthcare providers in triaging patients when allocating limited healthcare during COVID-19 outbreak.

591338,The Parkinson’s Real-World Impact Assessment (PRISM) Study: A European Survey of the Burden of Parkinson’s Disease in Patients and their Carers,2021-08-02,"Nurses are essential workers, particularly in a pandemic. Increasingly complex patients and an ever-changing health care environment are a few of the challenges that nursing faculty have to prepare novice nurses for, now more than ever, but it is proving difficult due to the limited number of nursing faculty. In order to continue to prepare nurses for practice, schools of nursing are looking for ways to recruit and retain new faculty. The transition from clinician to academia is challenging due to anxiety related to new expectations, adjusting socially into a new environment, and loss of a previous identity as a clinician; however, for faculty hired during the COVID19 pandemic, these challenges have been amplified due to the loss of learning through observation and social interactions. The idea that learning is a cognitive process that takes place in a social context is rooted in Albert Bandura’s Social Learning Theory. This paper gives voice to two novice faculty who undertook the challenge of starting a ranked faculty role while working remotely during the COVID19 pandemic. Due to the increased likelihood of another pandemic occurring in the relative near future due to globalization; the second role of this paper is to propose measures for faculty enculturation, based on the Social Learning Theory, which can be implemented safely from home. Improved nursing recruitment into academia, and retainment, will improve the education of future nurses facing the challenges of modern healthcare.","Power, Pamela J.; Warren, Gabri M.",J Prof Nurs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S8755722320302283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33674105/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.profnurs.2020.11.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755722320302283?v=s5,129

All consultations targeted respondents with immunization program experience. They included: (1) an online survey to identify immunization implementation barriers and desired vaccine attributes in three use settings, (2) an online survey to identify and evaluate the most important immunization challenges for ten exemplar vaccines, and (3) in-depth interviews to better understand the perceived programmatic benefits and challenges that could be addressed by nine innovations and to rank the innovations that could best address current challenges. The first consultation included responses from 442 participants in 61 countries, representing 89% of the 496 respondents who correctly completed at least one section of the online survey. For facility-based settings, missed opportunities for vaccination due to reluctance to open multidose vaccine vials was the barrier most frequently selected by respondents. In community-based (outreach) and campaign settings, limited access to immunization services due to geographic barriers was most frequently selected. Multidose presentations with preservative or single-dose presentations were most frequently selected as desired vaccine attributes for facility-based settings while improved thermostability was most frequently selected for outreach and campaign settings. The second online survey was completed by 220 respondents in 54 countries. For the exemplar vaccines, vaccine ineffectiveness or wastage due to heat or freeze exposure and missed opportunities due to multidose vial presentations were identified as the greatest vaccine-specific challenges. In-depth interviews with 84 respondents in six countries ranked microarray patches, dual-chamber delivery devices, and heat-stable/controlled temperature chain qualified liquid vaccines as the three innovations that could have the greatest impact in helping address current immunization program challenges. These findings informed the VIPS prioritization and provided broader application to designing immunization interventions to better meet country needs.","Mvundura, Mercy; Frivold, Collrane; Janik Osborne, Anna; Soni, Priyanka; Robertson, Joanie; Kumar, Sandeep; Anena, Jacqueline; Gueye, Abdoulaye; Menozzi-Arnaud, Marion; Giersing, Birgitte; Kahn, Anna-Lea; Scarna, Tiziana; Kristensen, Debra",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34412922/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.024,129

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate community responses to a public health campaign designed for health service waiting rooms that focuses on the harms of unnecessary diagnostic imaging for low back pain. METHODS: We conducted two focus groups of 19 community members with or without low back pain in Sydney, Australia. This study formed the fourth and final stage of the development process of a public health campaign: (a) initial design, (b) expert review and revision, (c) online experiment and (d) community views & revision. We evaluated reactions to components of the campaign that included digital posters and an information leaflet using strong imagery and messaging about the risk of overdiagnosis. We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis to identify main themes. RESULTS: Community members reacted with surprise, initial mistrust, and occasionally anger towards imagery and messaging that suggested diagnostic imaging tests could be unnecessary and harmful. With further reflection and discussion, and after reading longer format information about overdiagnosis, the participants found some of the messages informative and useful. Participants appeared to gain a better understanding of the concept of overdiagnosis and the importance of not rushing to imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Public health campaigns including posters and leaflets displayed in waiting rooms could raise awareness about overuse of diagnostic imaging and the harms of overdiagnosis more broadly. However, negative reactions are possible and must be managed carefully. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: We involved a community participation manager who provided advice on the focus group discussion guide, participant recruitment and manuscript presentation.","Sharma, Sweekriti; Traeger, Adrian C.; Tcharkhedian, Elise; Harrison, Janet; Hersch, Jolyn K.; Pickles, Kristen; Harris, Ian A.; Maher, Chris G.",Health Expect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33599389/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13211,129

We present a comparison of electronic adherence data of stroke patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 in Switzerland. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis using data from the ongoing MAAESTRO study, in which stroke patients with atrial fibrillation electronically monitor their adherence to DOAC treatment. Eligible patients for this analysis had at least four weeks of adherence data prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Three adherence metrics (taking adherence, timing adherence, drug holidays) were calculated and compared descriptively. RESULTS: The analysis included eight patients (median age 81.5 years, IQR 74.8–84.5). Five patients had a pre-lockdown taking adherence over 90% (mean 96.8% ± 2.9), with no change during lockdown, high timing adherence in both periods and no drug holidays. The remaining three patients had pre-lockdown taking and timing adherence below 90%. Of those, two patients showed a moderate decline either in taking or timing adherence compared to pre-lockdown. One showed a substantial increase in taking and timing adherence during lockdown (both + 25.8%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that a major disruption of social life (i.e., the imposed COVID-19 lockdown) is unlikely to relevantly affect the medication intake behaviour of patients with high pre-established adherence, but might have an impact in patients with previously suboptimal adherence.

591972,Highlights from the European society of cardiology congress 2020,2021-01-06,"A new disinfection system utilizing UVC‐LED irradiation was developed. The system was affixed to the toilet seat and it was challenged by three bacteria strains. Different configurations were tested: 3‐LEDs, two 5‐LEDs, and 8‐LEDs. To determine the arrangement designs of LEDs with the optimum efficacy, two 5‐LEDs configurations were additionally considered – uniform and concentrated (2‐sided) distributions. It was noticed that disinfection efficacy initially increased with the number of LEDs, but with 8‐LEDs, the trend became almost non‐obvious for surface disinfection and just marginally increased for airborne disinfection. The mean efficiencies for the surface disinfection ranged from 55.17±23.89% to 72.80±4.13% for E. coli; 36.65±2.99% to 50.05±13.38% for S. typhimurium; and 8.81±3.23% to 39.43±9.33% for S. epidermidis. Likewise, the mean efficiencies for airborne disinfection ranged from 42.17±8.18% to 70.70±4.80%; 40.40±17.90% to 58.31±13.87%; and 24.16±3.81% to 42.79±10.20% for E. coli; S. typhimurium; and S. epidermidis, respectively. Furthermore, the efficacy of the uniform irradiation was nearly twice that of the concentrated irradiation for surface disinfection and 17.70% higher for airborne disinfection, when tested against E. coli. Collectively, these very promising results showcased that this compact, sustainable, and localized disinfection system has a high potential for the next generation of disinfection devices.","Lai, Alvin CK; Nunayon, Sunday S.",Indoor Air,https://doi.org/10.1111/ina.12752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32989792/,129

592164,Covid-19: Monoclonal antibody treatment to be rolled out to hospital patients with no antibody response,2021,"COVID-19 spread across the globe at an immense rate and has left healthcare systems incapacitated to diagnose and test patients at the needed rate. Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model (RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks for anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.71 to 0.77.","Motamed, Saman; Rogalla, Patrik; Khalvati, Farzad",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87994-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883609/,129
592301,One Piece of the Jigsaw for the Cancer Recovery Strategy: Prevalence of COVID-19 in Patients With Cancer,2020-09-04,"STUDY QUESTION: What is the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate following the Spanish Fertility Society (SEF)/Association for the Study of Reproductive Biology (ASEBIR) screening recommendations? SUMMARY ANSWER: The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in the centers following the SEF/ASEBIR screening recommendations was 0.316% after the first survey and 0.364% after the second one WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Due to the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, all the Medical Assisted Reproduction (MAR) centers in Spain had to interrupt their activity most of the time during the first pandemic wave. On April 27th activity was restarted, and SEF and ASEBIR jointly elaborated a guide describing their SARS-CoV-2 screening recommendations for MAR centers. This document aims to achieve a safe environment for patients and staff. It includes the possibility of screening patients through a targeted clinical interview and the use of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aim of this study is to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate based on these recommendations. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: National multicenter cross-sectional study. Information was gathered from centers using an anonymous survey asking for aggregated data about the number of positive cases among screened patients, sent twice. The first survey covered the period April 27th - June 30th. Second survey covered July 1st - August 31st. Response rates among centres were 9% (29/319) and 6% (20/319), respectively. This study includes 2,695 and 4,068 screenings performed in the first and the second survey, respectively. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The SEF/ASEBIR recommendations describe two screening strategies. Strategy (a) consists in a targeted clinical interview (TCI) evaluating clinical symptoms and exposure risk, first before starting the cycle, and before egg-retrieval, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and/or embryo transfer (ET). Suspicious cases could be confirmed by further RT-PCR testing. Strategy (b) consists in conducting the same first TCI, and a systematic RT-PCR testing before the medical procedure in all patients. All patients in both strategies have a TCI. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In the 1st survey, 1,177 screenings and 919 RT-PCR (78.07%) were performed before the egg-retrieval. One patient with a negative TCI and positive RT-PCR was detected, and the cycle was cancelled. 1,518 screenings and 1,161 RT-PCRs (76.48%) were performed before the ET/IUI. Two patients with a positive TCI were detected, one did not perform a RT-PCR, while the other resulted in a positive RT-PCR. Both cycles were cancelled. Besides, 5 patients with negative TCI performed a RT-PCR with a positive result; all 5 were cancelled. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 8/2533 (0.316%), of which 7/2533 (0.276%) were identified by RT-PCR testing. The 2nd survey included 1,376 screenings and 1,009 RT-PCR (73.32%) performed before the egg-retrieval. Four patients with negative TCI and further positive RT-PCR were detected, and their cycle was cancelled. 2,692 screenings and 2,134 RT-PCR (79.27%) were performed before ET/IUI. Two patients had a positive TCI, one with a negative, the other with a positive RT-PCR testing; both cycles were cancelled. Besides, 8 patients with negative TCI, but positive RT-PCR testing, were detected and their cycles cancelled. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 14/3846 (0.364%), of which 13/3846 (0.338%) after positive RT-PCR testing. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The criteria for performing the RT-PCR testing were not the same in all MAR Centres or even in the same centre at different times. Due to the low response rate of the study, we should not extend these results to all the MAR Centres in Spain. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results of the surveys suggest that the SEF/ASEBIR recommendations could be a good screening strategy for SARS-Cov-2 at MAR Centres. Further survey collected at different times of the pandemic are warranted, including new strategies for screening as antigen tests or vaccination status.

Digital health solutions today range from non-regulated wellness applications and research-grade exploratory instruments to regulated software as a medical device (SaMD). This paper discusses the considerations and complexities in developing innovative, effective, and validated SaMD for multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of SaMD requires a formalised approach (design control), inclusive of technical verification and analytical validation to ensure reliability. SaMD must be clinically evaluated, characterised for benefit and risk, and must conform to regulatory requirements associated with device classification. Cybersecurity and data privacy are also critical. Careful consideration of patient and provider needs throughout the design and testing process help developers overcome challenges of adoption in medical practice. Here, we explore the development pathway for SaMD in MS, leveraging experiences from the development of Floodlight™ MS, a continually evolving bundled solution of SaMD for remote functional assessment of MS. The development process will be charted while reflecting on common challenges in the digital space, with a view to providing insights for future developers.","van der Walt, Anneke; Butzkueven, Helmut; Shin, Robert K.; Midaglia, Luciana; Capezzuto, Luca; Lindemann, Michael; Davies, Geraint; Butler, Lesley M.; Costantino, Cristina; Montalban, Xavier",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573267/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091247,129

We will undertake interrupted-time series and non-linear regression analysis, including sensitivity analyses, on time series of referrals to DVA services from routinely collected data to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and associated lockdowns on referrals to the IRIS Programme, and analyse key determinants associated with changes in referrals. We will also conduct an interview- and observation-based qualitative study to understand the variation, relevance and feasibility of primary care responses to DVA before and during the pandemic and its aftermath. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative findings using rapid analysis and synthesis will enable the articulation of multiscale trends in primary care responses to DVA and complex mechanisms by which these responses have changed during the pandemic. DISCUSSION: Our findings will inform the implementation of remote primary care and DVA service responses as services re-configure. Understanding the adaptation of clinical and service responses to DVA during the pandemic is crucial for the development of evidence-based, effective remote support and referral beyond the pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PRECODE is an observational epidemiologic study, not an intervention evaluation or trial. We will not be reporting results of an intervention on human participants.","Szilassy, Eszter; Barbosa, Estela Capelas; Dixon, Sharon; Feder, Gene; Griffiths, Chris; Johnson, Medina; De Simoni, Anna; Wileman, Vari; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Dowrick, Anna",BMC Fam Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980165/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01447-3,129

595218,"Multiple Sclerosis, COVID-19 and Vaccines: Making the Point",2021-10-08,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel human coronavirus. Viral maturation requires a main protease (3CL(pro)) to cleave the virus-encoded polyproteins. We report here that the 3CL(pro) containing additional N- and/or C-terminal segments of the polyprotein sequences undergoes autoprocessing and yields the mature protease in vitro. The dimeric three-dimensional structure of the C145A mutant protease shows that the active site of one protomer binds with the C-terminal six amino acids of the protomer from another asymmetric unit, mimicking the product-bound form and suggesting a possible mechanism for maturation. The P1 pocket of the active site binds the Gln side chain specifically, and the P2 and P4 sites are clustered together to accommodate large hydrophobic side chains. The tagged C145A mutant protein served as a substrate for the wild-type protease, and the N terminus was first digested (55-fold faster) at the Gln(-1)-Ser(1) site followed by the C-terminal cleavage at the Gln(306)-Gly(307) site. Analytical ultracentrifuge of the quaternary structures of the tagged and mature proteases reveals the remarkably tighter dimer formation for the mature enzyme (K(d) = 0.35 nm) than for the mutant (C145A) containing 10 extra N-terminal (K(d) = 17.2 nm) or C-terminal amino acids (K(d) = 5.6 nm). The data indicate that immature 3CL(pro) can form dimer enabling it to undergo autoprocessing to yield the mature enzyme, which further serves as a seed for facilitated maturation. Taken together, this study provides insights into the maturation process of the SARS 3CL(pro) from the polyprotein and design of new structure-based inhibitors.","Hsu, Min-Feng; Kuo, Chih-Jung; Chang, Kai-Ti; Chang, Hui-Chuan; Chou, Chia-Cheng; Ko, Tzu-Ping; Shr, Hui-Lin; Chang, Gu-Gang; Wang, Andrew H.-J.; Liang, Po-Huang",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15788388/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820794032; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820794032,129

Lymphopenia occurs early in the clinical course and is a predictor of disease severity and outcomes. The mechanism of lymphopenia in COVID-19 is uncertain. It has been variously attributed to the release of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-α; direct infection of the lymphocytes by the virus; and rapid sequestration of lymphocytes in the tissues. Additionally, we postulate that prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) is a key meditator of lymphopenia in COVID-19. First, SARS-CoV infection is known to stimulate the production of PGD(2) in the airways, which inhibits the host dendritic cell response via the DP(1) receptor signaling. Second, PGD(2) is known to upregulate monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) via the DP(2) receptor signaling in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2). We propose targeting PGD(2)/DP(2) signaling using a receptor antagonist such as ramatroban as an immunotherapy for immune dysfunction and lymphopenia in COVID-19 disease.","Gupta, Ajay; Chander Chiang, Kate",Med Hypotheses,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110122; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720318570; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720318570?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759007/,129

It will cause a very high impact on world’s economy and global health sector. Earlier the structure of main protease (Mpro) protein was deposited in the RCSB protein repository. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and remdesivir were found to effective in treatment of COVID-19 patients. Here we have performed docking and molecule dynamic (MD) simulation study of HCQ and remdesivir with Mpro protein which gave promising results to inhibit Mpro protein in SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of results obtained we designed structurally modified 18 novel derivatives of HCQ, remdesivir and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and carried out docking studies of all the derivatives. From the docking studies six molecules DK4, DK7, DK10, DK16, DK17 and DK19 gave promising results and can be use as inhibitor for Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 very effectively. Further, molecular dynamics simulation of one derivative of HCQ and one derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol showing excellent docking score was performed along with the respective parent molecules. The two derivatives gave excellent docking score and higher stability than the parent molecule as validated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the binding affinities towards Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 thus represented as strong inhibitors at very low concentration.","Mishra, Deepak; Raman Maurya, Radha; Kumar, Kamlesh; Munjal, Nupur S.; Bahadur, Vijay; Sharma, Sandeep; Singh, Prashant; Bahadur, Indra",J Mol Liq,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2021.116185; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167732221009120; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732221009120?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33879934/,129

599366,Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy use in early stage breast cancer during the covid-19 pandemic,2021-03-02,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: I analyzed the current state of Ethology (i.e., the study of animal behavior and cognition) from the researchers’ perspective through an online questionnaire that was responded to by almost a hundred participants. Despite that the number of the respondents was small, it is interesting to highlight some of the results, since they align with some published analyses. First, not many basic concepts of the discipline, nor its denomination, reached homogeneous consensus. This is alarming because researchers need common vocabulary to communicate effectively between them. Second, despite the enormous biodiversity existent, the researchers seem to be biased towards studying primates, our own family species. Also, the apparatuses employed in the studies are not always adapted to the species’ specific characteristics, so our conclusions about their behavior or cognition might be biased. Fortunately, the technology needed to conduct further studies already exists. However, there is not enough funding or collaboration with engineers to make it real. Establishing big scale networking, adopting some research principles such as transparency, and broadening gender and ethnic diversity in research teams may help in adopting new endeavors. ABSTRACT: Many factors can impact the advancement of scientific disciplines. In the study of animal behavior and cognition (i.e., Ethology), a lack of consensus about definitions or the emergence of some current events and inventions, among other aspects, may challenge the discipline’s grounds within the next decades. A collective metadisciplinary discussion may help in envisioning the future to come. For that purpose, I elaborated an online questionnaire about the level of consensus and the researchers’ ways of doing in seven areas: Discipline name and concepts, species, Umwelt, technology, data, networking, and the impact of sociocultural and ecological factors. I recruited the opinion of almost a hundred of colleagues worldwide (N = 98), both junior and seniors, working both in the wild and in the lab. While the results were pitted against the literature, general conclusions should be taken with caution and considered as a first attempt in exploring the state of the discipline from the researchers’ perspective: There is no unanimity for the discipline’s name; 71.4% of the researchers reported there is limited consensus in the definition of relevant concepts (i.e., culture, cognition); primate species still predominate in publications whereas the species selection criteria is sometimes based on fascination, chance, or funding opportunities rather than on biocentric questions; 56.1% of the apparatuses employed do not resemble species’ ecological problems, and current tech needs would be solved by fostering collaboration with engineers. Finally, embracing the Open Science paradigm, supporting networking efforts, and promoting diversity in research teams may help in gathering further knowledge in the area. Some suggestions are proposed to overcome the aforementioned problems in this contemporary analysis of our discipline.","Bueno-Guerra, Nereida",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573486/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092520,129

599899,"Furin, a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19",2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: In China, the primary health care (PHC) system has been designated responsible for control and prevention of COVID-19, but not treatment. Suspected COVID-19 cases presenting to PHC facilities must be transferred to specialist fever clinics. This study aims to understand the impact of COVID-19 on PHC delivery and on antibiotic prescribing at a community level in rural areas of central China. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 PHC practitioners and seven patients recruited from two township health centres and nine village clinics in two rural residential areas of Anhui province. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. RESULTS: PHC practitioners reported a major shift in their work away from seeing and treating patients (due to government-mandated referral to specialist Covid clinics) to focus on the key public health roles of tracing, screening and educating in rural areas. The additional work, risk, and financial pressure that PHC practitioners faced, placed considerable strain on them, particularly those working in village clinics. Face to face PHC provision was reduced and there was no substitution with consultations by phone or app, which practitioners attributed to the fact that most of their patients were elderly and not willing or able to switch. Practitioners saw COVID-19 as outside of their area of expertise and very different to the non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infections that they frequently treated pre-pandemic. They reported that antibiotic prescribing was reduced overall because far fewer patients were attending rural PHC facilities, but otherwise their antibiotic prescribing practices remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had considerable impact on PHC in rural China. Practitioners took on substantial additional workload as part of epidemic control and fewer patients were seen in PHC. The reduction in patients seen and treated in PHC led to a reduction in antibiotic prescribing, although clinical practice remains unchanged. Since COVID-19 epidemic control work has been designated as a long-term task in China, rural PHC clinics now face the challenge of how to balance their principal clinical and increased public health roles and, in the case of the village clinics, remain financially viable.

PURPOSE: To report on the frequency and type of neuroradiological findings in COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, all consecutive adult hospitalized patients with PCR-positivity for SARS-CoV-2, undergoing neuroimaging at Karolinska University Hospital between March 2 and May 24, 2020, were included. All examinations were systematically re-evaluated by 12 readers. Summary descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: 185 patients with COVID-19 (62±14 years, 138 men) underwent neuroimaging. In total, 222 brain CT, 47 brain MRI and 7 spinal MRI scans were performed. Intra-axial susceptibility abnormalities were the most common finding (29 of 39 [74%, 95%-CI 58–87%]) in patients with brain MRI, often with an ovoid shape suggestive of microvascular pathology, and with a predilection to corpus callosum (23 of 39, [59%, 95%-CI 42–74%]) and juxtacortical areas (14 of 39, [36%, 95% CI 21-53%]). Ischemic and macrohemorrhagic manifestations were also seen, but vascular imaging did not reveal overt abnormalities. Dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 19 patients did not reveal consistent asymmetries between hemispheres or regions. Many patients (18 of 41 [44%, 95%-CI 28–60%]) had leukoencephalopathy and one patient had a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum. Other findings included olfactory bulb signal abnormalities (7 of 37, 19%), prominent optic nerve subarachnoid spaces (20 of 36, 56%), and enhancement of the parenchyma (3 of 20, 15%), leptomeninges (3 of 20, 15%), cranial nerves (2 of 20, 10%), and spinal nerves (2 of 4, 50%).

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption of telehealth modalities was increasing slowly but steadily. During the public health emergency, rapid widespread telehealth implementation has been encouraged to promote patient and provider safety and preserve access to health care. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was acquired from English language Internet searches of the medical and business literature and following breaking news on the COVID-19 pandemic and responses from health care stakeholders, including policymakers, payers, physicians, health care organizations, and patients. We also had extensive discussions with colleagues who are developing telehealth techniques relevant to neuro-ophthalmology. RESULTS: Regulatory, legal, reimbursement, and cultural barriers impeded the widespread adoption of telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the increased use of telehealth in response to the public health emergency, we are rapidly accumulating experience and an evidence base identifying opportunities and challenges related to the widespread adoption of tele–neuro-ophthalmology. One of the major challenges is the current inability to adequately perform funduscopy remotely. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is an increasingly recognized means of health care delivery. Tele–Neuro-Ophthalmology adoption is necessary for the sake of our patients, the survival of our subspecialty, and the education of our trainees and students. Telehealth does not supplant but supplements and complements in-person neuro-ophthalmologic care.

603374,Immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with cancer: Promising results and a note of caution,2021-07-03,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Parotitis occurs in extremes of age and is associated with infections or inflammatory conditions. Typical bacterial parotitis presents with a unilateral, tender enlarged parotid gland and fever whereas inflammatory parotitis presents with bilateral enlargement of the parotids without fever. Here, we present two atypical cases: bilateral parotitis likely secondary to bacterial infection and unilateral parotitis likely due to inflammation. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 45-year-old male with history of obesity who presented with hypoxia and dyspnea. CT angiogram noted multifocal pneumonia, consistent with COVID-19. He was started on dexamethasone, remdesivir and baricitinib as well as community acquired pneumonia coverage. On day 5, he was placed on high-flow nasal cannula due to progressive hypoxia. Although initially afebrile, he developed a fever on day 12, with tachypnea and tachycardia. Acute swelling of the submandibular space with adjacent erythema and a lactic acid of 3.2 were noted. CT neck demonstrated enlarged parotid glands bilaterally with inflammatory changes indicative of parotitis, no abscess or mass was noted. He was started on vancomycin, with improvement of his erythema and swelling within 3 days. Blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Patient continued to deteriorate, requiring intubation on day 18 and died on day 34.The second case is a 79-year-old-male with history of COPD on 3L and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented with hypercapnic respiratory failure, found to be COVID-19 positive. The patient required non-invasive ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, despite COVID-19 treatment. He developed a sudden swelling of the right mandibular area on day 7 of admission. CT neck identified an enlarged heterogenous enhancement of the right parotid gland and edema consistent with parotitis. Blood cultures were negative. The patient was started on vancomycin but had worsening oxygen requirements and encephalopathy, was ultimately made DNR and expired on day 9. DISCUSSION: There has been increased incidence of atypical disease presentation and reactivation of latent infections during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the above patients, parotitis occurred secondary to severe viral illness, immune suppression, increased inflammation and/or superimposed bacterial infection. COVID-19 has been shown to cause significant inflammatory response and immunosuppression with lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and low complement levels. Both patients had elevated inflammatory markers and persistent leukopenia. CONCLUSIONS: The pathophysiology of atypical parotitis and other atypical disease presentations, in the setting of severe COVID-19, should further be investigated.

603620,Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids for Drug Repositioning in Cancer Care: A Promising Approach in the Era of Tailored Treatment,2020-12-04,"Aichivirus B has been reported worldwide in calves and adult cattle with and without diarrhea. The aim of this study was to describe the molecular characteristics of the RdRP and VP1 genes of aichivirus B strains identified as the most frequent etiologic agent in a neonatal diarrhea outbreak in a high-production Brazilian dairy cattle herd. Preliminary laboratory analysis ruled out important enteropathogens (Cryptosporidium spp; Eimeria spp., E. coli F5, and bovine coronavirus). Fecal samples from diarrheic (n = 24) and asymptomatic (n = 5) calves up to 30 days old were collected for virological analysis. RT-PCR assays were performed for the detection of aichivirus B RdRP and VP1 genes and for rotavirus A VP7 and VP4 genes in fecal samples. Asymptomatic calves (control group) were negative for both viruses. Aichivirus B and rotavirus A G10P[11] genotypes were found in 54.2% (13/24) and 25% (6/24) of the diarrheic fecal samples, respectively. Aichivirus B was only identified (83.3%, 10/12) in calves up to two weeks old. Phylogenetic analysis based on the RdRP gene grouped the Brazilian strains in a new branch within the aichivirus B group. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the VP1 gene of Brazilian and Chinese aichivirus B strains allowed the strains identified in this study to be classified in the putative lineage 1. This is the first description of a high rate of aichivirus B detection in a diarrhea outbreak in dairy calves, and the first phylogenetic study of the VP1 gene of aichivirus B wild-type strains performed in South America.","Ribeiro, Juliane; Lorenzetti, Elis; Júnior, José Carlos Ribeiro; da Silva Medeiros, Thais Neris; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28849283/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3531-x,129

This paper takes a different approach and investigates the decision to purchase health insurance once self-employed. Using data from the US Federal Reserve Board’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, we found that in 2016 (when full provisions of the Affordable Care Act were in place) the self-employed were less likely to be insured, especially females who in the general population are more likely to be insured. Compared to the general population, the odds of being covered by health insurance were 62% lower for self-employed males and 83% lower for self-employed females. Additionally, self-employed females were less likely to be insured when they reported using friends and family as a source of financial information.","Kwapisz, Agnieszka",Journal of Business Venturing Insights,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673420300330; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352673420300330,129
605049,Are central nervous system drugs displaying anti-inflammatory activity suitable for early treatment of COVID-19?,2021,"AIMS: Atypical lymphocytes circulating in blood have been reported in COVID-19 patients. This study aims to (1) analyse if patients with reactive lymphocytes (COVID-19 RL) show clinical or biological characteristics related to outcome; (2) develop an automatic system to recognise them in an objective way and (3) study their immunophenotype. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory findings in 36 COVID-19 patients were compared between those showing COVID-19 RL in blood (18) and those without (18). Blood samples were analysed in Advia2120i and stained with May Grünwald-Giemsa. Digital images were acquired in CellaVisionDM96. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to accurately recognise COVID-19 RL. Immunophenotypic study was performed throughflow cytometry. RESULTS: Neutrophils, D-dimer, procalcitonin, glomerular filtration rate and total protein values were higher in patients without COVID-19 RL (p<0.05) and four of these patients died. Haemoglobin and lymphocyte counts were higher (p<0.02) and no patients died in the group showing COVID-19 RL. COVID-19 RL showed a distinct deep blue cytoplasm with nucleus mostly in eccentric position. Through two sequential CNNs, they were automatically distinguished from normal lymphocytes and classical RL with sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy values of 90.5%, 99.4% and 98.7%, respectively. Immunophenotypic analysis revealed COVID-19 RL are mostly activated effector memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. CONCLUSION: We found that COVID-19 RL are related to a better evolution and prognosis. They can be detected by morphology in the smear review, being the computerised approach proposed useful to enhance a more objective recognition. Their presence suggests an abundant production of virus-specific T cells, thus explaining the better outcome of patients showing these cells circulating in blood.","Merino, Anna; Vlagea, Alexandru; Molina, Angel; Egri, Natalia; Laguna, Javier; Barrera, Kevin; Boldú, Laura; Acevedo, Andrea; Díaz-Pavón, Mar; Sibina, Francesc; Bascón, Francisca; Sibila, Oriol; Juan, Manel; Rodellar, José",J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-207087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33310786/,129
605128,Smaller Copper Oxide Nanoparticles have More Biological Effects Versus Breast Cancer and Nosocomial Infections Bacteria,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Medicare’s Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) is a major value-based purchasing program. Little is known about how physician practice leaders view the program and its benefits and challenges. OBJECTIVE: To understand practice leaders’ perceptions of MIPS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were conducted from December 12, 2019, to June 23, 2020, with leaders of 30 physician practices of various sizes and specialties across the USA. Practices were randomly selected using the Medical Group Management Association’s membership database. Practices included small primary care and general surgery practices (1–9 physicians); medium primary care and general surgery practices (10–25 physicians); and large multispecialty practices (50 or more physicians). Participants were asked about their perceptions of MIPS measures; the program’s effect on patient care; administrative burden; and rationale for participation. MAIN MEASURES: Major themes related to practice participation in MIPS. KEY RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 30 practices representing all US census regions. Six major themes emerged: (1) MIPS is understood as a continuation of previous value-based payment programs and a precursor to future programs; (2) measures are more relevant to primary care practices than other specialties; (3) leaders are conflicted on whether the program improves patient care; (4) MIPS creates a substantial administrative burden, exacerbated by annual programmatic changes; (5) incentives are small relative to the effort needed to participate; and (6) external support for participation can be helpful. Many participants indicated that their practice only participated in MIPS to avoid financial penalties; some reported that physicians cared for fewer patients due to the program’s administrative burden. CONCLUSIONS: Practice leaders reported several challenges related to MIPS, including irrelevant measures, administrative burden, frequent programmatic changes, and small incentives. They held mixed views on whether the program improves patient care. These findings may be useful to policymakers hoping to improve MIPS.

605304,COVID‐19 and Headache Medicine: A Narrative Review of Non‐Steroidal Anti‐Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and Corticosteroid Use,2020-07-10,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the already high levels of stress that higher education students experience. Stress influences health behaviors, including those related to dietary behaviors, alcohol, and sleep; yet the effects of stress can be mitigated by resilience. To date, past research studying the connections between dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep, and resilience commonly investigated singular relationships between two of the constructs. The aim of the current study was to explore the relationships between these constructs in a more holistic manner using mediation and moderation analyses. Methods: Higher education students from China, Ireland, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and the United States were enrolled in a cross-sectional study from April to May 2020, which was during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic for most participants. An online survey, using validated tools, was distributed to assess perceived stress, dietary behaviors, alcohol misuse, sleep quality and duration, and resilience. Results: 2254 students completed the study. Results indicated that sleep quality mediated the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors as well as the relationship between perceived stress and alcohol misuse. Further, increased resilience reduced the strength of the relationship between perceived stress and dietary behaviors but not alcohol misuse. Conclusion: Based on these results, higher education students are likely to benefit from sleep education and resilience training, especially during stressful events.","Du, Chen; Zan, Megan Chong Hueh; Cho, Min Jung; Fenton, Jenifer I.; Hsiao, Pao Ying; Hsiao, Richard; Keaver, Laura; Lai, Chang-Chi; Lee, HeeSoon; Ludy, Mary-Jon; Shen, Wan; Swee, Winnie Chee Siew; Thrivikraman, Jyothi; Tseng, Kuo-Wei; Tseng, Wei-Chin; Doak, Stephen; Folk, Sara Yi Ling; Tucker, Robin M.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572863/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020442,129
605492,Potential trade-offs between reproduction and migratory flight in Spodoptera frugiperda,2021,"Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported to show milder symptoms and better prognosis than their adult counterparts, but the difference of immune response against SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults hasn’t been reported. Therefore we initiated this study to figure out the features of immune response in children with COVID-19. Sera and whole blood cells from 19 children with COVID-19 during different phases after disease onset were collected. The cytokine concentrations, SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or N-specific antibodies and T cell immune responses were detected respectively. In children with COVID-19, only 3 of 12 cytokines were increased in acute sera, including interferon (IFN)-γ-induced protein 10 (IP10), interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-16. We observed an increase in T helper (Th)-2 cells and a suppression in regulatory T cells (Treg) in patients during acute phase, but no significant response was found in the IFN-γ-producing or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-producing CD8(+ )T cells in patients. S-RBD and N IgM showed an early induction, while S-RBD and N IgG were prominently induced later in convalescent phase. Potent S-RBD IgA response was observed but N IgA seemed to be inconspicuous. Children with COVID-19 displayed an immunophenotype that is less inflammatory than adults, including unremarkable cytokine elevation, moderate CD4(+) T cell response and inactive CD8(+) T cell response, but their humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 were as strong as adults. Our finding presented immunological characteristics of children with COVID-19 and might give some clues as to why children develop less severe disease than adults.","Jia, Ran; Wang, Xiangshi; Liu, Pengcheng; Liang, Xiaozhen; Ge, Yanling; Tian, He; Chang, Hailing; Zhou, Hao; Zeng, Mei; Xu, Jin",Virol Sin,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-020-00265-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699972/,129

Due to the frequent outbreaks of different HCoVs, the development of a pan-HCoVs vaccine is of great value to biomedical science. The antigen design is a key prerequisite for vaccine efficacy, and we therefore developed a novel antigen with broad coverage based on the genetic algorithm of mosaic strategy. The designed antigen has a potentially broad coverage of conserved cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes to the greatest extent, including the existing epitopes from all reported HCoV sequences (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). This novel antigen is expected to induce strong CTL responses with broad coverage by targeting conserved epitopes against multiple coronaviruses.","Li, Minchao; Zeng, Jinfeng; Li, Ruiting; Wen, Ziyu; Cai, Yanhui; Wallin, Jeffrey; Shu, Yuelong; Du, Xiangjun; Sun, Caijun",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670023/,129
606517,Use of Peptides for the Management of Alzheimer’s Disease: Diagnosis and Inhibition,2018-02-07,"The history of agriculture includes many animal and plant disease events that have had major consequences for the sector, as well as for humans. At the same time, human activities beyond agriculture have often driven the emergence of diseases. The more that humans expand the footprint of the global population, encroach into natural habitats, alter these habitats to extract resources and intensify food production, as well as move animals, people and commodities along with the pathogens they carry, the greater the potential for pathogens and pests to spread and for infection to emerge or re‐emerge. While essential to human well‐being, producing food also plays a major role in disease dynamics. The risk of emergence of pests and pathogens has increased as a consequence of global changes in the way food is produced, moved and consumed. Climate change is likely to increase pressure on the availability of food and provide newly suitable conditions for invasive pests and pathogens. Human population displacements due to economic, political and humanitarian crises represent another set of potential drivers for emerging issues. The overlapping drivers of plant, animal and human disease emergence and environmental changes point towards the concept of ‘One Health’. This paradigm underlines the urgent need to understand the influence of human behaviour and incorporate this understanding into our approach to emerging risks. For this, we face two major challenges. One is cultural; the second is methodological. We have to look at systems not under the narrow view of specific hazards but with a wider approach to system dynamics, and consider a broad spectrum of potential outcomes in terms of risk. In addition, we have to make sense of the vast amounts of data that are available in the modern age. This paper aims to help in preparing for the cultural and methodological shifts needed in our approach to emerging risks.","Richardson, Jane; Lockhart, Caryl; Pongolini, Stefano; Karesh, William B.; Baylis, Matthew; Goldberg, Tony; Slingenbergh, Jan; Gale, Paul; Venturini, Tommaso; Catchpole, Mike; de Balogh, Katinka; Pautasso, Marco; Broglia, Alessandro; Berthe, Franck; Schans, Jan; Poppy, Guy",EFSA J,https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2016.s0512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313573/,129

Nevertheless, lags in outbreak reporting remain a threat to the global human health and economy. In the time between first occurrence of a novel disease incident and public notification of an outbreak, infected individuals have a greater possibility of traveling and spreading the pathogen to other nations. Shortening outbreak reporting lags has the potential to improve global health by preventing local outbreaks from escalating into global epidemics. Methods: Reporting lags between the first record and the first public report of an event were calculated for 318 outbreaks occurring 1996-2009. The influence of freedom of the press, Internet usage, per capita health expenditure, and cell phone subscriptions, on the timeliness of outbreak reporting was evaluated. Results: Freer presses and increasing Internet usage correlate with reduced time between the first record of an outbreak and the public report. Increasing Internet usage reduced the expected reporting lag from more than one month in nations without Internet users to one day in those where 75 of 100 people use the Internet.

A survey of IC and OH resources and a questionnaire completed by HCWs were compared with on-site observational audits. HCWs believed that plans were available to protect against future SARS-like events but audits revealed that these did not exist in many facilities. Both OH and IC were under-resourced post-SARS, with OH professionals particularly lacking in British Columbia.

When challenged with SRBC, PEMS-infected poults had 1 to 2 log2 lower anti-SRBC antibody titers than the controls (P < or = 0.05). Responsiveness to a mitogenic lectin, phytohemagglutinin-P, was reduced significantly in PEMS poults (P < or = 0.05).

609038,Hopefulness predicts resilience after hereditary colorectal cancer genetic testing: a prospective outcome trajectories study,2010-06-11,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has inspired renewed interest in understanding the fundamental pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following infection because fatal COVID-19 cases are commonly linked to respiratory failure due to ARDS. The pathologic alteration known as diffuse alveolar damage in endothelial and epithelial cells is a critical feature of acute lung injury in ARDS. However, the pathogenesis of ARDS following SRAS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined apoptosis in post-mortem lung sections from COVID-19 patients and lung tissues from a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a cell-type manner, including type 1 and 2 alveolar cells and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and T cells. Multiple-target immunofluorescence (IF) assays and western blotting suggest both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 fails to induce apoptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells (i.e., BEAS2B cells) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infection of co-cultured Vero cells and HUVECs or Vero cells and BEAS2B cells with SARS-CoV-2 induced apoptosis in both Vero cells and HUVECs/BEAS2B cells, but did not alter the permissiveness of HUVECs or BEAS2B cells to the virus. Post-exposure treatment of the co-culture of Vero cells and HUVECs with an EPAC1-specific activator ameliorated apoptosis in HUVECs. These findings may help to delineate a novel insight into the pathogenesis of ARDS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yakun; Garron, Tania M.; Chang, Qing; Su, Zhengchen; Zhou, Changcheng; Gong, Eric C.; Zheng, Junying; Yin, Yw; Ksiazek, Thomas; Brasel, Trevor; Jin, Yang; Boor, Paul; Comer, Jason E.; Gong, Bin",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398280/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.424254,129

METHODS: This study first examined current epidemiological reports to better understand the risk of mortality from COVID-19. Past epidemiological studies from severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS were also examined given similar virology. Next, at best and at worst mortality cases were considered with the goal of estimating the probability of mortality. To accomplish this for the general population, microdata from the National Health Interview Survey pooled sample (2016, 2017, and 2018 IPUMS NHIS with a sample of 34,881 adults at least 60 years of age) were utilized. Primary measures included age and health status (diabetes, body mass index, and hypertension). A logit regression with 100,000 simulations was employed to derive the estimates and probabilities. RESULTS: Age exhibited a positive association for the probability of death with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.22 (p<0.05, 1.05-1.42, 95% C.I.). A positive association was also found for obesity (OR 1.03, p<0.01, 1.02-1.04 95% C.I.) and hypertension (OR 1.36, p<0.01, 1.09-1.66 95% C.I.) for the at best case. Diabetes was significant but only for the at best case. DISCUSSION: This study found mortality increased with age and was notable for the 74-79 age group for the at best case and the 70-79 age group of the at worst case. Obesity was also important and suggested a higher risk for mortality. Hypertension also exhibited greater risk but the increase was minimal. Given the volume of information and misinformation, these findings can be applied by health professionals, gerontologists, social workers, and local policymakers to better inform older adults about mortality risks and, in the process, re-establish public trust.","Sharma, Andy",J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931554/,129

Challenges in healthcare access have driven a need for innovative approaches ensuring connectivity to health providers. Telehealth services and virtual clinics offer accessible disease management pathways for patients living in health resource limited areas or, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, where there may be potential barriers to existing healthcare resources. Those suffering with serious chronic disorders often cannot be seen by a healthcare specialist due to their limited availability, or the lack of a specialist within a reasonable proximity. Epilepsy represents such a disorder where most of the world's population lacks the availability of necessary specialists. Virtual clinics allow for specialist care and an ability to perform necessary ambulatory electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring by placing the technologies directly in patients' homes or at local clinics near the patients' homes. By moving the diagnostic process out of the hospital or epilepsy center, it becomes possible to overcome growing gaps in neurology services. Virtual clinics have the potential to expand access to high-quality, cost-effective care for the patient.

A main limitation for widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is the global shortage of essential supplies, among them RNA extraction kits. The need for commercial RNA extraction kits places a bottleneck on tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, including PCR-based reference tests. Here, we propose an alternative method we call PEARL (precipitation-enhanced analyte retrieval) that addresses this limitation. PEARL uses a lysis solution that disrupts cell membranes and viral envelopes while simultaneously providing conditions suitable for alcohol-based precipitation of RNA, DNA, and proteins.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to significant health burden in infected patients especially in those with underlying comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between comorbidities and their role in the exacerbation of disease in COVID-19 patients leading to fatal outcomes. A systematic review was conducted using data from MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases published from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020. Fifty-three articles were included in the systematic review. Of those 53 articles, 8 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus were identified to be the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Our meta-analysis showed that cancer, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were independently associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Chronic kidney disease was statistically the most prominent comorbidity leading to death. However, despite having high prevalence, obesity was not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Ng, Wern Hann; Tipih, Thomas; Makoah, Nigel A.; Vermeulen, Jan-G; Goedhals, Dominique; Sempa, Joseph B.; Burt, Felicity J.; Taylor, Adam; Mahalingam, Suresh",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563817/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03647-20,129

As an important area of research of the Convention on Biological Diversity and a key avenue for the dissemination of biodiversity and health knowledge, we investigated how well-embedded biodiversity and health interlinkages are in institutional higher education offerings. Methods: Using One Health education programs as a starting point, we collected a global list of institutions potentially carrying out education in the links between biodiversity and health through previously published research, academic partners of global conglomerates, and our own networks. We then analyzed the offerings from these institutions to determine the degree of integration of biodiversity and health interlinkages. Results: We found 105 educational offerings in biodiversity and health interlinkages from 89 institutions in 30 countries. These were primarily found in faculties of public health, veterinary sciences, and medicine, with varying degrees of coverage of the interlinkages. Conclusion: Education incorporating the links between biodiversity and health exists globally, but should be more widely integrated, particularly through inter-faculty and inter-institutional collaboration.","Cianfagna, Mark; Bolon, Isabelle; Babo Martins, Sara; Mumford, Elizabeth; Romanelli, Cristina; Deem, Sharon L.; Pettan-Brewer, Christina; Figueroa, Daniela; Velásquez, Juan Carlos Carrascal; Stroud, Cheryl; Lueddeke, George; Stoll, Beat; Ruiz de Castañeda, Rafael",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718324/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.637901,129
611702,Highlights from the 60th national meeting of the Italian Society of Nephrology: celebrating the role of the nephrologist,2020-09-03,"This paper discusses the long-term effects of low-cost carrier (LCC) presence at European airports and identifies the airports that have benefited the most from LCC consolidation since 2001. The research uses ‘LCC Market Share’, in terms of seats, to measure the relative importance of LCCs within each airport; and introduces ‘EU LCA Rank’ as a normalised metric of the capacity share of every airport in the European low-cost segment. It evaluates the trends between 2001 and 2019 in all airports in Europe using OAG supply information (seats by carrier). Results show two different phases of LCC rise in Europe, 2001 to 2008 and 2009 to 2019, marked by the effects of the financial crisis of the Great Recession. The analysis highlights the role that LCCs have played in boosting the growth of both primary and secondary airports. Indeed, despite the fact that LCCs have put many smaller airports on the European map, during the second phase of the period of analysis growth has been more significant for major airports and for a few airports that were keen to support the earliest development of LCCs. In that sense, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the historical and contemporary dynamics in European LCCs choice of airports and, in particular, the long-term effects that this disruptive business model have had for airports. This is increasingly important in the context of a potential recovery path from the effects of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper also attempts to settle academic discussions that attach LCC development to secondary/regional airports disregarding the wide range of strategies used by airlines and airports.","Jimenez, Edgar; Suau-Sanchez, Pere",J Transp Geogr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692320302180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692320302180; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863620/,129

Black, Hispanic, and Native American students and faculty are also largely underrepresented in environmental engineering programs in the United States. Nearly 80 participants of a workshop at the 2019 Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Research and Education Conference developed recommendations for reversing these trends. Workshop participants identified factors for success in academia, which included adopting a broader definition for the impact of research and teaching. Participants also supported the use of community-based participatory research and classroom action research methods in engineering programs for recruiting, retaining, and supporting the transition of underrepresented students into professional and academic careers. However, institutions must also evolve to recognize the academic value of community-based work to enable faculty, especially underrepresented minority faculty, who use it effectively, to succeed in tenure promotions. Workshop discussions elucidated potential causal relationships between factors that influence the co-creation of research related to academic skills, community skills, mutual trust, and shared knowledge. Based on the discussions from this workshop, we propose a pathway for increasing diversity and community participation in the environmental engineering discipline by exposing students to community-based participatory methods, establishing action research groups for faculty, broadening the definition of research impact to improve tenure promotion experiences for minority faculty, and using a mixed methods approach to evaluate its impact.","Montoya, Lupita D.; Mendoza, Lorelay M.; Prouty, Christine; Trotz, Maya; Verbyla, Matthew E.",Environ Eng Sci,https://doi.org/10.1089/ees.2020.0148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079202/,129

However, no approved prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are currently available. The MERS-CoV envelope spike protein serves as a crucial target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccine development, as it plays a critical role in mediating viral entry through interactions with the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Here, we constructed a recombinant rare serotype of the chimpanzee adenovirus 68 (AdC68) that expresses full-length MERS-CoV S protein (AdC68-S). Single intranasal immunization with AdC68-S induced robust and sustained neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice. In a human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mouse model, it completely protected against lethal challenge with a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV-MA). Passive transfer of immune sera to naïve hDPP4-KI mice also provided survival advantages from lethal MERS-CoV-MA challenge. Analysis of sera absorption and isolated monoclonal antibodies from immunized mice demonstrated that the potent and broad neutralizing activity was largely attributed to antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. These results show that AdC68-S can induce protective immune responses in mice and represent a promising candidate for further development against MERS-CoV infection in both dromedaries and humans.","Jia, Wenxu; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Zhang, Chao; Li, Mingxi; Zhou, Haixia; Zhang, Shuyuan; Zhou, Panpan; Xu, Jiuyang; Shan, Sisi; Shi, Xuanling; Wang, Xinquan; Zhao, Jincun; Zhou, Dongming; Perlman, Stanley; Zhang, Linqi",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2019.1620083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31130102/,129

Design Cross-sectional study Methods A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p<0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post-hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. Results 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1-6months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p<0.0001), daily (61%; p<0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p<0.0001) and for 30-60min (72%). During leisure time athletes preferred sedentary above active behaviour (p<0.0001). Sleep patterns changed significantly (79%; p<0.0001). A significant number of athletes consumed excessive amounts of carbohydrates (76%; p<0.0001; males 73%; females 80%). Many athletes felt depressed (52%), and required motivation to keep active (55%). Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). Conclusions COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry. Government and sporting federations must support athletes and develop and implement guidelines to reduce the risk in a COVID-19 environment.","Pillay, Lervasen; Janse van Rensburg, Dina C.

Both viruses infect the same host (humans) and the same cell (type-II alveolar cells) causing lower respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia. Molecularly, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter alveolar cells via spike proteins recognizing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and angiotensin converting enzyme-II, respectively. Intracellularly, both viruses hide in organelles to generate negative RNA strands and initiate replication using very similar mechanisms. At the transcription level, both viruses utilise identical Transcription Regulatory Sequences (TRSs), which are known recombination cross-over points during replication, to transcribe genes. Using whole genome alignments of both viruses, we identify clusters of high sequence homology at ORF1a and ORF1b. Given the high recombination rates detected in SARS-CoV-2, we speculate that in co-infections recombination is feasible via TRS and/or clusters of homologies. Accordingly, here we recommend mitigation measure and testing for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in ME countries.","Sajini, Abdulrahim A.; Alkayyal, Almohanad A.; Mubaraki, Fathi A.",J Epidemiol Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605109/; https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.201105.001,129

The threat of bioterrorism is increasing daily. The ease of production and the broad availability of biological agents and technical know-how have led to a further spread of biological weapons and an increased desire among nations as well as terrorists to have them. Health professionals in emergency departments are expected to play crucial roles in the management of victims of bioterrorism when bioterrorism occurs. This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, and preparedness of emergency department nurses and medical officers (MOs) toward potential bioterrorist attacks in Ghana. This qualitative study utilized focus group discussions and semistructured interviews to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and preparedness of emergency department nurses and MOs toward potential bioterrorist attacks in Ghana. Data were subjected to a qualitative content analysis in which three main thematic categories were developed. These thematic categories are as follows: (a) differences in bioterrorism knowledge between emergency department nurses and emergency department MOs, (b) unprepared emergency department nurses and MOs for care during bioterrorism attacks, and (c) positive attitudes of emergency department nurses and MOs toward bioterrorism preparedness. Although emergency MOs had better knowledge of bioterrorism than their nursing counterparts, both groups of health professionals were unprepared to respond to any form of bioterrorism. Both nurses and MOs indicated the need for staff education and infrastructure readiness to be able to respond effectively to a bioterrorist attack. A well-prepared emergency department and health professionals against bioterrorism could prevent high casualty rates in a bioterrorist attack and also serve a dual purpose of dealing with other natural disasters when they occur.","Atakro, Confidence A.; Addo, Stella B.; Aboagye, Janet S.; Blay, Alice A.; Amoa-Gyarteng, Kwaku G.; Menlah, Awube; Garti, Isabella; Agyare, Dorcas F.; Junior, Kumah K.; Sarpong, Limmy",SAGE Open Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415237/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2377960819844378,129

Yet community clinicians often have little knowledge of the basic rights and ethical principles governing care of seriously ill incarcerated patients. Such patients are legally entitled to make their own medical decisions just like non-incarcerated patients, and retain rights to appoint surrogate decision makers and make advance care plans. Wardens, correctional officers, and prison health care professionals should not make medical decisions for incarcerated patients and should not be asked to do so. Dying incarcerated patients should be offered goodbye visits with their loved ones, and patients from federal prisons are legally entitled to them. Community health care professionals may need to advocate for this medically vulnerable hospitalized patient population to receive ethically appropriate, humane care when under their care in community hospitals. If ethical care is being obstructed, community health care professionals should contact the prison’s warden and medical director to explain their concerns and ask questions.

The socioeconomic, political, and demographic profile of these vulnerable populations places them at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic is disproportionally higher among these at-risk groups. The purpose of this perspective is to: (1) highlight the interactions among the social determinants of health (SDoH) and their bi-directional relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic which results in the current syndemic and; (2) offer recommendations that consider an integrated approach to mitigate COVID-19 risk for marginalized populations in general. For these at-risk populations, we discuss how individual, structural, sociocultural, and socioeconomic factors interact with each other to result in a disparate risk to contracting and transmitting COVID-19. Marginalized populations are the world's collective responsibility. We recommend implementing the Essential Public Health Services (EPHS) framework to promote those systems and policies that enable optimal health for all while removing systemic and structural barriers that have created health inequities.

The latter issue is partially solved using correction methods in post-analysis of AVA but the accuracy of these methods is not yet accessed. This study employs two twisted wind profiles to test an urban area in a boundary layer wind tunnel to investigate the influence of twisted wind flows on the outcomes of AVA and to estimate the accuracy of three common correction methods: No-Shift, Threshold, and Proportional methods. The results reveal significant differences in wind speeds at the pedestrian level for twisted and conventional wind flows at locations with low building densities. The discrepancies in wind speeds are minimum at the locations where the density of buildings is high. The indicators calculated by the No-Shift method frequently deviate from those of the twisted wind flows, while the Threshold and Proportional methods routinely over-predict the indicators of AVA.","Weerasuriya, A.U.; Tse, K.T.; Zhang, Xuelin; Kwok, K.C.S.",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287983/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.03.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132318301537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318301537,129

Multiple surveillance and phylogenetic studies suggest a bat origin. In this study, we describe the detection and full genome characterization of two CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV from two Italian bats, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii. METHODS: Pool of viscera were tested by a pan-coronavirus RT-PCR. Virus isolation was attempted by inoculation in different cell lines. Full genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent platform and phylogenetic trees were performed using IQtree software. Similarity plots of CoV clade c genomes were generated by using SSE v1.2. The three dimensional macromolecular structure (3DMMS) of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein was predicted by sequence-homology method using the protein data bank (PDB). RESULTS: Both samples resulted positive to the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR (IT-batCoVs) and their genome organization showed identical pattern of MERS CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic group placed in the Beta2c clade formed by MERS-CoV sequences originating from humans and camels and bat-related sequences from Africa, Italy and China. The comparison of the secondary and 3DMMS of the RBD of IT-batCoVs with MERS, HKU4 and HKU5 bat sequences showed two aa deletions located in a region corresponding to the external subdomain of MERS-RBD in IT-batCoV and HKU5 RBDs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported two beta CoVs closely related to MERS that were obtained from two bats belonging to two commonly recorded species in Italy (P. kuhlii and H. savii). The analysis of the RBD showed similar structure in IT-batCoVs and HKU5 respect to HKU4 sequences. Since the RBD domain of HKU4 but not HKU5 can bind to the human DPP4 receptor for MERS-CoV, it is possible to suggest also for IT-batCoVs the absence of DPP4-binding potential. More surveillance studies are needed to better investigate the potential intermediate hosts that may play a role in the interspecies transmission of known and currently unknown coronaviruses with particular attention to the S protein and the receptor specificity and binding affinity.","Moreno, Ana; Lelli, Davide; de Sabato, Luca; Zaccaria, Guendalina; Boni, Arianna; Sozzi, Enrica; Prosperi, Alice; Lavazza, Antonio; Cella, Eleonora; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Cicozzi, Massimo; Vaccari, Gabriele",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258555/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0907-1,129

The degree of abnormalities correlates with clinical outcome. Imaging of the lungs using chest radiography (CXR) at the peak of a pandemic is considered a basic diagnostic tool at the triage stage. The CXR images are less characteristic than computed tomography (CT) and should be interpreted with a combination of clinical findings. OBJECTIVES Comparison of the usefulness of 2 CXR severity scores to evaluate the presence/severity of inflammation in the course of COVID-19 and the possibility of a non-radiologist to interpret the image independently. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective analysis of the medical records of 152 consecutive patients (aged 19-96, 73 men), infected with SARS-CoV-2, confirmed using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Five-point and twelve-point CXR severity scoring systems were used (independently by a radiologist and a referring physician) to assess the severity of inflammation. RESULTS In 77 of 152 cases, the CXR revealed features of inflammation. Bilateral abnormalities were found in 48/77 (62.3%) cases. Statistically, the lower lobes were involved more often than the upper ones (p < 0.001) and the left lobe more often than the right one (p < 0.001). The intensity of the abnormalities using both scales correlated with the persistence of symptoms (p = 0.0133 and p = 0.0403). A positive and statistically significant correlation was found between both scales and dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase activity. The interobserver agreement analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in the CXR severity score using the five-point (B = 0.8345, kappa = 0.82; p = 0.1480) or the twelve-point scale (B = 0.8219, kappa = 0.77; p = 0.0502). CONCLUSIONS The CXR severity score is a useful tool to assess the inflammation in the initial diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

After large-scale interpersonal infection, asymptomatic patients appear. Whether asymptomatic patients are contagious or not and whether they need medication are the arguments among clinical experts. Areas covered: This paper reports a special asymptomatic couple with COVID-19, of which the male patient is an intercity bus driver but has not induced confirmed infection of his 188 passengers. The patients were treated with four combinations of lopinavir/ritonavir tablets, arbidol tablets, Lianhuaqingwen granules, and recombinant human interferon-α2b (IFN-α2b) injection via aerosol. Their clinical characteristics and medication were summarized and analyzed. Expert opinion: The two asymptomatic patients far away from Wuhan did not seem to be highly contagious. They improved obviously, after treatment with the quadruple therapy, but the effective drug is still unknown.

Our aim is to evaluate functional respiratory parameters, changes in chest CT, and correlation with peripheral blood biomarkers involved in lung fibrosis at two and six months after SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia METHODS: COVID-FIBROTIC (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04409275) is a multicenter prospective observational cohort study aimed to evaluate discharged patients. Pulmonary function tests, circulating serum biomarkers, chest radiography and chest CT were performed at outpatient visits. RESULTS: In total, 313, aged 61.12±12.26 years, out of 481 included patients were available. The proportion of patients with DLCO<80% was 54.6% and 47% at 60 and 180 days. Associated factors with diffusion impairment at 6 months were female sex (OR: 2.97, 95%CI 1.74 – 5.06, p=0.001), age (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01 – 1.05, p=0.005), and peak RALE score (OR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.06 – 1.40, p=0.005). Patients with altered lung diffusion showed higher levels of MMP-7 (11.54±8.96 vs 6.71±4.25, p=0.001), and periostin (1.11±0.07 vs 0.84±0.40, p=0.001). 226 patients underwent CT scan, of whom 149 (66%) had radiological sequelae of COVID-19. In severe patients, 68.35% had ground glass opacities and 38.46% had parenchymal bands.

This study aims to assess the efficacy of Chansu injection in treating patients with severe COVID-19. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan, China from February 5 to March 5, 2020 were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive general treatment plus Chansu injection or only general treatment as the control group. The treatment course was 7 days. The changes of PaO2/FiO2 and ROX index indicating respiratory function, the white blood cell (WBC) count, peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocyte (PBML) count, respiratory support step-down time (RSST), and safety indicators for the 7th day were retrospectively analyzed. After 7 days treatment, the oxygenation index was improved in 20 of 21 patients (95.2%) in the treatment group, as compared with 13 of 19 patients (68.4%) in the control group. The PaO2/FiO2 and ROX indices in the treatment group (mean, 226.27 and 14.01 respectively) were significantly higher than the control group (mean, 143.23 and 9.64 respectively).

Currently, there is no specific treatment against the SARS CoV-2. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. Previous studies found that indomethacin has the ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV. Methods SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected African green monkey kidney VERO E6 cells treated with different concentrations of indomethacin or aspirin at 48 hours post infection (p.i). The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity. Anti-coronavirus efficacy in vivo was confirmed by evaluating the time of recovery in canine coronavirus (CCV) infected dogs treated orally with 1mg/kg body weight indomethacin. Results We found that indomethacin has a directly and potently antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus (reduce relative light unit to zero). In CCV-infected dogs, recovery occurred significantly sooner with symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments than with symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments (P =0.0031), but was not significantly different from that with symptomatic treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin + canine blood immunoglobulin + interferon treatments (P =0.7784).

618994,Time to Expect More From Pharmacometrics,2020-06-19,"[Image: see text] The continual spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), posing a severe threat to the health worldwide. The main protease (M(pro), alias 3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial enzyme for the maturation of viral particles and is a very attractive target for designing drugs to treat COVID-19. Here, we propose a multiple conformation-based virtual screening strategy to discover inhibitors that can target SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). Based on this strategy, nine M(pro) structures and a protein mimetics library with 8960 commercially available compounds were prepared to carry out ensemble docking for the first time. Five of the nine structures are apo forms presented in different conformations, whereas the other four structures are holo forms complexed with different ligands. The surface plasmon resonance assay revealed that 6 out of 49 compounds had the ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiment showed that the biochemical half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of the six compounds could hamper M(pro) activities ranged from 0.69 ± 0.05 to 2.05 ± 0.92 μM. Evaluation of antiviral activity using the cell-based assay indicated that two compounds (Z1244904919 and Z1759961356) could strongly inhibit the cytopathic effect and reduce replication of the living virus in Vero E6 cells with the half-maximal effective concentrations (EC(50)) of 4.98 ± 1.83 and 8.52 ± 0.92 μM, respectively. The mechanism of the action for the two inhibitors were further elucidated at the molecular level by molecular dynamics simulation and subsequent binding free energy analysis. As a result, the discovered noncovalent reversible inhibitors with novel scaffolds are promising antiviral drug candidates, which may be used to develop the treatment of COVID-19.","Yang, Jingyi; Lin, Xiaoyuan; Xing, Na; Zhang, Zhao; Zhang, Haiwei; Wu, Haibo; Xue, Weiwei",J Chem Inf Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279924/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00355,129

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the seroepidemiology of HKU1 infections in our local population. STUDY DESIGN: An ELISA-based IgG antibody detection assay using recombinant HCoV-HKU1 nucleocapsid and spike (S) proteins (genotype A) were developed for the diagnosis of CoV-HKU1 infections, Additionally, a neutralization antibody assay using the HCoV-HKU1 pseudotyped virus was developed to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum with antibody positivity in an S protein-based ELISA. RESULTS: Results of the recombinant S protein-based ELISA were validated with Western blot, immunofluorescence analysis and flow cytometry. The coupled results demonstrated good correlation with Spearmen's coefficient of 0.94. Seroepidemiological study in a local hospital-based setting using this newly developed ELISA showed steadily increasing HCoV-HKU1 seroprevalence in childhood and early adulthood, from 0% in the age group of <10 years old to a plateau of 21.6% in the age group of 31–40 years old.

619461,Effects of pay-for-performance system on tuberculosis default cases control and treatment in Taiwan,2010-07-10,"BACKGROUND: The government is the main body in charge of controlling epidemics; hence, expectations from the intention and capacities of the government would affect the flexibility and behaviors of citizens. Given the severity of COVID-19 pandemic and the urgent need for cooperation of people in the prevention and combat processes, understanding the public perspectives would be crucial and instructive. This study aimed to explore such perspectives towards the current pandemic among the Iranian. Indeed, we sought to provide a favorable platform for effective policies in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic through recognizing public expectations. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used an open-ended online questionnaire to investigate the common perspectives of the Iranian towards the response of government to COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were selected using snowball and convenient sampling techniques across the country. The collected data were analyzed and described using a thematic analysis. RESULTS: In general, 2547 participants agreed to participate in this study and completed the online questionnaire. According to the findings, the Iranian exhibited several expectations regarding the response of the government to COVID-19 pandemic. Three main themes were extracted based on these expectations: (1) health-related expectations, (2) policy-related expectations, and (3) Information-related expectations. In this study, a majority of participants highlighted the need to consider and follow-up the patients and their families, providing the financial and hygiene support during the pandemic, applying strict restrictions, and using close monitoring and controlling procedures. Furthermore, they mentioned that authorities and news agencies should observe the principals honesty and transparency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that people expect the government and other responsible institutions to minimize the burden of this pandemic through adopting effective policies. Also, they could help policy-makers become aware of the expectations of people and develop better strategies.

There remains a need for validated risk prediction models to assess short-term mortality risk among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a 7-day and 14-day mortality risk prediction model for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study with a separate multicenter cohort for external validation using two hospitals in New York, NY, and 9 hospitals in Massachusetts, respectively. A total of 664 patients in NY and 265 patients with COVID-19 in Massachusetts, hospitalized from March to April 2020. RESULTS: We developed a risk model consisting of patient age, hypoxia severity, mean arterial pressure and presence of kidney dysfunction at hospital presentation. Multivariable regression model was based on risk factors selected from univariable and Chi-squared automatic interaction detection analyses. Validation was by receiver operating characteristic curve (discrimination) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test (calibration). In internal cross-validation, prediction of 7-day mortality had an AUC of 0.86 (95%CI 0.74–0.98; GOF p = 0.744); while 14-day had an AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.69–0.97; GOF p = 0.588). External validation was achieved using 265 patients from an outside cohort and confirmed 7- and 14-day mortality prediction performance with an AUC of 0.85 (95%CI 0.78–0.92; GOF p = 0.340) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.76–0.89; GOF p = 0.471) respectively, along with excellent calibration. Retrospective data collection, short follow-up time, and development in COVID-19 epicenter may limit model generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-AID risk tool is a well-calibrated model that demonstrates accuracy in the prediction of both 7-day and 14-day mortality risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This prediction score could assist with resource utilization, patient and caregiver education, and provide a risk stratification instrument for future research trials.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Sharaiha, Reem Z.; Kumar, Sonal; Krisko, Tibor; Skaf, Daniel; Ang, Bryan; Redd, Walker D.; Zhou, Joyce C.; Hathorn, Kelly E.; McCarty, Thomas R.; Bazarbashi, Ahmad Najdat; Njie, Cheikh; Wong, Danny; Shen, Lin; Sholle, Evan; Cohen, David E.; Brown, Robert S.; Chan, Walter W.; Fortune, Brett E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32997700/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239536,129

Thus, they are widely used in studies and visual data storytelling. For example, a recent story by China Central Television Europe depicts Brexit as a hashtag movement displayed on an animated bubble chart. However, creating such a story is usually laborious and tedious, because narrators have to switch between different tools and discuss with different collaborators. To reduce the burden, we develop a prototype system to help explore the bubbles’ movement by automatically inserting animations connected to the storytelling of the video creators and the interaction of viewers to those videos.

The household has traditionally been the site for studying acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs). Most studies were conducted many years ago, and more broadly sensitive laboratory methods to determine ARI etiology are now available. Methods. We recruited and followed households with children over 3 annual surveillance periods and collected respiratory tract specimens from subjects with reported ARI. Virus etiology was determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Results. Individuals in larger households (defined as households with >4 members) and those in households with children aged <5 years had significantly higher ARI frequencies than others. ARI frequency generally declined with increasing age. Virus etiology was most likely to be determined in young children, who were also most likely to have virus coinfection. Overall, 16% of ARIs with 1 virus identified had ≥1 coinfecting virus. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified agents of ARI in all age categories. Influenza virus and adenovirus were less frequently identified but were most likely to cause ARI that required medical attention. Conclusions. Longitudinal studies in families remain a valuable way to study respiratory infections. RT-PCR has increased the sensitivity of virus detection, including coinfecting viruses, and expanded our ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARI.","Monto, Arnold S.; Malosh, Ryan E.; Petrie, Joshua G.; Thompson, Mark G.; Ohmit, Suzanne E.",Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu327; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4296188?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24907381/,129

A discrete choice experiment,2020-05-07,"The 60mer oligonucleotide microarray was designed and applied to detecting of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus. Thirty 60mer specific oligos were designed to cover the whole genome of the first submitted coronavirus strain, according to the sequence of TOR2 (GENEBANK Accession: AY274119). These primers were synthesized and printed into a microarray with 12 ×12 spots. RNAs were extracted from the throat swab and gargling fluid of SARS patients and reverse-transcripted into the double strand cDNAs. The cDNAs were prepared as restricted cDNA fragments by the restriction display (RD) technique and labeled by PCR with the Cy5-universal primer. The labeled samples were then applied to the oligo microarray for hybridization. The diagnostic capability of the microarray was evaluated after the washing and scanning steps. The scanning result showed that samples of SARS patients were hybridized with multiple SARS probes on the microarray, and there is no signal on the negative and blank controls. These results indicate that the genome of SARS coronavirus can be detected in parallel by the 60mer oligonucleotide microarray, which can improve the positive ratio of the diagnosis. The oligo microarray can also be used for monitoring the behavior of the virus genes in different stages of the disease status.","Shi, Rong; Ma, Wenli; Wu, Qinghua; Zhang, Bao; Song, Yanbin; Guo, Qiuye; Xiao, Weiwei; Wang, Yan; Zheng, Wenling",Chin Sci Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214700/; https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03183928,129

Current approved drugs or molecules under clinical trials can be a good pool for repurposing through in-silico techniques to quickly identify promising drug candidates. The structural information of recently released crystal structures of main protease (M(pro)) in APO and complex with inhibitors, N3, and 13b molecules was utilized to explore the binding site architecture through Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The stable state of M(pro) was used to conduct extensive virtual screening of the aforementioned drug pool. Considering the recent success of HIV protease molecules, we also used anti-protease molecules for drug repurposing purposes. The identified top hits were further evaluated through MD simulations followed by the binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA. Interestingly, in our screening, several promising drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of M(pro). However, based on control (N3 and 13b), we have identified six potential molecules, Leupeptin Hemisulphate, Pepstatin A, Nelfinavir, Birinapant, Lypression and Octreotide which have shown the reasonably significant MM-GBSA score. Further insight shows that the molecules form stable interactions with hot-spot residues, that are mainly conserved and can be targeted for structure- and pharmacophore-based designing. The pharmacokinetic annotations and therapeutic importance have suggested that these molecules possess drug-like properties and pave their way for in-vitro studies. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

623302,Developing an Agnostic Risk Prediction Model for Early AKI Detection in Cancer Patients,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND: Across the world, frailty is part of the guidelines that are being developed in the COVID‐19 pandemic for triaging in crisis situations. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) evaluates the ability to perform daily tasks to identify frail individuals, potentially excluding those from intensive care (IC) treatment. Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) experience varying degrees of dependence, distinct from age‐related physical deterioration. Using the CFS for triage in crisis situations could potentially unjustifiably exclude individuals with ID from IC treatment. Our objective was to compare the classification of individuals with ID into different frailty categories based on the CFS and the well‐studied ID‐frailty index and to determine suitability of CFS for evaluation of frailty in individuals with ID during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of the observational healthy aging and intellectual disabilities (HA‐ID) study included 982 individuals with ID of ≥50 years, who were classified according to the CFS and the ID‐frailty index. RESULTS: Of the cohort of 982 older adults with ID, 626 (63.7%) would be classified as moderately frail (CFS score 6), but 92% of this group is not moderately frail according to the ID‐frailty index. Furthermore, 199 (20.3%) would be classified as at least severely frail (CFS score 7–9), but 74.9% of this group is not severely frail according to the ID‐frailty index. Overall, 730 out of 982 (74.9%) individuals would be incorrectly classified by the CFS as too frail to have a good probability of survival. The ID‐frailty index predicts mortality better than the CFS in individuals with ID. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the CFS is not suitable to evaluate frailty in individuals with ID, with potential dramatic consequences for triage and decision‐making during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We strongly recommend using the ID‐frailty index when assessing probability of survival for individuals with ID.","Festen, Dederieke A. M.; Schoufour, Josje D.; Hilgenkamp, Thessa I.

RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 72 ± 14 years (range 17–98), 244 (65.4%) were male and 69 (18.5%) had diabetes. The most common comorbid conditions were hypertension (237 [64.8%]), cardiovascular disease (140 [37.7%]) and malignant neoplasms (50 [13.6%]). In-hospital death occurred in 142 (38.0%) patients. In the multivariable model older age (Relative Risk [RR] 1.06 [1.04–1. 09] per year), diabetes (RR 1.56 [1.05–2.02]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR 1.82 [1.13–2.35]), higher values of lactic dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective single-center study, diabetes was independently associated with a higher in-hospital mortality. More intensive surveillance of patients with this condition is to be warranted.","Ciardullo, S.; Zerbini, F.; Perra, S.; Muraca, E.; Cannistraci, R.; Lauriola, M.; Grosso, P.; Lattuada, G.; Ippoliti, G.; Mortara, A.; Manzoni, G.; Perseghin, G.",J Endocrinol Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32776197/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-020-01382-7,129

Design and setting A retrospective chart review was performed of the electronic medical record. Patients were included if they were identified as having confirmed COVID-19 as well as pneumothorax from March 16, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, mechanical ventilator parameters, lung compliance measurements and outcomes during hospitalization were collected. This case series was conducted in intensive care units at two large tertiary care centers within the Northwell Health System, located in New York State. Patients A total of 75 patients were identified who were predominantly male (73.3%) with an average age of 62.8 years. Thirty (40%) were Hispanic, 20 (26.7%) were White, 16 (21.3%) were Asian, and nine (12%) were Black. Common comorbid conditions were hypertension (52%), diabetes mellitus (26.7%), hyperlipidemia (32.0%), and chronic pulmonary disease (8, 10.7%). Measurements and main results Most of the patients were diagnosed with pneumothorax while on mechanical ventilation (92%) despite overall adherence with lung-protective ventilation strategies. Average tidal volume was 6.66 mL/kg) of ideal body weight. The average positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 10.83 (cm) H2O. Lung compliance was poor, with average peak and plateau pressures of 41.9 cm H2O and 35.2 cm H2O, respectively. Inpatient mortality was high in these patients (76%). Conservative management with initial observation had a success rate (73.3%) with similar mortality and shorter length of stay (LOS) on average. Significant factors in the conservatively managed group included lack of tension physiology, the smaller size of pneumothorax, lack of underlying diabetes, presence of pneumomediastinum, and not being on mechanical ventilation during diagnosis. Conclusion Despite overall adherence to best practice ventilator management in ARDS, we observed a large number of pneumothoraces during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conservative management may be appropriate if there are no clinical signs or symptoms of tension physiology and pneumothorax size is small.","Wong, Kelvin; Kim, Dae Hyeon; Iakovou, Annamaria; Khanijo, Sameer; Tsegaye, Adey; Hahn, Stella; Narasimhan, Mangala; Zaidi, Gulrukh",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403179/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11749,129

METHODS: We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children aged <2 years with a physician admitting diagnosis of bronchiolitis. For 3 consecutive years, from November 1, 2007 until March 31, 2010, site teams collected data from participating families, including information about prenatal maternal smoking and postnatal tobacco exposure. Analyses used chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 2207 enrolled children, 216 (10%) had isolated in utero exposure to maternal smoking, 168 (8%) had isolated postnatal tobacco exposure, and 115 (5%) experienced both. Adjusting for age, sex, race, birth weight, viral etiology, apnea, initial severity of retractions, initial oxygen saturation, oral intake, and postnatal tobacco exposure, children with in utero exposure to maternal smoking had greater odds of being admitted to the ICU (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–2.00). Among children with in utero exposure to maternal smoking, those with additional postnatal tobacco exposure had a greater likelihood of ICU admission (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13–3.37) compared to children without postnatal tobacco smoke exposure (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05–2.04). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy puts children hospitalized with bronchiolitis at significantly higher risk of intensive care use. Postnatal tobacco smoke exposure may exacerbate this risk. Health care providers should incorporate this information into counseling messages.","Stevenson, Michelle D.; Mansbach, Jonathan M.; Mowad, Eugene; Dunn, Michelle; Clark, Sunday; Piedra, Pedro A.; Sullivan, Ashley F.; Camargo, Carlos A.",Acad Pediatr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187628591500340X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2015.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555856/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187628591500340X,129

OBJECTIVES: To assess the predictive role of baseline ECG markers of increased risk of malignant arrhythmias and cardiac death for adverse in‐hospital outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study included 93 patients of newly diagnosed COVID‐19 with features consistent with pneumonia who were admitted to the hospital from August 20 to September 20, 2020. The main outcomes were defined as receiving mechanical ventilation, in‐hospital cardiac arrest, length of ICU stay, and degree of lung damage according to computed tomography (CT) score. RESULTS: Increased QTc (QT corrected) interval, Tp‐e (T from peak to end) interval, and transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) were independent predictors of prolonged ICU stay (P < .0001) after adjustment for baseline clinical characteristics. Increasing age (P < .0001) followed by increased QTc interval (P = .02) and history of chronic lung disease (P = .04) were independent predictors of extensive lung damage. The independent predictors for in‐hospital cardiac arrest were increased QTc (P = .02) followed by increasing age (P = .04) and increased Tp‐e interval (P = .04).

PURPOSE: The paper investigates if people compensate risk in this manner when their interaction partner wears a face mask, examining if risk compensation further depends on gender, signaled social status and perceived race. METHODS: An experiment was conducted in two waves (June, n = 1396 and September 2020, n = 1326) in front of the traffic lights of four busy roads in Paris. A confederate asked a randomly selected pedestrian for directions following a script and keeping the recommended distance. Confederates were locally recognizable as Blacks or Whites and alternatively presented themselves with a costume indicative of high or low social status. An observer recorded whether the pedestrian kept the recommended distance. RESULTS: Both in June and September, men are less likely to comply with the distancing rule when the confederate wears the face mask, and particularly so when the confederate signals high status. When the confederate wears the mask, female pedestrians observe less the one-meter rule in September than in June. CONCLUSIONS: Men's risk compensatory behavior is constant over time. In contrast, women's depends on the time period.","Aranguren, Martin",Ann. behav. med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34397085/; https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaab072,129

Therefore fly ash from MWI must be appropriately treated before being discharged into the environment. A melting process based on a direct current thermal plasma torch has been developed to convert MWI fly ash into harmless slag. The leaching characteristics of heavy metals in fly ash and vitrified slag were investigated using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, while the content of PCDD/Fs in the fly ashes and slags was measured using method 1613 of the US EPA. The experimental results show that the decomposition rate of PCDD/Fs is over 99% in toxic equivalent quantity value and the leaching of heavy metals in the slag significantly decreases after the plasma melting process. The produced slag has a compact and homogeneous microstructure with density of up to 2.8 g/cm3.","Pan, Xinchao; Yan, Jianhua; Xie, Zhengmiao",Journal of Environmental Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24218848/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S100107421260196X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S100107421260196X,129

Methods: Against the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, the data of patients who visited the neurological clinic of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital West Branch during the pandemic (February 1–May 30, 2020) and the corresponding period in 2019 (February 1–May 30, 2019) were analyzed, and patients with dizziness/vertigo from these two periods were compared to discover their demographic features and etiologic distribution according to their age and sex. Result: The absolute number of neurological outpatients decreased from 14,670 in 2019 to 8,763 in 2020 (−40.3%), with a corresponding decline in dizziness/vertigo patients (2019: n = 856; 2020: n = 1,436, −40.4%). Dizziness/vertigo was more common in women than men in these two periods (2019: women = 63.6%; 2020: women = 63.1%, p = 0.82). The overall etiology distribution was different among all disorders between the two periods (p < 0.001). There was an increase in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (2019 vs. 2020: 30.7 vs. 35%, p < 0.05) and psychogenic/persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) (2019 vs. 2020: 28.5 vs. 34.6%, p < 0.05) while a decrease in vascular vertigo during the epidemic (2019 vs. 2020: 13 vs. 9.6%, p < 0.05). During the epidemic, the top three causes of dizziness/vertigo were BPPV (35%), psychogenic/PPPD (34.6%), and vascular vertigo (9.6%). A female predominance was observed in BPPV (women = 67.7%, p < 0.05) and psychogenic/PPPD (women = 67.6%, p < 0.05). In addition, the etiology ratio of different age groups was significantly different (p < 0.001). The most common cause for young and young-old patients was BPPV, and the most common cause for middle-aged and old-old patients was psychogenic/PPPD. Conclusion: The absolute number of outpatients with dizziness/vertigo during the COVID-19 pandemic was reduced during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak. BPPV and psychogenic/PPPD were more abundant, and vascular vertigo was less frequent. Based on those data, health-care management policy for dizziness/vertigo and mental disorder should be developed during the outbreak of COVID-19 and other infective diseases.","Li, Changqing; Guo, Dongsheng; Ma, Xiangke; Liu, Siwei; Liu, Mingyong; Zhou, Lichun",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.663173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995259/,129

Telemedicine could be an alternative to the routine clinical care in this difficult period. We aimed to investigate in a cohort of LT recipients the access to remote consultation and the attitude towards Telemedicine using an internet-based survey. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We invited LT recipients from the Liver Transplant Follow-up Center of the University Hospital of Salerno to access remote consultation. A subgroup of them also participated in a self-administered, internet-based survey evaluating demographics; LT data and immunosuppressive therapy; comorbidities; attitudes towards COVID-19 infection; their perceptions of the need for health care, and their approach to telemedicine. RESULTS: Seventy-four/one hundred and fifty-three (48.3%) LT recipients were unable to access remote consultation. They showed a significantly higher mean age and a higher percentage of low school degree compared to those who accessed it (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001, respectively). Among the remaining LT recipients, 50/79 (63.3%) responded to the survey; mean time from liver transplantation was 12 ± 7 years; 94% of the sample reported at least one comorbidity; 44% of LT recipients declared to be “very much/much” worried because of COVID-19 infection, and 64% considered themselves more vulnerable than the general population. Forty percent of responders refused the routine follow-up visit, and 62% were very interested in using Telemedicine. CONCLUSION: LT recipients were anxious because of COVID-19 infection and considered themselves more vulnerable than the general population, refusing the routine clinical visit.

Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for treating coronavirus infections. In this study, we have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 helicase (Nsp13), which is critical for viral replication and the most conserved nonstructural protein within the coronavirus family. Using homology modeling that couples published electron-density with molecular dynamics (MD)-based structural refinements, we generated structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 helicase in its apo- and ATP/RNA-bound conformations. We performed virtual screening of ∼970 000 chemical compounds against the ATP-binding site to identify potential inhibitors. Herein, we report docking hits of approved human drugs targeting the ATP-binding site. Importantly, two of our top drug hits have significant activity in inhibiting purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 helicase, providing hope that these drugs can be potentially repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.","White, Mark Andrew; Lin, Wei; Cheng, Xiaodong",J Phys Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052685/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02421,129
631276,The clinical features and predictive factors of nocturnal enuresis in adult men,2020-07-24,"We recently reported that the intronic splice-site mutation IVS3-8G>A of CHRNA1 that encodes the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α subunit disrupts binding of a splicing repressor, hnRNP H. This, in turn, results in exclusive inclusion of the downstream exon P3A. The P3A(+) transcript encodes a non-functional α subunit that comprises 50% of the transcripts in normal human skeletal muscle, but its functional significance remains undetermined. In an effort to search for a potential therapy, we screened off-label effects of 960 bioactive chemical compounds and found that tannic acid ameliorates the aberrant splicing due to IVS3-8G>A but without altering the expression of hnRNP H. Therefore, we searched for another splicing trans-factor. We found that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) binds close to the 3′ end of CHRNA1 intron 3, that PTB induces skipping of exon P3A and that tannic acid increases the expression of PTB in a dose-dependent manner. Deletion assays of the PTB promoter region revealed that the tannic acid-responsive element is between positions −232 and −74 from the translation initiation site. These observations open the door to the discovery of novel therapies based on PTB overexpression and to detecting possible untoward effects of the overexpression.","Bian, Yang; Masuda, Akio; Matsuura, Tohru; Ito, Mikako; Okushin, Kazuya; Engel, Andrew G.; Ohno, Kinji",Human Molecular Genetics,https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article-pdf/18/7/1229/17248462/ddp023.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddp023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19147685/,129

631996,Rinsing the rima oris for expanding the horizons of breathing: Hypothesis processed,2020-12-03,"PURPOSE: Worldwide, patients experience difficulties accessing elective surgical care. This study examined the perceived health, social, and functional impacts of elective surgical cancellations and postponements in Canada. METHODS: We analyzed a subset of aggregate data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) annual components from 2005 to 2014. Multivariable logistic regressions examined associations between past-year non-emergency surgical cancellations/postponements and perceived impacts of waiting for surgery (e.g., worry/stress/anxiety, pain, loss of work, loss of income, deterioration of health, relationships suffered). RESULTS: Among those who experienced a cancellation or postponement of a past-year non-emergency surgery (weighted n = 256,836; 11.8%), 23.5% (weighted n = 60,345) indicated their life was affected by waiting for surgery. After adjusting for type of surgery, year, and sociodemographics, those who experienced a surgical cancellation or postponement had increased odds of reporting their life was affected by waiting for surgery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.67; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.41 to 5.1); in particular, they reported greater deterioration of their health (aOR, 3.47; 99% CI, 1.05 to 11.4) and increased dependence on relatives/friends (aOR, 2.53; 99% CI, 1.01 to 6.3) than those who did not have a cancellation or postponement. CONCLUSION: Results highlight the multifaceted perceived impacts of surgical cancellations/postponements. These findings suggest there is a need for improvements in reducing elective surgical cancellations and postponements. Results may also inform the development of targeted interventions to improve patients’ health and quality of life while waiting for surgery.","Sommer, Jordana L.; Jacobsohn, Eric; El-Gabalawy, Renée",Can J Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085061/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-020-01824-z,129
632782,Association between Long COVID and Overweight/Obesity,2021-09-14,"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of many people across the globe, both through the direct interpersonal cost of the disease, and the governmental restrictions imposed to mitigate its spread and impact. The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of ‘lockdown’ (15(th)–21(st) May 2020) and the specific role of Psychological Flexibility as a potential mitigating process. We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (N=555). However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress. Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest. No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found. In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses). Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping. We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic.","Dawson, David L.; Golijani-Moghaddam, Nima",J Contextual Behav Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212144720301654; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301654?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834970/,129

633862,Modern radiation techniques in early stage breast cancer for the breast radiologist,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 has affected almost every country in the world, which causing many negative implications in terms of education, economy and mental health. Worryingly, the trend of second or third wave of the pandemic has been noted in multiple regions despite early success of flattening the curve, such as in the case of Malaysia, post Sabah state election in September 2020. Hence, it is imperative to predict ongoing trend of COVID-19 to assist crucial policymaking in curbing the transmission. METHOD: Generalized logistic growth modelling (GLM) approach was adopted to make prediction of growth of cases according to each state in Malaysia. The data was obtained from official Ministry of Health Malaysia daily report, starting from 26 September 2020 until 1 January 2021. RESULT: Sabah, Johor, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are predicted to exceed 10,000 cumulative cases by 2 February 2021. Nationally, the growth factor has been shown to range between 0.25 to a peak of 3.1 throughout the current Movement Control Order (MCO). The growth factor range for Sabah ranged from 1.00 to 1.25, while Selangor, the state which has the highest case, has a mean growth factor ranging from 1.22 to 1.52. The highest growth rates reported were in WP Labuan for the time periods of 22 Nov - 5 Dec 2020 with growth rates of 4.77. States with higher population densities were predicted to have higher cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: GLM is helpful to provide governments and policymakers with accurate and helpful forecasts on magnitude of epidemic and peak time. This forecast could assist government in devising short- and long-term plan to tackle the ongoing pandemic.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Kamu, Assis; Mohd Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin; Ho, Chong Mun",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377875/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042721000506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000506,129

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been used for its treatment but their safety and efficacy remain uncertain. Objective: We performed a systematic review to synthesize the available data on the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 to 8th June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. Results: We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies. Meta-analysis of included studies revealed no significant reduction in mortality with HCQ use [RR 0.98 95% CI 0.66-1.46] , time to fever resolution [mean difference -0.54 days (-1.19-011)] or clinical deterioration/development of ARDS with HCQ [RR 0.90 95% CI 0.47-1.71]. There was a higher risk of ECG abnormalities/arrhythmia with HCQ/CQ [RR 1.46 95% CI 1.04 to 2.06]. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for these outcomes. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that CQ or HCQ does not improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Well-designed randomized trials are required for assessing the efficacy and safety of HCQ and CQ for COVID-19.","Elavarasi, A.; Prasad, M.; Seth, T.; Sahoo, R.

Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our findings and new research directions are discussed. Our study was conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which preppers consider a 'mid-level' event, and which many of them were well-prepared for, makes clear that scholarly attention to prepper's motivations and methods is both timely and valuable. Drawing from a three-year ethnographic research project with preppers, this paper traces the activity of a single bunker builder who has constructed a technically sophisticated private underground community. Supplemented by additional fieldwork, the paper argues that the boltholes preppers are building in closed communities built to survive the collapse of society, order, and even the environment itself, refract the seemingly irresolvable problems we are failing to address as a species. In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial. The bunkers preppers build are an ark to cross through a likely (but often unspecified) catastrophe; they are a chrysalis from which to be reborn - potentially even into an improved milieu.","Garrett, Bradley",Geoforum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292206/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016718520300804; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718520300804; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2020.03.014,129

It is, therefore, the duty of paediatric teams in Europe to prepare for the challenges ahead. We wish to contribute to this necessary preparedness in two ways: firstly, by assessing the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on children and on the paediatric setting; secondly, and more importantly, by identifying the various responsibilities of paediatric healthcare professionals, in light of established ethical principles.

The development of vaccines against COVID-19 is essential to contain the pandemic. we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Shanghai residents to understand residents’ willingness to be vaccinated with any future COVID-19 vaccines and take measures to further improve vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from 1 July to 8 September 2020. The main outcome was willingness of participants, and any children or older individuals living with them, to receive future COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential factors associated with vaccination willingness. RESULTS: A total of 1071 participants were asked about their willingness to receive future COVID-19 vaccines, for themselves and at least 747 children and 375 older individuals (≥60 years old) living with them. The highest proportion of expected willingness to vaccinate was among participants (88.6%), followed by children (85.3%) and older individuals (84.0%). The main reasons for reluctance to vaccinate among 119 participants were doubts regarding vaccine safety (60.0%) and efficacy (28.8%). Participants with a self-reported history of influenza vaccination were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines for themselves [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19–2.82], their children (adjusted OR = 2.08; 95%CI: 1.30–3.33), and older individuals in their household (adjusted OR = 2.12; 95%CI: 1.14–3.99).

Metabolic adaptations have been shown to fuel therapy resistance; however, little is known regarding the generality of these changes and whether specific therapies elicit unique metabolic alterations. Using a combination of metabolomics, transcriptomics, and functional genomics, we show that two anthracyclines, doxorubicin and epirubicin, elicit distinct primary metabolic vulnerabilities in human breast cancer cells. Doxorubicin-resistant cells rely on glutamine to drive oxidative phosphorylation and de novo glutathione synthesis, while epirubicin-resistant cells display markedly increased bioenergetic capacity and mitochondrial ATP production. The dependence on these distinct metabolic adaptations is revealed by the increased sensitivity of doxorubicin-resistant cells and tumor xenografts to buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a drug that interferes with glutathione synthesis, compared with epirubicin-resistant counterparts that are more sensitive to the biguanide phenformin. Overall, our work reveals that metabolic adaptations can vary with therapeutics and that these metabolic dependencies can be exploited as a targeted approach to treat chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer.","McGuirk, Shawn; Audet-Delage, Yannick; Annis, Matthew G; Xue, Yibo; Vernier, Mathieu; Zhao, Kaiqiong; St-Louis, Catherine; Minarrieta, Lucía; Patten, David A; Morin, Geneviève; Greenwood, Celia MT; Giguère, Vincent; Huang, Sidong; Siegel, Peter M; St-Pierre, Julie",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181531/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.65150,129

This paper describes a similar system developed for in-hospital acute care environments, AlertWatch Acute Care (AWAC). RESULTS: A decision support surveillance system has been developed which extracts comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data including live data from physiologic monitors and ventilators and incorporates them into an integrated organ icon-based patient display. Live data retrieved from the hospitals network are processed by presenting scrolling median values to reduce artifacts. A total of 48 possible alerts are generated covering a broad range of critical patient care concerns. Notification is achieved by paging or texting the appropriated member of the critical care team. Alerts range from simple out of range values to more complex programing of impending Ventilator Associated Events, SOFA, qSOFA, SIRS scores and process of care reminders for the management of glucose and sepsis. As with similar systems developed for the operating room and labor and delivery, there are green, yellow, and red configurable ranges for all parameters. A census view allows surveillance of an entire unit with flashing or text to voice alerting and enables detailed information by windowing into an individual patient view including live physiologic waveforms. The system runs via web interface on desktop as well as mobile devices, with iOS native app available, for ease of communication from any location. The goal is to improve safety and adherence to standard management protocols. CONCLUSIONS: AWAC is designed to provide a high level surveillance view for multi-bed hospital units with varying acuity from standard floor patients to complex ICU care. Alerts are generated by algorithms running in the background and automatically notify the selected member of the patients care team. Its value has been demonstrated for low acuity patients, further study is required to determine its effectiveness in high acuity patients.","Colquhoun, Douglas A.; Davis, Ryan P.; Tremper, Theodore T.; Mace, Jenny J.; Gombert, Jan M.; Sheldon, William D.; Connolly, Joseph J.; Adams, Justin F.; Tremper, Kevin K.",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301196/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-021-01411-9,129

In this study, we analyzed clinical and transmission features of 25 cases of Covid-19 from a single thoracic department, including 13 patients and 12 health care staff. There were 13 males and 12 females. The median age of the patients was 61 (range: 51 to 69) years. The median age of the health care staff was 35 (range: 22 to 51) years. By the end of follow-up date (Mar. 3, 2020), there were 16 non-severe cases (64%) and 9 severe cases (36%), 5 cases were dead (20%). Nineteen (76%) of the infected cases were confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, the rest were clinically diagnosed as suspected Covid-19 cases, and 19 (76%) of the infected cases had positive exposure history. We found that COPD was significantly associated with severity and death (P=0.040, and P=0.038, respectively), and chest operation was significantly associated with death for Covid-19 patients (P=0.039). A potential “super spreader” may be the source of the transmission before the implementation of quarantine and comprehensive protection.

Since the advent of the Second world war-2, humankind has experienced the most challenging health emergencies. The novel respiratory disease (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan at the end of December 2019. Aim The study focuses on providing education through the educational system with a mode of delivery using digital solutions with a new paradigm method. Method This research incorporates the statistical data related to the Pakistani Ministry of Health's coronavirus epidemic to draw the results. Results WHO reported more than 51.949 million confirmed COVID-19 patients in more than 200 territories and countries. This epidemic caused more than 1.282 million deaths; however, more than 36.49 million people have recovered from the infection of the deadly disease COVID-19, as of November 11, 2020. The COVID-19 has put forward unique challenges in personal and social life spheres. The precautionary measures, including social distancing, called for abrupt closure of educational institutions, leaving the digital solutions as the primary mean of continuity in educational activities. Conclusion The current review looks into the dynamics of embracing the change in the educational system, ranging from delivery mode to shifting to a new paradigm moving to digital solutions. This study looks into the challenges, issues, barriers, and success parameters of Pakistan's online learning management system. From the preparedness phase to the actual implementation of the learning system at higher education, the level is noteworthy. The private sector has provided higher, secondary, and primary levels; the private sector came forward to maintain learning continuity. The review suggests a way forward ahead for the educational system's continuity and sustainability in the coronavirus pandemic and educational institutions' crises.","Maqsood, Aneela; Abbas, Jaffar; Rehman, Ghazala; Mubeen, Riaqa",Current Research in Behavioral Sciences,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666518220300115; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666518220300115,129

Previous studies have implicated alveolar‐epithelial succinate in ALI protection. Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting alveolar succinate dehydrogenase SDH A would result in elevated succinate levels and concomitant lung protection. Wild‐type (WT) mice or transgenic mice with targeted alveolar‐epithelial Sdha or hypoxia‐inducible transcription factor Hif1a deletion were exposed to ALI induced by mechanical ventilation. Succinate metabolism was assessed in alveolar‐epithelial via mass spectrometry as well as redox measurements and evaluation of lung injury. In WT mice, ALI induced by mechanical ventilation decreased SDHA activity and increased succinate in alveolar‐epithelial. In vitro, cell‐permeable succinate decreased epithelial inflammation during stretch injury. Mice with inducible alveolar‐epithelial Sdha deletion (Sdha(loxp/loxp) SPC‐CreER mice) revealed reduced lung inflammation, improved alveolar barrier function, and attenuated histologic injury. Consistent with a functional role of succinate to stabilize HIF, Sdha(loxp/loxp) SPC‐CreER experienced enhanced Hif1a levels during hypoxia or ALI. Conversely, Hif1a(loxp/loxp) SPC‐CreER showed increased inflammation with ALI induced by mechanical ventilation. Finally, wild‐type mice treated with intra‐tracheal dimethlysuccinate were protected during ALI. These data suggest that targeting alveolar‐epithelial SDHA dampens ALI via succinate‐mediated stabilization of HIF1A. Translational extensions of our studies implicate succinate treatment in attenuating alveolar inflammation in patients suffering from ARDS.","Vohwinkel, Christine U.; Coit, Ethan J.; Burns, Nana; Elajaili, Hanan; Hernandez‐Saavedra, Daniel; Yuan, Xiaoyi; Eckle, Tobias; Nozik, Eva; Tuder, Rubin M.; Eltzschig, Holger K.",FASEB J,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002778r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687752/,129

However, little is known about the underlying processes that may mediate or moderate the relationship. The present study examined the relation between novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors, as well as the mediation role of personal responsibility and moderation role of health orientation. A sample of 511 online participants (mean age = 32.47 years) responded to anonymous questionnaires regarding COVID-19 information consumption on social media, health orientation, personal responsibility, and preventive behaviors. Bias-corrected bootstrap method was used to test the moderated mediation model. Results indicated that after controlling for participants' age, gender, education, income, and insurance, personal responsibility mediated the relationship between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, the direct relation between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors, and the mediation effect of personal responsibility were moderated by health orientation. The present study can extend our knowledge about how risk information consumption on social media is related to one's behavioral outcomes.

645722,A Novel Boot Camp Program to Help Guide Personalized Exercise in People with Parkinson Disease,2021-09-20,"Models of free recall describe free recall initiation as a decision-making process in which items compete to be retrieved. Recently, Osth and Farrell (Psychological Review, 126, 578–609, 2019) applied evidence accumulation models to complete RT distributions and serial positions of participants’ first recalls in free recall, which resulted in some novel conclusions about primacy and recency effects. Specifically, the results of the modeling favored an account in which primacy was due to reinstatement of the start-of-the-list, and recency was found to be exponential in shape. In this work, we examine what happens when participants are given alternative recall instructions. Prior work has demonstrated weaker primacy and greater recency when fewer items are required to report (Ward & Tan, Memory & Cognition, 2019), and a key question is whether this change in instructions qualitatively changes the nature of the recall process, or merely changes the parameters of the recall competition. We conducted an experiment where participants studied six- or 12-item lists and were post-cued as to whether to retrieve a single item, or as many items as possible. Subsequently, we applied LBA models with various assumptions about primacy and recency, implemented using hierarchical Bayesian techniques. While greater recency was observed when only one item was required for output, the model selection did not suggest that there were qualitative differences between the two conditions. Specifically, start-of-list reinstatement and exponential recency functions were favored in both conditions.

Excessive leukocyte recruitment, unregulated inflammation, and resultant fibrosis contribute to poor ARDS outcomes. Nanoparticle technology with cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNP) offers a mechanism by which unstable therapeutics such as the anti-inflammatory microRNA-146a can be locally delivered to the injured lung without systemic uptake. In this study, we evaluated the potential of the radical scavenging CNP conjugated to microRNA-146a (termed CNP-miR146a) in preventing acute lung injury (ALI) following exposure to bleomycin. We have found that intratracheal delivery of CNP-miR146a increases pulmonary levels of miR146a without systemic increases, and prevents ALI by altering leukocyte recruitment, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and decreasing collagen deposition, ultimately improving pulmonary biomechanics.","Niemiec, Stephen M.; Hilton, Sarah A.; Wallbank, Alison; Azeltine, Mark; Louiselle, Amanda E.; Elajaili, Hanan; Allawzi, Ayed; Xu, Junwang; Mattson, Courtney; Dewberry, Lindel C.; Hu, Junyi; Singh, Sushant; Sakthivel, Tamil S; Seal, Sudipta; Nozik-Grayck, Eva; Smith, Bradford; Zgheib, Carlos; Liechty, Kenneth W.",Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753282/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nano.2021.102388; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1549963421000319?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1549963421000319,129

Early identification of the emergence of novel outbreaks of infectious diseases is critical to the generation of timely responses. We performed a comparative study to determine the feasibility of the early detection of the COVID-19 outbreak in China based on influenza surveillance data and the internet-based Baidu search index to evaluate the timelines of the alert signals compared with the traditional case reporting and response systems. An abnormal increase in the number of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) occurred at least one month earlier than the clinical reports of pneumonia with unknown causes and the conventional monitoring system. The peak of the search volume was 20 days earlier than the issuance of the massive official warning about the epidemic. The findings from this study suggest that monitoring abnormal surges of ILI and identifying peaks of online searches of key terms can provide early signals of novel disease outbreaks. We emphasize the importance of broadening the potential of syndromic surveillance, internet searches, and social media data together with the traditional disease surveillance system to enhance early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases. SYNOPSIS: Early identification of the emergence of an outbreak of a novel infectious disease is critical to generating a timely response. The traditional monitoring system is adequate for detecting the outbreak of common diseases; however, it is insufficient for the discovery of novel infectious diseases. In this study, we used COVID-19 as an example to compare the delay time of different tools for identifying disease outbreaks. The results showed that both the abnormal spike in influenza-like illnesses and the peak of online searches of key terms could provide early signals. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings and discussing the broader potential to use syndromic surveillance, internet searches, and social media data together with traditional disease surveillance systems for early detection and understanding of novel emerging infectious diseases.","Dai, Yaoyao; Wang, Jianming",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001985/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008758,129

The plan for dose adjustment is usually done as per drug information recommendations from the licensing bodies, but there are no clear guidelines with regards to the best practice regarding the tapering off schedule given sudden dose reductions of drugs such as dopamine agonists may have serious adverse consequences. A systematic literature search was, therefore, performed to derive recommendations and the data show that there are no controlled studies or evidence-based recommendations how to taper or discontinue PD medication in a systematic manner. Most of the data were available on the dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) and we found only two instructions on how to reduce pramipexole and rotigotine published by the EMA. We suggest that based on the available data, levodopa, dopamine agonists (DA), and amantadine should not be discontinued abruptly. Abrupt or sudden reduction of DA or amantadine in particular can lead to severe life-threatening withdrawal symptoms. Tapering off levodopa, COMT inhibitors, and MAO-B inhibitors may worsen motor and non-motor symptoms. Based on our clinical experience, we have proposed how to reduce PD medication and this work will form the basis of a future Delphi panel to define the recommendations in a consensus.","Koschel, J.; Ray Chaudhuri, K.; Tönges, L.; Thiel, M.; Raeder, V.; Jost, W.

However, the differences in a viral infection pattern and clinical impacts of respiratory viruses between the two groups have not been well investigated. The clinical and microbiological data from COPD patients admitted with AE‐COPD (n = 281) or CP‐COPD (n = 284) between January 2010 and December 2012 were reviewed. After excluding 88 patients (40 with AE‐COPD and 48 with CP‐COPD) who did not undergo a multiplex RT‐PCR test for respiratory viruses, the demographic characteristics, identified viruses, and clinical outcomes of the AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD groups were compared. Respiratory viruses were identified in 41.9% of AE‐COPD group and 33.5% of the CP‐COPD groups. The most common virus was influenza virus in the AE‐COPD group (33.7%) versus human coronavirus (24.1%) in the CP‐COPD group. Influenza virus was significantly more common in the AE‐ACOPD group than in the CP‐COPD group (P < 0.01). In‐hospital mortality of AE‐COPD and CP‐COPD were 1.2% and 12.3%, respectively (P < 0.01).

We compared per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths from January 23, 2020 to January 24, 2021, across neighborhoods in Toronto by proportion of the population working in essential services. We used person-level data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 community cases and deaths, and census data for neighborhood-level attributes. Cumulative per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were 3.3-fold and 2.5-fold higher, respectively, in neighborhoods with the highest versus lowest concentration of essential workers.

649814,Positive Screening for Wuhan Novel Coronavirus Infection at International Airport: What's the Final Diagnosis for Positive Cases,2020-02-21,"Viral pathogenesis seeks to understand how a virus interacts with its host at multiple levels. Key questions include the source (an infected human, animal, or insect vector), the transmission mechanism, and how the virus is shed and transmitted. Following transmission, pathogenesis is governed by the initial site of replication, whether the virus disseminates within the host, and its tropism for specific tissues and organs. In turn, these steps are dictated by the structure and replication strategy of the virus. In addition to utilizing selected synthetic biochemical pathways in the host cell, viruses frequently reprogram host cells by inducing intracellular signaling pathways that render the cell more permissive. Host–virus interactions also control whether the infection is acute, chronic, latent, or transforming; how the virus interacts with the immune system; and the consequent pathophysiological response of the host. This chapter provides an overview of these basic concepts of viral pathogenesis, with emphasis on the interactions of viruses with their host cells and organisms.","Doms, Robert W.",Viral Pathogenesis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128009642000033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128009642000033,129

However, few have focused on the specific needs of Asian Americans (AA). We examine the prevalence of HRSN during a period spanning the COVID-19 pandemic to inform strategies to improve cancer screening and primary care among AA patients. Methods: We implemented a self-administered HRSN screening tool in English and Chinese, traditional (T) or simplified (S) text, within a hospital-affiliated, outpatient primary care practice predominantly serving AA in New Jersey. HRSN items included food insecurity, transportation barriers, utility needs, interpersonal violence, housing instability, immigration history, and neighborhood perceptions on cohesion and trust. We conducted medical chart reviews for a subset of participants to explore the relationship between HRSN and history of cancer screening. Results: Among 236 participants, most were Asian (74%), non-US born (79%), and privately insured (57%). One-third responded in Chinese (37%). Half reported having ≥1 HRSN. Interpersonal violence was high across all participants. Transportation needs were highest among Chinese-T participants, while food insecurity and housing instability were higher among Chinese-S participants. Lower-income patients had higher odds of having ≥2 HRSN (OR:2.53, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.98). Older age and public insurance/uninsured were significantly associated with low neighborhood perceptions. Conclusions: We observed higher than anticipated reports of HRSN among primary care patients in a suburban, hospital-affiliated practice serving AA. Low neighborhood perceptions, particularly among Chinese-S participants, highlight the importance of addressing broader SDOH among insured, suburban AA patients. These study findings inform the need to augment HRSN identification to adequately address social needs that impact health outcomes and life course experiences for Asian patients. As HRSN measuring efforts continue, and COVID-19's impact on the health of minority communities emerge, it will be critical to develop community-specific referral pathways to connect AA to resources for HRSN and continue to address more upstream social determinants of health for those who are disproportionately impacted.","Tsui, Jennifer; Yang, Annie; Anuforo, Bianca; Chou, Jolene; Brogden, Ruth; Xu, Binghong; Cantor, Joel C.; Wang, Su",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123992/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.674035,129

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was added to the panel of viral testing by polymerase chain reaction for the first 2 patients with ILI seen at one of the sentinel sites. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus co-infection with mild symptoms detected through routine ILI surveillance in Egypt. OBJECTIVE: This report aims to describe how the case was identified and the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patient. METHODS: The case was identified by Central Public Health Laboratory staff, who contacted the ILI sentinel surveillance officer at the Ministry of Health. The case patient was contacted through a telephone call. Detailed information about the patient’s clinical picture, course of disease, and outcome was obtained. The contacts of the patient were investigated for acute respiratory symptoms, disease confirmation, and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 510 specimens collected from patients with ILI symptoms from October 2019 to August 2020, 61 (12.0%) were COVID-19–positive and 29 (5.7%) tested positive for influenza, including 15 (51.7%) A(H1N1), 11 (38.0%) A(H3N2), and 3 (10.3%) influenza B specimens. A 21-year-old woman was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A(H1N1) virus coinfection. She had a high fever of 40.2 °C and mild respiratory symptoms that resolved within 2 days with symptomatic treatment. All five of her family contacts had mild respiratory symptoms 2-3 days after exposure to the confirmed case, and their symptoms resolved without treatment or investigation. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the possible occurrence of SARS-CoV-2/influenza A(H1N1) coinfection in younger and healthy people, who may resolve the infection rapidly. We emphasize the usefulness of the surveillance system for detection of viral causative agents of ILI and recommend broadening of the testing panel, especially if it can guide case management.","Fahim, Manal; Ghonim, Hanaa Abu El Sood; Roshdy, Wael H; Naguib, Amel; Elguindy, Nancy; AbdelFatah, Mohamad; Hassany, Mohamed; Mohsen, Amira; Afifi, Salma; Eid, Alaa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784634/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27433,129

More specifically, combining zoonotic disease data with wildlife trade data from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife and Fauna (CITES), we show that making trade requirements more stringent leads to a decrease in the number of animals traded and, incidentally, also the number of zoonotic diseases that are traded. Our results contribute to the discussion of policy measures that manage the spread of zoonotic diseases.","Borsky, Stefan; Hennighausen, Hannah; Leiter, Andrea; Williges, Keith",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10640-020-00456-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836860/,129

Among these, its role in the innate immune system as a first line of defense against pathogens has received less attention. In asthma, levels of exhaled NO have been utilized as a window into airway inflammation caused by allergic processes. However, respiratory infections count among the most important triggers of disease exacerbations. Among the multitude of factors that affect NO levels are psychological processes. In particular, longer lasting states of psychological stress and depression have been shown to attenuate NO production. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has caused a pandemic, and with that, sustained levels of psychological stress globally, also adversely affects NO signaling. We review evidence on the role of NO in respiratory infection, including COVID-19, and stress, and argue that boosting NO bioavailability may be beneficial in protection from infections, thus benefitting individuals who suffer from stress in asthma or SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ritz, Thomas; Salsman, Margot L.; Young, Danielle A.; Lippert, Alexander R.; Khan, Dave A.; Ginty, Annie T.",Brain Behav Immun Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354621000582?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666354621000582; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842899/,129

Thus, there is an urgent need to establish biological models to study the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which not only involves respiratory failure, but also includes dysregulation of other organs and systems, including the brain, heart, liver, intestines, pancreas, kidneys, eyes, and so on. Cellular and organoid models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are ideal tools for in vitro simulation of viral life cycles and drug screening to prevent the reemergence of coronavirus. These iPSC-derived models could recapitulate the functions and physiology of various human cell types and assemble the complex microenvironments similar with those in the human organs; therefore, they can improve the study efficiency of viral infection mechanisms, mimic the natural host-virus interaction, and be suited for long-term experiments. In this review, we focus on the application of in vitro iPSC-derived cellular and organoid models in COVID-19 studies.","Luo, Yumei; Zhang, Mimi; Chen, Yapei; Chen, Yaoyong; Zhu, Detu",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34552930/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2021.720099,129

Co‐chaired by Professors Heinz Feldmann and Jürgen Richt, the conference explored 10 topics: (i) The ecology of emerging zoonotic diseases; (ii) The role of wildlife in emerging zoonoses; (iii) Cross‐species transmission of zoonotic pathogens; (iv) Emerging and neglected influenza viruses; (v) Haemorrhagic fever viruses; (vi) Emerging bacterial diseases; (vii) Outbreak responses to zoonotic diseases; (viii) Food‐borne zoonotic diseases; (ix) Prion diseases; and (x) Modelling and prediction of emergence of zoonoses. Human medicine, veterinary medicine and environmental challenges are viewed as a unity, which must be considered under the umbrella of ‘One Health’. Several presentations attempted to integrate the insights gained from field data with mathematical models in the search for effective control measures of specific zoonoses. The overriding objective of the research presentations was to create, improve and use the tools essential to address the risk of contagions in a globalized society. In seeking to fulfil this objective, a three‐step approach has often been applied: (i) use cultured cells, model and natural animal hosts and human clinical models to study infection; (ii) combine traditional histopathological and biochemical approaches with functional genomics, proteomics and computational biology; and (iii) obtain signatures of virulence and insights into mechanisms of host defense response, immune evasion and pathogenesis.

653713,Prostate Cancer Screening and Young Black Men: Can Early Communication Avoid Later Health Disparities?,2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND: As a result of low numbers of pediatric cases early in the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains an understudied topic. This study sought to determine whether there are differences in the odds of household transmission for younger children compared to older children. METHODS: We assembled a cohort of all individuals in Ontario, Canada with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between June 1 and December 31, 2020. The cohort was restricted to individuals residing in private households (N=132,232 cases in 89,191 households), identified through an address matching algorithm. Analysis focused on households in which the index case was aged <18 years. Logistic regression models were fit to estimate the association between age group of pediatric index cases (0-3, 4-8, 9-13, and 14-17 years) and odds of household transmission. RESULTS: A total of 6,280 households had pediatric index cases, and 1,717 (27.3%) experienced secondary transmission. Children aged 0-3 years had the highest odds of household transmission compared to children aged 14-17 years (model adjusted for gender, month of disease onset, testing delay, and average family size: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.75). This association was similarly observed in sensitivity analyses defining secondary cases as 2-14 days or 4-14 days after the index case, and stratified analyses by presence of symptoms, association with a school/childcare outbreak, or school/childcare reopening. Children aged 4-8 years and 9-13 years also had increased odds of transmission (4-8: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.18-1.67; 9-13: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.97-1.32). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that younger children are more likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to older children, and the highest odds of transmission was observed for children aged 0-3 years. Differential infectivity of pediatric age groups has implications for infection prevention controls within households, as well as schools/childcare, to minimize risk of household secondary transmission.","Paul, L.

654516,Improving lung function in adolescents with CF by tracking annual rate of lung function decline,2021-08-12,"PURPOSE: To investigate CT patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia associated with respiratory failure (RF) focused on the distribution of lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-five patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. CT findings were classified as follows: Type A; patchy ground glass attenuation (GGA) with/without air-space consolidation, Type B; non-segmental GGA with/without air-space consolidation in both the central and peripheral lung portions especially with subpleural spare, and Type C; non-segmental GGA with/without air-space consolidation predominantly distributed in the peripheral lung portion without subpleural spare. We analyzed CT patterns and clinical factors associated with RF, including age categories. RESULTS: The number of patients with Type A, B and C was 31 (37%), 24 (28%) and 30 (35%), respectively. Type C and hypertension were independently associated with RF. On comparing between Types B and C, the frequency of traction bronchiectasis was higher in Type C than in Type B (P < 0.001). The ratio of Type C in patients ≥ 65 years old (66%) was higher than in patients < 40 years old (P < 0.001) and 40–49 years old (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The Type C, increasing with age, was associated with RF. Traction bronchiectasis in the lesion was more frequent in Type C than in Type B. Secondary abstract A lesion adjacent to the pleura and hypertension is associated with respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of a lesion adjacent to the pleura increased with age. The distribution of lesions is a useful parameter to predict respiratory failure.","Fukuda, Akito; Yanagawa, Noriyo; Sekiya, Noritaka; Ohyama, Koji; Yomota, Makiko; Inui, Takanori; Fujiwara, Sho; Kawai, Shoko; Fukushima, Kazuaki; Tanaka, Masaru; Kobayashi, Taiichiro; Yajima, Keishiro; Imamura, Akifumi",Jpn J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844123/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-021-01118-4,129

METHODS: The medical records of 56 patients who received ECMO support treatment in the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University from January 2013 to December 2019 were selected. The nosocomial infection, pathogen distribution and drug resistance, and the influencing factors of nosocomial infection were analyzed. The predictive value of independent risk factors for nosocomial infection after ECMO was analyzed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients receiving ECMO treatment were included. The nosocomial infection rate was 28.57%, and the prevalence infection rate was 44.64%. Lower respiratory tract infection was the main infection site. Among these infectious patients, 53 strains of pathogens were detected. The results showed that the gram-negative bacteria were mainly Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumonia. Moreover, the drug resistance rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to most of the antibiotics was more than 65%, among which the drug resistance rate to carbapenems was 80%. The results of risk factors of nosocomial infection after ECMO were analyzed by univariate analysis, showing that ECMO treatment time, hospitalization time, antibacterial drug use time, ventilator use time, catheter intubation time and central venous intubation time were statistically significant (all p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified that ECMO treatment time was an independent risk factor. As showed by ROC curve, ECMO treatment time had a high predictive value for postoperative nosocomial infection. ECMO treatment times of more than 4.5 days were associated with an increased risk of nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The nosocomial infection rate after ECMO was relatively high, and the main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. The selection of antibiotics should be based on the results of pathogen drug sensitivity.","Li, Zhan-Jie; Zhang, Dong-Fang; Zhang, Wei-Hong",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s306209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211285/,129

But it remains unclear how individual behaviors could exacerbate or protect against adverse changes in mental health. This study aimed to examine the associations between specific activities (or time use) and mental health and wellbeing amongst people during the COVID 19 pandemic. Data were from the UCL COVID 19 Social Study; a panel study collecting data weekly during the COVID 19 pandemic. The analytical sample consisted of 55,204 adults living in the UK who were followed up for the strict 11 week lockdown period from 21st March to 31st May 2020. Data were analyzed using fixed effects and Arellano Bond models. We found that changes in time spent on a range of activities were associated with changes in mental health and wellbeing. After controlling for bidirectionality, behaviors involving outdoor activities including gardening and exercising predicted subsequent improvements in mental health and wellbeing, while increased time spent on following news about COVID 19 predicted declines in mental health and wellbeing. These results are relevant to the formulation of guidance for people obliged to spend extended periods in isolation during health emergencies, and may help the public to maintain wellbeing during future pandemics.","Bu, F.; Steptoe, A.; Mak, H.

Thirty COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate symptoms and 27 patients with severe/critically severe symptoms were recruited from the Clinical Center of Kragujevac during April 2020. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to reveal phenotypic and functional alterations of peripheral blood cells and to correlate them with the severity of the disease. In severe cases, the number of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and HLA-DR-expressing cells was drastically decreased. In the monocyte population proportion between certain subsets was disturbed and cells coexpressing markers of M1 and M2 monocytes were found in intermediate and non-classical subsets. In mild cases decline in lymphocyte number was less pronounced and innate immunity was preserved as indicated by an increased number of myeloid and activated dendritic cells, NK cells that expressed activation marker at the same level as in control and by low expression of M2 marker in monocyte population. In patients with severe disease, both innate and adoptive immunity are devastated, while in patients with mild symptoms decline in lymphocyte number is lesser, and the innate immunity is preserved.","Matic, Sanja; Popovic, Suzana; Djurdjevic, Predrag; Todorovic, Danijela; Djordjevic, Natasa; Mijailovic, Zeljko; Sazdanovic, Predrag; Milovanovic, Dragan; Ruzic Zecevic, Dejana; Petrovic, Marina; Sazdanovic, Maja; Zornic, Nenad; Vukicevic, Vladimir; Petrovic, Ivana; Matic, Snezana; Karic Vukicevic, Marina; Baskic, Dejan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382687/,129

DESIGN: A prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ambulatory care settings at community general hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1972 consecutive ambulatory visits by 1952 patients were included from 2 February 2020 to 13 February 2020. Visits resulting in hospital admission and regularly scheduled visits were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of ambulatory visits resulting in antimicrobial drug prescriptions. The secondary outcomes were the reasons for antimicrobial drug prescription and the proportion of unnecessary antimicrobial prescriptions among all antimicrobial drugs used for treatment. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53.8 (SD 25.8) years old, and the proportion of women was 52.6%. A total of 162 antimicrobial drugs were prescribed in 153 (7.8%) visits. The most common antimicrobial drugs were penicillins (n=48, 29.6%), followed by third-generation cephalosporins (n=35, 21.6%) and quinolones (n=20, 12.4%).

Most data originate from temperate regions. We aim to study the health impact of air pollution, particularly among the elderly, in a tropical region. METHODS: A daily time-series analysis was performed to estimate excess risk (ER) of various air pollutants on daily death counts amongst the general population in Singapore from 2001 to 2013. Air pollutants included particulate matters smaller than 10 μm, and 2.5 μm (PM(10), PM(2.5)), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)) and sulphur dioxide (SO(2)). The studied outcomes were non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality. Single-day lag and distributed lag models were studied and adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: In single-day lag models, a 10 μg/m(3) increase in particulate matter was associated with significant increases in non-accidental (PM(10) ER: 0.627%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.260–0.995% and PM(2.5) ER: 0.660%; 95% CI: 0.204–1.118%) and cardiovascular mortality (PM(10) ER: 0.897; 95% CI: 0.283–1.516 and PM(2.5) ER: 0.883%; 95% CI: 0.121–1.621%). This was significant in the elderly ≥ 65 years but not in those < 65 years and were seen in the acute phase of lag 0-5 days. Effects by other pollutants were minimal. For cardiovascular mortality, the effects turned protective at a cumulative lag of 30 days in the elderly and could due to “harvesting”. CONCLUSIONS: These first contemporary population-based data from an equatorial country with tropical climate show that exposure to particulate air pollution was significantly associated with non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly.

This is not consistent with the current understanding of atmospheric chemistry or the microbiological characterization of aquatic and terrestrial environments. This knowledge gap is due to both difficulties in applying contemporary microbiological techniques to the low biomass concentrations present in aerosols, and the traditional reliance of aerosol researchers on culture-based techniques—the quantitative limitations and ecological biases of which have been well-documented and are now avoided in other environmental matrices. This article reviews the emergence of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a nonculture-based method to determine the identity, distribution, and abundance of airborne microorganisms. To encourage the use of PCR-based techniques by a broad spectrum of aerosol researchers, emphasis is given to the critical, aerosol specific method issues of sample processing, DNA extraction, and PCR inhibition removal. These methods are synthesized into a generalized procedure for the PCR-based study of microbial aerosols—equally applicable to both indoor and outdoor aerosol environments.","Peccia, Jordan; Hernandez, Mark",Atmos Environ (1994),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231006002408; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.02.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288550/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231006002408,129

RECENT FINDINGS: To date, there has been little evidence to suggest that children with PRD, including those on immunomodulatory therapies, are at increased risk for severe COVID-19. Clinical guidance statements have been created to support clinical providers in providing care to children with PRD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric rheumatologists have also been called upon to assist in the identification and management of post-COVID sequelae, including the rapidly emerging inflammatory illness, MIS-C. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 era has been defined by a rapid expansion in scientific knowledge and a time of extraordinary local and worldwide collaboration, both within the pediatric rheumatology community, as well as across multiple disciplines. Through collective efforts, we have learned that children with PRD, including those on immunomodulatory therapies, are not at increased risk for severe COVID-19.

Oltre il 95% di questi pazienti ha ricevuto un trattamento antivirale e oltre il 95% degli antibiotici, a fronte di un 20% soltanto di infezioni batteriche documentate, soprattutto da Streptococcus pneumoniae e Staphylococcus aureus. La mortalità globale a 28 giorni era del 17%. Il tempo mediano tra la comparsa della sindrome influenzale e il decesso era di 14 giorni. Fra questi decessi, la maggior parte dei pazienti aveva ricevuto un trattamento antivirale, ma non sempre nelle prime 48 ore, il che appare un fattore prognostico infausto. Così, il trattamento antivirale è consigliato nelle forme gravi; il virus pandemico A (H1N1) era sensibile ai due inibitori della neuraminidasi. Sono stati riscontrati dei casi sporadici di resistenza, il che spinge a sviluppare altre molecole attive sui virus influenzali.","Wiramus, S.; Martin, C.",EMC - Anestesia-Rianimazione,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1283077113645028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1283077113645028,129
663527,IgY - turning the page toward passive immunization in COVID-19 infection (Review),2020-04-30,"Many countries have been affected by the world‐wide outbreak of COVID‐19. Among Western countries, Italy has been particularly hit at the beginning of the pandemic, immediately after China. In Italy and elsewhere women seem to be less affected then men by severe/fatal COVID‐19 infection, regardless of their age. Despite the evidence that women and men are affected differently by this infection, very few studies consider different therapeutic approaches for the two sexes. Undoubtedly, understanding the mechanisms at the bases of these differences may help to find appropriate and sex specific therapies. Here, we consider that other mechanisms are involved to explain this difference, in addition to the protection attributable to oestrogens. Several X‐linked genes (such as ACE2) and Y‐linked genes (SRY, SOX9) may explain sex differences. Cardiovascular comorbidities are among the major enhancers of virus lethality. In addition, the number of sex‐independent non‐genetic factors that can change susceptibility and mortality is enormous, and many other factors are likely to be considered, including gender and cultural habits in different countries.","Penna, Claudia; Mercurio, Valentina; Tocchetti, Carlo G.; Pagliaro, Pasquale",Br J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698249/,129
664406,Medical Oncology Education in Egypt Over the Past 50 Years: the Experience of the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University,2021-06-10,"INTRODUCTION: As COVID-19 develops around the world, numerous publications have described the psychiatric consequences of this pandemic. Although clinicians and healthcare systems are mainly focused on managing critically ill patients in an attempt to limit the number of casualties, psychiatric disease burden is increasing significantly. In this scenario, increased domestic violence and substance abuse have been recently reported. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to perform a systematic review of the literature regarding the consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 infection in terms of domestic violence and substance abuse, and compare incidences found. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. The keywords included “domestic violence,” “substance abuse” AND “COVID-19,” including multiple variants from December 2019 through June 2020. An extensive bibliographic search was carried out in different medical databases: Pubmed, EMBASE, LILACS, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Titles and abstracts were reviewed according to the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in the retrieved articles was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical assessment instrument. RESULTS: A total of 1505 papers were initially retrieved after consulting the selected databases. After browsing through titles and abstracts, 94 articles were initially included considering the predefined eligibility criteria. After a more detailed analysis, only six scientific articles remained in our selection. Of these, three were evaluating domestic violence against children, while the other three were about substance abuse. CONCLUSION: There is not enough evidence to support the concept that COVID-19 has led to an increase in the rates of domestic violence and substance abuse. The initial decrease in violence reports might not translate into a real reduction in incidence but in accessibility. Apparently, there has been a slight increase in alcohol and tobacco abuse, especially by regular users, which also requires confirmatory studies. The inconsistency between expert opinon articles and the actual published data could be a result of the limited time since the beginnging of the crisis, the fact that psychitaric patients have been chronically exposed to stressful situatons, and a possible stimulated increase in demand for psychatric consultations.","Abdo, Carmita; Miranda, Eduardo P.; Santos, Caroline Silva; Júnior, José de Bessa; Bernardo, Wanderley Marques",Indian J Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33227046/; https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_1049_20,129

Addressing this is critical in reducing the burden of cancer in the African continent. Other challenges include socio-economic demographics and disparities in the overall cancer care. Lack of sufficient numbers of qualified staff has been one of the obstacles in developing adequate and modern cancer treatment centres in Africa. Training in clinical oncology in Zimbabwe was established in 1990 through the collaboration between the Government of Zimbabwe and the WHO as a regional project. The training is offered by the University of Zimbabwe through the established Master of Medicine in Radiotherapy and Oncology (MMed Rad & Onco) postgraduate programme. Regional and local fellows have been trained, yielding more than 20 clinical oncologists over the years, who have initiated cancer treatment facilities in Africa and beyond. They have continued to train others, fulfilling the original WHO programme target of transfer of skills in sub-Saharan Africa. Collaborations with external partners have complemented efforts by the local faculty in addressing deficiencies in training, in areas where experts in the subject are lacking and in supporting nationals working abroad to come and teach newer technologies and techniques. The curriculum continues to evolve from knowledge-based training to competency-based training. However, there is a need to expand the current infrastructure to keep up with changing technology. Clinical oncology training in Zimbabwe continues and remains a regional resource. Emphasis on subspecialising seems to be the next natural step in progression. Strengthening of other disciplines, including surgical oncology and medical physics, would be complementary to the training. The programme is an example of a sustainable initiative born out of collaborative partnership and is sustained by local resources. The greater majority of qualified oncologists have remained in Africa.","Ndlovu, Ntokozo; Ndarukwa, Sandra; Nyamhunga, Albert; Musiwa-Mba, Patience; Nyakabau, Anna Mary; Kadzatsa, Webster; Mushonga, Melinda",Ecancermedicalscience,https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912233/,129
665396,Knowledge and Attitudes of School Teachers on Vaccination in Greece,2021-04-29,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic still requires fast and effective efforts from all fronts, including epidemiology, clinical practice, molecular medicine, and pharmacology. A comprehensive molecular framework of the disease is needed to better understand its pathological mechanisms, and to design successful treatments able to slow down and stop the impressive pace of the outbreak and harsh clinical symptomatology, possibly via the use of readily available, off-the-shelf drugs. This work engages in providing a wider picture of the human molecular landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 infection via a network medicine approach as the ground for a drug repurposing strategy. Grounding on prior knowledge such as experimentally validated host proteins known to be viral interactors, tissue-specific gene expression data, and using network analysis techniques such as network propagation and connectivity significance, the host molecular reaction network to the viral invasion is explored and exploited to infer and prioritize candidate target genes, and finally to propose drugs to be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Ranks of potential target genes have been obtained for coherent groups of tissues/organs, potential and distinct sites of interaction between the virus and the organism. The normalization and the aggregation of the different scores allowed to define a preliminary, restricted list of genes candidates as pharmacological targets for drug repurposing, with the aim of contrasting different phases of the virus infection and viral replication cycle.","Stolfi, Paola; Manni, Luigi; Soligo, Marzia; Vergni, Davide; Tieri, Paolo",Front Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123533/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2020.545089,129

This paper examines the nexus between health status and health expenditure (both public and private), energy consumption and environmental pollution in the SAARC-BIMSTEC region. METHODS: We utilized the panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the heterogeneous panel causality test, the cross sectional dependence test, the cointegration test and the Pesaran cross sectional dependent (CADF) unit root test for obtaining estimated results from data over 16 years (2002–2017). RESULTS: Our results authorize the cointegration among the variables used, where the coefficients of energy consumption, public and private health expenditures, and economic growth are 0.027, 0.014, 0.030, and 0.029, respectively, and indicating positive and statistically significant effects. The coefficient of environmental pollution is − 0.085, implying significant negative effect on the health status of these regions in the long-run. However, no panel wise significant impact is found in the short-run. Bidirectional and unidirectional causal links between the studied variables and the health status are also identified..

In this study we aimed to assess the antibody and cellular responses of older people after a single dose of either the BNT162b2 vaccine (tozinameran; Pfizer–BioNTech) or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford University–AstraZeneca). METHODS: Participants aged 80 years or older, who did not live in a residential or care home or require assisted living, and had received a single dose of either the BNT162b2 vaccine or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were eligible to participate. Participants were recruited through local primary care networks in the West Midlands, UK. Blood samples and dried blood spots were taken 5–6 weeks after vaccination to assess adaptive immune responses using Elecsys electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and cellular responses by ELISpot. Primary endpoints were percentage response and quantification of adaptive immunity. FINDINGS: Between Dec 29, 2020, and Feb 28, 2021, 165 participants were recruited and included in the analysis. 76 participants had received BNT162b2 (median age 84 years, IQR 82–89; range 80–98) and 89 had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (median age 84 years, 81–87; 80–99). Antibody responses against the spike protein were detectable in 69 (93%) of 74 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 77 (87%) of 89 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients. Median antibody titres were of 19·3 U/mL (7·4–79·4) in the BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 19·6 U/mL (6·1–60·0) in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients (p=0·41). Spike protein-specific T-cell responses were observed in nine (12%) of 73 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 27 (31%) of 88 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients, and median responses were three-times higher in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine recipients (24 spots per 1 × 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells) than BNT162b2 vaccine recipients (eight spots per 1 × 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells; p<0·0001). Humoral and cellular immune responses against spike protein were correlated in both cohorts. Evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was seen in eight participants (n=5 BNT162b2 recipients and n=3 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 recipients), and was associated with 691-times and four-times increase in humoral and cellular immune responses across the whole cohort. INTERPRETATION: Single doses of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in older people induces humoral immunity in most participants, and is markedly enhanced by previous infection. Cellular responses were weaker, but showed enhancement after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at the 5–6 week timepoint.

This pandemic affects all people but it's serious in case of diabetes, elderly and in chronic and complicated diseases. The current work on the theme “ COVID-19 and Diabetes” attempts to bring together all the data available at MENA level through medical and scientific publications. It also includes all the efforts made by the governments and the responses of associations and their efforts in this field. Even if it is admitted that diabetes with its comorbidity represents a high risk factor for severe forms and mortality, the health consequences of the epidemic, does not seem as dramatic in terms of both morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 with diabetes in the majority of MENA countries. If the crises continues longer, the supply of insulin, oral drugs, self monitoring equipment of diabetes and other tools, will be affected. To this, we must expect great difficulties in supplying food for many countries. Certainely, it is important to remember that containment and hygiene measures, associated with other factors such as the young average age of the population, the higher temperature in these countries, the differences in the immune status of populations and the role of BCG vaccine have something to do with it.

666935,The Modern Autopsy: What to Do if Infection Is Suspected,2005-10-08,"Given the speed of viral infection spread, repurposing of existing drugs has been given the highest priority in combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Only drugs that are already registered or close to registration, and therefore have passed lengthy safety assessments, have a chance to be tested in clinical trials and reach patients quickly enough to help in the current disease outbreak. Here, we have reviewed available evidence and possible ways forward to identify already existing pharmaceuticals displaying modest broad-spectrum antiviral activity which is likely linked to their high accumulation in cells. Several well studied examples indicate that these drugs accumulate in lysosomes, endosomes and biological membranes in general, and thereby interfere with endosomal pathway and intracellular membrane trafficking crucial for viral infection. With the aim to identify other lysosomotropic drugs with possible inherent antiviral activity, we have applied a set of clear physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and molecular criteria on 530 existing drugs. In addition to publicly available data, we have also used our in silico model for the prediction of accumulation in lysosomes and endosomes. By this approach we have identified 36 compounds with possible antiviral effects, also against coronaviruses. For 14 of them evidence of broad-spectrum antiviral activity has already been reported, adding support to the value of this approach. Presented pros and cons, knowledge gaps and methods to identify lysosomotropic antivirals, can help in the evaluation of many drugs currently in clinical trials considered for repurposing to target COVID-19, as well as open doors to finding more potent and safer alternatives.","Norinder, Ulf; Tuck, Astrud; Norgren, Kalle; Kos, Vesna Munic",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220307757?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220307757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763818/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110582,129

Compounding this problem is the post-viral lung sequela that may be expected after COVID-19 pneumonia, similar to both SARS and MERS. Although chest imaging may play a role in the diagnosis of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, reinfection or relapse of COVID-19 will have similar imaging findings. A “new-baseline” imaging can be obtained from COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital discharge or clinical recovery. This new reference can not only determine if readmissions are from relapse or reinfection of COVID-19, resolving COVID-19 or potentially a different viral infection (influenza), but also for long term sequela of COVID-19 lung infection. Strategic use of imaging before discharge may be helpful in the subset of the population at the highest risk of a secondary viral infection such as influenza. Determining the residual abnormalities in post-discharge imaging can guide us in the long-term management of patients for many years to come.","Katal, Sanaz; Myers, Lee; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali",Clin Imaging,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0899707121001315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813316/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899707121001315?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2021.03.021,129

COVID-19 infected case records and meteorological data in four cities (Wuhan, Beijing, Urumqi and Dalian) in China were collected. Then, the best-fitting model of COVID-19 infected cases was selected from four statistic models (Gaussian, logistic, lognormal distribution and allometric models), and the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 infected cases was analyzed using multiple stepwise regression and Pearson correlation. The results showed that the lognormal distribution model was well adapted to describing the change of COVID-19 infected cases compared with other models (R(2) > 0.78; p-values < 0.001). Under the condition of implementing community-based pandemic prevention and control, relationship between COVID-19 infected cases and meteorological factors differed among the four cities. Temperature and relative humidity were mainly the driving factors on COVID-19 transmission, but their relations obviously varied with season and geographical location. In summer, the increase in relative humidity and the decrease in maximum temperature facilitate COVID-19 transmission in arid inland cities, while at this point the decrease in relative humidity is good for the spread of COVID-19 in coastal cities. For the humid cities, the reduction of relative humidity and the lowest temperature in the winter promote COVID-19 transmission.","Yang, Xiao-Dong; Li, Hong-Li; Cao, Yue-E",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435301/,129

Overall, the Covid-19 outbreak reduced Chinese listed firms’ financial performance proxied by the revenue growth rate, ROA, ROE, and asset turnover. This outbreak’s negative effects on Chinese firms’ profitability were much smaller than that on their revenue growth rates. While this outbreak’s negative effects on financial performance of Chinese listed firms were bigger for those that were seriously affected by this pandemic like airlines, travel, and entertainment (ATE), this pandemic’s effects were positive for the medicine industry. In the meanwhile, Chinese listed firms that located in high-risk regions suffered a bigger financial loss during the outbreak, and especially there was a strong Hubei effect. The corporate culture and CSR moderated the inverse relationship between this outbreak and Chinese firms’ financial performance. Findings of this study contribute to enrich the existing literature on impacts of the Covid-19 outbreak on firms’ financial performance worldwide and suggest helpful practical and theoretical implications.","Zheng, Fengjiao; Zhao, Zhiying; Sun, Yunpeng; Khan, Yousaf Ali",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02200-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400856/,129

There are currently some data on disparities between African American and Caucasian populations for COVID-19 infection and mortality.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made government and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using non-pharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number was computed with and without interventions and was used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population, while the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to the virus to the barest minimum.","Madubueze, C. E.; Sambo, D.; Onwubuya, I.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Complete responses of 178 OMF surgeons were included in the study. Descriptive and analytic statistics were computed. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Binary logistic regression models were created to assess the predictors of the impact of the COVID-19. RESULTS: Out of the 178 respondents of the study, most (37.1%) were following their hospital's guidelines. Most had access to adequate PPE (89.9%), whereas 93.8% had COVID-19 testing available. One hundred and thirty-three (74.7%) surgeons were involved in teleconsultation. Ninety-two (51.7%) and 166 (93.3%) were involved in elective surgery and emergency surgeries, respectively. Median outpatient department cases and number of surgeries done per week reduced by 73.9% and 66.7% (P < 0.001), respectively. Most surgeons (86%) experienced that cost of treatment had increased during the COVID. Over 75% were afraid to get infected with COVID, whereas 44.9% were anxious to lose the income. More than 56% of the OMF surgeons reported a fall in income and 94% reported decreased productivity in academic research. Most surgeons (93.8%) believed that COVID had a positive impact on human behavior in terms of hand hygiene. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 among OMF surgeons has adversely affected clinical practice, personal lives, and academic productivity and has catalyzed an exponential increase of telemedicine. Future surveys should capture the long-term impact of COVID-19.","Vishwakarma, Kuldeep; Khakhla, Deepakkumar Hamirbhai; Ambereen, Aafiya; Rawat, Saurabh Kumar; Mishra, Prabhaker; Shukla, Bharat",Natl J Maxillofac Surg,https://doi.org/10.4103/njms.njms_263_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483580/,129
673438,Why G3139 works poorly in cancer trials but might work well against HIV,2007-03-23,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental effect on residents’ operative training. Our aim was to identify the proportion of procedures performed by residents across two neurosurgical centres – one in the United Kingdom (UK) and one in Germany – during the pandemic-affected months of March 2020-May 2020, inclusive, in comparison to March 2019-May 2019, inclusive. Methods All neurosurgical procedures performed at the UK and German institutions, between 01/03/2019-31/05/2019 (pre-COVID months) and 01/03/2020-31/05/2020 (COVID-months), were extracted and operative notes evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS v22 (IBM). Results There was a statistically significant reduction in operative volume in the UK centre from the pre-COVID months to the COVID-months (χ2(5)=84.917; p<0.001) but no significant difference in the operative volume in the German centre (p=0.61). Mann-Whitney U test demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the volume of resident operating in the COVID-months compared to pre-COVID months in both UK and German centres (p<0.001). Average number of procedures performed by residents in the UK centre as the primary surgeon fell from 82 to 72 per month (pre-COVID vs COVID-months) whereas German residents’ operating volume increased from 68 to 89 per month (pre-COVID vs COVID-months). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the volume of operating by neurosurgical residents in the UK centre whereas residents in the German centre performed more procedures compared to 2019. This may reflect variations in national practice on maintaining surgical activities and provision of critical care beds during the first wave of the pandemic.","Jayakumar, Nithish; Hellwig, Sönke; Allison, Callum; Stummer, Walter; Holling, Markus; Surash, Surash",World Neurosurg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878875021010603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34280539/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.07.053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878875021010603?v=s5,129

Indeed, molecular imprinting represents a very promising and attractive technology for the synthesis of MIPs characterized by specific recognition abilities for a target molecule. Given these characteristics, MIPs can be considered tailor-made synthetic antibodies obtained by a templating process. After in silico analysis, imprinted nanoparticles were synthesized by inverse microemulsion polymerization and their ability to prevent the interaction between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was investigated. Of relevance, the developed synthetic antibodies are capable of significantly inhibiting virus replication in Vero cell culture, suggesting their potential application in the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Parisi, Ortensia Ilaria; Dattilo, Marco; Patitucci, Francesco; Malivindi, Rocco; Delbue, Serena; Ferrante, Pasquale; Parapini, Silvia; Galeazzi, Roberta; Cavarelli, Mariangela; Cilurzo, Francesco; Franzè, Silvia; Perrotta, Ida; Pezzi, Vincenzo; Selmin, Francesca; Ruffo, Mariarosa; Puoci, Francesco",Nanoscale (Online),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34528987/; https://doi.org/10.1039/d1nr03727g,129
674183,Recovering cancer screening in the pandemic: strategies and their impacts,2021-03-15,"A new coronavirus known as SARS‐CoV‐2 emerged in Wuhan in 2019 and spread rapidly to the rest of the world causing the pandemic disease named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19). Little information is known about the impact this virus can cause upon domestic and stray animals. The potential impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 has become of great interest in cats due to transmission among domestic cats and the severe phenotypes described recently in a domestic cat. In this context, there is a public health warning that needs to be investigated in relation with the epidemiological role of this virus in stray cats. Consequently, in order to know the impact of the possible transmission chain, blood samples were obtained from 114 stray cats in the city of Zaragoza (Spain) and tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 and other selected pathogens susceptible to immunosuppression including Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania infantum, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) from January to October 2020. Four cats (3.51%), based on enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike antigen, were seroreactive to SARS‐CoV‐2. T. gondii, L. infantum, FeLV and FIV seroprevalence was 12.28%, 16.67%, 4.39% and 19.30%, respectively. Among seropositive cats to SARS‐CoV‐2, three cats were also seropositive to other pathogens including antibodies detected against T. gondii and FIV (n = 1); T. gondii (n = 1); and FIV and L. infantum (n = 1). The subjects giving positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 were captured in urban areas of the city in different months: January 2020 (2/4), February 2020 (1/4) and July 2020 (1/4). This study revealed, for the first time, the exposure of stray cats to SARS‐CoV‐2 in Spain and the existence of concomitant infections with other pathogens including T. gondii, L. infantum and FIV, suggesting that immunosuppressed animals might be especially susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Villanueva‐Saz, Sergio; Giner, Jacobo; Tobajas, Ana Pilar; Pérez, María Dolores; González‐Ramírez, Andrés Manuel; Macías‐León, Javier; González, Ana; Verde, Maite; Yzuel, Andrés; Hurtado‐Guerrero, Ramón; Pardo, Julián; Santiago, Llipsy; Paño‐Pardo, José Ramón; Ruíz, Héctor; Lacasta, Delia María; Sánchez, Lourdes; Marteles, Diana; Gracia, Ana Pilar; Fernández, Antonio",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33686768/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14062,129
674252,AKT1 polymorphisms are associated with tuberculosis in the Chinese population,2010-02-05,"The recent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 pose a global health emergency. The SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein interacts with the human ACE2 receptor to mediate viral entry into host cells. We report the cryo-EM structures of a tightly closed SARS-CoV-2 S trimer with packed fusion peptide and an ACE2-bound S trimer at 2.7- and 3.8-Å resolution, respectively. Accompanying ACE2 binding to the up receptor-binding domain (RBD), the associated ACE2-RBD exhibits continuous swing motions. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer appears much more sensitive to the ACE2 receptor than the SARS-CoV S trimer regarding receptor-triggered transformation from the closed prefusion state to the fusion-prone open state, potentially contributing to the superior infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We defined the RBD T470-T478 loop and Y505 as viral determinants for specific recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD by ACE2. Our findings depict the mechanism of ACE2-induced S trimer conformational transitions from the ground prefusion state toward the postfusion state, facilitating development of anti–SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics.","Xu, Cong; Wang, Yanxing; Liu, Caixuan; Zhang, Chao; Han, Wenyu; Hong, Xiaoyu; Wang, Yifan; Hong, Qin; Wang, Shutian; Zhao, Qiaoyu; Wang, Yalei; Yang, Yong; Chen, Kaijian; Zheng, Wei; Kong, Liangliang; Wang, Fangfang; Zuo, Qinyu; Huang, Zhong; Cong, Yao",Sci Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277323/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abe5575,129

Cardiovascular dysfunction may also represent a primary phenomenon, with increasing data suggesting that severe COVID-19 reflects a confluence of vascular dysfunction, thrombosis and dysregulated inflammation. Here, we first consolidate the information on localized microvascular inflammation and disordered cytokine release, triggering vessel permeability and prothrombotic conditions that play a central role in perpetuating the pathogenic COVID-19 cascade. Secondly, we seek to clarify the gateways which SARS-CoV-2, the causative COVID-19 virus, uses to enter host vascular cells. Post-mortem examinations of patients' tissues have confirmed direct viral endothelial infection within several organs. While there have been advances in single-cell RNA sequencing, endothelial cells across various vascular beds express low or undetectable levels of those touted SARS-CoV-2 entry factors. Emerging studies postulate alternative pathways and the apicobasal distribution of host cell surface factors could influence endothelial SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. Finally, we provide experimental considerations such as endothelial polarity, cellular heterogeneity in organoids and shear stress dynamics in designing cellular models to facilitate research on viral-induced endothelial dysfunctions. Understanding the vascular underpinning of COVID-19 pathogenesis is crucial to managing outcomes and mortality.","Wazny, Vanessa; Siau, Anthony; Wu, Kan Xing; Cheung, Christine",Open Biol,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsob.200208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847471/,129
674495,Current State and Strategy for Establishing a Digitally Innovative Hospital: Memorial Review Article for Opening of Yongin Severance Hospital,2020-08-01,"AIMS: The COVID-19 pandemic forced closure of most U.S. university campuses in March 2020, obliging millions of students to finish their semesters via remote learning. This study examines whether and how students’ prior and current experiences of digital inequality—defined as constrained access to the internet and internet-connecting devices—were associated with their remote learning experiences. METHOD: An anonymous, online survey of 2,913 undergraduate college students from 30 U.S. universities completing their spring term remotely was conducted between April and May 2020. Hypothesis testing utilized a structural equation model with cluster-bootstrapped standard errors and p-values, to account for students being clustered by university. RESULTS: Findings revealed that students’ challenges with internet connectivity and digital devices during remote learning were associated with lower remote learning proficiency (RLP). Difficulty communicating with professors and teaching assistants was also associated with lower RLP. Prior experience with online coursework was associated with higher RLP, and digital inequality challenges during the year prior to the pandemic with lower RLP. Moreover, students who reported greater financial hardship since the start of the pandemic experienced significantly more connectivity, device, and faculty communication challenges during remote learning, and had significantly lower RLP. CONCLUSIONS: Many students will continue to learn remotely in some form until the pandemic recedes. We identify key factors associated with students’ remote learning proficiency: (1) consistent, high-speed internet connectivity and functioning devices to connect to it, and (2) the ability to relate to and communicate easily with professors and teaching assistants. This study identifies potential barriers to effective remote learning, as well as possible opportunities to improve students’ experiences.","Katz, Vikki S.; Jordan, Amy B.; Ognyanova, Katherine",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566832/,129

Herein, we evaluated the lead compound Auranofin and five selected gold organometallics as inhibitors of two relevant drug targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS‐CoV). The gold metallodrugs were effective inhibitors of the interaction of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor and might thus interfere with the viral entry process. The gold metallodrugs were also efficient inhibitors of the papain‐like protease (PLpro) of SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2, which is a key enzyme in the viral replication. Regarding PLpro from SARS‐CoV‐2, the here reported inhibitors are among the very first experimentally confirmed examples with activity against this target enzyme. Importantly, the activity of the complexes against both PLpro enzymes correlated with the ability of the inhibitors to remove zinc ions from the labile zinc center of the enzyme. Taken together, the results of this pilot study suggest further evaluation of gold complexes as SARS‐CoV antiviral drugs.","Gil‐Moles, Maria; Basu, Uttara; Büssing, Rolf; Hoffmeister, Henrik; Türck, Sebastian; Varchmin, Agnieszka; Ott, Ingo",Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915473/; https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202004112,129

Many of the pre-existing conditions that increase the risk of death in those with COVID-19 are the same diseases that are affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. We investigated whether long-term average exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death in the United States. Design: A nationwide, cross-sectional study using county-level data. Data sources: COVID-19 death counts were collected for more than 3,000 counties in the United States (representing 98% of the population) up to April 22, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. Main outcome measures: We fit negative binomial mixed models using county-level COVID-19 deaths as the outcome and county-level long-term average of PM2.5 as the exposure. In the main analysis, we adjusted by 20 potential confounding factors including population size, age distribution, population density, time since the beginning of the outbreak, time since state issuance of the stay-at-home order, hospital beds, number of individuals tested, weather, and socioeconomic and behavioral variables such as obesity and smoking. We included a random intercept by state to account for potential correlation in counties within the same state. We conducted more than 68 additional sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that an increase of only 1 μg/m3 in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2%, 15%). The results were statistically significant and robust to secondary and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: A small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate. Despite the inherent limitations of the ecological study design, our results underscore the importance of continuing to enforce existing air pollution regulations to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The data and code are publicly available so our analyses can be updated routinely.","Wu, Xiao; Nethery, Rachel C.; Sabath, Benjamin M.; Braun, Danielle; Dominici, Francesca",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511651/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502,129

However, the impact of the postoperative chemotherapy (postCTX) component on overall survival (OS) is not well defined. METHODS: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) 2006–2014 was queried for patients who received preoperative chemotherapy (preCTX) and resection for gastric cancer. Analysis was performed to identify factors influencing receipt of postCTX. The impact of postCTX on OS was evaluated in propensity-matched groups. RESULTS: Among 3449 patients who received preCTX and resection for gastric cancer, 1091 (31.6%) received postCTX. Independent predictors of receiving postCTX were diagnosis after 2010 (odds ratio [OR] 1.985), distal tumor location (OR 1.348), and 15 or more lymph nodes examined (OR 1.214). Predictors of not receiving postCTX were older age (OR 0.985), comorbidity score higher than 1 (OR 0.592), and black race (OR 0.791). After propensity-matching (1091 per group), the median OS was 56.8 months for those who did receive postCTX versus 52.5 months for those who did not (p = 0.131). Subset analysis according to tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, number of lymph nodes evaluated, T and N class, and AJCC stage identified an improvement in OS for the patients with N1 disease who received postCTX compared with those who did not (79.6 vs 41.3 months; p = 0.025). However, no other subgroup had a significant survival benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Additional postCTX was administered to a minority of patients who received preCTX and gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and its influence on OS appeared to be limited. Future trials should aim to define patients who will benefit from postCTX.

However, data on clinical characteristics and prognostic factors in such settings are scarce. We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study to assess clinical characteristics and baseline predictors of mortality of COVID-19 patients hospitalized after an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a LTCF. A total of 50 patients were included. Mean age was 80 years (SD, 12 years), and 24/50 (57.1%) patients were males. A total of 42/50 (84%) patients experienced symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 32%. In Cox regression, significant predictors of in-hospital mortality were: hypernatremia (HR 9.12), lymphocyte count <1000 cells/L (HR 7.45), cardiovascular diseases other than hypertension (HR 6.41), and higher levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6, pg/mL) (HR 1.005). Our study shows a high in-hospital mortality rate in a cohort of elderly patients with COVID-19 and hypernatremia, lymphopenia, CVD other than hypertension, and higher IL-6 serum levels were identified as independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.

675947,The PATHFINDER Study: Assessment of the Implementation of an Investigational Multi-Cancer Early Detection Test into Clinical Practice,2021-07-13,"Abstract Objectives The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan rapidly spread throughout China. While its origin remains uncertain, accumulating evidence links a wet market for the early SARS-CoV-2 spread in Wuhan. Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. Methods Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidence stratified according to contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for the market-to-human and human-to-human transmission, the reporting probability and the early effects of public health interventions. Results We estimated R at 0.24 (95%CrI: 0.01-1.38) for market-to-human transmission, and 2.37 (95%CrI: 2.08-2.71) for human-to-human transmission during the early spread in China (2019-2020). Moreover, we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2-34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. Conclusions Our R estimate tied to market-to-human transmission has substantial uncertainty, but it was significantly lower compared to the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission. Our results also suggest that asymptomatic and subclinical infections constitute a substantial component of the COVID-19 morbidity burden.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Kagaya, Katsushi; Chowell, Gerardo",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497812/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303982?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.091; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303982,129

In this study, we targeted viral pathogens, included carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), coronavirus (CoV), and canine morbillivirus (CMV), using molecular screening. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the target pathogens were evaluated. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we aimed to clarify the phylogenetic relationship of isolated viral pathogens between leopard cats and domestic carnivores. Samples from 23 and 29 leopard cats that were live-trapped and found dead, respectively, were collected from Miaoli County from 2015 to 2019 in northwestern Taiwan. CPPV-1 and coronavirus were detected in leopard cats. The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of CPPV-1, and CoV was 63.5% (50.4%–76.6%) and 8.8% (0%–18.4%), respectively. The majority of sequences of each CPPV-1 strain amplified from Taiwanese leopard cats and domestic carnivores were identical. All the amplified CoV sequences from leopard cats were identified as feline coronavirus. The spatial and temporal aggregation of CPPV-1 infection in leopard cats was not determined in the sampling area, which indicated a wide distribution of CPPV-1 in the leopard cat habitat. We consider sympatric domestic carnivores to be the probable primary reservoir for the pathogens identified. We strongly recommend establishing efforts to manage CPPV-1 and FCoV in the leopard cat habitat, with an emphasis on vaccination programs and population control measures for free-roaming dogs and cats. IMPORTANCE The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is an endangered species in Taiwan. The effects of infectious diseases on the wildlife population have increasingly been recognized.

Little is known on the impact of COVID-19 among nurses in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out between August and November 2020 among nurses recruited from the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi. The survey questionnaire consisted of six components- demographic and work title characteristics, information regarding care of COVID-19 patients, symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress and burnout, measured using standardized questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health disorders. RESULTS: Of 255 nurses, 171 (67.1%) consented to complete the survey. The median age of the participants was 33.47 years, 70.2% were females and 60.8% were married. More than half, 64.9% were frontline workers directly engaged in COVID-19 care. Only 1.8% reported a prior history or diagnosis of any mental health disorder. Depression, anxiety, insomnia, distress, and burnout were reported in 45.9%, 48.2%, 37.0%, 28.8% and 47.9% of all nurses. Frontline nurses reported experiencing more moderate to severe symptoms of depression, distress and burnout. Furthermore, females reported more burnout as compared to males. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment, working in the frontlines was an independent risk variable for depression and burnout. CONCLUSION: This is one of the few studies looking at mental health outcomes among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Similar to other studies from around the world, nurses directly involved with COVID-19 patients reported higher rates of mental health symptoms. Burnout threatens to exacerbate the pre-existing severe nursing workforce shortage in low-resource settings. Cost-effective and feasible mitigating strategies, geared to low-middle income countries, are urgently needed to help cope with mental health symptoms during such a pandemic.","Ali, Sayed K.; Shah, Jasmit; Talib, Zohray",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197540/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254074,129

A sectoral, whole-economy macroeconomic model was linked to a population-wide epidemiological demographic model to assess the potential macroeconomic impact of COVID-19, together with policies to mitigate or suppress the pandemic by means of home quarantine, school closures, social distancing and accompanying business closures. Our simulations indicate that, assuming a clinical attack rate of 48% and a case fatality ratio of 1.5%, COVID-19 alone would impose a direct health-related economic burden of £39.6bn (1.73% of GDP) on the UK economy. Mitigation strategies imposed for 12 weeks reduce case fatalities by 29%, but the total cost to the economy is £308bn (13.5% of GDP); £66bn (2.9% of GDP) of which is attributable to labour lost from working parents during school closures, and £201bn (8.8% of GDP) of which is attributable to business closures. Suppressing the pandemic over a longer period of time may reduce deaths by 95%, but the total cost to the UK economy also increases to £668bn (29.2% of GDP), where £166bn (7.3% of GDP) is attributable to school closures and 502bn (21.9% of GDP) to business closures. Our analyses suggest Covid-19 has the potential to impose unprecedented economic costs on the UK economy, and whilst public actions are necessary to minimise mortality, the duration of school and business closures are key to determining the economic cost. The initial economic support package promised by the UK government may be proportionate to the costs of mitigating Covid-19, but without alternative measures to reduce the scale and duration of school and business closures, the economic support may be insufficient to compensate for longer term suppression of the pandemic which could generate an even greater health impact through major recession.","Keogh-Brown, Marcus R.; Jensen, Henning Tarp; Edmunds, W.

Once lung tissues are colonized, cells that survive persistent bacterial infection can undergo permanent damage and accelerated cellular senescence. Consequently, several morphological and functional features of senescent lung cells facilitate SARS-CoV-2 replication. The higher risk for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, and death in older patients has generated the question whether basic aging mechanisms could be implicated in such susceptibility. Mounting evidence indicates that cellular senescence, a manifestation of aging at the cellular level, contributes to the development of age-related lung pathologies and facilitates respiratory infections. Apparently, a relationship between life-threatening COVID-19 lung infection and pre-existing periodontal disease seems improbable. However, periodontal pathogens can be inoculated during endotracheal intubation and/or aspirated into the lower respiratory tract. This review focuses on how the dissemination of periodontal bacteria into the lungs could aggravate age-related senescent cell accumulation and facilitate more efficient SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment and replication. We also consider how periodontal bacteria-induced premature senescence could influence the course of COVID-19 lung infection. Finally, we highlight the role of saliva as a reservoir for both pathogenic bacteria and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the identification of active severe periodontitis can be an opportune and valid clinical parameter for risk stratification of old patients with COVID-19.","Aquino-Martinez, Ruben; Hernández-Vigueras, Scarlette",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33466585/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10020279,129

The literature is classified based on (i) type of population modelling (classical or network-based), (ii) frequency of the game (non-repeated or repeated), and (iii) type of strategy adoption (self-learning or imitation). The choice of model is shown to depend on many factors such as the immunity to the disease, the strength of immunity conferred by the vaccine, the size of population and the level of mixing therein. We highlight that while early studies used classical compartmental modelling with self-learning games, in recent years, there is a substantial growth of network-based modelling with imitation games.

678539,COVID-19 associated mortality and cardiovascular disease outcomes among US women veterans,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND: In 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 300,000 deaths in the United States alone. Although nonpharmaceutical interventions were implemented by federal and state governments in the United States, these efforts have failed to contain the virus. Following the Food and Drug Administration's approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, however, the hope for the return to normalcy has been renewed. This hope rests on an unprecedented nationwide vaccine campaign, which faces many logistical challenges and is also contingent on several factors whose values are currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: We study the effectiveness of a nationwide vaccine campaign in response to different vaccine efficacies, the willingness of the population to be vaccinated, and the daily vaccine capacity under two different federal plans. To characterize the possible outcomes most accurately, we also account for the interactions between nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccines through 6 scenarios that capture a range of possible impacts from nonpharmaceutical interventions. METHODS: We used large-scale, cloud-based, agent-based simulations by implementing the vaccination campaign using COVASIM, an open-source agent-based model for COVID-19 that has been used in several peer-reviewed studies and accounts for individual heterogeneity and a multiplicity of contact networks. Several modifications to the parameters and simulation logic were made to better align the model with current evidence. We chose 6 nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios and applied the vaccination intervention following both the plan proposed by Operation Warp Speed (former Trump administration) and the plan of one million vaccines per day, proposed by the Biden administration. We accounted for unknowns in vaccine efficacies and levels of population compliance by varying both parameters. For each experiment, the cumulative infection growth was fitted to a logistic growth model, and the carrying capacities and the growth rates were recorded. RESULTS: For both vaccination plans and all nonpharmaceutical intervention scenarios, the presence of the vaccine intervention considerably lowers the total number of infections when life returns to normal, even when the population compliance to vaccines is as low as 20%. We noted an unintended consequence; given the vaccine availability estimates under both federal plans and the focus on vaccinating individuals by age categories, a significant reduction in nonpharmaceutical interventions results in a counterintuitive situation in which higher vaccine compliance then leads to more total infections. CONCLUSIONS: Although potent, vaccines alone cannot effectively end the pandemic given the current availability estimates and the adopted vaccination strategy. Nonpharmaceutical interventions need to continue and be enforced to ensure high compliance so that the rate of immunity established by vaccination outpaces that induced by infections.","Li, Junjiang; Giabbanelli, Philippe",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872188/; https://doi.org/10.2196/27419,129

METHODS: Mothers aged ≥ 18 years with a breast-fed infant ≤ 18 months of age during the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing, China, completed a questionnaire. Descriptive analysis of lockdown consequences was performed and predictors of these outcomes were examined using stepwise linear regression. RESULTS: Of 2233 participants, 29.9%, 20.0% and 34.7% felt down, lonely, and worried, respectively, during the lockdown; however, 85.3% felt able to cope. Poorer maternal mental health was predicted by maternal (younger age, higher education) and infant (older age, lower gestation) characteristics, and social circumstances (husband unemployed or working from home, receiving advice from family, having enough space for the baby, living close to a park or green space). Conversely, better maternal mental health was predicted by higher income, employment requiring higher qualifications, more personal space at home, shopping or walking > once/week and lack of impact of COVID-19 on job or income. Mothers with higher education, more bedrooms, fair division of household chores and attending an online mother and baby group > once/week reported better coping. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight maternal characteristics and circumstances that predict poorer mental health and reduced coping which could be used to target interventions in any future public health emergencies requiring social restrictions.

Public and private partnerships continue to form in order to tackle this unprecedented global challenge. This paper highlights the importance of open collaboration and cooperation between the disciplines of medicine, veterinary medicine, and animal health sciences in the fight against COVID-19. Since the pandemic took the whole world by surprise, many existing drugs were rapidly repurposed and tested in COVID-19 clinical trials and some of the trials are revealing promising results, it is clear that the long-term solution will come in the form of vaccines. While vaccines are being developed, the antiviral agent Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734) is being repurposed for use in human clinical trials but this is being done without acknowledging the significant efforts that went into development for treating cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal immune-mediated vasculitis in cats which is caused by a feline coronavirus. There are many other antiviral drugs and immune modulating treatments that are currently being trialed that have animal health origins in terms of discovery and clinical development. Closer collaboration between the animal health and human health sectors is likely to accelerate progress in the fight against COVID-19. There is much that we do not yet know about COVID-19 and its causative agent SARS-CoV-2 but we will learn and progress much faster if we increase interdisciplinary collaboration and communication between human and animal health researchers and taking a genuine “One Health” approach to this and other emerging viral pathogens. Enhanced knowledge of zoonotic coronaviruses can significantly enhance our ability to fight current and future emerging coronaviruses.

680572,Cytokine Storms in Cancer and COVID-19,2020-10-02,"Severe cardiovascular complications can occur in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in spontaneously beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor but not the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that mediates spike protein cleavage in the lungs. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs was prolific: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CMs, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with canonical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in hiPSC-CMs we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm cell-to-cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin and furin-like proteases abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that disrupts the multibasic furin cleavage motif was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in hiPSC-CMs and furin and/or furin-like-protease activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform enables target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19. Importance Cardiac complications frequently observed in COVID-19 patients are tentatively attributed to systemic inflammation and thrombosis, but viral replication has occasionally been confirmed in cardiac tissue autopsy materials. We developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 spread in myocardium using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In these highly differentiated cells, viral transcription levels exceeded those previously documented in permissive transformed cell lines. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we expressed a fluorescent version of its spike protein that allowed us to characterize a fusion-based cytopathic effect. A mutant of the spike protein with a single amino acid mutation in the furin/furin-like protease cleavage site lost cytopathic function. Of note, the fusion activities of the spike protein of other coronaviruses correlated with the level of cardiovascular complications observed in infections with the respective viruses. These data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may cause cardiac damage by fusing cardiomyocytes.","Navaratnarajah, Chanakha K; Pease, David R; Halfmann, Peter; Taye, Biruhalem; Barkhymer, Alison; Howell, Kyle G; Charlesworth, Jon E; Christensen, Trace A; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Cattaneo, Roberto; Schneider, Jay W",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01368-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613786/,129

Twenty registered nurses, who worked in six hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, participated in interviews. A narrative analysis was conducted with a focus on content and form of stories. RESULTS: We identified three themes about working in COVID-19 acute care hospital environments: the emotional experience, the agency of emotions, and how emotions shape nursing and practice. CONCLUSION: In moving forth with pandemic preparations, healthcare leaders and governments need to make sure that a nurse’s sacrifice is not all-encompassing.

The aim is to evaluate and compare tourism organization in their areas, taking into account selected aspects of management: the network of hiking trails with its related infrastructure, transport accessibility, a typology of tourist centers, as well as directions and destinations of tourist movements. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the availability of geographical space for tourists is much greater in the German than in the Czech national park, and the tourism infrastructure is clearly more extensive there, including the network of tourist trails. This is mainly due to the longer and fairly uninterrupted development of tourism in this area. Šumava National Park can be identified as a model in terms of how to adjust the directions of tourist movements and the layout of the tourist trail network to the needs of natural environment.

Methods We collected daily numbers of COVID-19 cases in 202 locations in 8 countries. We matched meteorological data from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We used a time-frequency approach to examine the possible association between meteorological conditions and basic reproductive number (R0) of COVID-19. We determined the correlations between meteorological factors and R0 of COVID-19 using multiple linear regression models and meta-analysis. We further validated our results using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) metapopulation model to simulate the changes of daily cases of COVID-19 in China under different temperatures and relative humidity conditions. Principal results Temperature did not exhibit significant association with R0 of COVID-19 (meta p = 0.446). Also, relative humidity (meta p = 0.215), wind speed (meta p = 0.986), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (meta p = 0.491) were not significantly associated with R0 either. The SEIR model in China showed that with a wide range of meteorological conditions, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases would not change substantially. Conclusions Meteorological conditions did not have statistically significant associations with the R0 of COVID-19.

684271,Seasonal trends of diagnosis of childhood malignant diseases and viral prevalence in South Korea,2017-11-08,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the novel SARS-CoV-2 evade the host innate immunity, and subsequently the adaptive immune response, employing one protease called Papain-like protease (PLpro). The PLpro and the 3CL main protease are responsible for the cleavage of the polyproteins encoded by the + sense RNA genome of the virus to produce several non-structured proteins (NSPs). However, the PLpro also performs deubiquitination and deISGylation of host proteins and signaling molecules, and thus antagonize the host innate immune response, since ubiquitination and ISGylation are critical processes which invoke host’s antiviral immune responses. Thus, to maintain host antiviral defense, inhibition of the PLpro is the primary therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, inhibition of the enzyme prevents replication of the virus. The present study employs molecular modeling approaches to determine potential of different approved and repurposed drugs and other compounds as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. The results of the study demonstrated that drugs like Stallimycin, and known protease inhibitors including Telaprevir, Grazoprevir and Boceprevir, were highly potent in inhibiting the enzyme. In addition, several plant-derived polyphenols, including Corylifol A and Kazinol J, were found to be potent inhibitors. Based on the findings, we suggest that clinical trials be initiated with these inhibitors. So far, PLpro inhibition has been given less attention as a strategy to contain COVID-19 pandemic, and thus the present study is of high significance and has therapeutic implications in containing the pandemic.

ACE2 is a receptor protein of SARS- CoV-2, and TMPRSS2 promotes virus proliferation and transmission. Some patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndromes other than lungs. Therefore, studying the viral susceptibility of other organs is important for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis. Methods The advantage of scRNA-seq data is the identification of cell types by clustering the gene expression of cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in AT2 of lungs, we compared the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of cell types from 31 organs, with AT2 of lungs to evaluate the risk of the viral infection using scRNA-seq data. Findings For the first time, we found the brain, gall bladder, and fallopian tube are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Besides, the nose, heart, small intestine, large intestine, esophagus, testis and kidney are also identified to be high-risk organs with high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, the susceptible organs are grouped into three risk levels based on the TMPRSS2 expression. As a result, the respiratory system, digestive system and reproductive system are at the top-risk level to COVID-19 infection.

Our objective was to evaluate the role of OAC in the early prevention of NEC and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants with gestational age (GA) ≤ 32 weeks. METHODS: A pilot, single-center, 1:1 parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 40-bed tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in China from 1 January 2019 to 30 September 2020. Preterm infants were randomly divided into two groups with GA ≤ 32 weeks. The OAC group included preterm infants who received 0.4 ml of maternal colostrum via the oropharyngeal route every 3 h for 10 days beginning within the first 48 h after birth, and the control group included preterm infants who received normal saline instead. Data from the two groups were collected and compared. RESULTS: A total of 127 infants in the OAC group and 125 infants in the control group were enrolled. The incidence of NEC (Bell stage 2 or 3) and late-onset sepsis were lower in the OAC group [2.36% vs. 10.40%, relative risk (RR) 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07, 0.78), adjusted RR 0.23 (95% CI 0.06, 0.84); 4.72% vs. 13.60%, RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.14, 0.85), adjusted RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.14, 0.95)]. In addition, the incidence of proven sepsis and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (stage 3 or 4) were lower in the OAC group [2.36% vs. 8.80%, RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.08, 0.94); 1.57% vs. 7.20%, RR 0.22 (95% CI 0.05, 0.99)], and the time to achieve full enteral feeding was shorter (23.13 ± 9.45 days vs. 28.50 ± 14.80 days).

CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal administration of colostrum is a safe and simple NICU procedure that may yield a potential effect in decreasing the incidences of NEC, late-onset sepsis, and severe IVH and shorten the time to achieve full enteral feeding in preterm infants with GA ≤ 32 weeks.

Myocardial infarction (MI) in such cases can be due to the coronary embolism from the prosthetic valves or due to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Intravascular imaging helps in delineating the cause. We present a case of a 34-year-old premenopausal woman with no conventional cardiovascular risk factors and had triple valve replacement 4 years ago and anterior wall MI with cardiogenic shock and left ventricular failure. She was managed with mechanical ventilation, thrombolysis, diuretics, double antiplatelets and anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Intravascular ultrasound showed a lipid-rich plaque with associated plaque rupture and thrombosis. Intravascular imaging helps in delineating the cause of MI and further management. Atherosclerotic MI in a patient with no conventional risk factors is rare and needs to be considered.","Sharma, Yash Paul; Prasad, Krishna; Patel, Nitin; Panda, Prashant Kumar",BMJ case reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285017/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-240732,129

A multicenter, retrospective, and observational study including 540 patients with confirmed COVID-19 was carried out at four designated hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data were collected and analyzed. The primary end point was in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19. The concentration of admission UA (adUA) and the lowest concentration of uric acid during hospitalization (lowUA) in the dead patients were significantly lower than those in the survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the concentration of lowUA (OR 0.986, 95% CI 0.980–0.992, p < 0.001) was able to independently predict the risk of in-hospital death. The mean survival time in the low-level group of lowUA was significantly lower than other groups. When lowUA was ≤ 166 µmol/L, the sensitivity and specificity in predicting hospital short-term mortality were 76.9%, (95% CI 68.5–85.1%) and 74.9% (95% CI 70.3–78.9%). This retrospective study determined that the lowest concentration of UA during hospitalization can be used as a prognostic indicator and a marker of disease severity in severe patients with COVID-19.","Li, Gang; Wu, Xia; Zhou, Chen-liang; Wang, Ye-ming; Song, Bin; Cheng, Xiao-bin; Dong, Qiu-fen; Wang, Liu-lin; You, Sha-sha; Ba, Yuan-ming",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96983-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493750/,129

Paradoxically, the contagion has resulted in increased use of technology and digital mediation, as well as enhanced hopes for vaccines and biomedical solutions. It has thereby intensified humans’ reliance on the very high-tech economy of cognitive capitalism that caused the problems in the first place.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease. METHOD: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to collect the literature concerning coronary heart disease and COVID-19. The retrieval time was from inception to Nov 20, 2020, using Stata version 14.0 for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 22,148 patients from 40 studies were included. The meta-analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 (OR=3.42, 95%CI [2.83, 4.13], P < 0.001). After subgroup analysis, coronary heart disease was found to be related to mortality (OR = 3.75, 95%CI [2.91, 4.82], P < 0.001), severe/critical COVID-19 (OR = 3.23, 95%CI [2.19, 4.77], P < 0.001), ICU admission (OR = 2.25, 95%CI [1.34, 3.79], P = 0.002), disease progression (OR = 3.01, 95%CI [1.46, 6.22], P = 0.003); Meta-regression showed that the association between coronary heart disease and poor prognosis of COVID-19 was affected by hypertension (P = 0.004), and subgroup analysis showed that compared with the proportion of hypertension >30% (OR = 2.85, 95%CI [2.33, 3.49]), the proportion of hypertension <30% (OR = 4.78, 95%CI [3.50, 6.51]) had a higher risk of poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Coronary heart disease is a risk factor for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.","Liang, Chendi; Zhang, Weijun; Li, Shuzhen; Qin, Gang",Med Clin (Engl Ed),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcle.2020.12.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S238702062100231X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S238702062100231X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109276/,129

Toxicities arising from therapy are autoimmune in nature and may affect essentially any organ system. The immunologic basis of such toxities is complex, with contributions from T cell activation and autoantibody generation. Though less recognized, hypersensitivity reactions are also possible. Although most toxicities resolve with systemic corticosteroids, some require second-line immunosuppression. Further, the safety of drug rechallenge is not well-characterized, with variable rates of toxicity flares arising with re-exposure. Herein, we review toxicities of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, particularly focusing on issues that allergists/immunologists may clinically encounter, including interstitial nephritis, skin toxicity, and risks associated with immunotherapy rechallenge.","Johnson, Douglas B.; Jakubovic, Baruch D.; Sibaud, Vincent; Sise, Meghan E.",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219820306279?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599218/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.06.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219820306279,129
689848,Overcoming gaps in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.,2020-10-01,"The efficacy of antimicrobials is an important aspect during their applications in food and therapeutics. In this study, combination of two bacteriocins, enterocin LD3 and plantaricin LD4, was studied against two pathogenic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus ATCC25923 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC13311 for increasing their potency and bactericidal activity. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of enterocin LD3 and plantaricin LD4 against Staph. aureus subsp. aureus ATCC25923 were 180 and 220 μg/mL, whereas in combination, reduced to 115 μg/mL, respectively. The MICs of enterocin LD3 and plantaricin LD4 against Salm. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC13311 were 240 and 320 μg/mL, respectively, whereas in combination, these were found to be 130 μg/mL, respectively. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices calculated as 0.50 against Staph. aureus subsp. aureus ATCC25923 and 0.43 against Salm. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC13311 were found to be ≤ 0.5 indicating the synergy. The isobologram showed MIC of combined bacteriocins falls below the plotted straight line further signifies synergy. The growth response of Staph. aureus subsp. aureus ATCC25923 and Salm. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC13311 was significantly reduced in the presence of combined bacteriocins in comparison with their individual effects. The number of dead cells was higher as a result of combined effect as compared with their independent effect evidenced by fluorescent microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the higher disruption of cell membrane in the combined bacteriocin-treated cells as compared with alone effects. The FTIR spectra of enterocin LD3-treated cells showed alteration at ~ 1,451.82 and ~ 1,094.30/cm corresponding to nucleic acids and phospholipids suggesting its interaction with cell membrane and nucleic acids. In contrast, plantaricin LD4-treated cells did not show such alterations suggesting plantaricin LD4 may kill target cells using other mechanism. Our data suggest that different mode of action of both bacteriocins results in division of labour and may be responsible for their synergistic activity against target cells. Similarly, the synergistic effect of bacteriocins was also observed against other pathogenic bacteria such as Proteus mirabilis ATCC43071, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 and Escherichia coli ATCC25922. These bacteriocins, therefore, act synergistically against target pathogens and may be applied in appropriate combinations for food safety and medical applications.","Sheoran, Poonam; Tiwari, Santosh Kumar",Probiotics Antimicrob Proteins,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12602-020-09708-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918678/,129
